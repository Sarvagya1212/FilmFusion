18966.0,Love at First Bite,"Dracula and Renefield relocate to '70s era New York in search of Cindy Sondheim, the reincarnation of Dracula's one true love, Mina Harker.

The Communist regime in Romania forces Dracula from his castle (George Hamilton), so he and Renfield (Arte Johnson) fly to New York City to meet a model who has caught the Count’s eye (Susan Saint James). Richard Benjamin plays her therapist and Dick Shawn an officer that tries to help solve the vampire happenings.

“Love at First Bite” (1979) spoofs Dracula flicks and was AIP’s most successful film up to that point (an honor that would only last three months, after which “The Amityville Horror” took the crown). It surged Hamilton’s career and remains his most profitable movie. 

If you like other classic monster satires, such as “The Vampire Happening” (1971) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), you should appreciate this one. It puts Dracula in the modern day Big City and milks it for fun. While it’s rarely laugh-out-loud funny, it’s consistently amusing (or eye-rolling) in a quiet smirks kind of way. There are several cameos of celebs that were popular at the time.

Although it has been accused of being “racist,” it pokes fun of people across the board, whatever their skin color or socioeconomic status. For instance, the beginning makes fun of Romanian Communists followed by superstitious rural villagers (all white people).

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan and The Langham Apartments, Los Angeles.

She and ""Berger are from different sides of the tracks, but despite her silver spoon she has quite a rebellious nature and very much embraces her hippie existence protesting the war whilst stoked up on weed, emotion and idealism. They only have a few days, but in those days their relationships develop, thrive, vacillate and ultimately Milos Forman presents us with a quite subtly scathing commentary on a mid-1960s USA. I still think this works better on the stage - the confined space there forces the characters and scenarios together better, but this is still a strong big-screen adaptation that allows the music and dance numbers to retain much of their punch. The characterisations run deep too with plenty of their gang having slightly more than bit parts to complement the thrust of the burgeoning romance. It's perhaps that that lets this down a little. The pair are rarely seen together and the portrayal of their ""love"" is a wee bit on the shallow side. Musically, there are more than a few familiar numbers to keep the pace rollicking along, and perhaps the fairly explicit nature of some of the lyrics explains why this did rather better on the European Awards circuit than it did in the USA (or the UK). ""Aquarius"", ""Good Morning Starshine"" and the title song are maybe the most memorable but there are plenty more to get our teeth into as the rawness of the original Gerome Ragni book is framed within a cityscape dealing with racism, homophobia and just about everything to preclude the concept of ""free love"" (or even creatively inexpensive love). It's holding it's relevance quite well and is well worth two hours."

I remember being a teen when this came up, and with U.S./Soviet relations at a nadir, nuclear war films were just starting to appear on the cinephile's radar once again, after taking a breather from their 60's heyday for the sake of the glut of natural disaster films that hit theatres in the interim.

This was one of the first and best, simply because director Nicholas Meyer was so good at sci-fi. I fervently wish he had made a lot more movies. || Well worth the view and it's surprisingly hard-hitting, for an American movie.

TDA depict the full nuclear exchange between NATO and the Warsaw-pact and how this affect the population in and around Kansas.

I think TDA really works better as a pure movie, because it is. Compared to the UK-made ""Threads"", which is more of a docudrama, TDA sets the scene and develop the characters.

Many of the characters also survive the initial attack and we follow them 2-4 weeks after the initial attack.

Even though TDA was both politically incorrect at the time and is also pretty bleak and scary, it does fall into the trap of being more of a movie than a film meant to shock and present facts.

Some of the cheesy dialogue and characters also feels a little 'meh' (love stories, family-drama etc). Threads also has some of that, but avoid the most cheesy moments, because it's more 'real' than 'played out by actors'.

Anyway, TDA works well, it will keep you seated and you will indeed feel moved by the buildup and attack-scene, as well as the aftermath.

Acting is for the most part very good and the film flows nicely trough the story.

The thing I don't like too much with TDA, is that it does pull it's punches concerning the consequences of such a nuclear exchange and it does leave the viewer with a slightly positive outlook, that things will improve in time and that mankind will prevail. 

Dr. Oakes, one of the main-characters in the film is probably the voice of the most realistic views on what is to come, but his views aren't lifted up as being the view of the movie itself.

Still a highly recommended film, it does cover a subject only covered properly by this and the UK made 'Threads'. || James Robards is exceptional in this sad nuclear holocaust fable, made for TV but a top notch production in most all respects."

A cult horror classic, Silent Night, Deadly Night is something of a treat for the old school horror faithful. Plot has a young boy witness the slaying of his parents by a man dressed as Santa Claus. He grows up in an orphanage run by an over zealous Mother Superior, moves out when manhood beckons and gets a job in a department store. Come Christmas time he is coerced into being the store Santa and promptly cracks up, grabbing an axe and wreaking slasher hell on everyone who gets in his way.

That's pretty much it, the stalk and slash formula in all its bloody glory. It's done very well here, with invention, genuine shocks and it's all boosted by having the mad Santa as an angelic faced beefcake (Robert Brian Wilson). Of course any new-age horror film fan coming to it for the first time now will struggle to see what the appeal is? So listen to the staccato music, feel the nastiness - the humbug of it all, observe that the film makers don't use filler or padding - they get in for some short sharp shock, and it's deliberately icky to garner a reaction.

Masterpiece of horror cinema? No of course not, the acting is sub-standard, the ending rushed, but in the same year as Wes Craven unleashed one of cinema's ultimate bogeymen upon us, Charles E. Sellier Jr. and his writers offered us a reason to actually hope Santa Claus doesn't exist. 6.5/10 || _**Beware: An ax-wielding Santa**_

A traumatized boy grows up at a Catholic orphanage in a small Utah town near the mountains. Once he gets a job at a toy store at 18, havoc ensues.

""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" (1984) is infamous for causing moral outrage when it was released, but I never understood the indignation. Not only is this a horror flick, it’s a slasher. Shock and grisly killings come with the territory. Aduh. 

Consider clowns for a moment. They are whimsical & funny and yet no one had an issue when they were used for scares in “He Who Gets Slapped” (1924), “Terror on Tour” (1980) and “Poltergeist” (1982). How exactly is Santa off limits, especially since he was depicted as the killer twelve years earlier in “Tales from the Crypt” (1972), not to mention four years earlier in “Christmas Evil” (1980)?

Unlike many slashers, this one takes the time to establish why the killer does what he does. The tone is mostly serious, but there’s also a wink of humor or camp here and there. While it lacks the mood and artistry of “Silent Night, Bloody Night” (1972), it’s serviceable as a one-dimensional (and sometimes amusing) slasher. I appreciated the scenic mountain town locations.

Linnea Quigley is notable on the female front as Denise, as is winsome Toni Nero as Pamela. Both are shown top nude so, if that offends you, I suggest staying away.

The full version is succinct at 1 hour, 22 minutes (while the theatrical version is 3 minutes shorter). It was shot at Heber City & nearby Midway, Utah, which are both east of Salt Lake City on the other side of the mountain pass.

12615.0,Death of a Salesman,"Willy Loman is an over-the-hill salesman who faces a personal turning point when he loses his job and attempts to make peace with his family: Willy's long-suffering wife Linda, and Biff and Happy, his troubled sons and his life.",Its passion cannot be overstated. Its power must not be overlooked.,"Drama, TV Movie",130.0,1985-08-16,en,6.9,174.0,1.6699,"Dustin Hoffman, Kate Reid, John Malkovich, Stephen Lang, Charles Durning",Volker Schlöndorff,"parent child relationship, profession, failure, extramarital affair, family conflict","The age of social media would be a double-edged sword for Willy Loman (Dustin Hoffman) and his prophetic obsession with what we now know as 'likes.' One of his mantras is “Be liked and you will never want.” Today this would mean getting likes, and not just by the hundreds; if possible, by the thousands.

“One day I will have my own business and I will never have to leave the house,” says Willy. “Like Uncle Charley [Charles Durning]?” asks his youngest son Hap (Stephen Lang). “Bigger than Uncle Charley. Charley is not liked. He's liked but he's not well liked.”

Ironically, Charley is much more successful than Willy — as is Charley’s son Bernard (David S. Chandler) compared to Hap and his older brother Biff (John Malkovich) — despite, or perhaps because of his indifference to whether or not he is liked (“Why must everybody like you? Who liked JP Morgan? Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath he looked like a butcher. With his pockets on he was very well-liked.”).

Willy drew inspiration from Dave Singleman; “Old Dave would go up to his room, put on his green velvet slippers, pick up the phone and call the buyers. Without ever leaving his room at the age of 84, he made his living. When I saw that, I realised that selling was the greatest career a man could want because what could be more satisfying than to be able to go at the age of 84 into 20 or 30 different cities and pick up a phone and be remembered and loved and helped by many different people?” 

This could be thought of as the old fashioned way of sending friend requests, and if one wants those requests to turn into contacts — because, after all, “It's not what you do; it's who you know” — it's better to have, so to speak , a good profile picture; this is the sort of lesson that Willy instills in Biff and Hap since they were in high school (“I thank Almighty God you're both built like Adonises. The man who makes an appearance in the business world, the man who creates personal interest, is the man who gets ahead”).

In Willy's world, a man's life's worth is judged by the number of people who attend his funeral; for example, “When [old Dave] died, hundreds of sellers and buyers were at his funeral. Things were sad on many trains for months after that."" 

As for his own funeral, Willy dreams of a “massive” one: “Oh, they'll come from Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire. All the old-timers with the strange licence plates. [Biff] will be thunderstruck ... because he never realised I am known. Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, I am known!” 

All of this is as illusory as a Facebook profile, as are the 'memories' that Willy 'shares' with us, which represent an idealized view not only of the past but also, thanks to Willy's incipient senility, of the present.

The greatest irony of this film, directed by Volker Schlöndorff and adapted from the play of the same name by Arthur Miller, is Willy's inability to see that if people don't like him, it's not because he’s ""very foolish to look at"", but due to the simple fact that he’s just not a likeable person: he yells at his wife Linda (Kate Reid), whom he used to two-time on his business trips — when Biff catches him red-handed with another woman and loses his considerable respect and admiration for him, Willy accuses him of throwing his life away to spite Willy, who had placed high hopes on Biff's athletic prowess (Biff, however, never tells his mother what he saw, at the cost of having her resent him for his coldness towards his father) —; he constantly hurls insults at Charley, and even questions his manhood, (""A man who can't handle tools isn't a man""), but has no problem taking Charley's money (but not a job that would most likely be a sinecure when Charley offers him one after Willy has been fired); etc. 

All things considered, Willy is the kind of 'friend' who is shocked when you block him, but then sends you a request from a different profile."

He was an actor and fancies himself as a bit of a disillusioned philosopher who craves the decency of times gone by - even though were probably never really there in the first place. Anyway, the party soon sets off down the usual path of familial discord and just when things couldn't get any more awkward, the house starts to tremble and loud aircraft sounds are heard passing overhead. They turn to the television and it tells them that a nuclear war has began before going blank. Now, they have no electricity and no way of knowing what's going on in the outside world and this adds more to their frustrations and fears and drives ""Alexander"" to his knees in prayer. He prays, he offers everything he has and is - if only his family are spared the worst. It's now that we are introduced to the enigmatic ""Otto"" (Allan Edwall) who suggests that salvation may indeed be in his hands, but first he must visit - and possibly placate - the reclusive ""Maria"". Who is she and what power might she have to alter this terminal train of events? This has many of the traits of an Ingmar Bergman film. The usual dysfunctional dynamics, the style of presentation and I'd say the glacial pace of the plot development, but it is't actually that quick. What makes it work though is the striking effort from Josephson in offering us a character who at times looks like he has but a limited grasp on realty, but who also has a deep spirituality to him. Though he doesn't much care for his brood, he will sacrifice anything and everything to see them safe. There's enough dialogue to convey meaning, but no more and the camerawork does most of the rest of the heavy lifting accompanied by some beautiful JS Bach. It's a film that tantalises our brains. We don't get anything, really, handed to us - we can treat it as a load of emperor's new clothes if we like, or we can imagine just how we might deal with impending disaster and consider what pacts we might make with God - or, for that matter, anyone else - to avert catastrophe. Susan Fleetwood is on top form as ""Adelaide"", a woman not entirely anchored in reality either and the below stairs machinations add a bit of necessary diversion to the intensity of the principal plot as we take a leisurely 2½ hours to reflect on what we might chose to reflect on with armageddon looming. It's a big screen experience, this film. Not just for the cinematography but also to help concentrate - no easy feat at times, here."

In the post-apocalyptic landscape of the American Southwest, Sam Hellman (Roddy Piper) becomes property of the provisional government and is taken by agent Spangle (Sandahl Bergman) & her crony (Cec Verrell) to the derelict factory complex now known as Frogtown, where mutant frog-humanoids dwell. Their mission is to rescue a kidnapped harem of women. William Smith is on hand as a heavy.

""Hell Comes to Frogtown"" (1988) is a sci-fi/fantasy adult comedy that mixes the first two Planet of the Apes movies (or the Mad Max flicks) with frog people and a comedic vibe. Former pro-wrestler Piper makes for a likable, amusing protagonist while Sandahl is the same in the feminine department, although she lost the curvy appeal she had when she was in her physical prime in “Conan the Barbarian” (1982). She’s too thin here, but still attractive.   

At the end of the day this is an entertaining throwaway flick that fills the bill when you’re in the mode for something light and goofy. While the movie flirts with raunch, it has a good heart. You like the two protagonists and enjoy their antics together; and the ending is heartwarming. 

The film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal (Indian Dunes, Valencia; Kaiser Steel Mill, Fontana; Lincoln Foundry, Vernon; and Vasquez Rocks, Agua Dulce).

Something of the forgotten John Carpenter movie, Prince of Darkness shows both the good and bad side of the supremely talented director.

The story is a beaut, a bit skew-whiff, but unmistakably Carpenter territory as Satan exists in some sort of parallel universe. How he manifests himself is narratively a bit tricky, but still it makes for good horror, especially as the old religious angle finds Carpenter - in the guise of Donald Pleasence - chortling away to himself in a way that Old Nick has been prone to do.

Cue bugs, green goo, zombies and a centuries old sect determined to keep Satan out of our world. The scares are many, atmosphere bubbling away (in time with another of Carpenter's pulse beat synth musical scores), while the finale has a genuine surprise up its sleeve.

Unfortunately the cast are playing second fiddle to the supernatural strengths, working from a script that doesn't sit at one with the screenplay, rendering the characters as uninvolving fodder. Yet be that as it may, it's still a film of delights, enough in fact to make it a top end entry on Carpenter's CV. 7/10 || When an elderly priest passes away, one of his colleague discovers a mysterious green liquid hidden in a cylinder deep beneath a long-abandoned church. Rather misguidedly, as it turns out, he invites a group of enthusiastic students to come and investigate it's properties. Big mistake! It was hidden deep in the bowels of this crypt for a very good reason, and once they release it they discover that the Satanic horror they face might just be the tip of the iceberg! Donald Pleasence is strong here as the priest who realises, all too late in the day, that they are facing a terror that could jeopardise the very future of humanity... Christianity at any rate! Can he galvanise his now panic-stricken helpers to reverse the effects of the deadly gloop before they all become zombified servants of evil? The dialogue maybe isn't so hot, especially as hysteria begins to set in amongst the petrified, but the pace is great and the effects have held up remarkably well as this solid and quite menacing story builds to a genuinely exciting conclusion. The supporting cast deliver well, too and John Carpenter and Alan Howarth manage a score that adds quite a bit of peril to the accruing sense of danger the former creates throughout this rather superior drama. It's short, taut, and well worth a watch."

A town by the central California coast is invaded by circus-like extraterrestrials, who prey upon humans for their blood.

""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"" (1988) is a colorful and fun alien invasion flick in the mold of “Critters” from two years earlier but, unlike that flick, is too preposterous to suspend disbelief. For instance, “Critters” offers a good explanation for how one of the extraterrestrials appears like a striking rock star, but you’ll get nothing like that here.

Nevertheless, there are multiple funny moments and winsome redhead Suzanne Snyder is a highlight as Debbie. Also, John Vernon is entertaining as the curmudgeon officer and the sequence involving one of the Klowns using a certain character as a ventriloquist dummy is worth the price of admission.

An interesting interpretation is that the Klowns are analogous of the dispersed Israelites who learned to hide in plain sight and thrive (not just survive) by changing their names and taking control in their new environments thru influencing and manipulating entertainment, politics, the media and financing (e.g. Federal Reserve banking).

It runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot in Watsonville, California (and nearby Santa Cruz), which are located 80-90 miles south of San Francisco.

And there is perhaps no more quirky Ghibli film than _Kiki's Delivery Service_.

Fundamentally, _Kiki's Delivery Service_ is a coming of age film, telling the story of 13-year-old trainee witch Kiki who leaves home with her cat Jiji to continue her training. Arriving in a far-off European city, Kiki starts a flying delivery business, couriering goods around the town, which catches the eye of aviation-obsessed Tombo, who is immediately smitten by her flying.

One of the big draws of Ghibli is the simplicity of the stories, making them hugely accessible for the audience. In Kiki's Delivery Service we must just accept that there are ""some"" witches and even though people will possibly never see one, they are not feared. In fact, the only fear in Kiki's Delivery Service comes from Kiki's own self-doubt.

Considering, then, that Japan is far more conservative than the West - especially when it comes to family values - it is quite bizarre that one conservative Christian group in America took the decision to boycott the film solely for the purpose of glamorising witches.

But really, Kiki being a witch is completely secondary to the film. In some ways it could be argued that Kiki being a witch is simply another excuse for director Hayao Miyazaki to view another Ghibli world from the sky, allowing his team of animators to draw some of the most beautiful landscapes in animation.

In addition, it allows Kiki's comic foil to be a talking cat (who, in the English dub, is voiced by the instantly vocally recognisable Phil Hartman, who you may remember from such shows as _The Simpsons_, where he plays Troy McClure). As well as dominating most of the film's funnier moments, Jiji also depicts Kiki's transition from innocence.

Despite all of this marshmallowy innocence, _Kiki's Delivery Service_ is still a quirk. The plot is littered with unanswered questions - what happened to the other flying witch who was returning home? - and the final act involving the dirigible is, frankly, too overdramatic and out-of-place with the rest of the down-to-earth storyline.

Still, it is perfectly enjoyable, and while it isn't necessarily the first Ghibli I would recommend, it is still one that you should see."

Paul Hogan will forever be known as the bloke from Crocodile Dundee, a highly efficient fish out of water comedy that became a huge hit. However, the sequels and his other subsequent film's are either roundly ignored or highly frowned upon. That's a shame because Almost An Angel is a very engaging comedy, the sort of picture that stands up like a Capraesque piece for the 90s. It's the sort of fable that cheers one up when the blues draw in and then turn into a blackly dark cloud, yes it be true, old craggy faced Paul Hogan has the gift of comedy. True enough the doses of sentiment are at times like a treacle itch to be scratched, but is that a bad thing? Watching a street wise criminal turning his less than honourable skills into a thing of goodness?

The film has many visual gags to go with the ream of religious ones that flow within the piece, be it Hogan attempting to fly or a quiet word about Elvis, Almost An Angel delights if one accepts the nature of the beast. Linda Kozlowski again teams up with Hogan (after the earlier Crocodile Dundee pairing), here she has very little to do but she slots in very nicely, even if a pre-end credits sequence does her and everyone else no favours at all. The best actor on show is the criminally undervalued Elias Koteas, playing the wheelchair bound Steve Garner, he exudes a believability factor that many modern day actors can learn from, where, the ability to act with just your face is high art if it's done correctly. Check out both the first and last scenes that Koteas shares with Hogan, great stuff that seems to have been forgotten due to the disdain shown for this particular film.

I rate it 7/10 because it hits my spot when I need a pick me up, perhaps that is too high in this age where comedy is the hardest genre to succeed in? But don't believe the low rating here on this site, it's a delightful little comedy that is far from perfect, but hell! It's a heavenly piece knowingly incorporating the serious side of religious beliefs."

What does work here is the exposure of the sub-culture of criminality that prevailed in what was little better than a lawless East End of London; where protection rackets, prostitution and illicit trading was rampant and where, to some extent, these two men were seen as benevolent influences amongst a community that likened them a little to Robin Hood. Indeed, it’s it’s very clumsy attempts to glamorise the violence with which they ruled the streets that might be it’s redeeming feature. The general population did not recoil from their brutal activities in anything like the fashion we might expect nowadays - but there’s nowhere near enough action of any kind here.

State of Grace is directed by Phil Joanou and written by Dennis McIntyre. It stars Sean Penn, Ed Harris, Gary Oldman, Robin Wright, John Turturo and John C. Reilly. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth.

Terry Noonan (Penn) returns to Hells Kitchen after a number of years away and finds his best pal, Jackie Flannery (Oldman), is a major player in the Irish/American mob being run by his elder brother, Frankie Flannery (Harris). With a love interest rekindled and a secret he dare not reveal, Terry is soon caught in a maelstrom of danger and tested loyalties.

It got lost in the slipstream of Goodfellas, but although it’s not in the same league as Scorsese’s critical darling, State of Grace is a splendid slice of neo-noir gangsterism. The plot is made up of standard genre tropes, divided loyalties, betrayals, kinship, revenge, rivalries, territorial machismo and etc, all of which of course comes laced with spitfire  dialogue and sparky violence.

The strengths come with the performances of the lead cast members, the visual flourishes via Cronenweth and Joanou and Morricone’s classical score. Penn and Oldman are forces of nature, the former a ball of emotional turbulence, the latter a hopped up maniac with killer tendencies. Harris as the daddio main man is a moody and malevolent presence, as is Joe Viterelli as mafia boss man Borelli. Wright seems a little out of place in this material, Turturo isn’t used nearly enough, but Reilly scores well with a limited role and Burgess Meredith pops in for a superb cameo.

It doesn’t have originality on its side, but it’s a mightily strong film regardless, with the human drama drawing one in as the tech skills impress across the board. 8/10 || This is a fine film. Loved everything about it!

Great ensemble cast, Sean Penn plays a fantastic role as imbedded mole unto his past ‘hoodlum’ friends.
Gary Oldman is outstanding with such intensity and dynamic manic character he plays.

Robin Wright plays the love interest, and you can understand how Penn fell for her (outside of movie) 

There’s such great music too.

Brilliant soundtrack!

Merrideth Burgess plays a lovely cameo which must have been one of his last appearances on film.

The st Patrick’s Day Finale is beautifully filmed.

Totally loved the film!!

Meantime, ""Su Li-zhen"" has again found herself alone after her boyfriend decides to leave his police job and become a sailor. Is it all possible that the two might reconcile? Now, there is definitely something of the episodic - even soap opera - about this film. An unlikable and frankly selfish character seeking his own truth for his own reasons, but to be fair to the director and the writers, they manage to elevate it from the more tabloid and gradually develop the characters into creatures with whom we can, to an extent, empathise. There are façades all over the place, truth and honesty and trust are near, but in shadows - and the use of the dark, rainy, Hong Kong scenarios provides ample locations for all of those to hide - and from which to be discovered. Not my favourite of Wong Kar-wai's films - it is just a little predicable - but still, he packs lots into ninety minutes and the cast deliver well - especially Maggie Cheung - and I did enjoy it."

A typhoon struck the set in the Philippines, local officials were difficult to work with, Martin Sheen had a heart attack during filming, and Coppola was constantly troubled how to bring his script to a powerful ending. The 1991 documentary <i>Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse</i> chronicles these trials and tribulations through audio recordings that Coppola's wife Eleanor made for her filming diary, informal footage of life on the set and interviews with cast and crew.

If all <i>Hearts of Darkness</i> did was rehash the same general trivia one can get from Wikipedia, like so many documentaries, it wouldn't be very good. I was pleased to find that it reveals a lot about the story that I never knew before. The genesis of the screen adaption of Joseph Conrad's novel in earlier attempts by Orson Welles and George Lucas is charted. Dennis Hopper's maniacal performance is placed in the context of his own nervousness at a career slump and his thankfulness that Coppola was giving him a second chance.

Perhaps the strongest point of the film is how it reveals the mind of someone tormented by his drive to create, and how a film can result from spontaneous choices on set that go far beyond any script. When the film was first shown at Cannes, Coppola said of the production ""little by little we went insane"", and indeed his highs of inspiration and lows of self-doubt are captured here. The opening of the film where Sheen's character drunkenly breaks a mirror and slumps, bleeding and crying next to his hotel room bed, is shown to have resulted from the cameras rolling when Sheen did drunkenly stumble on set.

Upon its 1991 release this documentary must have been even more interesting as it contains much footage that appeared only in the <i>Apocalypse Now Redux</i> director's cut in 2001: the French Plantation scene, the interlude in the abandoned, muddy camp, etc. I was surprised to hear Coppola insist on cutting the French Plantation scene because he was unsatisfied with the quality of the French actors and the lighting, not because of its place in the story. But what remains remarkable about <i>Hearts of Darkness</i> is that it betrays nothing of the scenes out of the 5-hour workprint that remain cut from commercial release, such as the prominent role given to Lt. Colby and his murder of the American photographer. There's also absolutely no shots of Harvey Keitel as Captain Williard before he was replaced. || ***Outstanding documentary on the making of the hallowed ""Apocalypse Now""***

Released in 1991, ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" chronicles the making of 1979's ""Apocalypse Now,"" combining footage shot by Eleanor Coppola during the shooting of the film with more recent interviews with the cast & crew.

Documentaries or commentaries on how a particular film was made don't interest me because I'm not a filmmaker and only care about the final product. As a writer and former musician I'm familiar with the creative process and understand how some ideas fail to deliver the goods and must be thrown out, etc. As an example, I heard some demos of a couple of my favorite songs and they were lousy compared to the final product and almost ruined my view of those songs. This explains why I'm generally not interested in the harrowing details of how my favorite movies were made and the parts that were thrown out, etc. This documentary is an exception because (1.) ""Apocalypse Now"" is my all-time favorite movie (the original theatrical version, that is) and (2.) the documentary is just so well-done. In fact, it's fascinating from beginning to end.

""Hearts of Darkness"" shows the monumental problems Coppola and crew encountered in making the movie: The sudden firing of their leading man (Harvey Keitel) after three weeks of shooting and replacing him with Martin Sheen; the delays in filming due to the Philippine Army taking back their rented helicopters to quell an uprising; a hurricane that ruins the sets; Sheen having a heart attack at only 36 years of age and the corresponding delay; overweight Brando arriving to the set unprepared and making $1 million a week with an unwritten, improvised ending; the amusing tiger incident; Francis venting in genuine uncertainty at various stages of the creative process, particularly the entire ending; etc.

The interviews with cast and crew are also very informative and entertaining, like Frederic Forrest's commentary on the tiger sequence and John Milius' insights on his original screenplay and his encounter with Francis during filming where the latter convinced him that it'd be ""the first film to win the Nobel prize."" 

This documentary came out ten years before the ""Redux"" version of the film was released and, as such, it was the public's first glimpse of various scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor, like the French Plantation sequence and the typhoon-with-the-bunnies sequence. In my opinion, ""Redux"" is a failure and those scenes should've never been inserted into the movie as very little of the added footage works, but those sequences ARE interesting as deleted scenes or viewing them (in part) in the context of ""Hearts of Darkness."" 

For some good laughs, be sure to check out the spoof of this documentary: ""Hearts of Hot Shots Part Deux: A Filmmaker's Apology,"" which was released in 1993 and is available on Youtube in a couple parts.

The film runs 96 minutes.

Kristy Swanson and William Ragsdale don't do much wrong themselves in the two lead roles, though their characters are portrayed/written woefully. Nice to see Meshach Taylor again, even if he isn't as good as before; Taylor is the only actor from last time out to return.

Quigley Down Under is directed by Simon Wincer and written by John Hill. It stars Tom Selleck, Laura San Giacomo and Alan Rickman. Music is by Basil Poledouris and cinematography by David Eggby. Plot sees Selleck as Matthew Quigley, a Wyoming cowboy and sharp shooting rifleman who answers an advertisement to go to Western Australia as a hired sharp shooter. If proving his worth, he's to work for Elliot Marston (Rickman), but when Marston outlines his sick reasons for hiring Quigley, the pair quickly become on a collision course that can only see one of them survive. 

It was written in the 1970s by John Hill, where it was hoped that Steve McQueen would take on the lead role, but with McQueen falling ill and Clint Eastwood allegedly passed over, the project sat on ice until 1990. In came Selleck and the film finally got made. Just about making back its money at the box office, Wincer's movie deserved far better than that. It's competition in the Western stakes in 1990 were Costner's beautiful and elegiac Dances With Wolves and the Brat Pack bravado of Young Guns II, both vastly different films from each other, and both considerably different from Quigley Down Under. If those two films contributed to the average response to the Selleck picture? I'm not completely sure, but viewing it now one tends to think that the 1990 audience just wasn't ready for such a delightfully old fashioned Oater, one that features a straight and simple narrative to tell its tale.

It's safe to say that anyone after deep psychological aspects will not get that here. There's some serious themes in the story, such as the horrid genocide towards Aborigines, while the deft kicks at the British are fair enough even to a British guy such as myself. But in the main this is old time Western fare, where it may be as predictable as a horse doing toilet where it pleases, but it's fun, brisk, gorgeous to look at, and there's never a dull moment within. Wincer (Lonesome Dove) directs with assuredness and the trio of cast leads are great value. Selleck cuts an impressive figure of a tough guy high on principals and with a comedy glint in his eye, Rickman is suitably attired all in black and bang on form for sneering, cocksure, villainy, while Giacomo is pretty and works neatly alongside Selleck as a spunky, lively, sidekick type who carries along some sad emotional baggage. 

There appears to be quite some division amongst fans and critics as regards Poledouris' (Conan the Barbarian) score. Whilst I agree that it does at time veer close to being too boisterous, it sits well within the type of film the makers are going for. It carries with it a sort of Magnificent Seven flavouring, imbuing the story with a rightful sense of adventure. It also flows freely with Eggby's classical capturing of the Western Australian locations. Eggby (Mad Max/The Man From Snowy River) utilises the scope format on offer to deliver some truly gorgeous back drops, while the brown and yellow hues are most appealing to the eyes. Costuming and sets are spot on for period detail, and Quigley's Sharps Rifle is an absolute beast of a weapon. The simple structure and telegraphed nature of the story stops it from being a true classic of the genre. But it's got so much going for it and is high on rewatchability factor, to make Quigley Down Under (not the best of titles either) essential viewing for fans of old fashioned Westerns. 8.5/10 || _**“Maybe the dingo ate your baby”**_

In the late 1870s, a famous sharpshooter from Wyoming (Tom Selleck) travels to Australia for a gig with a land baron in the Outback (Alan Rickman), but things turn sour when he learns what the job really entails. Laura San Giacomo is also on hand as Crazy Cora.  

“Quigley Down Under” (1990) is a Western taking place in the desert wilderness of Australia. The title suggests that Quigley was meant to be a Western character in the manner of Indiana Jones with sequels of him visiting other continents, such as “Quigley in Africa,” “Quigley in South America” and so on. Unfortunately, its lack of success at the box office put the kibosh on that.  

It’s not as goofy as some of the Indiana Jones yarns and I appreciated the realistic vibe behind the typical hero shenanigans. For instance, we know personal hygiene wasn’t the best in the late 1800s and, especially, in dry areas of the Old West and most of Australia where washing clothes was infrequent; “Quigley Down Under” shows this reality.

Selleck of course makes for a great Western protagonist, likewise Rickman as the odious antagonist. Meanwhile petite Laura San Giacomo is an amusing spitfire. She was 26 during filming.

The film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot entirely in Australia (Warrnambool & Apollo Bay, Victoria, etc.).

While not quite as good as those, it’s still worth checking out, especially if you like mambo or energetic Latin music in general, not to mention the setting of 50’s America. 

Assante is convincing, performing with charisma and gusto, while Banderas is effective as the sensitive and sincere younger sibling, although he’s a far cry from the brooding Brando. This was Banderas’ first English-speaking role; he learned his lines phonetically and worked with a dialect coach throughout pre-production and filming.

Too much of the movie takes place in clubs or apartments with people smoking, drinking and emoting for my tastes. But the story perks up in the third act with a notable sequence featuring Desi Arnaz, Jr. (I don’t want to say more because I don’t want to give anything away). 

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.

We see him forced into the outside world by the return of his parasitic and presumably itinerant father, who wants his place in the home again.   This childlike man, Bubby, realises that the outside world is not what he was made to believe it is and so begins his voyage of discovery.

Through Bubby's eyes we can see a (slightly crazy) city from a naive perspective and it is this sense of wonder and discovery that defines the film.  Bubby is not a clean slate, though.  His past is extremely messed up and this is never forgotten in his characterisation.  So he gets frustrated and angry as well as joyous and excited.  The acting is phenomenal, it really is.  This ain't Forest Gump, not to knock that film but this is next level documtary footage tier.

There's not much of a plot other than Bubby goes from A to Z via every stop along the way.  He finds love and learns that it is all.  There are a couple of incredibly touching scenes that are genuinely beautiful and, as far as I can tell, not acted.  It's a very philosophical film and explicitly encourages an open and critical mind in several scenes,   

An incredible masterpiece in my eyes, with many unforgettable scenes and several that you will not have seen the likeness of before."

I didn't have very high expectations when I decided to see this movie. I knew that it was a film set in a future that, for us, is now past (the year 2017) and that it was yet another film about a prison break. I also knew that it had been a success in Europe, especially on the VHS market, and that it had been forgotten since the end of the tapes and no one was talking about it anymore. So, I decided to take a look, see if it was worth it, and I liked what I saw. It is a creative film, made by people with ideas and the ability to come up with imaginative solutions, based on a competent cast, and which made good use of its short budget.

The script takes us to a high-security prison, built underground in the United States desert, in order to accompany a couple who have just been arrested for trying to have a second child, something prohibited by the “one-child policy” then in effect. strength in the USA. Sentenced to the outrageous sentence of 31 years in prison, they are placed inside that place, where everything is controlled by a computer and depends on a vicious and sadistic director, and on the computer system itself, which sometimes seems to have a life of its own. Even the dreams of these inmates are controlled and censored via a mechanism installed in the gut, and that could kill them if they step over the risk (literally).

The script has a serious problem: it is based on an old premise that is prison escapes. We've seen a lot of them already, because almost every great fugue in history has been adapted for the screen in some way. However, the film tries to get around the problem with doses of imagination and creativity that futurism accepts well. The graphic violence of some scenes can also bother some people, but I think I've even seen worse. But be warned: we have everything from exploding intestines to half-human androids with a misshapen appearance. There is an investment in visual effects, special effects, make-up, quality sets and costumes, and this investment has paid off. Unfortunately, the cinematography is not very good, it is even below the standard of the time the film was made, but I coped well with it.

Stuart Gordon gives the film a well-executed, effective direction, managing to take full advantage of what he has to work with. Christopher Lambert, the eternal McLeod, is in excellent shape here and does a solid job, even if the role is simple and effortless. Kurtwood Smith is an efficient villain, cold and worthy of our contempt, but he also provokes some sympathy for his quest for a certain warmth that his character has lost. Loryn Locklin is also a welcome addition, but I felt several times that the character had little to do and was limited to being a damsel in distress. Tom Towles, Clifton Collins Jr., Vernon Wells, Jeffrey Combs and Lincoln Kilpatrick provide effective support, but they can do no more."

But also because of the emotions displayed, I always had an idea about the tenor of the conversations.

I thought a few of the subplots could have been given more screen time, but then again, they were almost always talking about the titular baby-to-be so I guess that is fair. Plus, the person who wrote the novel adapted it to the screenplay, so hr must have imported what he thought was important.

It was nice seeing MOST of the team together again, but you got the sense that in Major League, it was written as a love story so the people involved could actually see the Indians win. This feels more like a cash cow and not as much about the love of baseball as it is about over-the-top gags.

Last of the Dogmen is written and directed by Tab Murphy. It stars Tom Berenger, Barbara Hershey, Kurtwood Smith and Steve Reevis. Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. 

When three convicts escape from prison and head into the Montana mountains, the local law enforcer hires skillful tracker/bounty hunter Lewis Gates (Berenger) to go find them. What he finds is torn clothes, blood and an Indian arrow. After spying someone in the trees it leads Gates to an investigation on the possibility of a lost tribe of Cheyenne Indians living in the mountains.

A thoroughly enjoyable contemporary Western, even if it's cribbing clichés from a number of films and TV episodes of the past. Formula of story is simple, grizzled tracker man Berenger and prim anthropologist Hershey are poles apart, but into the mountains they go in search of a hidden tribe of Cheyenne. That they find them is a given, since the title says it all, but what unfolds is a burgeoning relationship between the two, while much understanding and soul searching involving the ""alien"" Cheyenne makes for a good chunk of the narrative. There's observations galore in here about the advancement of time, different cultures etc, and a nod to the Sand Creek Massacre, while a back story sub-plot involving Kurtwood Smith is deftly handled; if a little redundant in the grand scheme of things.

Anyone who has seen the likes of The African Queen, Dances With Wolves and the Twilight Zone Episode: A Hundred Yards Over The Rim, wont be particularly surprised by what transpires in eventuality. But Berenger and Hershey make for a nice duo to be in the company of, while Kip the dog steals the film from both of them! Though story is set in Montana, film was shot on location in Alberta and British Columbia, and here is the film's trump card, where Lindenlaub's photography is quite simply stunning. In fact his work, and that of Arnold, whose score darts in and out of the landscape, deserves to be in an ""A"" grade movie. It rounds out as very watchable, a professional picture that just about manages to sustain interest and good will for the two hours run time. 7/10"

It's based in part upon the real-life story of the behind the scenes of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, and in part of the documentary The Battle over Citizen Kane that made as a part of The American Experience.

Orson Welles (Liev Schreiber) has been offered a carte blanche-contract with RKO after his legendary War of the Worlds broadcast, however he has troubles coming up with a picture, and he lacks inspiration. One night, at a party hosted by newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (James Cromwell) he finds the inspiration. He wants to make a movie about this powerful man. He and writer Herman Mankeweizc (John Malkovich) starts writing the screenplay and Citizen Kane gets into production. When the movie is near completion, Hearst gets the information that Citizen Kane is about him (and not the most flattering portrait either) so he is determined to have the film destroyed. He blackmails the studio-bosses in Hollywood to buy the filmnegative... and burn it...

Honestly, I find this movie much more interesting and BETTER than Citizen Kane itself. Although I love that movie, I find this so much better! A compelling, well-written film (with a kind of downbeat ending) that keeps your (atleast my) attention all the way through. The highlight of the film for me is when Welles is filming Kane! Great re-creation of the sets in Kane, the details are just right! The actors do a good job at portraying their characters and it's well-directed. 

To fully appreciate this movie, you have to watch Citizen Kane first. If you have already seen Citizen Kane, then go right ahead and watch RKO 281! Highly recommended!

I give it a 10/10"

What in the original was an unforeseeable surprise becomes expectation here, and we’re left simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

Having said that, this film is better than it has any right to be, precisely because it knows how dumb it is. An old band of bank robbers is getting back together for one more score, which they insist on carrying out even after most of them have been turned into vampires; this would only make sense if it were a blood bank. 

To its credit, Texas Blood Money is not oblivious to the situation’s inherent silliness; when asked ""What in the hell are vampires doing robbing a bank?,"" protagonist Buck Bowers (the always effective Robert Patrick) deadpans: ""I suppose vampires need money just like anybody else.""

Insofar as the movie works, it does so because of the cast, who bring to the script more than it brings them. The filmmakers try too hard to emulate Tarantino and Robert Rodríguez at the peak of their powers, and can’t even reach the low levels to which those have sunk nowadays. 

As far as horror/fantasy sequels are concerned, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money exists in the same limbo as The Crow: Wicked Prayer. This not the best vampire movie ever, but it’s by no means the worst either."

There quite often comes a time when a film fan who is so enamoured with a specific genre or style of film making, comes across a picture that one knows is far from perfect if deconstructed frame by frame, but still loves it with every breath they take. Purgatory is one such film for myself.

Purgatory, a TNT TV production, is that rare old beast of the Western fused with fantastical or supernatural elements. More often than not this is a blend that proved to be disastrous, hence why there are so few films of this type put into production here in the modern era. Yet director Uli Edel and producer Daniel Schneider pulled it off back in 1999, my only regret is that it took me so long to let it into my cinematic life.

The title is something of a give away, thus rendering the supposed twist as being hardly surprising. However, it was not the intention of the film makers to hoist a Sixth Sense surprise on us, really it wasn't. We are asked to put ourselves into the young Greenhorn shoes of Leon ""Sonny"" Miller (Brad Rowe) and experience his own coming of age awakening. From dime novels and hero worship to first kills and first loves, Sonny is our conduit and the key holder to the gates of redemption for many of the Wild West's legendary characters.

The cast is a veritable feast of splendid character actors playing a veritable feast of iconic real life people. Sam Shepard, Eric Roberts, Randy Quaid, Peter Stormare, Donnie Wahlberg and J.D. Souther. While Brad Fiedel provides a musical score of some magnificent beauty, a piece that revels in heroic swirls and escalating emotions, it darts around the town of ""Refuge"" like a novelist writing a dime novel soon to go down in folklore legend.

Budget restrictions are hidden very well, Edel and his cinematographer William Wages prove adept at lighting techniques and scene staging. Be it keeping things in the shade or cloaking a sequence with believable dust clouds, there's a professional touch here that puts the pic into the upper echelons of TV movies.

Then there's the action, a key component for so many Western fans, and thankfully Purgatory is book-ended by superb action sequences, with the finale a skilled lesson in shoot-out choreography and machismo pulse beats. And then there's the emotional kickers, ready to be embraced by those who still yearn to have the spirit lifted and the heart gladdened.

I could write a whole weighty paragraph on Purgatory's flaws, maybe even point out thematically what I think will annoy others, because for sure not everything works. But as a Western movie lover I found myself cheering at the film's end, even wiping away a damn fly from my eye. That's job done for me, a Western that tickled and teased my every emotion, wonderful. 10/10 || Last chance for the marginally good plucked from the incorrigibly wicked

RELEASED TO TV IN 1999 and directed by Uli Edel, “Purgatory” chronicles events circa 1888 when a gang of outlaws led by Blackjack Britton (Eric Roberts) holds up in a mysterious hidden town called Refuge where the inhabitants seem overly gracious and pacifistic. Respectful greenhorn Sonny (Brad Rowe) increasingly suspects something strange is happening. Sam Shepard plays the Sheriff, Donnie Wahlberg his deputy, Randy Quaid the doctor and JD Souther a shop-owner. Amelia Heinle and Shannon Kenny are on hand in the feminine department.

Other than the action-packed opening, this is a town-bound Western. While you can pick-up the made-for-TV quality right away, the movie scores well in its intriguing premise and quality writing. There are fantastical elements akin to “Pale Rider” (1985) and “High Plains Drifter” (1973). The movie’s pretty much on par with the former and superior to the latter IMHO due to the more engaging story and weighty subtext.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Barstow and Burbank Studios, California. WRITER: Gordon T. Dawson.

GRADE: B

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don’t read unless you’ve watched the movie).

Some viewers misunderstood the premise of the movie. The town of Refuge isn't just for outlaws; it's the ""last chance"" for the ""marginally good,"" as phrased in the movie; it evens says something like the inhabitants were plucked from the incorrigibly wicked. As such, the citizens (not visitors) have different identities and occupations than in their former lives. For instance, Billy the Kid is now Deputy Glen, not a gunfighter; and Dolly Sloan is now Ivy, not a prostitute or suffragette. Holliday was now Doc Woods, an M.D. and not a dentist, who wasn't skinny because he no longer has tuberculosis.

Just the same, Jesses James was now a shop owner named Brooks and was no longer robbing trains. Some contend that James deserved immediate damnation because he was a notorious bank/train robber, but the movie implies that he was corrupted by the Civil War during his developing years which involved the bloody guerrilla warfare in Missouri/Kansas and therefore he is given a ""last chance"" in Refuge .

As for the dubious chronology, Holliday might have been a relatively recent arrival and therefore the reference to ""10 years"" in regards to Hickok's death actually meant ""about 10 years."" So the events could be taking place in 1888 or even 1889.

The movie suggests that Sonny was read-up on famous Western figures and so recognized clues to their real identities. He only suspected who they really were. And this was eventually verified as he increasingly discovers the supernatural nature of Refuge. In other words, it wasn't like he instantly recognized these individuals and was 100% sure of their semi-infamous identities based on dime-store novels.

Lastly, some complain that the movie supports the questionable idea that shooting people makes you a candidate for eternal life. Actually, it advocates selfless bravery and commitment to justice: Blackjack & his gang proved that they were chronic thugs and a serious threat to others; taking a violent-if-necessary stand against them was the only answer since they were incurable. The best way to stop a bad person with a gun is via a good person with a gun."

The latter two are wasted, aside from some quips about cinema (I know Letterboxd ate that up!) and one aimless relationship subplot. I like what Bodnia provides as lead, even if his performance isn't too far adrift from what he gives in that aforementioned 1996 release.

There is at least one scene involving an injection that will remain in my mind (not that it made the most sense, given the character's connection with the injecter's sibling but...). Aside from that though, I don't think <em>'Bleeder'</em> offers all that much in my opinion. 6/10."

The themes are relayed cleverly using the naivety of a child's eyes - and that's frequently poignant, comical, amusing - and surprisingly practical. The young boy engages with the animal kingdom in a plausible way too - they don't speak, indeed frequently the collection of squirrels, wart-hogs and snakes react naturally when they encounter him - scoring away or taking him on.

As he writes, he forms relationships of varying degrees of importance with four women but the more he tries to forget his past, the harder it is for him to move on, to escape from the memories of his now late wife. Is that the goal of ""2046"" - memories never die, never exist - time stands still? Leung handles this emotional tsunami of a film with aplomb, and as usual, there is a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack to keep the sense of confusion working nicely, too. Maybe a touch too long - but still an absorbing piece of cinema from a man who can juggle concepts and characterisations with some considerable skill. || _2046_ is a visual treat, embodying Wong Kar-wai’s trademark dreamlike style. However, it falls short in delivering the emotional impact of In the Mood for Love. Tony Leung's performance is a standout, but the fragmented narrative and slow pacing create a sense of detachment. The film's exploration of love and memory is intriguing, but it tends to dwell too much on melancholy, losing some of the elegance that defined its predecessor. Despite its unevenness, _2046_ leaves a lasting impression, not quite reaching its full potential."

As the film lovers of the Western World clamoured for more Asian horror, along came Ôdishon (Audition), a one of a kind sort of pic. Its positive reputation is well deserved, though what negative press exists is certainly understandable.

Run time runs close to two hours, and for ninety minutes of that time the film trundles along at a sedate pace. Director Takashi Miike is exploring the key characters, deftly providing an overlay of grief management, loneliness, sadness and even cruelty.

There's a deliberately hallucinatory vibe to the narrative, with many thematic beats ticking away, though answers are not readily available, where both the lead protagonist and antagonist have blurry mindsets, or do they?

It all builds to the Grand Guignol last quarter, where the film has gained its wince inducing rep. Worth the wait? Yes it is for sure, even if it is tinged with a sense of disappointment that there's one too many twists for twist sake. 7/10"

However, while it's visually sublime - a magical mystery tour of animation styles- it doesn't fully deliver. Overall, the disc is debilitated by story issues and an overwhelming number of downbeat endings, which place it far from the cathartic exhilaration of the original movie.

The Wachowskis themselves penned The Second Renaissance Part 1, a beautifully designed look at life pre-Matrix, using a faux newsreel style to chilling effect as the machines rise.

Dark-edged, brutal and less smoothly styled, The Second Renaissance Part 2 shows those machines creating The Matrix.

Program - the most truly manga-fied effort - is a love story set in Medieval Japan; artistically startling, but less profound than it thinks it is.

An athlete breaks out of the Wachowskis' wonderland through sheer willpower in stylized short World Record. Bouquets for its strange, angular art; brickbats for a confusing story.

A Kid's Story, on the other hand, is suffused with a dream-like quality, as Clayton Moore (who appears in Reloaded and Revolutions) tries to escape The Matrix with Neo's help.

Until a climax which betrays the internal logic of The Matrix, Detective Story is by far the best of the shorts - a spot-on black-and-white noir about a detective enlisted to find Trinity.

Beyond (a group of children exploit a glitch in The Matrix) is slight and atmospheric; while Matriculated (outside The Matrix, humans reprogram a machine) is a visually stunning, frankly hallucinogenic trip which out-Kubricks 2001.

Lastly, The Final Flight Of The Osiris, the much-vaunted precursor to Reloaded: a triumph for CG photorealism, but the story is wafer-thin.


Verdict - Though undeniably beautiful, overall, the disc is debilitated by story issues and an overwhelming number of downbeat endings, which place it far from the cathartic exhilaration of the original movie. 

3/5

- Empire Magazine || Ooooh, yeah, I just ripped into Revolutions for breaking from the way The Matrix and Reloaded looked and now... the Animatrix.

And I'm not going to do the same thing.

All the segments looked a little different, which I liked. But this comes along and it sort of fills in the backstory of the Matrix world. Almost like the, brothers at the time, sisters now looked at the Matrix and realized that Sci-Fi geekdom was loving it and they had to really explain a history so that the geeks like me had something to sink our teeth into and argue about at the comic book store on Wednesday nights.

And then, with the Animatrix, they gave it to us... and THANK YOU."

Description:
A man must survive a prison where hardened criminals battle to the death for the wardens' entertainment.

Review:
In Hell is a 2003 Action Drama starring Jean-Claude Van Damme that's surprisingly watchable. Van Damme plays Kyle Leblanc a man sent to a Russian prison after the killing his wife's murderer. Leblanc is sentenced to life in this run down prison where the warden arranges illegal fights.

Van Damme takes a departure from his usual tough guy who kicks ass in prison like Death Warrant and instead is a troubled mourning prisoner who sees his wife's image as he descends into madness while in solitary confinement. Of course the story becomes predictable as Van Damme becomes the top fighter and the surrounding actors are forgettable including former football star Lawrence Taylor. Similar to the Undisputed series and as serious as Lock-Up, In Hell is a great turn for Van Damme which sets you up for his performance just a few years later in JCVD. Do yourself a favor and peep this shit sometime."

I watched this as part of my run through Mads Mikkelsen's filmography, but it may as well be a Nikolaj Lie Kaas 'watchathon' given how often he has appeared - not that I'm complaining, I like him as an actor. Him and Mikkelsen (how about that trim!) are terrific all the way through this 2003 flick.

The story is a surprisingly simple one but is one that never bores or overstays its welcome, the 90 or so minute run time is perfectly selected in that regard. It's a pretty messed up story but an entertaining one at that, you can probably predict large portions from a certain point - yet even then there are still bits that are against that grain.

Humour-wise it's solid if not spectacular, though a lot of it is naturally likely lost in translation... it still has its moments, mind. Elsewhere, I enjoyed the score a fair amount, it reminded me ever so slightly of a tiny bit of music from 2011's (outstanding) <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/source-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">Source Code</a>'</em>.

OldBoy here, second installment from The Vengeance Trilogy directed by  Park Chan-wook (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, OldBoy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) really have them all, good story, powerful acting and the most horrifying and clever end twist if not genius. In fact no matter how many times you see this, the twist would still be awesome. The theme of revenge here is taken to the next level, to its supremacy for it’s really carefully-planned. OldBoy has a mind-bending assortment of drama, thriller, romance and beautifully spiced up with sadistic plot, shocking elements, ultra violence and clever psychological twist. Imagine yourself captured, locked in a room for 15 years, not knowing why and who did it and when you finally escaped and thought it’s all over, you were wrong and here’s the punching line, the direct punch to your stomach. Min-sik Choi as Oh Dae su really acted well, he really got us carried away by dragging us into the mystery that surrounds his life, into the depression he’s been feeling and into the deep well of his curiosity. Once again, OldBoy is a way too remarkable, when “revenge” isn’t merely knife-chopping or gun-battling. Enough said. || This is definitely one of the films to see before you die. It's seat-squirmingly unsettling, shocking and very violent. 

It's a journey into a truly disturbed mind; a mind, which - like yours will be - is unable to cope with what it discovers.

This film is brilliantly twisted. It has a thread of the most wonderful, blackest humour running through it, a sense of complete disorientation and enough plot twists and turns to sustain your interest.

Not one of the best revenge thrillers I've seen - simply THE best! || Just about everyone I’d spoken to about this film recommended it to me.

I watched this film with the original Korean-language soundtrack, with English subtitles.

Oh Dae-su (Chi Min-sik) is a bit of a flirt (whether he is a womaniser is not made clear) with a wife and young child, who has turned two years old on the day we start the film. Dae-su is in a prison waiting room having insulted a woman he was flirting with. A friend comes and eventually gets him out, but while he’s making a call to his wife to explain he will be home soon, he is kidnapped.

Incarcerated in a small room, with only a TV for company, he is fed and looked after, but not allowed his freedom. He unsuccessfully attempts suicide several times. He keeps himself fit by doing exercise programmes he sees on TV and he starts to dig his way out with chopsticks. He sees a TV report that shows he’s been framed for the murder of his wife. Fifteen years later, without a word of explanation, he is released.

The rest of the film follows his attempts to find out why he was imprisoned, who did it, and where his daughter is.

The film is frenetic, highly charged, and very emotional on several levels. It is also bloody in places, but Dae-su’s obsession for seeking revenge on whomsoever imprisoned him and on finding out where his daughter is drives this film along. There are psychological aspects to the film as well, and the film does eventually resolve itself – it is not one of those open-ended “I wonder who did it” type films. Follow the film through and you will get all the answers.

I would recommend it, but I wouldn’t call it light entertainment."

It's the day before the UK joins the Euro (so, yes - it's a fantasy/horror story depending on your perspective) and from the sky falls a bag of used twenties. Hundreds of thousands of pounds worth. Now he (""Damian"") and his pal ""Anthony"" (Lewis McGibbon) are honest sort of lads - though not take it to the police station sort of honest - and they decide that they can become the benefactors for some people and institutions who need a bit of help. Clearly, though - they can't distribute it all in time, so they gradually start to include their friends and family in the disposal of their largess and that's when the story starts to take on a more critical aspect. We see humanity in many of it's guises emanating when lucre is involved - and some of that behaviour isn't so charming. The writing is often quite pithily amusing - the young lad has an habit of talking to saints, to whom he attributes his windfall, and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce quite cleverly uses this innocence and generosity of spirit to create a template for a look at just how we react when money is the raison d'être - too little, too much, sharing, hoarding, stealing... This is a well delivered testament to the acting talents of the two youngsters and to a bit of amusing, though-provoking, writing that I would not say is especially memorable - but it is enjoyable. || Recently, I decided to watch the movie ""Millions,"" available on Disney+. I was unsure if it was an original Disney production or a film from another company that Disney acquired. Nevertheless, I had seen it on the platform multiple times and decided to give it a chance.

The story follows two brothers who stumble upon a large sum of money. One brother wants to invest and grow the money, while the other brother starts seeing spirits of people from Jesus' time and feels compelled to donate the money to charitable causes. As the plot unfolds, the siblings clash over how to handle the newfound wealth, leading to a series of conflicts and decisions.

The movie takes a peculiar turn when saints, apostles, and other spiritual figures begin appearing to communicate with one of the brothers. However, the narrative takes a surprising twist when it's revealed that the money was not a gift from God but rather the result of a robbery. This revelation shatters the boy's faith and leaves both the characters and the audience questioning the purpose of the spiritual encounters.

The film's direction becomes muddled as it struggles to reconcile the spiritual themes with the materialistic elements of the story. The protagonist, already a spiritual and kind-hearted child, is left disillusioned by the origins of the money, raising doubts about the film's underlying message and the significance of the supernatural encounters.

In the end, ""Millions"" appears to lose its focus, leaving viewers puzzled about the overall message and the relevance of the spiritual elements in the story. The film's attempt to blend spiritual themes with materialistic concerns ultimately leads to a disjointed and unsatisfying narrative."

Open Water, which reminded me of Force Majeure (2014), is instead about the tension brewing between two husband-wife divers who are left to adrift by their crew in the middle of a reef. Based on an odd true story, it is about the delirium, the panic attack, and the sheer fear of being shark food when you are in the middle of an ocean infested with sharks, stingrays, and barracudas than about being preyed on by sharks, which makes it a slightly dull movie to watch, especially if you are a shark movie connoisseur like me. There are hardly any jumpscares or thrills here, their lack of which is aggravated by some odd humming music and found footage-like camera work. But it does have some brilliant dialogues that are tinged with humour and wisdom, which is supported by some level of suspense, making it a worthwhile watch if you like natural survival films.

It's a remake of the classic film about men in a hopeless situation when their small plane crashes in the desert. Hope comes back when one of the men reveals he can make an airplane, and the others believe him.
In such a story, the subplots and side stories make the story. Here, the subplots and side stories are cartoonish and contrived. The characters are totally without motivation. One can almost see the actors wince about being part of such a horribly written story.
In fact, one almost wonders if it was written for the purpose of some day being a ""so bad it's good"" story. I'm not sure. There really isn't any charm to this movie, no inspiration, no motivation, and that might be too bad to even make the ""so bad it's good"" list. || I think to be fair to this reimagining of the story, it tries to be different from the 1965 version. They shift the location and update the dialogue and up to a point that gives it a fighting chance. A plane gets caught up in a sandstorm over the Gobi desert and crashes. It falls to the survivors to work out a plan before the water runs out. Sadly, though, aside from the efforts from Giovanni Ribisi as designer ""Elliott"" (and that's because at times he resembles Hardy Kruger) the acting is pretty woeful. Dennis Quaid ought to be commended for taking on the Jimmy Stewart role - that was never going to be easy, but he just hasn't the screen presence. The rest of the ensemble form an unremarkable bunch and John Moore's direction does little to deliver any sense of peril or desperation as their predicament gets worse and their personal relationships become more and more fraught. It looks ok, but in the end comes across as little better than an OK television movie that I questioned the necessity for. || _""The design is perfect, the only flaw is that we have to rely on you to fly it.""_

And my commodity happens to be cocaine.

With a considerable amount of cash saved from his, ahem, dealings. A London drug dealer is all set to retire abroad and start a new life. However his mob boss Jimmy Price has two jobs for him to do immediately...

Layer Cake is directed by Matthew Vaughn. Vaughn is more well known as Guy Ritchie's producer on his early British gangster genre forays. Suffice to say he had some insight into what made those films {Snatch et al} hugely popular with the watching British public. How pleasing it is then to say that Vaughn, by showing restraint and an unfussy approach, has crafted a film that's more than equal to the best of Britain gangster faves, and actually sets new parameters for toning a film. By focusing more on mood and atmosphere over bombastic scenarios, Vaughn, aided by a superlative Daniel Craig as the nameless dealer, lifts the film above its conventional plot arc. In what could have been a standard tale of a man doing one last job before going straight, we, along with Craig, find that all roads are blocked, it's as if there is some higher force at work here.

Layer Cake also scores high for its more easy on the eye filming of London, this is no destitute capital where tower blocks loom like monsters over the characters. This London is thriving, vim and vitality, the place to be, seediness is far from the ebullient crowd. Ben Davis' photography perfectly complimenting the engrossing score from Lisa Gerrard & Ilan Eshkeri, both of which serve to make London an extra character in the story. The film however is not perfect, at 105 minutes it's actually too short, something that only becomes apparent when all the plot strands come crashing together in a rushed last quarter. Yet in spite of that failing, the ending delivers a jolt to the system, to crown, what to me at least, is one of Britain's finest and tidiest gangster offerings. 9/10 || Absolutely tremendous!

I haven't got much <em>(edit: five paragraphs later...)</em> to say about <em>'Layer Cake'</em>, but that's only because it's simply one of those movies that is undeniably outstanding, to the point it's plain and simple that it requires little explanation. I had heard this bandied about down the years as being arguably Daniel Craig's best, though that is all that I knew about it.

What a film! I knew it was one of my favourites because I got goosebumps as soon as the credits rolled as I processed it and that only happens for the movies I adore. Going back to Craig, that man is superb in this, definitely one of the best performances of his that I've seen - up there with <em>'Knives Out'</em>. That's also saying something, given his other stellar stint as that spy geezer.

Michael Gambon is, though, the one I enjoyed most. I'm already a big fan of his, though here he is also a notch above; his voice is up is just so iconic. Away from Craig & Gambon, I lost track of all the known faces that appeared <em>*insert Rick Dalton meme here*</em>. Crazy to see Tom Hardy in this and that he's used the least of his whole crew! I also didn't even recognise Sally Hawkins, despite seeing her name in the opening credits!

Simply put: It's brilliantly entertaining! I loved every second, quite literally. It gave me exactly what I wanted from a British gangster flick, so many from this subgenre fail to correctly tow the line between the crime and comedic gangster elements so it can either be cringe or boring, or even both.

This, however, utterly nailed it for me. It also holds a pleasing score, you give me that, an entertaining plot and a fantastic cast then, I'm afraid, I am gonna love your movie. It does surpass (the great) <em>'Stardust'</em> as my standout Matthew Vaughn flick."

Today there is a clear shift and we aren't seeing that much of it, Nike hasn't changed their practices of out-sourcing and sweatshops and are now an iconic brand on one side of the divide. Outsourcing is now supported by the left where ""the jobs aren't coming back, deal with it"" is a commonly heard phrase there. It wasn't back in 2003.

So, watching it in 2003 as opposed to 2018 it's interesting to see a lot of the same faces that once opposed it speaking on the news in favor of how the corporations work today.

If memory serves, Noam Chomsky is the only political voice that hasn't made an abrupt shift or dialed it back in the decade plus since it's release.

Despite the shift in some of the voices heard in the documentary, it does do an excellent job tracking the evolution of the corporation in the United States, how it started in our earliest days, straight through how it became an individual entity politically, and onto how that identity as a ""person"" effected our politics.

And, at times, it was moving, given that it did treat people who work for corporations very well, even interviewing them so that they can express that, yes, they too had the same concerns as the people protesting them, but were bound by the law to pursue policies that would generate the most profit for their shareholders, which illustrates an interesting problem that is often ignored with discussing the topic.

It remains educational today, even if there has been a distinct shift on how the topic and some of the corporations highlighted are handled by the people interviewed for the documentary."

291.0,Riding Giants,Riding Giants is story about big wave surfers who have become heroes and legends in their sport. Directed by the skateboard guru Stacy Peralta.,,Documentary,105.0,2004-07-09,en,7.6,47.0,0.4673,"Jeff Clark, Darrick Doerner, Laird Hamilton, Dave Kalama, David H. Kalama Jr.",Stacy Peralta,"sea, surfing, surfer, surfboard, california, beach, ocean, wave, hawaii, sun, lifestyle, extreme sports, sports documentary","Well, you wonder, how dangerous could the ""graveyard"" be if Clark survived it solo for 15 years? Then word of Mavericks gets around, and legendary surfers from Hawaii's North Shore come to visit. One of the sport's champions, Mark Foo, is killed after wiping out on a medium wave. One theory is that the tether to his board got caught on rocks and he drowned. Another surfer thinks he felt or sensed somebody under the water who shouldn't have been there. Exactly one year later, during a memorial to Foo, another surfer is drowned.

The documentary ""Riding Giants"" shows surfers gathered to discuss and mourn the lost men. It does not show Jeff Clark during those previous 15 years because, of course, he was alone. And what a species of aloneness it was, to plunge into the cold ocean and swim out 45 minutes for a few seconds of exhilaration at the risk of your life. Clark and his kind live at the intersection of courage, madness, skill and obsession.

Consider Laird Hamilton, the current golden boy of the sport, who has cashed in with endorsement contracts, modeling assignments and magazine covers. But no, I am not comparing him unfavorably to Clark, because Hamilton is also a superb athlete and a driven man. Hanging around as a kid with Hawaii's big wave riders of the 1960s, he introduced his divorced mom to one of them, who became his stepfather and tutor; Laird grew up to become surfing's first superstar.

What Hamilton has done is go farther from land than any rider had thought to go, seeking ""remote offshore reefs capable of producing unimaginable waves."" At first this involved paddling two hours and then waiting up to two hours for a wave. Then Hamilton invents ""towing surfing,"" in which a jet ski tows him out to the far reefs, and slingshots him onto waves moving so fast it is impossible to access them any other way.

The jet ski driver's other job is to pick up Hamilton again after the ride, or be prepared to rescue him. The current thriller ""Open Water"" shows a couple lost at sea after being left behind on a scuba-diving tour. For Hamilton, being lost at sea is a possibility several times a day. ""Riding Giants"" was directed by Stacy Peralta, whose ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" (2002) documented the invention and culture of Southern California skateboarding. In both films his archival work is the key; he seems to have access to limitless historical footage, sometimes in home movie form; we see Hamilton at the dawn of towing surfing, when at first it was scorned and then embraced by the sport's champions.

In August 2000, Hamilton goes to Tahiti in search of a legendary wave so big it is ""a freak of hydroponics."" He finds it and rides it, and we see him precariously balanced on its terrifying immensity in what the movie calls ""the most significant ride in surfing history."" Other surfers, providing voiceover commentary, say the wave's characteristics were so different from ordinary waves that Hamilton had to improvise new techniques, some of them violating years of surfing theory and instinct, right there on the wave.

What a long time it seems since that summer of 1967, when I sat in a Chicago beer garden with the suntanned and cheerful Bruce Brown. He'd just made a documentary named ""The Endless Summer,"" and was touring the country with it, at the moment when surfing was exploding (there were 5,000 surfers in 1959, 2 million today). For Brown, surfing was a lark. With a $50,000 budget, he followed two surfers on an odyssey that led to Senegal, Ghana, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti and Hawaii. They were searching for the ""perfect wave,"" and found it off Durban, South Africa: ""A 4-foot curl that gave rides of 15 minutes and came in so steadily it looked like it was made by a machine.""

A 4-foot curl? Hamilton and his contemporaries challenge waves of 60 or 70 feet. ""The Endless Summer"" charts a world of beaches and babes, brews and Beach Boys songs, and surfers who live to ""get stoked."" In ""Riding Giants"" the sport is more like an endless winter -- solitary and dangerous. Even as Brown was making ""The Endless Summer,"" modern surfing was being invented by pioneers like Greg Noll of Hawaii, who ventured 15 miles up the coast from Honolulu to Waimea Bay. It was thought to be unsurfable; a surfer asks himself, ""can the human body survive the wipeout?"" It could. The discovery of the North Shore of Oahu, the movie says, ""was surfing's equivalent of Columbus discovering the New World.""

More vintage footage. The ""storm of the century"" descends upon Hawaii, and Noll, known as ""The Bull,"" determines to surf it. His chances of surviving are rated at 50/50 by the movie, at zero by any reasonable person watching it. He survived. It was ""the biggest wave ever ridden"" -- until, perhaps, the monster that Hamilton found off Tahiti, too big to be measured.

After Bruce Brown finds his Perfect Wave in ""The Endless Summer,"" he marvels: ""The odds against a wave like this are 20 million to one!"" The odds that Laird Hamilton could get stoked on a 4-foot curl are higher than that. Before seeing ""Riding Giants,"" my ideas about surfing were formed by the Gidget movies, ""The Endless Summer,"" the Beach Boys, Elvis and lots of TV commercials. ""Surfin' Safari"" was actually running through my head on the way into the screening.

""Riding Giants"" is about altogether another reality. The overarching fact about these surfers is the degree of their obsession. They live to ride, and grow depressed when there are no waves. They haunt the edge of the sea like the mariners Melville describes on the first pages of Moby Dick. They seek the rush of those moments when they balance on top of a wave's fury and feel themselves in precarious harmony with the ungovernable force of the ocean. They are cold and tired, battered by waves, thrown against rocks, visited by sharks, held under so long they believe they are drowning -- and over and over, year after year, they go back into the sea to do it again."

Released in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood, “Million Dollar Baby” stars Eastwood as a cantankerous boxing trainer who owns a working class gym in Los Angeles, which is maintained by one of his former boxers, the narrator of the story (Morgan Freeman). A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she’s too old at 32 and he “doesn’t train girls,” probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier. Eventually he begrudgingly agrees.

The bulk of the film is basically a female version of “Rocky” (1976), except that I prefer the potent drama in this one. The three main characters are well fleshed-out with an all-around reverent tone, not to mention an occasional bit of mild amusement. Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it’s touching.

The third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat. It departs from sports movie formula with a message that contradicts everything the first two acts pushed, which is inexplicable. Sure, I ‘get’ the point: A certain person basically sacrifices everything to do what’s (supposedly) best for the situation and honor the will of a dearly loved soul. Nevertheless, it’s a dark turn that leaves a sour taste because it refutes the positive message of the first two-thirds of the story.

The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.

GRADE: B-/C+ || Unreal! I didn't expect <em>'Million Dollar Baby'</em> to be so astonishingly brilliant.

I've said it many a time before but for full context, I do not read up about films before watching them - aside from making sure the film isn't part of a franchise, checking the run time and seeing the genre - so I was expecting this to be a cliché-filled, but still great, sports flick. It's so much more than that.

It's way more deeper and has an everlasting impact that I hadn't anticipated. Even across the opening chunk I was predicating the obvious cliché ending, but as the film progresses and, especially, as the final portion rolls around it just absorbed my total attention - I was fully engrossed... hook, line, and sinker. Some film!

The cast are simply stunning. Clint Eastwood gives an absolutely fantastic performance, Hilary Swank is truly sensational - especially at the end, damn - and Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman; what an actor and what a voice, using him as narrator was a great move. Elsewhere, and though less dramatically, Jay Baruchel, Anthony Mackie, Margo Martindale and Michael Peña also feature interestingly.

It's quite the journey the film takes you on, which I just found utterly enthralling to watch unfold. Perfect pacing, perfect acting. I loved watching every second of it and will undoubtedly be revisiting it.

I noted days ago that I was rather surprised to learn that Eastwood's <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/unforgiven/"" rel=""nofollow"">Unforgiven</a>'</em> had been so heavily acclaimed, on this occasion with this 2004 film I am the complete opposite. I don't care much for awards et al., but I am delighted to see all involved receive their props for this. Chapeau!

Marvellous, just marvellous. || **Million Dollar Baby is an extremely well-done film that takes an abrupt turn to deal with incredibly sobering subjects that are definitely not what I thought I signed up for.**

I know it’s supposedly a masterpiece, and I will lose some cred for saying this, but Million Dollar Baby was a dreadful movie. I spent the first half of the film falling in love with the hopeful, talented, and inspiring Maggie Fitzgerald and her redeeming of the cranky and lonely trainer, Frankie Dunn. But when the second half takes its giant turn, the story shifts from an endearing sports narrative about overcoming opposition and redemption to hopelessness and agony. Clint Eastwood directed a powerful story with impressive mastery, but the subject matter robbed the film of any enjoyment. For many, Million Dollar Baby deserved Best Picture at the Oscars. For me, I wish The Incredibles had claimed that victory."

Julia Winter probably taks the cake as the truly obnoxious ""Veruca Salt"" but Jordan Fry's ""Mike Teevee"" isn't too far behind. With Depp putting his heart and soul into his character, we incorporate some of Danny Elfman's more entertaining music into a journey of self discovery and millions of calories. It's a quickly paced, lively, enterprise with Tim Burton bringing his technicolour imagination alive for almost two hours. The most engaging effort has to come from Deep Roy who just oozes cheeky charisma as the Oompa-Loompa (well, quite a few of them) who does all the heavy lifting while the guy in the purple velvet takes the credit.

Great cast, fantastic music, beautiful storyline. Can't help but watch it over and over. The music just stays with you and haunts you for days after.

The Phantom just draws you in... this movie has everything going for it. It's a drama, comedy and romantic, and a great looking cast. The stage production was fabulous, it's so much better watching it on the big screen. 

The phantom being the villain, you just feel for him and his love for Christine. Not to mention that fact that he's so hot. That's something I wasn't expecting. I couldn't keep my eyes off him. 

The movie is stunning, the music absolutely superb. The cast WOW especially Gerard...what a hunk. 

I must say I bought the DVD, which had extras of the original phantom with the original stage cast. The movie I think is so much better. Gerard is superb, his emotional state was so believable. As were the rest of the cast. I still cry at the final scene.

Definitely a movie to watch and don't forget the tissue.

A wonderful love story. Andrew Lloyd Webber is a genius and I've fallen in love with Gerard.

(This was my only IMDB review and I pinched it back) || I was fortunate enough to see this on stage and this version holds up quite well, by comparison. Sure, some of the dialogue scenes are cheesy, almost Disney-esque, but the quality of the music is consistently high with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Charles Hart's wonderful music and lyrics delivered well by Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson - who is surprisingly engaging as ""Raoul"". It hasn't the impact nor menace of either the 1923 or 1943 iterations, the colour and glamour of the costumes and sets see to that; but that doesn't impact too negatively on the story of a young opera singer ""Christine"" who becomes the obsession of the murderous ""Phantom"" who lives in the sewers beneath the Opéra Populaire in Paris. Luckily, she has the dashing, chivalrous ""Vicomte de Chagny"" to keep her from her scarred pursuer. Minnie Driver is great as the ultimate diva ""Carlotta"", and Simon Callow and Ciarán Hinds as the sort of ""Stadler and Waldorf"" of theatre management create some light comical breathing space now and again from the continuous pace of this sumptuous drama. Miranda Richardson doesn't quite cut it as ""Madama Giry"", nor Jennifer Ellison as ""Meg"" - but all in all, Joel Schumacher has created a feast for the eyes that does some justice to Gaston Leroux' original story, and even more to the magnificent musical theatre adaptation from 1986 with rousing performances of ""Think of Me""; ""Music of the Night"" and the eponymous title track made famous by Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman to entertain us."

Released in 2004, ""The Woodsman"" tells the story of Walter (Kevin Bacon) who's trying to make a life for himself in Philadelphia after spending 12 years in prison due to his abnormal predilection for 10-12 year-old girls. When news gets out of why he was in prison it causes problems with his girlfriend (Kyra Sedgwick) and at his new job. Walter desperately seeks healing from his condition even while he occasionally flirts with his sick desires. On top of this is Walter's parole officer who doesn't believe the ex-con can be trusted in conventional society. Meanwhile Walter spots a pedophile preying on kids near the local elementary school. What should he do? And is there any hope for him to escape his condition?

There are two things potential viewers should know up front: Walter is aware of his problem and desires freedom from it. In other words, he's repentant: He WANTS to turn from his negative desires and channel his sexual energy positively and responsibly. Secondly, it becomes clear that Walter is not guilty of raping any girls but rather molesting them. Yes, it's still bad, but not as bad as raping or killing. These are important points which help the viewer have compassion on Walter and root for his success (because, if he was impenitent or guilty of actually raping or killing girls, then please fry his butt and get it over with; or, at least, lock him up and throw away the key).

As noted in the title blurb, the film is a dramatic psychological study. It spotlights the classic struggle of flesh & spirit or id & superego. It's dialogue-driven and plot-driven rather than action-driven or cgi-driven. In other words, this is a thinking-person's drama.

In a way, Walter's struggle is universal and most of us can relate to it on one level or another. For example, we may not have a predilection for tweenage girls but we might struggle with other destructive tendencies, like alcoholism, drugs, adultery, fits of rage, porn addiction, gluttony, sloth, depression, lying, etc. The film subtly makes it clear that without love & belief there's little hope of spiritual metamorphosis.

**MINOR SPOILER** (The next two paragraphs explore one of the main insights of the story and comments on one important scene).

One of the main points of the film is distinguishing a repentant pedophile from a non-repentant one. Walter has come to a place where he understands that his pedophile desires are of his flesh (id or destructive carnal nature) and should not be embraced, fed and acted upon (although, again, he flirts with the idea on a couple occasions). Walter KNOWS that to take advantage of young girls to get his jollies is wrong, and is trying to walk free of such desires. This is contrasted by the predatory pedophile who hangs out by the school preying on boys. This guy obviously embraces, feeds and acts on his pedophile desires. There's a big difference between these two. The attitude of the heart makes all the difference. Walter deserves a second chance because he's repentant and trying to change for the positive, even while he should be monitored closely. The other guy, on the other hand, has totally given himself over to his perverted desires and deserves the snot beat out of him.

One critic argues that it's not realistic that a 45 year-old guy sits on a bench in the park and a cute 11 year-old girl sits herself next to him and asks, ""How's the view?"" But, wait a second, Walter had previously met the girl so she was already familiar with him; he didn't hurt her before, why would he hurt her now? Besides, the girl comes from a dysfunctional home where she suffers molestation from her dad; hence, it's not likely that she has the best understanding and discretion concerning social situations, not to mention her inner need and compulsion for undefiled masculine love and attention. In addition, Walter was obviously drawn to and comfortable around girls, which helped make the girl feel safe around him.

Be sure to catch the deleted scene of Walter and Robin's discussion at the bench. The fuller version should never have been deleted; you'll see why when you compare the sequences.

Another criticism is that the film is melancholy and plays out in a flat manner. This is true but don't you think a bit o' melancholy fits the subject matter? As for the story being flat, the filmmakers (Nichole Kassell and Steven Fechter) were obviously shooting for realism. Isn't real life kind of flat? Personally I prefer realism over the goofiness, overkill action/cgi and generally unbelievable tone of many modern “blockbusters.”

Interesting tidbit: Kevin Bacon and co-star Kyra Sedgwick have been married since 1988 and have 2 children.

FINAL WORD: As long as you can handle the subject matter and a couple of cringe-inducing spots, ""The Woodsman"" is outstanding if you're in the mood for a serious drama or psychological study.

The film doesn’t overstay its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot on location in Philadelphia.

A poor, precocious 18 year-old woman (Scarlett Johansson) returns to New Orleans after the death of her estranged mother where she inherits a dilapidated house in the low-income section with two co-heir strangers: A quirky ex-English professor (John Travolta) and his wannabe-writer mentee (Gabriel Macht), both alcoholics in a foggy melancholy. As the story progresses, the truth is slowly revealed.

“A Love Song for Bobby Long” (2004) is a sluggish, sometimes humorous drama set in The Big Easy with lotsa poetry & prose, as well as jazz, blues and folk. It’s very literature-quoting in the manner of flicks like “Dead Poets Society” (1989), “Finding Forrester” (2000), “The Squid and the Whale” (2005) and numerous Woody Allen flicks.

While the story is lethargic and lacks the drive of “Dead Poets Society,” there’s something to be said for an intelligent American film that dares to take its time and is filled with verbiage that assumes the viewer is well-read. Plus the story perks up in the final act and cutie Johansson is always a pleasure.

The movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes and was shot in New Orleans & Gretna, Louisiana.

GRADE: B-/C+ || _It was the invisible people he wanted to live with. The one that we walk past every day. The ones we sometimes become. The ones in books who live only in someone's minds eye. He was a man who was destined to go through life and not around it. A man who was sure the shortest path to heaven was straight through hell._

_A Love Song for Bobby Long_ is a straight up masterpiece. This movie isn’t some action packed sci-fi movie or an emotionally draining drama. This movie is about the lives of two alcoholic failed academics, and a young woman destined for the same path. This movie is _about_ the dull, _for_ the dull. 

The unconditional love and hatred between the characters is both relatable and terrifying. I think I see myself in Pursy more than I’d like to admit. Her lack of motivation, longing for memories of the life she never had… She’s a beautiful character, and beautifully portrayed. 

Anyone who’s known me for more than 5 minutes knows that Scarlett Johansson might be my favourite person on the entire planet. She’s an amazing actor, comedian, entrepreneur, producer etc… Even though this might be one of her least popular movies, I think it’s one of her best. 

This movie really captures the lives, and emotions of unknown people. The people who blend into the background. The nobodies, the highschool drop outs who lives rent to rent. 

Family can be found, and it will be found even if you might not be looking for it. Even though their awkward relationship, these characters lived. They didn’t have some fake life like the influencers on social media. They _lived_."

A little girl (Dakota Fanning, even) narrates Darger's biographical facts, while excerpts from Darger's autobiography are reads by an old man (Larry Pine), and texts from his fantasy epic are read by some fellow with a radio play delivery. In addition, we find interviews with people who knew Darger. Kiyoko Lerner, his landlady and now the caretaker of his legacy, is of course featured, as are some of his neighbours and an altar boy from his church. While everyone reports him to be an odd fellow, Yu avoids the controversial issue of Darger's mental health, preserving the ambiguity of whether he was mad or a mere eccentric. Similarly, the relation of Darger's work to sexual frustrations or the possibility of sexual abuse as a child are left out. But this is a mere introduction, and it's reasonable to expect the viewer to move on to other sources for contentious matters. My only real complaint is that Yu is not always content to let Darger's paintings speak for themselves. Rather, she has animated certain of Darger's scenes, which I feel distorts the paintings to a degree. While I think the film does not deserve a one-star rating for this as another reviewer awarded it, it is troubling.

Nonetheless, all in all this is a fine presentation of a remarkable figure. And if Darger's intrigues you, I'd recommend also discovering Adolf Wolfli, a Swiss madman whose life and work resembles Darger in several years."

Watching Keaton as he unconvincingly stares at televised white noise for an hour and a half, which is essentially nothing, perfectly surmises the experience of Sax' supposedly supernatural horror. However, the biggest crime that the studio committed was releasing the feature on the first weekend of the year. Now, it's common knowledge that the initial start to the cinematic year typically begins with a disposable horror. Well, White Noise is to blame. Signalling untapped box office potential, despite the overt opinions of critics. And, as to be expected, matches the quality of a broken tape. A successful architect loses his wife to a drowning accident, to which he then encounters a psychic introducing him to the supernatural phenomenon of EVP.

Electronic Voice Phenomena. Y'know, recording background noise in a room, playing back the tape and flabbergasted when the ghost of ‪Michael Jackson‬ hauntingly sings ""Thriller"". Except in White Noise the tool that's used is, well, white noise. The annoyingly hypnotising static from televisions when no channel is picked up from the current frequency. Keaton becomes entranced by the ominous voices and high definition faces he sees within the six televisions he owns in his modern apartment. Who is making contact? Is it his wife? Malevolent entities trapped in the cubic prison that is a television? Pretty sure writer Johnson didn't even know himself.

The film is a mess. It's muddled, confused and abhorrently remains stagnant throughout. This architect, a father, essentially abandons his son when fixated on saving souls warned by his deceased wife that conveniently match the images in the white noise as soon as he arrives to any given scenario, despite ""Willow Avenue"" being mentioned days before. So think of it as 'Final Destination' meets 'Pulse' (original, obviously...). Except it's neither as entertaining as the former nor as horrifying as the latter.

Keaton looked bored as hell and overacted in times of emotional distress, although reassured the narrative with control. The jump scares were obnoxiously tame, yet admittedly one of the piercing noises made me twitch my body. The ending is...well, let's just not talk about it. It's terrible, with CGI ghost things swooping in on Batman, and answers no lingering questions that the mystery of EVP conjured up. Heck, the feature begins and concludes with onscreen text about ""existing"" occurrences. ""1 in 12 cases are dangerous"". Yeah. Ok. You know what is dangerous? Ruining Keaton's career. We had to wait a decade later for his rejuvenation!

White Noise admittedly has a decent enough premise, yet Sax' lack of direction accompanied by shoddy writing and lacklustre performances resulted in one film that had the similarities to white noise. Nothingness."

He is then called to serve his country and despite deep religious and moral objections to fighting becomes one of the most celebrated American heroes of WWI.,Missiles! Jets! Tanks! ... It's still the guy with guts and a gun who wins the war!,"War, Drama",134.0,1941-09-27,en,7.2,219.0,1.3966,"Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, Joan Leslie, George Tobias, Stanley Ridges","Howard Hawks, Alvin C. York","hero, world war i, patriotism, firearm, infantry, us army, conversion, conscientious objector, one man army, hillbilly, war hero, war propaganda","Just like a turkey shoot!  

Alvin York of Tennessee was a simple backwoods farm boy who liked a drink and a scrap, then one day, fuelled by drink and anger in his heart, an event gave him religion and a new found respect for life. However, the advent of World War 1, and his subsequent call to duty, tore his pacifist state of mind apart, torn between a patriotic sense of duty and his religious beliefs, Alvin York of Tennessee was to become the name on everyone's lips in 1918.

Sergeant York is pretty much close to being the perfect template for biography movies. It stands out (as it stands up proud) because the makers have the willingness to tell the tale from the humble beginnings of the central protagonist. They then ease it through to the end without feeling the need to rush there. Some allegations of it being a tad slow for its own good may well be valid, but for those of us who crave ultimate detail and flesh on the bones of main characters, well Sergeant York is a peerless joy. By the time that the critical point in York's life is realised, we the audience care so much because we have been party to his life story. From hard working farm boy to falling in love with Gracie, and onto his World War 1 heroics, Alvin York feels like one of us because of the work that all involved have done here.

Producer Jesse Lasky literally spent years trying to persuade the real life York into letting him film his story, the humble and modest Tennessean kept refusing until finally relenting with some conditions. One was that the proceeds go to charity (truly befitting the man that), two was that a non-smoking actress play his wife Gracie, and another that Gary Cooper play the title role!, well he got his wishes, and what a result it turned out to be. Cooper was initially against taking the job but soon relented after a meeting with York himself. Cooper then requested that Howard Hawks direct, which turned out to be the case - but only after the studio failed to attract Michael Curtiz, Henry Koster and a few other notable directors of the time.

As it turned out this was a perfect subject for Hawks, Alvin York boasting all the human traits in a man that Hawks admired, and with Gary Cooper operating on full tilt the resulting picture is a stirring emotive classic that never falls to gung-ho over bearing theatrics. In fact the critical war sequences here are wonderfully subtle. Backing Hawks up is the excellent Sol Polito, whose photography is precious - have a look at one scene as York sits on a cliff edge with his hound, contemplating his being in the war, it's shot in half silhouette and just gives me tingles on my spine.

Critics of the time were mixed on Sergeant York, and many people felt that the film was over propagandist in its aims?, well time has been kind to the film and personally I find the story, and the technical brilliance on show, to be truly remarkable. 10/10 || To summarize (which is quite a task, since this is a very detailed, comprehensive, and well-done biopic), Gary Cooper plays one of the greatest and most beloved heroes of the First World War: backwoods sharpshooter, Alvin C. York. Hailing from the Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf, somewhere in the Tennessee hills, he spent his youth drinking, carousing, and causing mischief and mayhem in general. All that changes one stormy night when a lightning bolt strikes his rifle, instead of him, and he turns from his rowdy ways and becomes a fine, upstanding Christian. When America becomes involved in WWI, he requests to be exempted from the draft as a conscientious objector. But his appeal is rejected and into the army he goes. As he serves his country, his eyes are opened to the reasons behind the conflict, and to the fact that it isn’t against God or the Bible to fight against evil. In a heroic act, he saves the lives of several men in his squadron and captures over 100 German prisoners.

There’s so much fascinating trivia behind this film which is so much more than your average war picture. It’s the story of a humble yet remarkable man’s life, and a good reminder that, as Alvin observes, “the Lord sure do move in mysterious ways.”

The real Alvin C. York was approached by producer Jesse Lasky several times, asking for permission to film the story of his life. York finally agreed on three conditions — first, that a share of the profits would go towards a Bible school York was trying to establish; second, that a non-smoking actress would play his wife Gracie; and third, that Gary Cooper play him!

At first, Cooper didn’t even want the role. Even if he did he was under contract to Samuel Goldwyn, who had no intention of releasing him. After York spoke to Cooper personally the latter agreed to take the part. A bargain was struck when Goldwyn agreed to lend out Cooper in exchange for Warner Brothers lending him Bette Davis for his production of The Little Foxes. Thus, everything worked out, everyone was happy, and two excellent films were made because of the exchange.

Not only were two great films made (both of which were nominated for Best Picture), but Gary Cooper won his first Oscar for Best Actor! In his acceptance speech he made the comment, “I’ve been in this business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these things.”

While films of this era were consistently clean and wholesome, and had a definite reverence for God, not as many could be called overtly “Christian.” Sergeant York is one of the few movies that definitely fits this category. The pivotal faith aspect of Alvin York’s story is handled well, mostly due to Cooper’s sensitive and sincere performance. Walter Brennan was an honest, upstanding man in his own life, and plays the local pastor who counsels Alvin. Brennan claimed to be religious in his personal life as well. He brings enthusiasm and warmth to his role, and received his fourth nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, the Oscar went to Donald Crisp for ""How Green Was My Valley.""

The scene in which York’s rifle is struck by lightning, causing his conversion, was an invention of the screenwriters. In reality, the steps leading to York’s conversion were longer and more drawn-out due to the efforts of his wife to help him clean up his act.

Ultimately, Sergeant York is a film that takes its time, with a running length of 2 hours and 14 minutes, but it’s time well spent. The production fares well under the expert direction of the masterful Howard Hawks, who received his only Best Director nomination for it.

It also contains one of the most gorgeous camera shots I’ve ever seen. York stands tall and proud on a rocky outcrop, surveying the Tennessee countryside, with his hound dog by his side. It’s shot in half-silhouette, and the imagery is both haunting and exhilarating.

After this recent Resurrection Sunday, when the focus is especially on faith and looking to a Savior, the following is an appropriate quote from the film with which to end this review.

“You see, I believe in the Bible and I’m a-believin’ that this here life we’re a-livin’ is something the Lord done give us and we got to be a-livin’ it the best we can…” || Alvin York (Gary Cooper) likes to work hard and play hard amidst the Tennessee backwoods, despite the warnings of the well meaning pastor (Walter Brennan) and the stoic observations of his mother (Margaret Wycherly). Then he starts to take a shine to local gal Gracie (Joan Leslie) and decides to put his hell-raising days behind him and settle down. That plan is thwarted by a love-rival but before he can go off the rails again something akin to a miracle occurs in the woods and next thing he has found and plans to keep God. In 1918, the USA finds itself finally drawn into the Great War and he hopes to be able to use his faith to avoid the draft. Not because he’s a coward, but because he thinks it’s an unpardonable sin to take a man’s life. Those pleas fall on deaf ears and so into a regiment he duly goes where pretty swiftly his prowess at sharp-shooting is noticed. He shuns promotion and insists to his commanding officer that he still wishes to be considered a conscientious objector - though he does agree to train his colleagues. Once deployed, however, how long can he stick to his principles before he realises that even those who founded his country had to compromise their beliefs for the good of the country? It’s based, loosely, on the life and times of a real man and I think Cooper might just turn in one of his most engaging efforts depicting him. It’s maybe a little episodic and it does take quite a long time to get to the sharp end, but once it does it plonks it’s tongue firmly in it’s cheek and strolls down ticker-taped boulevards celebrating a national hero and a man of humble beginnings and expectations via some fun with turkeys. Some effort has gone into the look of the production and with a each scenario of his life providing for extra ballast from the supporting cast, it’s a solidly speculative biopic."

Coach Carter is the inspiring true story of a coach that cared much more about the lives and future of his players than winning a game. Samuel Jackson was the perfect choice to play no-nonsense but compassionate Coach Ken Carter that believed in his players while holding them to standards that changed their lives. While the movie is about basketball, the focus is much more on the relationships and development of its characters. The actual basketball scenes of the movie are decent but less compelling than the rest of the story. Coach Carter is an excellent film for those that want to see how their choices and willingness to fight compromise can change the lives of others. || When the eponymous coach (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives at Richmond High School, he inherits a disparate group of guys who play basketball as they take life - casually with little responsibility. Their grades are low and so their futures unlikely to break the cycle of poverty and lack off opportunity. He decides to try and break that by insisting that they sign contracts before they can play. These require perfect attendance, no late-coming and grade averages that will ensure they graduate. There's resistance from the team and from their parents, but thanks to a bit of help from the principal (Denise Dowse) he sticks to his guns and they have to accept his ultimatum. The remainder of the film follows his attempts to mould something cohesive from these young men as they, themselves, deal with issues that impact on their own lives. Carter's dream is not a forgone conclusion here. Though there is an element of predictability to the development of the story, his charges do not routinely conform to his grand design and as he gradually builds a functioning (and winning) team, he also realises that their academic focus is what's lacking. That's his biggest challenge. They can't make a living playing ball, but it can be a conduit to an education that can stand them in good stead in the future - and that's the real message here. As with so many people growing up in an environment devoid of opportunity, sport can prove to galvanise people. It can offer hope, introduce the benefits of team building and inter-reliance and ultimately help to prioritise for what's to come. Jackson puts in a strong effort here, and the writing also helps succinctly tell a story that Rick Gonzalez, Rob Brown and Anton Tanner also contribute well to as they represent the men who just initially want to play with little appreciation of the profound chance being offered them. It is too long, and towards the end the story does rather run out of steam, but as a real-life coming of age story it still works well."

They are led my matriarch “Rosaria” (Katina Paxinou) from their roots in Italy’s south to find a new home in Milan. That’s because elder son “Vincenzo” (Spyros Fokas) has moved there to be with his girlfriend “Ginetta” (Claudia Cardinale). Almost immediately, there’s a bit of a lively inter-family squabble that sees the her and her other sons “Rocco” (Alain Delon), “Simone”, the more sensible “Ciro” (Max Cartier) and their much younger brother “Luca” (Rocco Vidolazzi) all struggling to make ends meet with “Vincenzo” doing what he can to assist. Jobs are hard to come by and so they all resort to milking the system to put a roof over their heads whilst “Ciro” gets a job and the others do what they can to raise some cash. The narrative is loosely compartmentalised with each brother getting a little bit of the storyline but increasingly they centre around the handsome but unreliable “Simone” who proves useful in the boxing ring and who starts to make some money and to date “Nadia” (Annie Girardot). She’s a lady of the night with whom he falls heavily for, but when she discovers that he his stealing to pay his way with her, she asks “Rocco” to return the gifts and moves to another town. Now “Rocco” receives his draft papers and having sent his last lire to his mother, bumps into “Nadia” and soon a romance of their own is bubbling. This one, though, is not based on supply and demand and when his brother discovers this news, he and his friends set up a scenario with heinous ramifications. With “Simone” now on quite an obviously self-destructive path, “Rocco” - himself now a distinguished boxer after his time in the army disgusted by his brother, and “Nadia” loathing just about everyone - including herself, things become more and more toxic for the “Parondi” family. It’s that toxicity that Luchino Visconti captures evocatively as this characterful story develops along lines that are anything but predictable. Sure there is vengeance, but it’s exercised in such a subtle and accumulating manner as to provide us with a denouement that proves entirely unsatisfactory but somehow entirely appropriate. It’s Salvatori who steals this for me, but Girardot also shines as does Paxinou as the epitome of the Italian mother whose character is largely responsible for some of the sparing but punchy histrionic humour that peppers this family drama. The setting of a nation still recovering from the ravages of war, with money tight and opportunities unevenly spread throughout the place tells us potently of the trials and tribulations of relocation and of fitting-in as much as anything else, and some of the monochrome photography contrasts just as strikingly their slum dwellings with the more beautiful architecture of Milan suggesting that even there, there are rags and riches stories to be told and perhaps even to anticipate too. As in so many stories, boxing is used effectively as not just a conduit for hope, but also one for hatred and ambition and it’s with this persona that Delon is at his most effective as his increasingly conflicted and decent “Rocco” finds life nigh on impossible. The final segment falls to the impressionable young “Luca” who might feel just a little short-changed, but who might also prove to be the one most affected and with the most to look forward to. It’s vibrant, angry, clever and possibly my favourite Visconti film and if you can sit for a few hours and watch it on a big screen, then it’s well worth the effort."

Kang-ho Song, Sang-kyung Kim and Roe-ha Kim don't exactly see eye to eye as they set about their task, adopting some scientific and not-so scientific approaches to their detection. The stylish and witty writing allows the characters to develop at a slow, but steady and interesting pace - using humour, pathos and violence - and at times it is the methods and attitudes of the police that appear under more scrutiny than the perpetrator of the crimes! Sadly, though, it does sag towards the end. The sharp pace of the writing and the intensity of the performances having reached a pretty high plateau, comes off the boil a bit and I found the ending annoyingly self-defeating: the identity of the criminal being less important to me than the collapsing integrity of those charged with his discovery. We never quite get back to that high standard of storytelling achieved in the first 90 minutes and as the quirkiness of the plot becomes more subsumed into the increasing frustrations of the investigators, the film becomes more and more a generic crime thriller losing much of its uniqueness. Certainly well worth watching, but perhaps it could have been shaved a bit to maintain the jeopardy."

Schygulla delivers powerfully as a woman who must think on her feet to put bread on the table and a roof (or at least part of one) over her head. She's not by nature ruthless but when needs must she realises that she can rely on nobody but herself. Fassbender cleverly uses the screenplay and the bombed-out city-scape to create characters that do illicit a degree of counterintuitive sympathy. In may ways, she is a victim but will she accept that status? Her society gradually becomes akin to the phoenix and the ashes, and her determination not to be left behind is emotively captured over the two hours we spend with her and some equally ill-equipped destitute German people gradually becoming just ein bischen optimistic. It doesn't address the post-war politics of directly, but there are a few more oblique comments to add a further elements of realism to this quite poignantly written drama that marries disaster, a little humour and a great deal of fortitude."

Le Trou (The Hole) is directed by Jacques Becker and adapted to screenplay by Becker, Jose Giovani and Jean Aurel from Giovani’s own novel. It stars Michel Constantin, Jean Keraudy, Philippe Leroy, Raymond Meunier, Marc Michel and Jean-Paul Coquelin. 

Jacques Becker’s last film before he would pass away shortly after the film’s completion, is a tightly wound prison procedural that deals in grim realism and claustrophobic sparsity. There’s no prison movie clichés here, there’s no sadistic prison staff, no Mr. Big who is in with the wardens and demands money with menace, and no rapists hovering about the place to seize by force and break the last inch of spirit of the victim, this is as pure and unfussily raw as it gets. 

Based on a real escape attempt at La Sante Prison in 1947, story has four men in a cell plotting to escape via digging a hole in their cell. When construction work within the prison means a number of prisoners have to be relocated, the four men are a bit perturbed to find they have another inmate thrust into their already overcrowded cell. While of course there’s the small matter of the escape attempt that’s planned, will they be able to trust the newcomer? Will he join in and help? Pertinent questions hang heavy in the sweaty air. 

Once Claude Gaspard (Michel) arrives in the cell, the narrative initially operates on a cat and mouse basis as the men sound out the newcomer. There’s no histrionics, no threats of violence, an enforcement of machismo to intimidate the new cellmate, just human interaction with viable concerns. Much of these passages pulse with atmosphere as the men talk in hushed tones, or just exchange glances, and then once an accord is reached, all parties are comfortable with each other, it’s time to put the escape plan into action. 

What follows is quite simply engrossing suspense as Becker deals in long takes of silence punctuated by animal strength as the men pound on concrete with metal. The camera stays static, filming as if in real time, the sound department ramp up the volume to splinter the ears. We observe as the men fashion devices to aid their escape and to remain undetected, some of it genius in its simplicity. And all the while there is the feeling of trust, a bond between the incarcerated males, where the two lead off men are entrusted to go out and beyond the bowels of the prison, working tirelessly in charting the course through a maze of murky masonry, and to then return back to “HQ” for some rest and updates of the progress… 

The use of non professional actors works brilliantly, adding further realism to the story, with one of them, Jean Keraudy, a bona fide prisoner from the actual event back in 1947. There’s no music here, it isn’t needed to emphasise or manipulate a scene, none more so with the denouement, a closure of some emotional magnitude, and once again it’s without histrionics, and once again it works brilliantly. 9/10 || This week's Noir of the Week is Le Trou (1960) directed by Jacques Becker. The film was called The Night Watch when released in the US in 1960.

The 2 ½ hour prison escape film, like Rififi, utilizes long, unbroken, often dialogue-free shots to dramatize the simple story of a group of prisoners attempting an ambitious escape from prison. Le Trou is shot in black and white and is totally without soundtrack music until the very end.

The film begins with one of the escapees, now outside the Santé Prison walls introducing the story. The film then flashes back to the Paris prison in 1947.

We’re then introduced to a young man Claude Gaspard. He’s put into a very small cell with four other inmates. There he meets the charming, always smiling Volsselin, nicknamed Monseigneur. Also in the cell are fellow inmates Roland Darbant, the man who introduced the film, Geo Cassid, and Manu Borelli.

The men work in their cell assembling cardboard boxes. Gaspard finds out that the men in his cell all eat well from care packages from the outside and all are close friends. What he doesn’t realize is that the men are working on escaping. While picking up a care package filled with bread, butter, saugage, smoked fish and rice pudding, the men discuss whether the should tell the new guy about their prison escape plans. They eventually take Gaspard into their confidence and being the long task of breaking the floor.

Slowly, in real time, the men chip away at the concrete floor that leads to a sewer tunnel.

The film lacks most prison film clichés. There are no sadistic prison guards, and all the prisoners seem like regular guys. Director Becker, who died shortly after the film was completed, used unprofessional actors including Jean Keraudy who was an actual participant in the escape attempt in 1947.

Given the film takes place in only three days, the sense of overwhelming tenacity shown by the prisoners is an astounding piece of filmmaking. The film has a number of memorable scenes, including the noisy breaking of the concrete floor with one of the bed legs –in real time- while another prisoner looks out the peep hole using a spy glass made from a tooth brush and a broken piece of mirror. Watching the scene draws you in an even makes you feel like a participant in the hacking, sawing and picking.

I won’t give away the ending or any of the interesting plot twists, but let’s just say there’s a heart-breaking double cross involved in a very un-Hollywood finish. Young Gaspard has to bear the brunt of an ironic plot-twist at the end. The film is a great prison escape film not to be mistaken for the French New Wave happening at the same time.

El Cid is the story of legendary Rodrigo Diaz who lifted his country with valour and integrity to drive the Moorish invaders from Spain.

I think the best thing I can say about this film is that even though it's nearly three hours long, I never once look at the clock. It's a thoroughly engaging picture that boasts all the great hallmarks of a sweeping historical epic. The colour, the costumes, the scope, and the attention to detail from director Anthony Mann are first rate, and par for the course is the suitably rousing score from Miklos Rozsa. Big square jawed bronzed beefcake Charlton Heston takes the lead role as Diaz, and firmly cements himself as the go to guy for gargantuan epics. Support comes in the form of Sophia Loren, Genevieve Page, Raf Vallone, John Fraser (excellent), and Gary Raymond (also excellent).

The story is an excellent one because Diaz was such a fine character from the annals of Spanish history, uniting the sulking Christian kings of Spain whilst simultaneously lifting the people of the streets off their knees and getting them to believe in the cause. However, it has to be said that this is far from the perfect historical epic movie, even allowing for the usual Hollywoodisation of facts, one can't quite get past the fact that El Cid comes across as a glamorised glory tale without any hindrances. Surely here in the 11th century El Cid's path would have been fraught and sodden with a great deal more death and destruction? There's a tameness where there should be serrated edges to the story and it takes away greatly from the film's end because the build up of Cid's heroism actually didn't contain a great deal of hard work - it was a stroll in the park so to speak.

Still, it's a wonderful film that ticks all the boxes for genre staples, and as churlish as I may be as regards the assumptive nature of El Cid's story being told here, I'm still the first to start cheering and thumping my chest as the credits role, and not even Sophia Loren's pout can distract me from the bravado warmth washing over me. 8/10 || _**Ranks with the best sword & sandal epics**_

In the latter half of the 11th Century when Spain consisted of Christian kingdoms and Moorish strongholds, Castilian knight Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (Charlton Heston) becomes known as ‘El Cid,’ meaning “the lord,” after generously showing mercy to a couple of Emirs, who orchestrated an attack on a Spanish city. This gets him accused of treason, but he proves his nobility, courage and skill to King Ferdinand (Ralph Truman) and his successors (Gary Raymond, John Fraser & Geneviève Page). Sophia Loren plays his romantic interest while Herbert Lom is on hand as a Berber general hell-bent on Islamic world domination. Raf Vallone appears as Rodrigo’s cunning rival for Jimena’s affections    

“El Cid” (1961) is curiously obscure compared to other classic sword & sandal epics, like “The Ten Commandments” (1956), “Ben-Hur” (1959) and “Spartacus” (1960), but it’s just as great and on par with the more modern “Troy” (2004), not to mention superior to the overrated “Braveheart” (1995) and “Gladiator” (2000). Even if you disagree with me on those last two films, “El Cid” stands well with any of these epics.

I knew enough about Rodrigo’s real-life story to know that the political intrigue gets convoluted and wondered if the movie could keep everything understandable and compelling for the course of three hours; and it does (unlike 2005’s “Kingdom of Heaven”). Just before the drama overstays its welcome a quality action scene manifests, Like Rodrigo’s thrilling duel with Jimena’s father. I also appreciated the subtext of dealing with flawed people in leadership positions and overcoming resentment to have effective working relationships.

For those who object to Heston being cast as a Spaniard, the Castilian aristocracy of the 11th Century was generally Visigothic in ethnic background, aka German. Despite the regular influx of people of color ever since, there are plenty of Blond Spaniards to this day, even redheads. (Remember, Spain is decidedly Europe and not Mexico).

The film runs 3 hour, 2 minutes, and was shot in Spain with studio stuff done in Rome.

GRADE: A || El Cid is “the story of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar [Charlton Heston] ... a simple man who became Spain's greatest hero. He rose above religious hatreds and appealed to all Spaniards, whether Christian or Moorish [not unlike how JCVD ​​befriended Jews and Muslims in The Order, in which Heston also appears], to confront a common enemy that threatened to destroy their land of Spain.” 

Rodrigo's unifying work is facilitated by the fact that Moors and Christians have a common language, although this lingua franca is not, as one would expect, Spanish but rather English — apparently the official language not only in the Iberian Peninsula but also in the rest of Europe, and North Africa.

I mention this because I can't help thinking that a lot must have been lost — and replaced — in the translation between El Cantar de Mío Cid and this film directed by Anthony Mann; then again, El Cid is not based on the Castilian epic but in the French tragicomedy Le Cid by Pierre Corneille (which explains — but does not justify — that Rodrigo's wife, played by Sophia Loren, is called Chimène and not Jimena). This is a big mistake.

The anonymous author of Mío Cid begins his poem in media res, with the exile of the Cid — a point that Mann takes almost two hours to reach, and even then practically in extremis. Everything that happens before this moment can be classified as excess foreplay.

Don Rodrigo, on his way to wed Doña Chimène (although in those days even a 27 year old Loren would have presumably been already considered an old spinster), rescues a Spanish village from an invading Moorish army. 

Two of the emirs, Al-Mu'tamin (Douglas Wilmer) of Zaragoza and Al-Kadir (Frank Thring) of Valencia, are captured. More interested in peace than revenge, Rodrigo escorts his prisoners to Vivar and frees them on the condition that they never again attack the lands of King Ferdinand of Castile (Ralph Truman).

For his act of mercy, Don Rodrigo is accused of treason by Count Ordóñez (Raf Vallone). At court, he’s further accused by Chimène's father, Count Gormaz (Andrew Cruickshank), the king's champion. Rodrigo's elderly father, Don Diego (Michael Hordern), calls Gormaz a liar. Gormaz slaps Don Diego, challenging him to a duel. In a private meeting, Rodrigo begs Gormaz to apologize to the elderly but proud Diego. Gormaz refuses repeatedly, so Rodrigo challenges him to a duel and kills him. Chimène witnesses Gormaz's death and swears to avenge him, renouncing her love for Rodrigo.

Here the writers really screwed the pooch; I know there was no way that Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren weren’t going to end up together, but how the script goes about it is nothing short of asinine: Rodrigo persuades the King to force Chimène to marry him as payment 'for services rendered.'

This approach is reminiscent of Richard III 'wooing' of Lady Anne, or even Henry Fonda’s treatment of Claudia Cardinale in Once Upon a Time in the West; the problem is that those two were the villains of their respective stories, while Rodrigo is supposed to be the hero of this one — and yet, despite everything, Chimène eventually, willingly accepts her status as a trophy wife, because what woman can resist her father’s murderer? Why they didn't just have Gormaz instigate the duel, and have Rodrigo kill him in self-defense, I’ll never understand."

It is, without question, undoubtedly worse than 1994's <em>'The Mask'</em> in every conceivable way though.

Jamie Kennedy's version of this Dark Horse Comics character is truly dreadful, especially visually, though thankfully the film doesn't actually give that much air time to Kennedy as The Mask; like, he's there but it's predominantly the dog and the son that get much of the screen time alongside Alan Cumming's Loki - to slightly better effect too, the way the kid is animated kinda nearly works... it doesn't, but almost.

4/10 is probably generous on my part, though there are far worse films out there that actually annoy me - <em>'Son of the Mask'</em> honestly doesn't. It kinda just exists and I'm almost nonplussed about it. || **A film made to make money off the success of its predecessor, but which has nothing to do with it.**

Anyone who saw the movie “The Mask” with Jim Carey, from 1994, cannot remain indifferent. It's one of those family comedies that marked the 90's and that strongly contributed to the meteoric rise of the comic actor's career. It was a film that, in my opinion, did not need a sequel, but that, if it came to exist, would have to have the same crew and a similar cast (that is, keeping, at least, Carey and some other actors). Unfortunately, this movie does everything it shouldn't have done.

In fact, any comparison between the first movie and this crap is pointless. It is not the first time that I see that there are sequels made to profit from great successes and that have virtually no connection with the preceding films. This is just one more example. Jim Carey was right not to want to associate himself with a project that failed at the outset, not least because most of the cast that associated with the film did not manage to take advantage of it beyond the financial inflow.

The film is clearly expensive and stupid. It had a high budget, which was invested in a range of CGI assets and massive and sometimes impressive visual effects, but everything else is lacking. And the film's biggest flaw couldn't be any other: the script is so amateurish and idiotic that it seems to have been written by ten-year-old children. Ideas are bad, there are a number of situations in which we feel that the public is being mocked, and our intelligence is being mocked too.

Another problem with this film is the total lack of humor. The movie was supposed to be funny and make us laugh, but we couldn't find anything funny. Much of what is shown was already done – and better – in the first film, and what has been introduced as new is a series of scatological or gross jokes that, I think, could have been cut. Even children's audiences might not be very interested in seeing this, if you think about it.

The cast does what they can, but they can't do much. Deep down, the actors end up being the least to blame for the fact that the film is rubbish. Alan Cumming turns out to be the best actor present and is the only one worth seeing work. He's an effective villain and his comedic streak is interesting, but totally wasted here. Bob Hoskins makes an appearance, but it is innocuous and adds nothing to the film. Jamie Kennedy is bad, he does a bad job, and surely he must be sorry he got into this movie. The rest is basically a bunch of extras, even when they have to talk."

Bunny Lake is Missing is directed by Otto Preminger and adapted to screenplay by John & Penelope Mortimer from the novel of the same name written by Marryam Modell (AKA: Evelyn Piper). It stars Laurence Olivier, Carol Lynley, Keir Dullea, Martita Hunt & Noel Coward. Music is by Paul Glass and cinematography by Denys N. Coop. 1960s Brit Pop combo The Zombies also feature in the film.

Ann Lake (Lynley) turns up at her daughter's school to collect her after her first day there, but nobody has any recollection of ever having seen the four year old...

It was a film that irked Otto Preminger, he was never happy with the finished product, this even after changing the ending from the one in the novel and relocating the story from New York to London. Yet time has been very kind to the film, after re-evaluations from auteurist critics the film has found a sturdy fan-base, giving it cult classic status and a reputation as a sleeper classic of its type. You feel that with its thematic links to Hitchcock's Psycho, Preminger wanted to make a film worthy of being in the same league as Hitch's classic. Certainly the marketing for the film lends one to think the makers wanted to be compared with it, that it of course isn't on a par with Psycho is a given, otherwise it would be more well known. But it's a damn fine picture, stitched together impeccably by Preminger, film holds attention and intrigue from Saul Bass' nifty opening credit sequence, right to the eerie denouement.

Here we go round the mulberry bush, The mulberry bush, The mulberry bush. Here we go round the mulberry bush on a cold and frosty morning.

With real London locations used and Coop's pin sharp black and white (shadowy) photography tight to the unsettling mood, story carries an air of psychological discord about it. The mystery element is strong, and this coupled with the edgy, near unhealthy, relationship between Ann and her brother Stephen (Dullea), makes for a ""shifting in your seat"" experience. Then there's the small matter of Noel Coward as Horatio Wilson, creepy landlord extraordinaire, he may not be in it for much, but the impression made creeps the flesh. Slotted into the tight narrative are scenes that the likes of Hitchcock, Welles and Kubrick would be proud of, where Preminger calls on his film noir know how to feverishly glide around a doll shop and track his actors as they cavort around a children's garden play area. All topped off by the supreme performance of Olivier as analytical Superintendent Newhouse, a man calm and versed in psychology, he is the perfect contrast to the hysteria and borderline mania that surrounds him. 

Is it Hitchcockian? As some critics have called it? Well yes it is, but not overtly so, it has closer links in tone and narrative thrust to under seen British thrillers like Don't Talk to Strange Men (1962) and Taste of Fear (1961). Is it flawless? No! Dullea is way too animated, some character reactions to situations are eyebrow-raising and Paul Glass' score is at times maddeningly wrong for the mood sequence it accompanies. But they are problems easily forgivably when taking the film as a whole. 8.5/10"

Written, directed, produced and starring Stephen Chow (Sing), Kung Fu Hustle is a remarkably breathless piece of work, the plot is threadbare for sure, but it really matters not, because Chow has fused the grand old genre staple punch up with balletic comedy, it's quite something to behold.

Petite Zoe Trilling stands out in the female cast as Normi, Coreen’s bestie, but she’s way underused. Sara Melson has a beefier role as the aforementioned Coreen, and is another highlight. Deborah Tucker is worth a mention as Dianne while Holly Marie Combs is decent as the main protagonist, but kinda meh. She would soon go on to television stardom with the series Charmed.

It is tightly cast and the scenarios - filmed just three years after the allies reduced much of the city to rubble are very poignant; the photography and sparing dialogue all lend well to the gently accumulating sense of desperation that culminates in tragedy.

A piano player in Los Angeles (Ted Wass) wants to make it big and so the devil (George Burns) offers to turn him from a Barry Manilow wannabe into a stud-ly Rick Springfield rock star. Will he stay with his wife (Roxanne Hart) and simple life as a struggling musician or give into temptation and the ‘success’ he craves?

“Oh, God! You Devil” (1984) was the third and final “Oh, God!” film. It’s superior to the sitcomy precursor from 1980 while the first half is just as good as the original 1977 film. Shortly after the midway point, though, it starts to lose its mojo and becomes a little tedious, but things perk up when ‘God’ (Burns) appears for a showdown with the devil. If you ignore the paranormal elements, it’s reminiscent of “The Rose” in ways (1979).

Lovely Roxanne Hart is a highlight in her brief role. Too bad it wasn’t bigger. Meanwhile Wass is surprisingly convincing as the Rick Springfield-like rocker.

The film cost $5,560,001 and made $21,538,850 in the USA alone in late 1984, which means it was a modest box office hit. Roger Ebert & Gene Siskel gave it a positive review, calling it ""charming"" and ""delightful"" ""with a wicked sense of humor.”  

The movie runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, with some scenes done in Las Vegas.

Divine inspiration returns Michelangelo to the mural, but his artistic vision clashes with the pope's demanding personality and threatens the success of the historic painting.",From the age of magnificence comes a new magnificence in motion pictures.,"Drama, History",138.0,1965-09-16,en,7.121,141.0,0.9542,"Charlton Heston, Rex Harrison, Diane Cilento, Harry Andrews, Alberto Lupo",Carol Reed,"epic, based on novel or book, vatican (holy see), pope, artist, painter, biography, michelangelo, 16th century, italian renaissance, sistine chapel","When will you make an end?

When I am finished!

And so it be that that is the often repeated exchange between Rex Harrison's Pope Julius II & Charlton Heston's Michelangelo, and thus we have the basis for the film version of Irving Stone's novel The Agony & The Ectasy. This is a fictionalised account of how Michelango came to paint his masterpiece on the roof of the Sistine chapel, focusing solely on the two main characters of the piece, The Agony & The Ectasy is a character and dialogue driven piece of work.

I'm not here to give you a history lesson on the Renaisssance painters or the background to Pope Julius II (The Warrior Pope) and his term of office, there are many well written comments on this site that revel in that side of things. I'm here purely as a lover of this film and to tell you that I do indeed love it regardless of the obvious historical failings. It spins a smashing story of two great men driven to distraction by each other on account of each respective man's blustery ego, both men seemingly failing to realise that what irks them so, does in fact flourish the soul. Thankfully the two lead actors here put up a special show to carry the film with ease, with both Heston & Harrison really getting their teeth into the roles to feed off of each other with quality results - with one scene having Michelangelo goad Julius off of his sick bed being particularly memorable.

The toil and time consuming lengths that Michelangelo went to finish the wondrous ceiling of the chapel is perfectly captured by the pacing from director Carol Reed, and it's within this mindset that I personally feel engrossed with the characters from beginning to end. Though it should be noted that the film is not without moments of humour, some scenes shaking you away from the men's battle of wills to bring dashes of levity. It's safe to say that one should avoid this film if they are after a searing costume drama infused with battles and death encompassing romances, this is purely for those after fine art, fine acting, and most of all, fine story telling. 8.5/10 || Depending on the version you see, this film starts with a gorgeously scored trip around some of the museums of Italy and of the Vatican allowing us to put the sheer magnificence of the talent of Michelangelo Buonarroti into context - and the volume and quality of that body of work, condensed into ten minutes or so, makes this worth watching just as a lesson in the history of art! The story is set during the Papacy of Julius II (Rex Harrison) the warlike, but artistically enlighted Pontiff who commissions and unwilling Charlton Heston to paint the ceiling of the rather run-down Sistine Chapel. Reluctantly, he sets about his task and over the years it takes to complete, Sir Carol Reed explores how their relationship might have evolved. Harrison is not good, there's no denying it - his performance is wooden and his delivery of an admittedly stilted script lacks any charisma. Heston, on the other hand, is better - though perhaps overly theatrical - as the angst-ridden artist who initially hates the idea of painting something 70 foot up in the air, but by the end is completely obsessed. Philip Dunne's screenplay is not his finest; it is wordy and thick - but it does manage to combine history and fiction in a fashion as to give us a glimpse of just how fragile Julius II' 10 year Pontificate was at the start of the 16th Century. Alex North lost out on the Oscar to Maurice Jarre's """"Dr. Zhivago"" score but otherwise would surely have scooped the prize as a sumptuous accompaniment to this better than average historical drama."

Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (AKA: Elevator to the Gallows/Lift to the Scaffold) is directed by Louis Malle and co-written by Malle, Roger Nimier and Noël Calef (novel). It stars Jeanne Moreau, Maurice Ronet, Georges Poujouly, Yori Bertin and Jean Wall. Music is by Miles Davis and cinematography by Henri Decaë. 

A little ole devil this one, a sly slow pacer that itches away at your skin. Rightly seen as a bridging movie between the classic film noir cycle and the nouvelle vague, Malle's movie is in truth straightforward on narrative terms. Julien Tavernier (Ronet) is going to kill husband of his lover, Florence Carala (Moreau), who also happens to be his boss, but upon executing the perfect murder, he, through his own absent mindedness, winds up stuck in a lift close to the crime scene. Outside Florence is frantically awaiting his arrival so as to begin their life together in earnest, but when a couple of young lovers steal Julien's car, Florence gets the wrong end of the stick and a sequence of events lead to Julien and Florence hitching that ride to the gallows. 

Simplicity of narrative be damned, Malle's movie is a classic case of that mattering not one jot. There is style to burn here, with bleak atmospherics dripping from every frame, and Miles Davis' sultry jazz music hovers over proceedings like a sleazy grim reaper. The ironic twists in the writing come straight off the bus to noirville, putting stings in the tale, the smart reverse of the norm finding Moreau (sensual) wandering the streets looking for her male lover, while elsewhere he's in isolation and a doppleganger murder scenario is cunningly being played out. Decaë's photography has a moody desperation about it that so fits the story, the use of natural light making fellow French film makers sit up and take notice. While the dialogue, and the caustic aside to arms dealings, ensures we know that Malle can be a sly old fox. He really should have done more noir like pictures. 

A film that convinces us that Julien and Florence are deeply in love and passionate about each other, and yet they never are once together in the whole movie! It's just one of the many wonderful things about Louis Malle's excellent picture.

It's one ridiculously memorable (or memorably ridiculous) scene after another, with just a couple highlights being Carole Lombard getting stabbed in the behind with a pincushion, and John Barrymore faking a fatal bullet wound in order to get her to sign another contract.  John Barrymore is unbelievably and hopelessly hammy, and I mean that in a very good way.  The film itself is so completely over the top, you will either love it wholeheartedly, or hate it with a passion.  I do hope it's the former. || I'm not quite sure what the title had to do with anything, but this is still an enjoyable opportunity for John Barrymore and Carole Lombard to have some theatrical games of cat and mouse with a bit of help from the long suffering Walter Connolly's ""Oliver"" and the permanently sozzled ""Owen"" (Roscoe Karns). Barrymore is the acclaimed impresario ""Jaffe"" who discovers the improbably named ""Mlldred Plotka"", re-christens her ""Lily Garland"" and - despite herself - decides to make her a star. Turns out he's not a bad judge of character, but as her star ascends the relationship between them sours. She takes up an offer to move to Hollywood and that leaves him in the lurch. A few flops later and he's desperate to get her back. Might a chance meeting on a train manage to reconcile them or are things just too far gone for that now? The writing really does allow Barrymore and Lombard to play to their strengths here providing loads of thespian dramatics and ham as the plot motors along for an hour and an half. There's a diverting little sub-plot featuring a poster boy with a difference (Etienne Girardot) before a clever little denouement that just has to raise a smile.

If you are looking for a film with a feel good ending then you've chosen the wrong trilogy. The ending of this one is a mixed bag. Who the bad guys and good guys are is a matter of opinion and you may change your view from the other two films. I personally feel this film was the weakest in the trilogy since there is a lot of focus on what goes on outside the cube and less focus on character development inside the cube.  It is still well worth watching.

42222.0,Julia,"At the behest of an old and dear friend, playwright Lillian Hellman undertakes a dangerous mission to smuggle funds into Nazi Germany.",The story of two women whose friendship suddenly became a matter of life and death.,"Drama, Romance, Thriller",117.0,1977-10-01,en,6.477,153.0,1.031,"Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Robards, Maximilian Schell, Hal Holbrook",Fred Zinnemann,"friends, playwright","""Julia"" and ""Lillian"" have been best friends since childhood. Even as time has passed, the two have stayed in touch and remained affectionate. The former (Vanessa Redgrave) has found herself in Germany in the 1930s and is determined to do what she can to thwart the rise of the Nazis - or, at least, to help those in their sights to flee. To that end, she contacts her playwright buddy (Lillian Hellman, who wrote the screenplay based on her own book and played here by Jane Fonda) asking her if she could help move a rather large sum of money into the country for her to fund her ever more dangerous activities. What now ensues has Fred Zinnemann direct a train journey that has just about everyone - especially Miss Fonda - on the edge of their seats. Passport checks, customs checks - we know where the money is, but can she make it through? It's this stage of the film that offers us the most jeopardy and is really quite enthralling. Thereafter, it falls a little into melodrama and the intensity diminishes somewhat. That said, though, this sees a convincing effort from Jane Fonda and an engaging supporting one from her neighbour and confidante ""Hammett"" (Jason Robards). Redgrave actually features quite sparingly - but her scenes do go some way to reminding us of just how brutal and ruthless the regime was - and of how safety was definitely at a premium for any detractors. Georges Delerue has written a score that complements the story well - one which has a powerful degree of authenticity to it at times. The film looks good, there is plenty of attention to the detail of the production design and though it peters out a little at the end, is certainly a truth worth watching. || The great filmmaker Fred Zinnemann, in the twilight of his career, proved he could still direct with the best of them. Jane Fonda plays writer Lillian Hellman. Hellman is living a quiet life with her lover, Dashiell Hammett (Jason Robards), as she tries to pound out a play. The duo are a perfect match- hard drinking, hard smoking; Hammett is Hellman's mentor and support. Through Hellman's memories, we see a different side. Hellman was once friends with Julia (Vanessa Redgrave), a passionate and lonely girl who was admired by Hellman. The two have physically lost touch over the years, but still remain close through letters. Finally, Lillian tries to contact Julia. Julia leads Lillian into some pre-World War II anti-Nazi intrigue which tests the bounds of their friendship.

The most interesting aspect of the film is Fonda's portrayal of Lillian Hellman. She does an excellent job of being bold and confident around Hammett, but turns into an almost child-like, stuttering woman around Julia, and when involved with Julia's plan to smuggle money into Berlin to help out the Jews. Fonda does not seem a likely choice, physically, but she does well. Redgrave won the Oscar deservedly, especially when her character is not onscreen much of the time, or lying in bed bandaged and unable to speak. Robards is good, as is Maximilian Schell in a tiny role as one of Julia's co-conspirators. The supporting cast also includes familiar faces like Hal Holbrook, John Glover- who was also in ""Annie Hall,"" that year's Best Picture Oscar winner, and Meryl Streep. Alvin Sargent's screenplay jumps back and forth in time, and Zinnemann keeps the viewer grounded. Every shot he makes is beautiful, the film looks very expensive, but there is a grittiness to the look that tells you Hellman's life was not all roses. ""Julia"" is a hard film to explain in one or two sentences. It concerns friendship, loss, sorrow, war, and chain smoking. It is one of the most underrated films of the 1970's, and my pick for the second best film of 1977 right after ""Star Wars""."

I've been a big Michelle Trachtenberg fan since ""Harriett the Spy"", and I'm a nerd for science so mixing the two together makes a minimal good watch for me: it would have been hard for them to ruin this for me.

The premise feels weak as it's a ""coming of age"" story with a focus in the physics of figurine skating, but the execution is wonderful.  Kim Cattrall, Hayden Panettiere and the other skaters all embody the insanity of the ice skating culture and establish the world that Michelle Tratchenburg and Joan Cusack's characters are forced to deal with.

In the end it becomes a story of passions (clearly stated in the movie) and really feels uplifting and inspiring despite the absurdity of the situations.

I know that when I throw this on, I'm going to enjoy a movie. || <em>'Ice Princess'</em> is good. Nothing more, nothing less.

There are enjoyable performances from Michelle Trachtenberg (Casey), Hayden Panettiere (Gen), Kim Cattrall (Tina) and Joan Cusack (Joan - creative!). Even if the latter two's characters are irritating at times, but that is intentional to be fair. There's also an appearance for Erik King, which I guess you could say was a ""Surprise!"" ...

Props are in order for Christophe Beck, who I thought did a top job with the music - all of which suited events very well. The premise, which entails figure skating, is entertaining enough to see unfold. It's nothing special, but is certainly a harmless and fine production from 2005. || Ice Princess is a fun, lighthearted movie with a simple but engaging plot. It follows a classic underdog story, making it easy to root for the main character. While the storyline isn’t groundbreaking, it works well for a family-friendly film, keeping things straightforward without unnecessary drama. The directing is solid, balancing the emotional moments with the sports aspects, and the pacing keeps things moving without dragging. The cinematography captures the elegance of figure skating, making the performances visually appealing, even if some scenes feel a bit predictable.

Michelle Trachtenberg delivers a strong performance, carrying the movie with ease. She makes the character relatable, and her acting adds depth to the story. The supporting cast does a good job as well, though no one really steals the spotlight from her. The script is decent, with natural dialogue that fits the tone of the film. The music and sound design complement the skating sequences, adding energy where needed. Overall, it is an enjoyable and well-put-together movie that makes for a great watch, especially for a casual family night. Michelle Trachtenberg's presence, both on and off screen, was exceptional. She will be deeply missed."

I enjoyed _Miss Congeniality_, despite the various issues and problematic points I talked about in my review of that film, and I hoped that, at least, this sequel (which is far from being the second part of a bigger film, like Sandra Bullock said she faced all this) would be able to match the original film. Let's be fair, it had everything to achieve this: in addition to keeping the same protagonist and having a script that linked directly to its predecessor, the film kept part of the original crew and cast. Well, I'm sorry, but I feel that those expectations were disappointed: the film is not so bad, but it is below what I expected to find.

The problem starts with the script: it's a very underdeveloped and basic story, despite starting from a promising initial premise. Marc Lawrence, who has worked on the previous film, just couldn't do any better. If the first film was guided by the exaggeration of the story, this one proved to be predictable and has ideas that simply don't work, such as seeing two federal agents, posted outside their area of ​​origin, and who have the luxury of disobeying blatantly to superior orders without this earning them an immediate suspension and the handing over of their weapons and badges. What the movie does is almost make fun of the FBI (well, sometimes they deserve it). Another problem is the melodrama that the protagonist lives after the end of her romance, which started in the previous film. This is irritating enough to prevent us from sympathizing more with the character, who is saved ""in extremis"" by the baggage of previously acquired sympathy.

Sandra Bullock is, frankly, the best asset present in this film. She was not only the producer but also the protagonist and, once again, she offers us a job well done, full of commitment, charm and charisma. Regina King also does quite well as a tough federal agent with anger management issues. The collaboration between both actresses is excellent, and the scenes they both star in are among the best in the film, particularly when they don't understand each other. Heather Burns and William Shatner also return for this film, in their respective roles, but the truth is that they have little to do and don't particularly stand out, apart from the demerit of other actors. Treat Williams tries but fails to do much more than he does, Diedrich Bader is very irritating in the role of a brazen homosexual with cross-dressing aspirations, and the two villains are never credible or exude any sense of real threat.

On a technical level, the film is on average, and that can be evaluated by the cinematography, editing and choice of sets or visual and sound effects. It's not a film where the production has invested a lot in technical issues. The soundtrack also leaves a lot to be desired and doesn't bring any theme or song that stays in the ear. The film's pace is slower than would be desirable, but I wonder if the plot, so confused and disordered, would perhaps allow the adoption of a faster pace without a significant loss of the intelligibility of the story. The humor is quite clever at times, but it barely strays from the conventional family sitcom jokes, puns, wordplay and physical humor (nothing against it, it's humor more suited to a family movie, and I recognize that). The costumes have some interesting ideas, but they don't go beyond what was expected to find."

When a patrol cop is shot and killed, small time crook Frank Wiecek is tried for the crime and promptly sentenced to life imprisonment. Some 11 years on, tough cookie reporter P.J. McNeal gets involved with the case, the further he delves, the more he believes that Wiecek is innocent, but can he find evidence to back up his belief?

Filmed in semi-documentary style by director Henry Hathaway, this James Stewart led noir thriller oozes realism from start to finish. It's actually the lack of gloss and glamour that is the film's trump card. Based on the real story of the Joe Majczek case in 1933, it's filmed perfectly on location in Chicago {where the actual events happened}, gloriously mood emphasised by Joe MacDonald's superb black & white cinematography, and scored with tonal adroitness by Alfred Newman. As intrepid Chicago Times reporter McNeal (based on real reporter Jim McGuire who was a Pulitzer Prize winner for his investigative efforts on this case), James Stewart lays down a marker for the more edgier character roles that would follow for him in the 50s. Here he plays it perfect as McNeal shifts from mere cynical newsman to an outright crusader of justice; and it's riding along with McNeal that this human interest piece lifts itself to great crime thriller heights. Along the way we find problems are encountered and police procedural techniques are scrutinised. All may not be as it first seemed, and this mysterious element ices what was already a delightful docu-drama based cake.

There is not much else to say, it's a film I personally highly recommend, a fascinating story that is given top care and attention from all involved, mean, moody and yes, magnificent. 8/10 || James Stewart and Lee J. Cobb are both on top form in this crime thriller. The latter, the boss who sends the former, one of his better reporters, to investigate the case of convicted murderer ""Frank Wiecek"" (Richard Conte) after his mother puts an ad in a newspaper offering $5000 for information that might cast doubt on the voracity of the verdict. Initially sceptical, ""McNeal"", soon begins to suspect that perhaps the conviction - based solely on the testament of a long lost witness ""Wanda Skutnik"" - might be flawed. Now, he has to deal with understandable hostility from the Chicago PD as well as manage the hopeful optimism of the man's mother as his search involves some risk to himself, the gut instinct innate to a good journalist and the innovative use of state of the art technology (for the 1940s) to try and get the evidence to enable a pardon board to reverse the sentence. Aside from a slightly over-bearing narrator, Henry Hathaway manages to build the tension and keep it going well for a strong last hour of the picture with a lovely, grittily jazzy score from Alfred Newman. Not seen very often nowadays, but if you get a chance - it's well worth two hours of anyone's time."

They bluff store owner Felix into letting them repair his roof, from here they plan to execute their robbery, but the more that the escapees observe this family, the more they find humane personas coming from within.

Humphrey Bogart, Aldo Ray and Peter Ustinov take up the task of playing our villains who find hearts, where backed up with witty dialogue amongst the very tidily scripted piece, the result is a hugely enjoyable picture for all the family to enjoy. The film mostly works because of the interplay between Ustinov & Bogart, Ustinov's Jules is a softly spoken gentile sort of man and this oddly works well against Bogart's Joseph who is gruff and oozing toughness, this of course sets us up for some delightful scenes that leave a lasting impression. Witness Bogart in a pink apron!

Aldo Ray, perhaps not unsurprisingly, seems a touch out of place and looks swamped by the acting talent either side of him, but he does what is needed and his characters' pet snake, Adolphe, is the crucial meat in this films sandwich. Sadly Basil Rathbone is wasted by being reduced to what amounts to little more than a walk on villain part, but a great bonus is Leo G. Carroll as the hapless Felix Ducotel, charmingly oblivious to what is around him, Carroll gets the audience on board with a smashingly effective turn.

Three grizzled stories from Basin City comprise the basis for Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels (Miller along for co-directing duties as well). Man mountain Marv is out to avenge a murdered hooker, Dwight attempts to help the red light girls stay independent from the mob, and aging cop Hartigan is trying to protect a beautiful dancer from a sadistic pervert.

I think the first thing I should say is that I have no frame of reference as regards the adaptation here, I have never read (or seen) a Frank Miller story, but from what I can gather from the IMDb site is that fans of Miller's graphic stories were well pleased with the final result. I'm pleased to see that, because too many times comic book adaptations are roundly panned by the hard core fan base of each respective franchise for not being close to the spirit of the source, so here I'm doubly relieved mainly because I find Sin City to be a majestic assault on the senses.

Sin City is a stark place, full of seedy residents thriving on misery and mistrust, and here we are privy to three stories that only serve to remind us that we don't want to be anywhere near the place. Playing out as some sort of horror comic noir, Sin City is for sure a very violent picture, yet the violence is formed so perfectly in its style, it cloaks the film in artistic class. Once viewed, Sin City is never forgotten, and I for one literally do tip my hat towards Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez for bringing such a great and interesting movie to the masses. All of the cast do great work, so I'll not single anyone out for praise, the techniques and the whole structure of the piece is quite simply marvellous, and as for the writing?

I'm not aware of Matthew McConaughey or Steve Zahn being big action stars, but they surprisingly manage to handle their own, even if it isn't always believeable.  Rainn Wilson and Penelope Cruz get in on the action as well....if that helps.

The premise is a little interesting: they're looking for a U.S. Confederate boat in Africa.  Because it's not interesting enough on it's own, Penelope Cruz is a doctor trying to stop a plague coming from a war-torn country.  It all feels a like ridiculously improbable things happening in a world that is far too realistic rather than a world created of fiction that houses an incredible story.

It's fine to watch, but there has to be something else that you can watch that is likely going to be better. || Words like ""Literary work"" and ""Clive Cussler"" really shouldn't be in the same sentence.

Hey...chill...I love Clive Cussler, I honestly do. In fact I'll put him in the same league as Elmore Leonard and Louis L'Amour and I will put them in the same league as Dumas and Doyle.

They all write pulp fiction, adventure, crime, mystery, horror, whatever, they all fall under the title ""pulp"" and I can admit that I eat them whole, without swallowing...

...and without the need to call them ""Literary"" in an effort to save face.

I have the academic degrees somewhere in a box, the intellectual prowess, and a library with enough classics and heady works of history and philosophy to be able to openly display writers like Chris Claremont, Marv Wolfman, and Timothy Zane to not have to call his work ""Literature."" I will however call it ""Adventure"" I will call it ""Fun"" and what should be most important to any writer or film maker...""Entertaining."" It doesn't have to follow the book. Jackie Brown was a far cry from Rum punch and they were both a lot of fun to watch and read.

So Sahara isn't like the novel.

You can usually find a lot of room within these sub-genres for imaginative examples. They can be wildly different. Romantic Comedies seem to have less leeway. You have a formula that is often used, with minor changes here and there. The characters usually seem to have little in common at first glance, one of the characters usually gets sidetracked by another love interest (in Fever Pitch the love interest is the Boston Red Sox), there is a breakup where one or both becomes miserable, and the one who is ""at fault"" usually has to make a grand gesture at the end to mend the split. And of course there are jokes and romance.

I think Fever Pitch is an excellent example of the genre. The two main characters are witty and charming and provide a lot of laughs. They are caring people and there is  great chemistry between them. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it (though perhaps Yankee fans should steer clear), but like with most romantic comedies, you might want to set your cynicism aside for the duration, especially if you are a guy watching it with your favorite lady. If she is okay with the sports theme, you can let the romantic moments wash over you.

This is one of those rare movies that when it comes on, no matter what place it is in the film, I am apt to settle in and watch it."

This was a masterpiece. I could talk all day about how excellent the two stars must have been, in order to completely subvert every preconception we have come to associate with their on-screen romantic partnership (namely, Loren portraying a shy, put-upon mother of six, and Mastroianni playing a suicidal gay man) AND so convincingly. As well, I heartily recommend viewers to watch all of the extras on The Criterion Collection's recent release--I loved Scola's statement (and I paraphrase): 'Humour is as much a part of life as everything else--If a writer has a chance to put a comedic incident in a realistic drama, he has a moral obligation to do so.' I will remember that--and hopefully utilize it in my own work, should I ever be so gifted as to work in the field that I love--for the rest of my days.

I am surprised that it wasn't mentioned in any of the extras that Mastroianni was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance here. That is extremely rare for a foreign-language film, and should instantly be a clue to you of the film's quality. In Loren's June 2015 interview, she stated it was her best work other than her Oscar-winning acting in 'Two Women'. She's absolutely spot-on--and still looking gorgeous today. Definitely worth a purchase and rewatching. It's one of the most poignant observations of loneliness I have yet seen. When Loren's Antonietta says to Mastroianni's Gabriele 'I love you just as you are', it really doesn't matter what eventually happens to either party--Gabriele has found unconditional love. There is truly nothing else worth having, not even life. It should have been called 'A Very Special Day', for it most certainly is, especially for the cinephile who watches it, even now. And I wouldn't be the least surprised if the film's re-release starts a surge of interest in scrapbooking, as Antonietta was so good at it, charting in an obsessive fashion the doings of her beloved Il Duce. || The first fifteen minutes or so of this film consists of a mini-documentary setting the scene as Adolf Hitler makes the train journey from Germany to meet with King Vittorio Emanuele III and Benito Mussolini in Rome to seal this friendship pact in 1938. The extensive archive footage is overlaid with a propagandist style of commentary that would have entirely fitted the cinema screenings at the time extolling the might of the Italian Empire and their new, invincible, allies. It's a grand celebration in Rome that the family of ""Antonietta"" (Sophia Loren) are to attend. Her husband ""Emanuele"" (John Vernon) takes their six children to the party whilst she remains at home attending to her chores. It's while they are away that she encounters her neighbour ""Gabriele"" (Marcello Mastroianni). Until recently he was an announcer on state radio but no longer. An intense few hours, and a mynah bird with a mind of it's own, sees us introduced in more depth to both characters and to discover why he is no longer on air, not at the parade and why she is less than contented with her drudge of a life. It's the intensity of the hour or so we spend in this couple's company that challenges many stereotypes of expected and tolerable behaviour in the 1930s - and not just in Italy either. The scripting is poignant and delivered sometimes calmly and then as if all hell were breaking lose - and Loren is on great form exploding the exasperation of ""Antonietta"" all over their apartment. The conclusion is to be expected - on just about every front - but as the audio continually reminds us of what the rest of the population are up to, the intimate story of these two, flawed, people is well told."

Over the years, our traveller is drafted into service for his country during the Great War, he serves at Verdun, but still comes back to visit his ageing mentor whose efforts are now, quite literally, bearing fruit. Their conversation is sparse, but there is a bond developing between these two men that unfolds generously here amidst some fantastic drawings of nature at it’s harshest and most bountiful whilst mankind’s weapons of war do their worst elsewhere. These pictures move effortlessly, as if blown along by the ever-present winds atop his mountains, with colours and shades, fine and broad definitions on the strokes of the artwork and supported by a gently engaging Normand Roger score that serves to enliven the already delicate imagery. Over the course of his lifetime, Bouffier established a forest that stretched for over thirty square kilometres and by the time of his death in 1947, this abandoned and broken landscape had become a national park and home to thousands of industrious creatures - including mankind. It’s message of being synergetic with nature, of being patient and of being satisfied is potently delivered for half an hour that makes for compelling viewing."

An adaptation of a short story by Vladimir Bogomolov set in World War&nbsp;II, its protagonist is a 12-year-old orphan (Nikolai Burlyaev) on the Eastern Front whose small size allows him to scout German positions undetected. Ivan's missions have been useful to the army, but officers Lt. Col. Gryaznov (Nikolai Grinko), Capt. Kholin (Valentin Zubkov) and Lt. Galtsev (Evgeny Zharikov) would like very much to send him to a military academy to get him away from the front, especially as the final offensive against the Germans is imminent.

The action in the film plays out between two of Ivan's ventures across the river Dniepr into German-held territory. It depicts the difficult life of the soldiers at the front and the destruction that war brought to the Soviet village whose damaged buildings now host the army. Ivan's back story is revealed elliptically through comments among the soldiers, dream sequences or flashbacks. A subplot involves Kholin's disturbing attempts to seduce Nurse Masha (Valentina Malyavina) and, in stark contrast to earlier Soviet treatments of the war, suggest that in wartime one's own fellow soldiers can just as dangerous as the enemy.

As far as Tarkovsky films go, <i>Ivan’s Childhood</i> is still an immature work. You'll find nothing of the slow, almost ritualistic pacing that marks his later films, and this comes in at a compact 90 minutes. Still, a few shots (tracking shots of a wall, Ivan flipping through a book of religious art) seem like mature Tarkovsky in embryo, and the prominent use of religious iconography (crosses, fresco) is already here. Vadim Yusov's cinematography is memorable, with its several ""layers"" of view in certain shots, and the prominent framing of shots with broken timber beams that seem to hinder the characters. I was however very disappointed that at the end, the film segues into basically a Soviet anti-German propaganda film, complete with archival footage of the Soviet capture of Berlin. It is like some completely different filmmaker took over."

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._ || _A Trip to the Moon_ (1902), initially titled in French as _Le Voyage dans la Lune_, is director Georges Méliès' most famous film out of the more than 500 films he made. He stars as Professor Barbenfouillis, who, along with several other astronomers, boards a bullet-shaped spacecraft fired from a long cannon onto the moon's surface. Once there, the astronauts explore the moon, sleep under the open stars, and after a snowstorm, they flee into a cavern where they discover moon inhabitants (called Selenites after the Greek goddess of the moon, Selene). After being attacked, the astronauts return to their spaceship and fall from the moon back to the Earth, where they are welcomed as heroes. 

There are multiple versions of this film, both in black & white and hand-colored versions. The 2010 ""restored"" version of this film is colorized, and it features a modern-day score by the French musical group, Air (with members Nicolas Godin, Nicolas Godin, Jean-Benoît Dunckel, Jean-Benoît Dunckel). This version is a surreal, psychedelic acid trip (which has a long-lost parade scene at the end of the film). The black & white versions, with traditional string scores (and often narration), are easier to watch.

This film gets 3.5 stars mostly because it was the earliest science fiction film and the earliest film containing animation which I have seen. || There is something almost Arthurian about the opening to this short feature as an ensemble of astronomers gather complete with pointy hats and telescopes. Why? Well they are discussing the likely prospects of a trip to the moon. As you might expect, the conversation gets a little heated but eventually we see the familiar shape of a space module under construction - again amidst considerable discord, though by now we have reverted to ordinary attire. To grand ceremony, their ship is loaded into an enormous gun and they are blasted into space... This is good fun, especially once they have got off the ground and the crew are seen wandering around the moon as if it were the Bois de Boulogne on a sunny Sunday. The sets are of course basic, but given it was shot in 1902 they are still effective as the crew settle down for a nice night's sleep under the eyes of the gods. A spate of what looks like snow forces them underground where they enter a Vernean style environment with huge mushrooms and what I can only describe as a lunar equivalent of ""Ben Gunn"" before discovering that there is life on the moon after all and it's none too friendly - forcing them to beat a rather hasty retreat. Science this is not, not even remotely, but it's really quite an entertaining film with plenty of movement, acrobatics and even the odd visual effect."

The now injured ""Sotnikov"" has a proud and determined stoicism that he's prepared to take to the grave; his friend is a touch more pragmatic than him but both have consciences to wrestle with about not just their own lives, but those of others caught up in their fight for freedom. There's something very striking about Plotnikov here - it reminded me in many ways of Jeffrey Hunter in ""King of Kings"" (1961) - those piercing eyes and an almost celestial bearing as the photography focussed on a face that seemed to be able to project itself as a vision of something holy, better, virtuous. Indeed, the last twenty minutes or so have something of the Calgary to them that resonate really quite poignantly. The supporting cast, and a really quite provocative effort from Gostyukhin, also add a layer of characterful richness to a tale that questions just what people might be prepared to do to preserve their own, and/or other, lives. Is it braver to die for the cause or to compromise, maybe even collaborate, survive and fight another day? It's a cold film from start to finish and well worth a watch."

A young couple with three children buys an old, large house on Long Island in 1975. The house has a diabolic history, but they purchase it anyway because it's such a great deal. Will they make it out alive? 

I didn’t have high hopes for ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005) because I'm not a fan of haunted house movies and thus had not yet seen the original version. But I decided to give it a try due to Melissa George. The movie maintains a serious tone throughout and did not disappoint; it successfully piqued my interest in the whole Amityville Horror legend, which you can read about on the internet.

Some may accuse the film of ripping off aspects of ""The Shining"" (1980), but keep in mind that the original movie was released a year before ""The Shining"" while the books they were based on were both published in 1977. The difference is that “The Amityville Horror” was inspired by supposedly true events whereas Stephen King’s novel was purely fictional.

Of course this remake inspired me to see the classic version from 1979 with James Brolin and Margot Kidder. What I like about that one is that it takes its time to develop the characters in what is essentially a realistic drama topped off with creepy paranormal happenings. It addresses dark, ugly stuff but it actually has a warm heart (recall what George does in the final scene). This brisk 2005 remake is like the Reader’s Digest version, unsurprisingly upping the ante with the (clichéd) horror elements; it thankfully offers interesting details on the backstory of the house. I think they’re both worth checking out. If you prefer longer with more depth you’ll favor the original version whereas if you want something faster and more modern you’ll appreciate this one. 

Melissa George is a gorgeous woman and I enjoy watching her. Also on hand on the feminine front is Rachel Nichols, who played Tamara in the 2011 redo of ""Conan the Barbarian."" Rachel plays a hippie chick babysitter and she's perfect for the role. The babysitter is haughty and scoffs at the diabolic history of the house but let's just say she leaves as a true believer. This was a great sequence that perked my interest at a time it needed it (as I was starting to get bored by that point). In any event, I had to reassess my appraisal of Ms. Nichols after seeing her in this film as she won my appreciation. Meanwhile Chloë Grace Moretz plays the little girl; she was only 7 when the film was shot.

Ryan Reynolds as the husband is fine, but he seems TOO in-shape for the role. However, I'm sure the ladies appreciate it.

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot at Silver Lake and Salem, Wisconsin, with other parts filmed in the Chicago area of Illinois.

I found the storytelling to be inconsistently paced, and there was nearly no depth to the description of actually how the fraud was perpetrated. The tie-in to California was interesting and I appreciated all of the primary content they were able to use -- company videos, recordings, etc. Still, I don't think I'd recommend this to a modern viewer. || From the start the documentary makes it clear that it's a hit-piece. It has a clear agenda it's pushing and the film makers don't hold back on telling the public that, yes, Enron was evil.

However, honestly, despite that it was pretty fair. It actually made more of a point to detail how Enron got to the place that brought convictions rather than doing a straight hit-piece on the corporation.

In other words, there is really a lot of meat on the bone here and it does a decent job of detailing the evolution of the company and why it turned out the way it did, rather than just focusing on the political mess that it created as one would have expected on a film covering this topic, and one with a fairly snarky title at that.

There is a lot to learn from watching this, particularly because the scandal that engulfed the company was NOT the primary focus, but rather how it came to the scandal. And that, I really believe, is what the film should be about.

It had a story to tell and it told it well, surprisingly well for a film that promised to be a hit-piece. We actually need more things like this. It was refreshing that it covered the circumstances and, most importantly, the hows rather than focusing on the results of Enrons actions.

Illuminating would be the best phrase to use."

""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) isn’t as good as contemporaneous sword & sandal flicks ""Troy"" (one of my favorites) and ""King Arthur"" (very good), but it's not bad either.

THE PLOT: After the death of his child and suicide of his wife, Balian (Orlando Bloom) meets his long, lost father (Liam Neeson) who encourages him to go to Jerusalem and start a new life. After a long eventful trip, Balian arrives in Jerusalem and is introduced to Princess Sibylla (Eva Green), the leprous King Baldwin and other VIPs. The political maneuverings of these key personnel is mindboggling (I suggest using the subtitles to keep track of who’s who) but, when all is said and done, Balian must rise to the challenge of defending the city against Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) and his great Muslim army.

Like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is a film that can be enjoyed just for the visuals and soundtrack. The film was shot in Morocco where a vast replica of ancient Jerusalem was built in the desert with the backgrounds enhanced by CGI effects, and so on.

Story-wise, the beginning and ending are strong while the convoluted soap operatics of Jerusalem aren't very compelling, but Eva Green's awesome eyes help.

I'm no connoisseur of the crusades but I realize the filmmakers put a modern spin on the events and ideology of the characters. So what else is new? In any case, I was impressed that all the main players are based on real-life people and that the gist of the story is accurate.

The Theatrical Cut runs 144 minutes and the Director's Cut about 48 minutes longer. The DC is heralded as one of the best DCs ever, like ""Daredevil"" (2003).

BOTTOM LINE: ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is worth it just for the magnificent visuals and soundtrack. The story starts strong and ends strong while the dramatics of the lengthy mid-section are complicated and not very compelling. But story drive and interesting characters were never director Ridley Scott’s strong suit. Nevertheless, Orlando Bloom is likable as the protagonist and Massoud makes for a striking Saladin, who doesn’t appear till the halfway point.

GRADE: C+/B- || One of the most hated movies by Ridley Scott, that shows the difference of what versions and cuts can have on a movie. This movie have a Theatrical version (144 min.) a Director's Cut (189 min.) and Director's Cut Roadshow Version (194 min.) (that I watched years after watching  the theatrical on cinema). 

The movie is loosely based on the story of Balian I of Ibelin (originally a noble of French or Italy, but portraited as his son in this movie and epoch) travels to Jerusalem during the Crusades of the 12th century, and there he finds himself as the defender of the city and its people.

A tale of noble actions and ideals on the 2nd Crusade among equally noblesse and troubled people. It is not totally historically accurate (let's say 50%) but is one of the most impressive movies about the crusade with all the desert, sun and bloody scenes than you can imagine (and a fictional end).

Originally a 7.0 raised up to a 7.8 out of 10.0 in this version B+ (not sure if this is the version that Netflix have)."
10066.0,House of Wax,A group of unwitting teens are stranded near a strange wax museum and soon must fight to survive and keep from becoming the next exhibit.,Prey. Slay. Display.,"Mystery, Horror, Thriller",113.0,2005-05-05,en,6.02,3127.0,5.2216,"Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton, Jared Padalecki",Jaume Collet-Serra,"louisiana, gore, traffic jam, remake, murder, wax museum, slasher, series of murders, twins, killer, group of friends, ghost town, wax, waxwork, brother sister relationship, 2000s","Engrossing and imaginative modern Mystery/Horror with Elisha Cuthbert 

RELEASED IN 2005 and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, ""House of Wax"" is a horror/slasher about six college students (4 dudes and 2 gals) who drive from Gainesville to Baton Rouge to attend a crucial football game. They end up camping in the woods somewhere off I-10 where some of the party discovers a mysterious town in the sticks that has a curious House of Wax. Horror and death ensue.

This is not a remake of the splendid 1953 Vincent Price cult flick of the same name. The only thing these two films have in common is their title, their genre, and the fact that they both involve a wax museum. It's therefore pointless to compare them as they are two totally different stories. Plot-wise, ""House of Wax"" is an obvious mixture of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and the 1953 film of the same name, along with elements of more modern flicks like “Wrong Turn” (2003) and torture porn.

Although the first 12 minutes or so are unimpressive with too much annoying shaky cam, the story starts to capture your attention at the camp-out sequence. From there their encounter with a horrible stench, a local hick, and the mystery of the isolated town & wax museum gradually pulls you in. The fairly slow initial 50-minutes are a crucial character-building and mystery-developing foundation to the final horrific hour.

The major protagonist of the story is Carly, played by Elisha Cuthbert, who was only 22 during filming and never looked better with her curvy cuteness. The glamorous and infamous Paris Hilton also stars and does a commendable job, but Elisha basically blows her out of the water as far as all-around beauty goes.

Speaking of Ms. Hilton, in light of the ads to “Come see Paris Hilton die,” it’s no secret that her character does indeed buy the farm and, the way it happens, is pretty amusing. The film's worth checking out for this scene alone, especially if you despise her.

The picture was shot in Queensland, Australia, of all places, but it works alright as a stand-in for the Deep South, although I don’t recall any hills along I-10, as depicted in the background of the town. Speaking of the town, it doesn’t look like a Deep South town, but rather a contrived set. Nevertheless, the filmmaking is top-notch in all categories with the rest of the no-name cast doing a fine job. As a matter of fact, the six college kids are all rather likable; even Nick (Chad Michael Murray), Carly’s supposedly 'black sheep' twin, once he shows his true colors.

""House of Wax"" works fabulously for what it IS, a mystery/slasher flick. The unlikely story is played straight and serious by all involved; there's no silly ""comedic relief"" or camp to be seen. Everyone knows going in that this isn't going to be ""Gandhi."" But if you're in the mood for an entertaining and imaginative mystery/horror picture, look no further. ""House of Wax"" has practically everything you’d want in such a film. Why do I describe it as imaginative? See the conclusion's spectacular melting wax museum and you'll understand; this is F/X at its finest.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes. WRITERS: Chad Hayes & Carey W. Hayes.

GRADE: B+ || Better than expected remake from 2005 with some decent gore and the effects during the finale looks pretty good. The cast was alright, reminder Elisha Cuthbert's time starring in movies (courtesy of 24) but she was fine and even Paris Hilton wasn't... awful I suppose. Nothing I'd really revisit anytime soon but all in all found it to be entertaining. **3.5/5**"
1640.0,Crash,"In post-Sept. 11 Los Angeles, tensions erupt when the lives of a Brentwood housewife, her district attorney husband, a Persian shopkeeper, two cops, a pair of carjackers and a Korean couple converge during a 36-hour period.","Moving at the speed of life, we are bound to collide with each other.",Drama,112.0,2005-05-06,en,7.218,3625.0,4.2103,"Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Michael Peña, Terrence Howard, Thandiwe Newton",Paul Haggis,"daughter, police, race politics, installer, fall, car crash, racism, los angeles, california, bigotry, social services, collision, interwoven stories","_**Provocative psychological drama**_

Peoples of differing ethnicities and social-economic levels 'crash' into each other in Los Angeles over a day or so at Christmas time. These people include: 

A white cop who's angry over the downside of affirmative action and so abuses his authority (Matt Dillon); his young white partner who objects to the abuse and actively tries to counteract it (Ryan Phillipe); a black TV director who feels emasculated over the racism he experiences and ultimately blows up (Terrence Howard); his light-skinned wife who doesn't know when to shutteth up (Thandie Newton); an Hispanic locksmith (Michael Peña) and his young daughter with an ‘impenetrable invisible cloak’; a Persian shopkeeper who needs a scapegoat after his store is horribly vandalized, not to mention his daughter and wife; two black car thieves (Ludacris and Larenz Tate), the latter the younger brother of a detective, Graham (Don Cheadle); Graham's beautiful partner and girlfriend, Ria (Jennifer Esposito), and her mother, a maid to the District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock); an Asian man who’s hospitalized and his frantic wife racing to see whether he's alive or dead. 

""Crash"" is reminiscent of another L.A. drama, the 1991 masterpiece ""Grand Canyon,"" but has enough nuances to stand on its own. For one thing, ""Crash"" is even more serious and dark. 

This is an involved story with several interwoven story lines; it ain't no mindless popcorn 'blockbuster.' A casual viewing won't cut it. It's not that kind of picture. Most of the negative criticisms about the film are by people who didn't watch closely and then lambaste it with criticisms that aren't even legitimate.

For one thing, the film is about more than racism; it's about stereotypes, hypocrites, abuse of power, the capacity for good or bad in every human soul, second chances, passive correction and shame, self-sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness, the last straw, manhood & emasculation, giving someone a break, true friendship, misunderstandings, favoritism and more. 

*** SPOILER ALERT *** 

Not every character is racist as some critics insist. Brendan Fraser's character never shows any racism and the only reason his wife (Bullock) blows up with racially-charged statements concerning the locksmith is because she just got robbed and shoved to the pavement at gunpoint by two young black guys. How would you or I react after such an experience? Also, the cop partner of Matt Dillon's character never displays racism in the truest sense; why else would he radically come to the defense of the director who has a fit or pick up a young black male hitchhiking? (What happens later is a misunderstanding not real racism). What about the detectives Graham & Ria and Ria's housemaid mother? (Yes, Graham makes one derogatory statement about Hispanics, but that's it; he's hardly racist). These are all main characters. 

Then there's the criticism that all the protagonists are ""essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes."" This is completely untrue. Graham and Ria (black and Latino) are successful detectives; Cameron is a successful black TV director; and the Hispanic locksmith is a family-oriented working man, not a criminal or gangbanger. Yes, there are some people who fit the stereotypes, like the two young black male thieves and the racist/abusive white cop, but one of the thieves becomes shamed for his lifestyle & hypocrisy and the racist cop is willing to risk his life for a woman of color, thus redeeming himself (from the guilt he felt over abusing his power the night before), besides his white partner is anything but a white racist who abuses his authority.

One critic criticized the film with this multiple-choice question: ""You are involved in a car accident on a busy street. The other driver is Asian. Do you: (a) Wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay; (b) Exchange insurance information with the other driver; (c) Scream and yell, ""damn chinks don't know how to drive!"" 

""If you picked ‘c’ you'd love Crash."" 

This car-crash scenario DOES take place in the story, but he's leaving out some important details: A woman & man are rear-ended by an Asian lady. Why don't they call the cops? Because they ARE cops and there are other cops on the scene. Why does the lady detective talk back to the Asian woman? Because the latter is having a fit and throwing racial slurs at her. This is WHY she talks back to the Asian woman, not to mention she's a cop and therefore in a position of authority. Why does the Asian woman have a fit anyway? Because she's rushing to the hospital to see if her husband's alive. So, you see, the witty little multiple-choice question doesn't actually fit the reality of the film. 

*** END SPOILER *** 

Another criticism is that the racism in the story is not subtle like it is in real life. Well, haven't you ever seen anyone blow up like in the movie? I have. In a city as big as L.A. how many such blow ups happen over any 36-hour period? 

There's a lot of raw emotion and hard-to-watch scenes, but there are undeniable glimpses of love, hope, redemption and forgiveness as well. If you're in the mood for a well-made psychological drama with numerous insights to the human condition, don't miss out.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

Gable brings his usual lighthearted charm to the proceedings and there are a couple of amiable scenes from the rags-to-riches ""Maisie"" (Jessie Ralph) to remind us that just about everyone in that city started from nothing - even those on it's exclusive Nob Hill.

After ""Episode II"" got so bogged down in politics that it played like the Republic covered by C-Span, ""Episode III"" is a return to the classic space opera style that launched the series. Because the story leads up to where the original ""Star Wars"" began, we get to use the immemorial movie phrase, ""This is where we came in.""

That Anakin Skywalker abandoned the Jedi and went over to the dark side is known to all students of ""Star Wars."" That his twins Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia would redeem the family name is also known. What we discover in ""Episode III"" is how and why Anakin lost his way -- how a pleasant and brave young man was transformed into a dark, cloaked figure with a fearsome black metal face. As Yoda sadly puts it in his inimitable word order: ""The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.""

As ""Episode III"" opens, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his friend Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are piloting fighter craft, staging a daring two-man raid to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). He has been captured by the rebel Gen. Grievous (whose voice, by Matthew Woods, sounds curiously wheezy considering the general seems to use replacement parts). In the spirit of all the ""Star Wars"" movies, this rescue sequence flies in the face of logic, since the two pilots are able to board Grievous' command ship and proceed without much trouble to the ship's observation tower, where the chancellor is being held. There is a close call in an elevator shaft, but where are the guards and the security systems? And why, for that matter, does a deep space cruiser need an observation tower, when every porthole opens on to the universe? But never mind.

Back within the sphere of the Jedi Council, Anakin finds that despite his heroism, he will not yet be named a Jedi Master. The council distrusts Palpatine and wants Anakin to spy on him; Palpatine wants Anakin to spy on the council. Who to choose? McDiarmid has the most complex role in the movie as he plays on Anakin's wounded ego. Anakin is tempted to go over to what is not yet clearly the dark side; in a movie not distinguished for its dialogue, Palpatine is insidiously snaky in his persuasiveness.

The way Anakin approaches his choice, however, has a certain poignancy. Anakin has a rendezvous with Padme (Natalie Portman); they were secretly married in the previous film, and now she reveals she is pregnant. His reaction is that of a nice kid in a teenage comedy, trying to seem pleased while wondering how this will affect the other neat stuff he gets to do. To say that George Lucas cannot write a love scene is an understatement; greeting cards have expressed more passion.

The dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point: The characters talk in what sounds like Basic English, without color, wit or verbal delight, as if they were channeling Berlitz. The exceptions are Palpatine and of course Yoda, whose speech (voiced by Frank Oz) reminds me of Wolcott Gibbs' famous line about the early style of Time magazine: ""Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind.""

In many cases the actors are being filmed in front of blue screens, with effects to be added later, and sometimes their readings are so flat, they don't seem to believe they're really in the middle of amazing events. How can you stand in front of exploding star fleets and sound as if you're talking on a cell phone at Starbucks?

""He's worried about you,"" Anakin is told at one point. ""You've been under a lot of stress."" Sometimes the emphasis in sentences is misplaced. During the elevator adventure in the opening rescue, we hear ""Did I miss something?"" when it should be ""Did I miss something?""

The dialogue is not the point, however; Lucas' characters engage in sturdy oratorical pronunciamentos and then leap into adventure. ""Episode III"" has more action per square minute, I'd guess, than any of the previous five movies, and it is spectacular. The special effects are more sophisticated than in the earlier movies, of course, but not necessarily more effective.

The dogfight between fighters in the original ""Star Wars"" and the dogfight that opens this one differ in their complexity (many more ships this time, more planes of action, more detailed backgrounds) but not in their excitement. And although Lucas has his characters attend a futuristic opera that looks like a cross between Cirque de Soleil and an ultrasound scan of an unborn baby, if you regard the opera hall simply as a place, it's not as engaging as the saloon on Tatooine in the first movie.

The lesson, I think, is that special effects should be judged not by their complexity but by the degree that they stimulate the imagination, and ""Episode III"" is distinguished not by how well the effects are done, but by how amazingly they are imagined. A climactic duel on a blazing volcanic planet is as impressive, in its line, as anything in ""Lord of the Rings."" And Yoda, who began life as a Muppet but is now completely animated (like about 70 percent of what we see onscreen), was to begin with and still is the most lifelike of the non-humanoid ""Star Wars"" characters.

A word, however, about the duels fought with lightsabers. When they flashed into life with a mighty whizzing thunk in the first ""Star Wars"" and whooshed through their deadly parabolas, that was exciting. But the thrill is gone.

The duelists are so well-matched that saber fights go on forever before anyone is wounded, and I am still not sure how the sabers seem able to shield their bearers from attack. When it comes to great movie sword fights, Liam Neeson and Tim Roth took home the gold medal in ""Rob Roy"" (1995), and the lightsaber battles in ""Episode III"" are more like isometrics.

These are all, however, more observations than criticisms. George Lucas has achieved what few artists do; he has created and populated a world of his own. His ""Star Wars"" movies are among the most influential, both technically and commercially, ever made. And they are fun. If he got bogged down in solemnity and theory in ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones,"" the Force is in a jollier mood this time, and ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a great entertainment.

Note: I said this is not necessarily the last of the ""Star Wars"" movies. Although Lucas has absolutely said he is finished with the series, it is inconceivable to me that 20th Century-Fox will willingly abandon the franchise, especially as Lucas has hinted that parts VII, VIII and IX exist at least in his mind. There will be enormous pressure for them to be made, if not by him, then by his deputies.

4.5/5

- Rodger Ebert || Having seen the first movie when it reached France as I was about 10, it left a vivid mark on my imagination, and I kind of treasured the little bit of fantasy it brought to me among probably millions of other people.

I think the reason why episodes IV to VI became timeless classics is that they were simply fairy tales in sci-fi clothing. You had heroes and princesses actually doing their heroes and princesses things on the screen, but most of the coolest bits happened somewhere in the recesses of your own imagination.

Struggle of good against evil. Quest for the father. Passage from childhood to adulthood through a series of trials and challenges. All the stuff chivalry stories are made off, presented in a minimalist way that stuck to the essential elements of the plot. All the rest, including top notch SFXs and the excellent Solo-R2D2-C3PO trio was just cleverly fleshing out this very strong backbone.

Just a few lines from a dreamy-eyed Sir Alec Guinness about the clone wars while young and clumsy Luke had his pants burn by a floating tennis ball were enough to flare your imagination in depicting an epic struggle between dark empire forces and a few heroic Jedi knights overwhelmed by sheer force and treachery. A few words about Leia and Luke's past were enough to evoke the moving fate of orphans afraid to uncover the hidden truth about a father shrouded in menacing mystery. Stuff dreams are made of, really.

Sadly oh so sadly, it looks like nowadays a blockbuster will never get the green light until some kind of quality insurance comity makes sure even the slowest 10% of your average audience will never be left wondering about anything that goes on for more than 2.5 seconds. I guess some marketing genius managed to convince the producers that leaving anything to the imagination of the customer seriously threatened the return on investment or something.

The last 3 episodes were unfortunately born in this disastrous context and proceeded methodically with the extermination of the slightest bit of magic that populated the 3 previous movies. Everything is laid bare in front of our eyes like some specimens on a dissection table. No, not even that. More like pieces of hardware broken down into component parts on a sterilized workbench.

So the Force is just something you catch like a flu. The mythical clone war is just 15 minutes of a ridiculous ""plan 66"". The mighty Vader is just a poor boy with an over-sized ego and an IQ reduced to 2 digits figures by an excess of testosterone (or midichlorians or whatnot for that matter). The mighty conflict that flares through the galaxy is just the outcome of desperately trivial political plots. The Jedi council a bunch of pathetically weak over-aged muppets. Yoda a preposterous 10 inches tall kung-fu master.

The epic spirit of the first trilogy has been judged guilty of sales-threatening capital crime, quietly dragged behind the marketing barracks at dawn and shot in the back of the head.

As if to make good for this assassination, the last 3 movies drown us into a squirming pool of special effect and fan service that go light years over the top. Hysterical scenes flashing past before you really could decide where to focus your gaze just make the cheesy plot-advancing ones look miserable. Here again I feel the invisible hand of the marketing staff, managing to cram about every single second or third rate characters from the previous trilogy into an already bloated plot, stretching even further the already badly mauled consistency of the scenario in the process.

Frankly, what could this stupid ""average viewer wants facts"" assumption bring but bitter disappointment? The result is not only boring, but really, really sad. || Truly the best of the bad _Star Wars_ movies, _Revenge of the Sith_ doesn't make a whole lot of sense, both when viewed as self-contained, and when seen as a part of the _Star Wars_ whole, but at least Lucas bothered to put a whole movie in here.

“The Snow Walker” (2004) is a survival flick helmed by Charles Martin Smith, who no doubt learned a thing or two about shooting in the remote North on the set of “Never Cry Wolf” (1983). It was based on a short story by Farley Mowat, who happens to be the character played by Smith in “Never Cry Wolf.”

Although beautiful in its own unique way, the setting is too one-dimensional for my tastes, but the acting is convincing. Anyone interested in gritty realistic survival films should find something to appreciate. It features the mundaneness of ""Limbo"" (1999), but lacks the thrills of ""The Edge"" (1997). While this is the least of these, it’s superior to ""Anything to Survive"" (1990).

The movie runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Churchill, Manitoba (tundra scenes); Rankin Inlet, Nunavut; Merritt, British Columbia (caribou hunt); and Thompson-Nicola Regional District, British Columbia.

Adam Sandler has always proved divisive, and this film has proved to be no exception. Massively popular at the box office (over $100 million profit), it's a film that anyone with an aversion to Sandler should stay away from.

Coming from someone who absolutely adores the original film, I had no hesitation in watching this, I like Sandler and I don't mind remakes as I'm always intrigued to see how they pan out. This is full of prison stereotypes, close to the knuckle humour and meaty violence, but is it funny?

The story is OK, but nothing new. Crowe performs well, but it is not one of his best movies. Giamatti is great, as always but Zellwegger is too cheesy in her role.

Just an entertaining movie without any more intentions. || This is a fine boxing movie, one that relies more on the fighter’s personal story than endless scenes of boxing brutality. James Braddock’s final rise to the championship was an inspirational example during the lull in between the headline-grabbing reigns of Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis, when the heavyweight title changed hands several times.

My only complaint with Ron Howard’s film was its portrayal of Max Baer, the champion Braddock defeated to win the title. For dramatic purposes, they changed his personality and made him into a bullying, vicious person, to the point of making a crude comment about Braddock’s wife. They needed a bad guy so they made one. 

I became interested in Max Baer when I was a teen and read a lot about him over the decades. He was fierce when he meant business in the ring, but mostly he was happy go liucky and didn’t love the fight game. As a side note, Max Baer’s son was also upset at seeing this man he didn’t recognize as his father (this was Max Baer Jr., Jethro Bodean from the Beverly Hillbillies). But what can you do — making changes is standard procedure for movies based on real events.  They are often still worth watching. Just don’t use them for research for a school project, right? || Once Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) breaks his hand in a fight, he discovers that his previously reasonably successful life in the ring has come to an end - and that puts him, wife “Mae” (Renée Zellweger) and their kids on skid row. He’s gone from making $8,000 from a fight to ferreting around the docks looking for work and taking state welfare funds so they can keep their children in their now electricity-free apartment. Then serendipity takes an hand as his former manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) arranges a last-minute fight for him that might garner a meagre $250. It’s not a fight he’s expected to fare well in, but against the odds he triumphs and that enables Gould to engage with his former backer Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) and that could, ultimately, lead to a world title tight fight against Max Baer (Craig Bierko). It’s a pretty savage indictment of urban American life in the 1930s and it also serves well at illustrating just how boxing so often proved the most appealing and available conduit for many an uneducated man to escape the poverty trap that would embrace not just him but his family, too. As to Braddock, his story also involves his close friend “Mike” (Paddy Considine) who embarks on a similar career path, only he has neither the skill nor the sense to make it work. For that, Braddock is especially fortunate to have Gould in his corner, a man who is less venal than many who would hire and fire at the drop of an hat. It’s the boxing action that really works well here, though, with Crowe putting heart and soul into a character that is designed to demonstrate fortitude and determination, sure, but also humanity and humility too. Giamatti steals the scenes, but Zellweger also contributes well as Ron Howard presents us with a poignant, violent and plausible story of a man motivated by family and friends who epitomised his own version of the pioneering spirit."

Heath Ledger is on hand as Skip Zephyr while Rebecca De Mornay appears as one of the teens’ struggling mother.

While I suppose “Lords of Dogtown” (2005) is a sports flick, it’s just as much a coming-of-age movie detailing growing-up on the bad side of Venice, aka Dogtown, the birthplace of America’s skateboard culture, which influenced the world.

It reminded me of the dissolute environment depicted in “River’s Edge” (1986) with elements of Jim Morrison’s hedonistic misadventures from “The Doors” (1991), but combined with skateboard action, like skating in dry backyard pools and various competitions. It’s a good movie with slightly amped-up events (so what else is new?), but somewhat hampered by a curiously dismal air with occasional dialogues that don’t work. Maybe I found it slightly depressing because it reminded me of the glory & shame of my teen years. The 70’s soundtrack is great, however.

I understand that this is supposed to be a ""power of imagination"" kids story, but there is just a lot of garbage in this.

The kids seem to do some fairly good acting for what they're asked to do, but I'm not sure why George Lopez was cast, but the writing is weak enough that it could easily just be the writing.

The story is designed to look like it's just literally written haphazardly as they go, so it's hard to tell what's badly written, and what's correctly written to make it look like bad kid writing.

While the characters of Sharkboy (especially) and Lavagirl are quite ridiculous, there are some fun things that they include throughout the movie, so its not like the movie is completely without quality, but piled together it was not an experience I'd want to do again."

Without Liman’s standard action comedy, we wouldn’t have had the power couple that dominated the tabloids. Several children wouldn’t have been adopted and brought up in a completely different, yet financially stable, environment. Jolie wouldn’t have been the charitable humanitarian she is now. And Shiloh’s first baby photograph wouldn’t have amassed over ten million dollars worldwide. Wow! Suffice to say, the two most beautiful humans in Hollywood have a substantial amount of gratitude to show Liman for his efforts in pairing them. If only his energetic vibrancy was enough to power the lacklustre screenplay, the balance of action and comedy could’ve been a landmark within the sub-genre. A bored upper middle class married couple are astonished to learn that they work for differing assassination organisations, soon to be assigned to kill each other.

It’s your standard marriage. Winning a teddy bear at a carnival, falling in love whilst buying the most expensive mansion on the street, succumbing to the same mundane daily routine, destroying the house with an almighty shootout followed by a gas explosion, participating in the feistiest erotic love-making scene ever and naturally ending in marriage counselling. A cruel irony for “Brangelina”, maybe they should’ve watched the film they made together? Cynicism aside, what truly elevates the memorability of this feature is the onscreen (and offscreen, bow chicka wow wow...) chemistry of its leading stars. Jolie and Pitt are exceptionally effortless with their comedic timing, dramatic endeavours and high-octane action. The lightning-fast wit that they inject into Kinberg’s less than impressive script is nothing short of, well, impressive. They make the film. They are the film. And they certainly have solid taste in curtains.

Liman maintains a light tone throughout, never dabbling into the cracks of the marriage which is vital for retaining a fun buoyancy. This isn’t an analysis on marital breakdown. It’s just a tongue in cheek slice of entertainment.

Having said that, despite the tantalising chemistry of its leads, you never quite feel that they are truly in love. Unfortunately, Kinberg’s script is so vacuous in emotional conviction, that both Smiths resemble roommates than a married couple. Understandably the marriage is stale as they conform to their upper middle class lifestyle, but even when they fight and makeup, there’s no real connection. I yearn to see Jolie and Pitt lust over each other. The momentum essentially grinds to a halt after their house explodes, with Kinberg’s script focussing on a central plot point involving “The Tank” and an onslaught of heavily armed operatives raiding a department store. Attention for the splendid couple instantly dissipated with a third act that seemingly refused to end, ultimately losing the acute fun that preceded the underwhelming conclusion. The whole “keeping up appearances” act was tossed out of the smashed window, and that was the sole element that made the film incredibly fun.

Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn’t conclude with a divorce, as it is sensible light entertainment for the vast majority of its runtime, yet the concluding act and poor screenplay prevent the marriage from flourishing fully. Angelina Jolie man! I would abandon my homosexuality for her... || Average performances, average script. What did you expect? || Been a long time since I last watched this and while not great, was certainly entertaining thanks to the charisma and chemistry between Pitt and Jolie and the action from director Doug Liman was well done.

272.0,Batman Begins,"Driven by tragedy, billionaire Bruce Wayne dedicates his life to uncovering and defeating the corruption that plagues his home, Gotham City.  Unable to work within the system, he instead creates a new identity, a symbol of fear for the criminal underworld - The Batman.",Evil fears the knight.,"Drama, Crime, Action",140.0,2005-06-10,en,7.714,21595.0,14.1702,"Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman",Christopher Nolan,"martial arts, undercover, loss of loved one, secret identity, crime fighter, superhero, based on comic, rivalry, ninja, vigilante, tragic hero, super power, haunted by the past, evil doctor, master villain, unfulfilled love, inspirational","It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.

Bruce Wayne is constantly tortured by his childhood memories when he witnessed his parents being murdered. Taken under the wing of The League Of Shadows, a deadly ninja assassin army devoted to erasing crime with their own brand of harsh justice. After completing training, Wayne refuses to join them on account of not agreeing with their methods, he returns to Gotham City to reek his own one man war against crime.

Director Christopher Nolan literally goes back to Batman origins to not just give the dead franchise a kiss of life, but actually to spark it into a sort of triumphant homecoming. Gone is all forms of camp veneer so evident in Joel Schumacher's offerings, and in place we have a darkly rich picture intent on fleshing out Batman's motives, and crucially, his fractured persona.

One of the most pleasing things to me was that Nolan paced this picture to perfection, the build up of character, and then birth of the Bat, dominates for practically the first hour of the piece. This gives Batman Begins some crucial heart, it really helps us to focus on this weird super-hero now that we have some meat on his bones. We then follow Wayne from a Chinese prison to The League Of Shadows monastery, watching his transformation from brawling man of anger into a controlled fighting machine. A machine that still roams with a revenge laden heart.

Then its to Gotham City where he then births Batman and all bad guys are on his agenda. Mob boss Falcone, the mysterious Scarecrow, and also a face from his past that rears its surprising head. Wayne is driven by powerful motives, and it's here in the second part of the film that Batman Begins rewards those who indulged in the character build up. In come the stunts and outrageous sequences, all played out in Nolan's desperately dank Gotham City (a far cry from Tim Burton's dark Oz like scapes). This Gotham is pot boiling to disaster and is crying out for the Bat to sweep all before it, and thankfully Nolan and his cast fulfil all the early promise to deliver a wonderful action fantasy that caters for all ages.

Christian Bale dons the Batsuit and it fits like a glove, his Bruce Wayne may lack the ebullient charisma that Michael Keaton's had, but his Batman is mean and moody and comfortable with the zippy dialogue. Michael Caine plays Alfred the loyal servant to the Wayne family, much heart and emotive drive from Caine ensures the role is a roaring success. Cillian Murphy is Dr Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow who actually scares more as Crane with his piercing eyes and devilishly smirky leer, whilst both Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) & Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) are solid with what little they actually have to do. Liam Neeson gets his teeth into a meaty role as Henri Ducard, and as a character arc he gets the best scenes (Nolan clearly having great fun here).

Minnor let downs to me without hurting the picture are Katie Holmes (pretty but hardly convincing as Assistant D.A. Rachael Dawes) and Rutger Hauer as Earle (a little bit of menace wouldn't go amiss here Rutger old man). Still, as I said they are very minor let downs because as comic book adaptations go, Batman Begins is from the top draw, a franchise re-suited, rebooted and completely reinvigorated. But now the test comes with that all important sequel... 9/10 || i'm beginning to think people only say a movie is good because of it being long and having a good camera. to me the only highlight was cillian murphy's performance. the rest of this was just some dumb, boring trek. || Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" shows us exactly how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) transforms into the caped crusader we all know and love, Batman. Admittedly like many others, even though this is the first entry in the Dark Knight Trilogy, I watched it is as my last one, and that is due to me not even knowing of it's existence, which is thanks to it being heavily overshadowed by the critically acclaimed sequel, ""The Dark Knight.""

Batman Begins has a simple plot to follow full of twists. A young Bruce Wayne travels to the Far East, where he's trained in the martial arts by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows. Ducard later reveals the true purpose of the League, the complete destruction of Gotham City as they feel it is an unjust cesspool full of criminals that is too far gone to be saved and must be cleansed to preserve their duty and for justice and balance to be restored. Bruce does not agree with the League's morals and returns to Gotham on his own determined to clean up the crime-ridden and corrupted city without resorting to murder. With the help of his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a tech expert at Wayne Enterprises, Batman is born.

The number one takeaway from this film that I did not experience as much in any other Batman movie, was that it really makes you care and feel compassion towards Bruce Wayne himself, not the masked vigilante he disguises himself as. The real Bruce is tragic, realistic, relatable, quite unstable, and frankly doesn't know what his purpose is or what he should be doing with himself. This is the origin story, and you get to first hand see the traumatic events that turned him into the lonely, guilt ridden bitter man you see today. His feelings and actions are completely justified, and I've gained a lot of respect for the character.

Now this is a dark, gritty and mature film clearly made for adult fans, do not expect the colorful, campy comic book styled ""Joel Schumacher"" treatment here, this is going to get real, real fast. I can and do appreciate the attempt to not be a generic superhero film and head towards the crime drama genre, and don't get me wrong it's a great movie, but there a few issues that keep it from being perfect movie status like the sequel in my books. It was maybe a bit too serious for it's own good, and ends up being so focused on becoming an art piece that it almost stops being fun. Primary antagonist Ra's al Ghul is great, but secondary villain Dr. Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) has an apparent lack of quality visual effects and proper screen time. The long run time was not wasted, but they probably did not need to include so many side characters, world building and lore into what could have been a quicker, neat, well done origin story.

Overall I liked and can get behind Batman Begins, I do not think it's the best in the ""Dark Knight Trilogy,"" but it's a top quality film on it's own accord especially if I stop comparing too much. This film delivers a uniquely cold, cruel, and memorable experience that will make you see and appreciate Bruce Wayne and his Batman persona from a completely new perspective."

One of my main worries throughout was how were they going to connect the plot, I liked how they were piecing it together but didn't have faith that they'd stick the landing. Unfortunately, I was probably correct as the conclusion isn't the best. However, there is still a heartwarming story sandwiched inbetween the averageness.

As mentioned, the talent onscreen isn't anything to shout about. Hilary Duff (Holly) and Heather Locklear (Jean) are the most noteworthy, as they lead an alright supporting cast. Usually these films are cast over plot, this is actually the other way around.

While I'm used to seeing Justin Long playing a support role, and Matt Dillon is the ""villain"",  it is a bit odd to see Michael Keaton play such a small, if appropriate, role.

Desperate to regain his fame, he insists on hiring an unknown actress to play Samantha as not to be overshadowed. When he finds Isabel, she seems perfect for the part. Little does he know, Isabel is a real witch.

I have not seen this movie since watching it in the theaters in 2005, so I didn’t remember much about it. Written and directed by Nora Ephron, there’s a certain amount of expectation when watching it. This is the woman who wrote When Harry Met Sally and You’ve Got Mail, after all. Unfortunately, Bewitched doesn’t really live up to those expectations, despite its potential.

Nicole Kidman seems like the obvious choice to replace Elizabeth Montgomery as the witchy Samantha (Isabel). Isabel is looking to put her witchy ways behind her, live a normal life and find love. She seems pretty naïve of the real world but she’s instantly smitten with Jack and agrees to become the Samantha to his Darren. Kidman is wide-eyed and breathy and Will Ferrell is… well, Will Ferrell at the peak of his own comedic career. They work perfectly fine on screen together, but the romantic chemistry is practically non-existent.

Bewitched seems to be missing that Ephron magic that made her previous romantic comedies so enchanting. It could be the miscasting of Will Ferrell, or the overly formulaic plot. It never seems to truly commit to the idea that the love story between Isabel and Jack is the real remake of Bewitched and instead of relies on special effects and some minor, silly spell casting/shenanigans to try and make the movie work. Michael Caine’s talent is completely wasted and Steve Carrell, whom I usually adore, shows up briefly as the obnoxious Uncle Arthur… and he really commits to the obnoxious part.

That being said, there were some parts of the movie that I found to be entertaining. Shirley MacLaine makes the most of her under-developed role as Iris/Endora and some of the sight gags are amusing. As usual, the Ephron soundtrack is full of cozy nostalgia, but it’s just not enough to make Bewitched worthy of its material source. I don’t regret watching it (again), but it’s unlikely I’ll return for another repeated viewing. (https://theromcomcatalog.com/review-bewitched-2005/) || Not a bad movie.

Land Of The Dead is directed & written by George A. Romero and it's the fourth film in his Zombie based series of films. It stars Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Eugene Clark & Asia Argento.

Human society has regrouped and formed a new community in a sealed off section of America. Run by a feudal government headed by Paul Kaufman (Hopper), the state survives on supplies garnered from the outside world by Riley (Baker) and his ""Dead Reckoning"" team. But during one of their raids they notice that one of the Zombies, Big Daddy (Clark), is starting to show signs of human awareness.

After the emergence of the Dawn Of The Dead remake in 2004 and the plaudits heaped upon zom-com Shaun Of The Dead also in 2004, one question immediately sprang to the minds of zombie fans, ""could Romero, the don of the dead, be stirred into a new entry in his already heralded series?"". Yes was the joyous answer to that, and although a torn ligament down from previous instalments, the great news is that Land Of The Dead rocks with gore and politico fervour. Naturally a lot has changed in the world of zombiedom since Romero's last venture in 85, but he manages to tonally keep the old fashioned feel while observing the unsteady social climate that was seeping from the wounds in 2005.

By his own admission he is taking pot shots at the Bush administration, while Hopper, on delightfully excessive form, deliberately channels Donald Rumsfeld. From fireworks in the sky bringing conformity, to class division down on the turf, Romero as always has something to say. The cast are a solid and energetic bunch, with Baker pleasingly coming up trumps as a hero type, while gore hounds are very well served here as George finds new and inventive ways of delivering the ick (one ""head"" sequence is genius). Sure there's a suggestion that the central idea of the zombies getting smarter is kind of going off tangent, but since he wrote the rules, he's also allowed to change them. But with this ending here it offers hope, not just in this skew whiff world he's created, but also of further film's to come.

The special effects are great (to this amateur anyway) and the acting and action more than adequate. Plus it stays near enough to the sci-fi genius of the author to satisfy the fans of the classic novel. I will say that I got a little tired of the son acting like such a teenager, but he and the Tom Cruise character both show some character growth by the end of the film. Tom is one of those actors who seems to be playing himself a lot, but I suspect there is a lot more work to it than that. I'm not sure Dustin Hoffman would have gotten his Academy Award for Rain Man if he had played off a lesser actor than Cruise. 

I think there are a couple of scenes the movie could have done without, such as in the cellar with Cruise, his daughter and the man who lived there. It slowed the story down, changed the tenor of the drama, and didn't add a lot, in my view. But it is what it is and overall I found War of the Worlds to be entertaining. Good science fiction movies can be hard to find. || First time seeing this in 15 years and lame plot, annoying characters (both kids got on my nerves) and a protagonist who just runs around, as Tom Cruise does so well, but has zero impact on the end game which was... bacteria. Yeah, this was just as dumb today as it was back then. At least the visual effects and sound design still holds up. **2.5/5** || Sometimes it just pays to leave well alone, and this remake of the 1953 version adds nothing aside from more sophisticated special effects. A vehicle for Tom Cruse, it allows Stephen Spielberg to turn this menacing and thought-provoking sci-fi classic into a family melodrama with the star and his dysfunctional family travelling the breadth of the country trying to escape the terror that is falling from the skies. These metallic creations are ruthless, destroying everything in their path but somehow the emphasis of this is more on why ""Ray"" can't get on with ""Robbie"" (Justin Chatwin) and whether or not ""Rachel"" (Dakota Fanning) can keep hold of her childhood toy. The effects are good: the lasers and the pyrotechnics; the explosions and scenes of dereliction are impressive - but oddly enough, I found them less so than in the iteration made fifty years earlier. Lots of horrified expressions as the cast look longingly at green screens, some banal dialogue and we end up with a film about the people in/behind it rather than one about alien world domination. After almost two hours, the ending - and it's huge significance - is almost an afterthought to the boring story of who did what to whom over the years in the ""Ferrier"" family. Cruise can, at times, bring charisma to the screen. Here he brings little and I am afraid that I found this a triumph of commercialism over creativity and was cheerily egging on the aliens from fairly early on."

Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). All set off on a space mission that sees them engulfed by a mysterious storm that imbues them all with different special powers.

Fantastic Four is arguably the most loved on the page of the super-group comic book creations. Certainly it's Marvel's flagship offering in that corner of the super hero market. Odd then, that when it finally makes it to the big screen they throw money at it but employ the director of ""The Firing Squad"" & ""Taxi""? The whole film reeks of nervousness, with director Tim Story either fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie, or worse still, being directed himself by studio executives fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie. While the casting of Gruffud (dull), Alba (cleavage for hire) and McMahon (out of his depth as a villain) beggars belief. Sloppy CGI fails to ignite what little action there is, while the final smack down as our intrepid 4 battle with Von Doom, is of a TV movie standard. Yet it still has a smidgen of fun about it to warrant investing a damp dark afternoon with.

Chiklis and Evans are the plus points, the former injecting a bit of heart into proceedings and the latter some sexiness and some much needed humour. There's also some worth in the script's attempt at messaging about the perils and pitfalls of celebrity status. While who can deny that the first appearance of ""flame-on"" & ""clobbertime"" doesn't induce an ickle tingle down the spine of the discerning comic book fan (ok that may just be me hankering for my youth). If only the film wasn't so safe and had been in better hands. But hey! the film turned over a $230 million Worldwide profit, so what do I know eh? The sequel was inevitable, so one can only hope that with the same people involved they not only learn from their guardedness, but that they manage to stay faithful to the source and give it some much needed pizazz.

Footnote: The extended cut at twenty minutes longer, suffice to say, is a better experience as it has more pizazz. So 5/10 for the theatrical cut and 6/10 for the extended version. || I personally find the Storyverse Fantastic Four films underrated for a lot of reasons. One good reason is Michael Chiklis' performance as Ben Grimm/The Thing. He did such a great job as the Thing and is seen by many as the best character. The acting, effects, plot and production values are pretty good. After the Fant4stic film, I feel like people should give this film and Rise of the Silver Surfer another chance. || A terribly wooden Ioan Gruffudd heads the cast of this weak and feeble sci-fi adventure as ""Reed Richards"" - a career boffin who leads the team of ""Ben"" (Michael Chiklis) and siblings ""Sue"" (Jessica Alba) and the cocky ""Johnny"" (Chris Evans). Funded by ""Victor von Doom"" (Julian McMahon) they are investigating some spacial anomaly when poor old ""Ben"" is caught unawares on an EVA and he is exposed to a hefty dose of cosmic radiation. The others thought they were safely behind an impermeable shield but upon their return to Earth they discover that they have some new quirks. ""VVD"" isn't impressed by this and soon the four must put aside their domestic grievances and unite to combat his ever increasing ambitions - and it turns out that he, being on the ship too, has powers of his own! Aside from the hunky Evans who has the most fun super-power (he can catch fire and fly like a rocket) and easily the most charisma, the rest of the casting is very much by-the-numbers, as is the dialogue and the predictable storyline. The writers have a stab at putting some humour into the film, but no amount of wit is going to help Gruffudd and his unpredictable accent (why did he even bother?) to carry this good looking but poorly delivered helping of Marvel-lite. There is also a little too much simmering romance and envy here to clutter up the main thrust of the lacklustre plot. What we end up with is actually a bit of a mess. To be fair, it does move along well enough and is only 100 minutes, or so, but really - this is an unremarkable effort from all concerned that I doubt I will ever bother watching again."

The main characterisation of ""Djay"" is strongly portrayed here with guts and a degree of viscerally plausible credibility that really works at times. Sadly, though, the bulk of the rest of it resorts to more aggressive and would mouthed stereotyping that reinforces so many pejorative views of how African American men treat each other and the women (and children) in their lives. It's that very sad predictability that rather ruined the potency of Howard's effort here, and by mid-way through I can honestly say I couldn't have cared less whether he succeeded or not. Too many lives had already been ruined by his previous behaviour, so why should he escape the consequences of a vicious circle he had quite an hand in creating? There's plenty for fans of the musical genre to get their teeth into as that offers a boxing-like conduit for those without academic credentials to use their more creative talents to escape their torpor and find hope. It may well resonate more in the USA, but elsewhere it can come across as a story of an unlikeable man who played in the dog-eat-dog world until it no longer suited him, then tried to escape being eaten himself."

Lincoln Six Echo is having vivid dreams about a past existence, here in this Utopian world he lives in, he's starting to question the function of his world. In this perfectly formed existence the inhabitants dream of winning the lottery, the prize? Relocation to an outside paradise known as The Island. After stumbling upon something sinister, Lincoln escapes with fellow inmate Jordan Two Delta, and now the consequences for both of them are as dangerous as it is for the rulers of this strange and intriguing place.

If you are entering a movie that is directed by Michael Bay then one can reasonably assume you know what you are going to get, cue explosions, ear splitting sound mix and a host of carnage set pieces. Bay's formula works and mostly his efforts have entertained the popcorn masses. So it's interesting to find that ""The Island"" does have some intellectual nous in amongst the Bayhem that the director is famed for. Working from a tantalising cloning story written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen (though the similarities to Robert Fiveson's ""The Clonus Horror"" resulted in a law suit being filed), ""The Island"" now more than ever is highly engrossing sci-fi in premise, where certainly the ethics of the story's core are worth scrutinising.

One of course can argue that Bay was the wrong director for such interesting material, and yes it's a point to note that the characters and plot arcs are not given any depth or a serious second glance, but really we are here for the bang to go with the buck are we not?. Ewan McGregor (Lincoln) and Scarlett Johansson (Jordan) play it just about right, the bemusement of their situation is coupled with daring do heroics, while suitably tongue in cheek performances come from Sean Bean, Djimon Hounsou and a picture stealing Steve Buscemi. This is not a film that is easy to recommend because it can frustrate as much as it entertains, but entertain it does, and with big screen TVs and glorious home cinema a staple requirement for the movie fanatic, ""The Island"" is something of an essential purchase - check out the highly octane outrageousness of the road pursuit here, it's fabulous through the speakers.

A serious topic is given a nonsense sheen for sure, but hell what a blast it is. 7/10 || Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

Even though this is from 2005, it's amazing that when you have a futuristic world, it holds up over time as the 2020 new tech doesn't seem to matter as much, or you design characters that wouldn't have average technology, this sort of does both.

Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johannson, Djimon Hounsou, even Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi and Michael Clark Duncan.  This has a great cast and clearly had too much money to work with.  There are all sorts of sci-fi effects, crazy constructed sets, and some really over the top action sequences for this premise.

And this premise is excellent: a clone discovers he's a clone and makes an escape attempt, it's a race for survival.  The writing is excellently paced, and structure with a little too much of an establishing act, but it's useful and not boring, so that's still good.  The leads truly embody the characters, showing a line between ignorance and intelligence: they are ignorant of societal constructs but incredibly intelligent as they've spent the last 3 years attempting to escape a puzzle box.

The mechanisms to keep the pursuit of the fugitives going are all rather seemless, and there is open discussion of morality of the facility's actions by most of the cast without harping on about it.

There is science and action abound, please enjoy."

After _Halloween II_. Which is also the best _Halloween_ movie.

...Now they're really coming for me.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || **Between black comedy and disgusting horror, it's not a movie that wants to be taken seriously.**

Rob Zombie is a decidedly strong stomach man. His musical curriculum could be enough to prove it, but we still have his horror films, full proof of his taste for blood and shocking scenes. Personally, I'm not a fan of excessively bloody films, I think that the blood and deaths in a horror film shouldn't be indiscriminate, it ends up being counterproductive and having a perverse effect, as if we got used to it, making this type of resource less effective.

This film is the sequel to “House of 1000 Corpses”: starting where it ends, it shows us the siege of the decrepit Firefly house to arrest or massacre that family of degenerates. They manage to escape and will spread panic in the region, while the local police try everything to catch them. To understand this film, therefore, I recommend first seeing the film that gives rise to these events (and which is just as violent and disgusting as this one). However, I felt that this film has a slightly better script than its predecessor and that it tries to at least create a good story, ""Bonnie & Clyde"" style, with cultural references to Ned Kelly, Ma Barker and others.

The slash subgenre, to which this film belongs, has a legion of fans and some renowned films, namely the “Saw” franchise. They are films filled with violent deaths, infamous acts, obscenities and graphic content. I already expected this here. What I really don't understand is how Zombie tries to introduce comedy into a movie like this. Even dealing with black humor, attempts to introduce humor end up cutting the atmosphere.

Back to characters they already knew, Sid Haig and Bill Moseley continue to do a great job as actors. They dominate the film and their characters are both comic (it didn't work for me but…) and brutal and sadistic. Sherry Moon Zombie, who is the director's wife, gained more prominence in this film, where she appears naked (or almost) in several scenes. The veteran and prestigious Leslie Easterbrook (who most people will remember for her performance in the comedies of the “Police Academy” franchise) replaced Karen Black, but I confess that I felt at various times that the actress did not fit into this type of material. The film also features other well-known actors such as William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Danny Trejo and Taylor Maine.

Technically, the film has some points that deserve to be highlighted, starting with the use of good special effects and good digital resources, which the director took full advantage of. We cannot fail to observe with some pleasure the richness of detail in the sets and costumes, and the good work of the camera. The soundtrack features several well-known songs, and contributes to not taking the film too seriously."

I'm not a fan of baseball on any level, but this is a surprisingly charming movie, and Billy Bob Thorton is great with inappropriate humor.  After this watch, I'm thinking this is from where ""Benchwarmers"" might have been inspired.

I think it's more of the ""misfits working together"" trope that gets me, and you see it in lots of kids sports movies: ""Kicking & Screaming"", ""The Sandlot"", ""Little Giants"", ""Mighty Ducks"".

This rolls in a lot of adult humor as well, so while you might have to have a few talks with your kids (which you should have had before watching a movie that would unexpectedly prompt them), but I think it's a movie that the whole family could actually watch.

This is one of the best superhero movies outside of DC and Marvel movies.  Not only does it use the silly costumes that I like from comics, but it incorporates it as part of normal life: the world is clearly built to show that Supers are somewhat normal to see, and that there is a community of them.  It's basically Professor X's school if people treated Mutants like the Avengers.

The immediate problems are in the the casting: there are SO MANY great people, almost everyone is funny and takes to their roles perfectly, but the lead, the focus of the story, is forgettable, and it is completely unbelievable that he would have these girls after him, let alone someone who we're happy to have powers.  And I hate Kurt Russell, but the movie is so good I forget he's in it until he suddenly appears and smarms it up.

A ""coming of age"" story, with ""high school politics"", and ""girl next door"" tropes all mixed together is a good recipe, and with super powers to keep it interesting.  I think that's the thing that makes this movie stand out.  Using the super powers, the movie is all about SHOW, don't tell.  A lot of movie forget this, overusing narration and dialogue out of place.

The content of the movie is all about meaningful dialogue, showing the world, and how it works.  It is also about being fun, they pay special detail to the scenes to keep it light and add something extra to the scenes.  Another thing that comedy movies forget is that a joke should compliment the movie, not stop it: there are so many little bits sewn into the movie that happen to the side (Larry being a 2-ton rock at a party), or as part of the world building (a hero support montage of utility belts).

The oddest parts of the movie deal with teens dating and their parents, it's perfectly apt, but you can feel the awkwardness of the situation.

If you've ever liked any super hero anything, then give this a go, you'll probably like it. || A decent superhero comedy from Disney.

<em>'Sky High'</em> sets up a little iffy, with a few cringey moments early, but goes on to produce a suitably entertaining film. Kurt Russell gives the only performance that I'll likely remember, but all the cast do their part - they are well cast, with none of them leaving anything to be desired to be honest.

The effects are good, while there are a couple of amusing gags thrown in. It's a simple and pretty predictable premise, but that doesn't stop it from being fun to watch. It could've, perhaps, worked better as a TV show? There are murmurs that that's what they plan to do soon, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

Worth a watch."

Especially since these people professed belief in the same God [uh, no they didn’t].” 

Charles had an “epiphany, which became the basis for a new religious sect. An order that would combine the fundamental tenets of the three major religions of his day. His first converts were Christian knights who'd also become disenchanted by the bloodshed. The force of his convictions even won over a number of Muslims and Jews. Former enemies who now became willing converts to the new faith.” 

The script for The Order was co-written by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who according to Wikipedia has his own wacky religious notions (Christianity is wrong because ""snakes are good"" and ""apples contain pectin, which is anti-cholesterol""); I want to believe that he and his co-writer Les Weldon are in on the joke, but whether or not they take this material seriously, the real probleem is that they don't really tap into the comedic potential of their premise.

Specifically, the film should have been a mock 'biography' of Charles Le Vaillant, especially if he were to be played by JCVD; I have no doubt that Charles delivering sermons in Van Damme's frenchglish and casting pearls of wisdoms such as the ones quoted above might just be able to produce a new ""Blessed Are the Cheesemakers"". 

Sadly, JCVD ​​and Weldon never really delve into this nameless religion known simply as The Order, thus missing out on what could have been a huge source of humor. Instead, the film skips to the present and introduces thief and smuggler Rudy Cafmeyer (Van Damme), who is in the process of stealing a Fabergé egg (presumably to sell it to ""Bleeding Gums"" Murphy).

Rudy's father is archaeologist and museum curator Oscar 'Ozzie' Cafmeyer (Vernon Dobtcheff). Ozzie travels to Israel and is kidnapped while on the phone with Rudy, who then travels to Jerusalem himself to rescue dear old dad. There Rudy meets an old friend of his father, archeology professor Walt Finley (Charlton Heston. Really).

This Heston cameo can only be explained as a manifestation of his then-incipient Alzheimer's; moreover, it's another wasted opportunity. The legendary actor would have been equally perfect in both the farcical sword-and-sandal epic that The Order could and should have been, and the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade knock-off it ends up aspiring to be; in either case, though, he would have needed more screen time, and in the latter case, he should have had the role of Rudy's father. 

The rest is just standard JCVD, complete with a foot chase scene with Van Damme disguised as a Hasidic Jew, fleeing from and fighting Israeli police (how Rudy gets his costume, particularly the beard and curls, is a mystery; why not show him buying it in a souvenir shop, as if it was a set of Mickey Mouse ears at Disneyland?)."

In may ways it felt like they took the major events that would have spanned the next 2 or 3 seasons and crammed it all into a 2 hour movie.

Nonetheless, it provides a decent sense of closure to the series. || This was an extremely poor movie. The weakest character during the TV series, River Tam, confusingly became the story focus in this movie.

Despite never exercising and having a small frame, River fought and K.O.ed a room full of bar patrons.

The crew, mysteriously, were devoted to going to the planet River wanted to visit to help her discover her past despite showing various degrees of hostility toward her during the series ranging from open contempt to advocating her murder.

The main villains do not make sense. They are, supposedly, so wild that they regularly sack planets and cannibalize its inhabitants, but can still work together well enough to fly space ships. The entire population of these wild people came from the planet River wants to visit and from a single research facility. I'd guess about 1,000 research and support personnel were initially infected. They have no way of infecting further individuals, the facility was shut down, and yet their current population is many times the original amount. How?

The plot does not make sense. It is not engaging. None of the characters are interesting. The characters die without emotional impact. Pass on this movie. Like the TV series, this is a waste of time. || This is the captain. We have a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then - explode.

Serenity is written and directed by Josh Whedon. It stars Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, Ron Glass and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Music is by David Newman and cinematography by Jack N. Green. 

When the captain Mal Reynolds (Fillion) of the space craft Serenity takes on board Dr. Simon Tam (Maher) and his troubled sister River (Glau), it thrusts the entire crew into a world of conspiracy and galactic despots. 

Coming at it as a complete novice as regards ""Firefly"", the short lived TV show that Serenity is spawned from, I personally have no frame of reference to work from. What I found was a hugely enjoyable sci-fi Western hybrid that deserved a better box office than it got. The cast are all comfortable with each other and very watchable, which isn't surprising since Whedon has transported them all over from ""Firefly"", good move that, while the action quota is high and the black comedy rich.

Where the itches start to appear for newcomers like myself, is that it does feel like an extended TV episode. With a twisty plot that sees Whedon cram much into the 2 hour running time, it demands the utmost attention. Which is fair enough to a degree, but many go (or more pertinently would have gone) into ""Serenity"" for a sci-fi action adventure, not for a tickle of the cranium. If this contributed to the poor show at the box office? I'm not sure. But you have to think this really was only made for the die-hard fans of the show.

Galling really, because the last third is a ripper of a blockbuster. The action sequences are expertly crafted, the story explodes still further and the principal characters really let loose, particularly the excellent Fillion. Biggest plus of all, the finale doesn't cop out by insulting those who have stayed the course chartered by the good ship Serenity and its crew. It's smart genre film making, a very enjoyable film without doubt, but really it's not got mainstream appeal. Which might suit those die-hards in a selfish kind of why, but that also means we are unlikely to get a sequel. And that's a shame because a newbie like me could easily stand some more of this whizz bangery. 7/10"

""Crocker-Harris"" (Michael Redgrave) has rather stoically and unsympathetically been trying to drum Greek into his classes of largely disinterested buys for many years, but is now to move on after becoming ill. What's fairly clear from the outset is that his wife ""Millie"" (an on-form Jean Kent) has little but disdain for her rather pedestrian husband, and that she has been a little too friendly with his slightly smarmy colleague ""Hunter"" (Nigel Patrick). As the day of his departure looms ever closer, the teacher finds himself beginning to bond with the bright and refreshingly honest young ""Taplow"" (Brian Smith) who seems not only interested in his Aristotle, but also in this now rather dejected purveyor of education. It's also fairly obvious that none of his professional colleagues are particularly sympathetic to him either - a fact ably demonstrated by the lack of sympathy to their impending financial predicament offered by headmaster ""Frobisher"" (Wilfred Hyde-White). Redgrave gives a strong and nuanced performance here. His character has been aimlessly cruising for so long, he has forgotten how to live or what he, himself, wanted when he was the age of the young man who is now provoking a long-abandoned sense of worth in the man. His realisation of his domestic predicament, and of the rather shrewishness of his wife, is also effectively banging his head against a wall and wakening him up to a state of affairs of which he was probably aware, but maybe just didn't really care. I can't say I loved the conclusion - perhaps all just a little too much of a volte face from just about everyone, but it's an interesting character study with the odd bit of humour and a strong story."

Not to mention the action sequences here by Chan are also some of the best we've ever seen. Rivaling even his greatest action sequences in Police Story and the like.

A New Orleans hospice worker (Kate Hudson) takes a job at a dilapidated antebellum mansion in the bayou caring for a dying old man (John Hurt). His wife seems to be hiding something, however (Gena Rowlands). Peter Sarsgaard is on hand as the estate’s amiable lawyer.  

""The Skeleton Key"" (2005) is a Southern Gothic supernatural thriller set in the Louisiana bayou à la “Cat People” (1982) and “The Reaping” (2007). It’s not as good as the former, but arguably superior to the latter or at least on par. Most of the film is an eerie drama taking place in and around the old Southern mansion, but the pace picks up in the final act with a quality surprise climax. Neither my wife nor I were able to anticipate the revelation, but it makes sense and hails back to earlier obscure horror flicks which I can’t name because I don’t want to give it away.

Kate is a highlight with her cute face and the director doesn’t fail to capture her beauty in a tasteful way, but she needed to gain about 12 lbs as her thinness is un-alluring.

On January 30, 1945, the United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas saved more than 500 POWs in the Japanese camp in the Philippines from certain death as the Japanese were ordered to ""liquidate"" all prisoners before evacuating in the face of MacArthur's advance. Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Max Martini, Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen and Marton Csokas star.

""The Great Raid"" was based on the books ""The Great Raid on Cabanatuan"" and ""Ghost Soldiers."" I've read the latter and it's interesting seeing the film for live-action visuals of what I saw in my head.

The rescue, along with the liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the POWs to share the truth about the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities. While the raid had no strategic value, as far as winning the war goes, it sparked a new wave of resolve in the war against Japan. Not to mention, it remains the most successful rescue mission in USA history.

Although the movie was shot in 2002, it was pulled from release schedule on several occasions before finally having a limited released in August, 2005, with little-to-no marketing. Was it any wonder it failed to garner an audience and box office success?

Be that as it may, this is a solid WW2 flick based on a true story. The prisoners of the camp are the survivors of the infamous 60-mile Bataan Death March of April, 1942. The movie's not politically correct in that it shows the truth of the brutal savagery of the Japanese military. The actual raid doesn't take place until the 95-minute mark, but it's worth the wait; the build-up is informational and keeps your attention.

While I wouldn't call it great, it's a well-done and informative war flick for those interested in the subject. It's even better if you've read either of the books on which it's based.

The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot in Bribie Island, Queensland, Australia, with the Manila sequences shot in Shanghai, China.

I found this 2004 flick to be comparatively more pleasant to watch, not in terms of a lack of violence or anything (there's plenty!) but more so just as a film in general - it feels more well made and a bit more progressive story-wise. It's still nothing perfect or anything that enthralled me at all, but I definitely class it highly (albeit minorly) than <em>'Pusher'</em>.

I would've preferred a sequel that followed up with Kim Bodnia's Frank, at least character-wise anyway as actor-wise Mads Mikkelsen is the one I'd prefer to watch instead. Mikkelsen puts in a good performance, 8 years on from his acting debut in the original. Away from Mads, Leif Sylvester Petersen is probably the standout - though all the support cast are pretty much level with each other to be honest.

I'm interested to see where the third and final flick from this series goes, given Mads Mikkelsen's absence and, from what I gather from the tiniest of look-ups out of pure nosiness, Kim Bodnia's continued disappearance. Viaplay recommended <em>'Pusher 3'</em> at the end of this film and their promo image features Zlatko Burić, so I know he makes it a hat-trick of appearances at least."

Their Elysian scenario prevails for a while but soon another insurrection looms in the form of ""Napoleon"" who sees their leader as weak and ineffectual. A coup ensues and gradually we see the emergence of a first amongst equals policy, then rules are arbitrarily altered, ostensibly for the good of the community then, yep - we are back with an overt dictatorship that spawns ideas of a little revolution now and again is a good thing. There are obvious parallels here with the decline of Imperial Russia (or even Bourbon France) being followed by a series of increasingly less benign dictators, and of the ultimate realisation that when you give people power, they will always want more. The animation uses the different animals to show strength - of body and/or will, well and the narration serves as a gentle tramline for what we can all see is the writing in the sand.

Should she not acquiesce to this perfectly reasonable request, then he has a pal on the ground who is all set to bump off her father ""Joe"" (Brian Cox). For the first half an hour, this is quite an effective thriller - the dynamic between the two, with her hemmed into her increasingly claustrophobic airline seat, helps build quite a decent sense of peril. Sadly, though, as she begins to fight back the scenario begins to lose it's potency. His complete control of the situation begins to become more and more compromised as serendipity takes just bit too much of an interest in the story for my liking. That's not to say that ""Lisa"" need be a shrinking violet in the face of her psychological oppressor, it's just that the fightback is all just a bit far-fetched, before a rather messy and unsatisfying ending that you just know is going to happen. Murphy can be quite an edgy character actor - he is an attractive man with a hint of something underhand (I think he'd make a good ""Bond"" villain) and McAdams is confident and competent - it's just the originality of the story that peters out and becomes predictably mediocre. || Red Eye is a solid thriller that builds tension well, especially in its first act. The slow-paced setup allows for strong character introductions, but it does feel like Rachel McAdams' character should have picked up on Cillian Murphy's unsettling presence sooner. The second act loses some momentum, with certain scenes dragging more than necessary, but Wes Craven's direction keeps the suspense alive. The final act is where the movie really kicks into gear, delivering a satisfying climax. The script does a good job of balancing psychological tension with action, though some moments require a suspension of disbelief—especially regarding in-flight conversations that seemingly go unnoticed by passengers.

Cinematography is straightforward but effective, using tight framing to enhance the claustrophobic feel of the setting. Cillian Murphy brings an eerie, controlled intensity, while McAdams carries the film well with a believable performance. The supporting characters don’t add much, and the film occasionally misdirects attention to elements that don’t pay off. The score complements the suspense but isn’t particularly memorable. While not groundbreaking, Red Eye is an entertaining, well-crafted thriller that works best when it leans into its psychological tension rather than its action."

When ""Georges"" starts receiving anonymous VHS cassettes things become much more tense and the strains on this family more pronounced. These tapes initially begin by surveilling their home, but gradually they become more penetrative and invasive. The police can't do anything and their neighbours have seen nothing untoward locally. Then he discovers what might just be a clue and that takes him to ""Majid"" (Maurice Bénichou) who lives with his grown-up son (Walid Afkir). It transpires that his family has history with this man. In fact, he is all but an half-brother to ""Georges"" and after a rather frank conversation he assures him that he has nothing to do with these intimidatory packages. When ""Pierrot"" makes an unscheduled overnight stay with a friend, the parents become frenzied and it looks like whoever has set out to wreck their lives might just have accomplished their task! Pretty much from the start, Auteuil is on good form as the man about to blow his top. His character is becoming more and more frustrated and his portrayal really counters well with Binoche's sparingly but potently delivered wife who is largely unaware of all the pieces of her husband's familial jigsaw as they fall into place. When tragedy strikes - only a matter of time - the tension is raised another notch, but will we ever discover who is doing what to whom? Or why? The backstory here is as important as what's going on presently, and that information isn't presented as fluidly as I'd have liked. We are not really given much information to go on, and when we are it is almost as if it's there to justify the plot we are seeing unfold rather than the other way around. That said, it's still quite a tensely directed and paced affair that is worth watching."

<em>'Valiant'</em> is a little hit-and-miss, however I think it just about makes for good viewing. The animation is, honestly, kinda crappy, though there are moments where it does look more than decent.

The plot is mostly predictable but I do actually quite like it, as it tells a story about war pigeons from WWII. It is amusing for the majority, even if the characters are strangely overtly horny too much.

The strongest part of this film is easily the cast, who are very good. Ricky Gervais (Bugsy) is the best voice on show, he is the ideal actor to play that role. There are many other familiar voices: Ewan McGregor (Valiant), John Cleese (Mercury), Jim Broadbent (Monty), Hugh Laurie (Gutsy) and Tim Curry (Von Talon); as well as one or two others.

No, but I look at this as a thumbs up or thumbs down thing, and it's getting thumbs up, sooo...disclaimer there.

I really liked this and I accept that I am in the minority. It has the Terry Gilliam comedic feel to it and it has the Terry Gilliam acid trip feel to it... and even at it's worst that is still absolutely entertaining and a pure joy to watch.

Someone mentioned wide angle work before and, yes, it has a lot of that wide angle close-up work that can only really be appreciated by people that thought they could out Thompson Hunter Thompson in their youth... wink wink nudge nudge, if you know what I mean.

The only real draw back is that Damon doesn't seem to fit in his role, and he doesn't really seem to fit in a Gilliam film...but surprisingly Ledger seems perfectly at home in that kind of world and you get the sense that he enjoyed acting the part as much as you are enjoying watching him act the part.

And then here and there you get a joke, a sight gag, a little hint that reminds you that, yeah, Gilliam was in Python wasn't he? That's something that you'd see in the Flying Circus shoved in there. Almost to the point where you can't but stop and wonder if he was channeling Idle or Chapman for some of the dialogue and physical humor.

It's a Gilliam film, made for adults, with Warner Brothers Cartoon violence. It's trippy and fun and it might not be your cup of tea, but I loved it. || Well it is a Terry Gilliam film so was always going to be a bit eccentric - but the idea that the legendary Brothers Grimm were actually grifters was actually quite an fun one. Assemble a couple of A-listers and we should have been flying. Except, well - we are not. Instead of having some amiable horseplay as they fleece the gullible and the unwitting, we find ""Jake"" (Heath Legder) and ""Will"" (Matt Damon) in a village where the children have all gone missing. The local grandee ""Gen. Delatombe"" (Jonathan Pryce) is on to their scamming and decides it's time to get them to prove their worth. Where are the sprogs? Well to save their necks, the not so dynamic duo have to deal with a seriously malevolent and fantastic foe in the ""Mirror Queen"" (the sparingly used Monica Bellucci) who wants to take over the world kind of thing. What now ensues are a series of typical Gilliam-esque escapades using a mediaeval backdrop to facilitate the borderline slapstick antics of the siblings trying to save their bacon. At times it is quite amusing offering some enjoyable parodies of established fairy tales, and the script does deliver a few entertaining quips as we go along but it seems unsure just who it's for. There's some darkness and good, old-fashioned, evil - but not enough of that. It's as if it was trying to be scary but hadn't quite the courage (to settle for a higher age rating, maybe?). As it is, it falls between two stools leaving us with an undercooked and overlong, slightly repetitious, series of frying pan to fire scenarios that even the engaging Ledger can't spin out for two hours. Damon doesn't really add much and Pryce is just in uniformed ham mode through his brief appearances. If you know the works of the brothers, it will make much more sense and some of it's observations about superstitions and the society in which the peasantry and gentry lived are quite witty, but they are all to often lost in a sea of mediocrity."

The premise is well worn, but that doesn't mean it has nothing to offer to the genre.  In theory at least.  The film plods along with characters announcing what they see in front of them, almost like they are performing an audio play.  Most of the film is all tell and no show, which is a mistake for the medium it is delivered in.

The B grade cast take what they are doing very seriously, and most of them are trying to do the best with the material they have.  Sadly the script is weak, there is almost zero character development and people are constantly behaving irrationally.  I know it's an action/horror, and no one ever acts normally in those films, but to have experienced salvage divers panicking so quickly when things go south is stupid and unrealistic.

Some of the design for the creatures are interesting and kinda cool, with surprisingly adequate CG for a B movie, and they are what elevates it from complete garbage to just not very good.  Unfortunately most of the action scenes are edited at such a frenetic pace that you almost have no idea what is happening.

Could have been worse, but probably should have been better than it was, maybe would have been better with a more seasoned director.  The biggest fault lies with the weak script though, so maybe it was always destined to be what it is.

A mathematical proof is a demonstration of this exactness. Math can also be, according to those who study it, beautiful – an art form even; in that sense, Proof is an aptly titled film in which mathematics overlaps with metaphysics, poetry and even faith.

Proof knows its characters’ field well enough to have a little fun with it (a character and his math department buddies have a band, and once of their songs is called “i”, as in ‘imaginary number;’ “They just stand there. They don't play anything for three minutes.”); on the other hand, it assumes at times, not entirely without reason, ignorance on the part of the audience. Now, I’ll confess that I didn’t know what a Germain prime was, but the characters do, so it’s a bit of awkward exposition when one explains it to another.

Other than this, director John Madden truly lucked out with this movie – which is not to say he didn’t have anything at all to do with the success of the material –; in addition to being based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning play, you simply can’t go wrong when you only have four characters and three of them are played by Hopkins, Gyllenhaal, and Paltrow. || This film quite succinctly sums up the characteristics of it's principal character. At times it's potent and at others it's a mess. It's all about ""Catherine"" (Gwyneth Paltrow) who together with her sister ""Claire"" (Hope Davis) are the daughters of acclaimed mathematician ""Robert"" (Sir Anthony Hopkins). Now he was borderline obsessed, in a clinical fashion, with his work writing a proof that will profoundly redefine thinking amongst his scientific community. Thing is, he's dead now and seems determined to ""haunt"" the life of his just as determined daughter (Paltrow) who, herself, treads a very thin line between reality and fantasy. Matters are exacerbated when one of his star pupils ""Hal"" (Jake Gyllenhaal) asks to look through their late father's papers and discovers something of monumental importance. Who wrote this, though - father or child or both? As the intensity grows for both sisters, their mental stability and their relationship is severely tested whilst the observing ""Hal"" (now the boyfriend of ""Catherine"") looks on somewhat dazed and confused as to what to do next as the narrative becomes increasingly peppered with historical familial flashbacks. Paltrow manages quite well with what must have been a difficult part and Davis does likewise as the loving sister who does not/did not share the all-consuming compulsion of her sibling and her dad. Some of the scenes between the two quite compellingly illustrate just how frustrations were growing as 'Catherine"" seems bent on a slippery slope to depression. Gyllenhaal hasn't very much to work with and isn't really much more than eye candy and with the odd intervention from Sir Anthony adding little meat to the bones, there's not really enough to hold the film together consistently.

At the time, Doom 3 was an obsession of mine that my parents could not break. They were semi-Christian, and when I got to the part in the game where pentagrams were spawning demons all over the place, I got nervous and told Mom. I was allowed to play any and all games, as long as they didn't involve demons or satanism. This was because, ostensibly, ""the demons could come out and influence your life in bad ways, and you don't want that."" So I had to return Doom 3. 

By the end of that year, I had all kinds of posters and magazines and memorabilia of Doom 3 in my room. An obsession is the only thing you can call it. I had everything Doom related you can think of, except the actual game. So when I heard about this movie, 12 Year Old Me obviously was all over it. And when I found out about they changed the plot from satanic monsters to Experiment Gone Wrong, you bet your ass I got my dad to take me to the local opening midnight screening of DOOM. One of my happiest memories. We were the only ones in the theater.

Fun movie. || Now you could watch this, I guess, I wouldn't stop you. But for a movie only a decade and change old, _Doom_ has dated **hard**, and it's not just 'cause of that garbage CGI.

Weird like the videogame it's based on, but still fucks up the lore that I can't see it sitting well with that crowd either. _Doom_ might genuinely have been made for no one.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Really good watch, will probably watch again, and can recommend.

Look, it's a movie based on a video game about shooting demons from hell.  It is far from perfect, it's probably a horrible Doom movie, but apart from that, this is a lot of fun.

It follows most of the zombie rules for infection, but the learning curve is one of the things that keeps the movie interesting as it drip feeds information as the infection gets out of control.

As great as the cast is with this one, it seems pretty clear from the beginning that the big billers, Dwayne Johnson and Karl Urban, are going to go head to head, whether it be against or back to back against monsters.

The monsters are done with great practical effects, they're creepy looking, and competitive with the available technology.  They're even used in creative ways.

When it comes down to it, the movie is fun, and a reliably good watch."

Firstly, it was one of the films that helped rocket forward the careers of both Ryan Reynolds (_Buried, Deadpool_) and Justin Long (_Accepted, Dodgeball, Jeepers Creepers_).

Secondly, it glorifies what is in my opinion the best American Comedy ever made, _Super Troopers_, as well as Kevin Smith (director of _Clerks I & II, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Dogma, Chasing Amy, Mallrats_)

Finally, it's an American Comedy movie, and I paid actual money for it. I then watched it. I've watched it before. I'll probably even watch it again. BOOM! This probably means nothing to anyone who's reading this (there's also probably nobody reading this) but regardless, it's quite a big deal.

Managing to take something as mundane as one day in a repetitive dead-end catering job, and make it even vaguely humorous is rather an achievement. You should watch it and play the other-other ""The Game"" (sidenote: I lost the game) like we used to in High School. 'Cause I'm classy like that.

Seriously though, and I can't believe my thoughts even as I'm typing this, but I honestly think Waiting... is an underrated American Comedy gem, maybe I'm just seeing that comparatively, or with the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, but I really do enjoy the film.

76%

-Gimly || Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

Granted it's a little raunchy, but it should be somewhat relatable to everyone.

This joins a movies like ""Clerks"" (basically any Kevin Smith movie), and ""The Concessionaires Must Die"" for it's fantastic dialogue and interesting characters.  Even if they're not ""good"" characters, each character has their own little gimmick that this awesome cast brings to life.

Not everyone can be Ryan Reynolds, Justin Long, Anna Faris or Luis Guzmán, but it all comes down to each and everyone's stellar delivery with the multitude of stories happening on top of each other.

The character is fairly serious and a few times comes out with an observation that is meaningful and believable. Like the comment to her grandfather that an old boyfriend of her mother only hit her Mom with words, like he did.

In some ways the story was predictable and the abusive boyfriend was almost just a stereotype. Then again, the reason we have cliches and stereotypes is that they are common in real life, but they could has shown a greater imagination in presenter atheist woman beater, for example.

This wasn't anywhere as bad as it could've been. The film is really split into two halves here with this one being basically helped greatly by its really good possession and shock scenes. The opening scene that sets her up to becoming possessed is one of it's best sequences, as the long hallway and the unearthly voices floating around give it an unearthly feel while the first scene in the classroom where she sees a demonic face appearing in the window through a cloud of mist and turns around to see a student's face turn into a distorted demon's face giving off an unearthly roar makes it quite shocking. Running out into the rain and seeing more demonic faces give off the same unearthly roar is a bit clichéd, but it still helps to sell the mood while the finale in the church giving this a quite creepy conclusion. The different manners of how she’s become afflicted are quite memorable moments with the frenzied bug-eating, speaking in tongues or just contorting her body into such impossible positions that it really becomes obvious something is wrong with her, and the long, suspenseful and chilling exorcism is the film's selling point, coming off with any number of creepy ideas and scenes in such a drawn-out style is one of the best scenes in the film. Otherwise, beyond the shocks and the exorcism, there isn't much else to like about it. Therefore, everything else in it doesn't really work which is only relegated to the courtroom battle drama. It's marketed as being a supernatural possession film, and the best moments come from those scenes, but the fact that the majority of the film is a courtroom battle with the supernatural elements coming in the form of flashbacks is a real misstep and is likely to confuse those coming in expecting the other kind of film. It's not that they're boring or anything, it's just that it's out of nowhere that it becomes that way, and it can be a disappointment. The fact that these are slow and really long don't help matters, extending this out far longer than it should. This could've easily been an hour and a half, or maybe a little longer, but the two hours running time forces it to keep the courtroom antics going for no reason other than to extend the running time. A few extraneous scenes could've been snipped as well, including the introductory scenes at the bar that repeat information we already know and also keep the running time going, and most of the time simply elicit a feeling of wanting to move along and get to the good scenes. These really harm the film.

Rated PG-13: Language, Mild Violence and intense demonic and spiritual themes. || **_Scares the hell out of ya_**

This was based on the actual story of a German girl who died while being exorcised in the late 1970s. The priest was then put on trial for neglectful homicide. Google it for details.

Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) plays an agnostic who defends the priest (Tom Wilkinson) while the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) is a believer. This creates some problems: How can an unbeliever defend a believer who performs a service that apparently kills the young woman? How can a believer come against another believer who was simply trying to deliver the girl from spiritual malevolence?

The prosecutor makes the case that the woman was ill with various mental disorders and that the exorcism was just a bunch of superstitious mumbo jumbo. By contrast, Erin Bruner argues that these illnesses were the RESULT OF possession -- that the girl's possession brought on the symptoms. This makes sense in light of the scriptural evidence of Jesus Christ delivering people from evil spirits who induced insanity, muteness and deafness.

Another important argument of the defense is that a potent drug that Emily was prescribed trapped her in a mode that was resistant to the exorcism.

The fascinating story provokes many questions. We need to take an honest look at our mental health practices and institutions. Although there are some genuinely good people working in this field who care about the patients, it seems that the best we can do is drug people and make them, more or less, numbed-up living zombies or even mindless vegetables. Unfortunately this is how they're damned to live the rest of their lives, subservient and dependent on the mental health establishment (that actually needs them to stay ill in order to exist).

Such people don't need more drugs and ""therapy."" What they need is delivered. They need delivered from evil spiritual powers that have possessed them. They need FREED. Don't mistake me here, I'm not against mental health people or facilities because I realize they're just doing what they know to do. It's just not working. Again, the mentally ill need delivered not force-fed more drugs and essentially locked-up for the rest of their lives. That's not life, it's living death!

Of course, releasing a horde of religious wackos into our mental institutions isn't the answer. Yet, what if some believers who walked in the boldness and authority of Jesus Christ were available, people who show documented evidence of DELIVERING the mentally ill? The New Testament relays case after case of Jesus Christ exorcising demons from hundreds of people, maybe thousands. He didn't numb 'em up and sentence them to a life of living death. Rather he came to set the prisoners free from darkness, heal the sick and heal the brokenhearted! If there are people out there who walk in this same anointing of power and freedom, shouldn't we allow them to minister to our mentally ill?

Unfortunately a large percentage of the church is very weak in regards to spiritual deliverance. Except for offering eternal salvation, which is wonderful, their gospel is powerless and next to worthless. Yet this wasn't the way of the early Church. Paul, Peter and others offered total deliverance. Thankfully, there are still a remnant of these types of believers and these are the ones who can help our mentally ill, as long as the oppressed WANT freedom, healing and deliverance (since some WANT to stay dependent and ""cared for"").

I'm only raising such moral/theological/philosophical questions because the film provokes it. So please don't be irked at me for getting all heavy and theological.

Despite the numerous courtroom scenes (which I'm not a fan of) there are certainly enough horrifying elements in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" to please most horror fans, just don't expect Freddy or Jason shenanigans.

Interestingly, while it's horrifying ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is also somehow warm and faith-affirming, even sometimes beautiful.

My only criticism is a theological theory introduced late in the movie. This theory is incredible wrong. I won't elaborate except to say that God would never allow the option of Emily's possession as a supposed testimony to the world of the existence of dark spiritual powers, rather the God's purpose is always to deliver such people, which not only testifies to the existence of the malevolent powers but, more importantly, sets the person FREE and gives glory to the Almighty.

The film runs 119 (the unrated version 122 minutes) and was shot in Vancouver, BC.
