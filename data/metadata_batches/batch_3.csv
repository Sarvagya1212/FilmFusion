<em>'The Barefoot Executive'</em> begins in entertaining fashion, as it sets up the plot with Steven (Kurt Russell) and chimp Raffles. It's all enjoyable enough, it's a cool and amusing concept. The first act is good.

However, after a middling middle act it then produces a relatively terrible third act - with unnecessary focus put on the characters of Joe Flynn (Francis) and Wally Cox (Mertons). They definitely didn't know how to end this, the final lot of scenes are so pointless and predictable. That's a shame, as the opening chunk of the film is more than up to scratch.

Russell gives another acceptable performance, Flynn is actually pretty solid when his character isn't shoehorned upfront. Heather North is alright as Jennifer, if a little plain. The chimp is as cute as you'd expect.

It looked like a film that I would thoroughly like at first, sadly it got comparatively worse as it went on. I would still say it's better than a lot of other works from Disney, it just could've/should've been greater."

RELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR) is about the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from June 6-16, 1944. The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.

No one's supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.

In between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn't find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I've seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie, e.g. the original ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).

Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps.

In light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as ""the greatest war movie ever made."" Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired.

I've heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken ""verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion."" I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father’s stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it’s resolved (ooh, the Captain’s a high school teacher, whoopee).

Nevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can’t beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 49 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France. WRITER: Robert Rodat.

GRADE: C+/B- || This movie should be known for changing Historical War Dramas as we know them. It was the first to accurately depict the carnage of war, and changed the direction of this genre of movies for all time. The initial D-Day scene was fantastic. Afterwards, Tom Hanks is ordered to chose a team of his men and look for James MacGuffin Ryan from Iowa. In order to achieve this goal, Hanks takes us across the entire back drop of world war 2, all the while making us ask, is all this worth  just one man?

Honestly it's a must watch and is on my ""Difinitive Movie List"" || I watched this movie during a project at school. Saving Private Ryan was a beautiful and, above all, realistic film. The film presented in a realistic way how the war went then. Most of the film was set in Europe in 1944. The story is that American soldiers are being sent to Europe to fight against the Germans. The American boy James Francis Ryan is sent to Europe with his brothers as a soldier. After the invasion of Normandy it appears that all his other brothers have already died and he is the only one left. That is why corporal Miller is instructed to look for him and return him home.
The main actors who play in the film are Tom Hanks who plays corporal Miller and Matt Damon who plays the soldier Ryan. You also have all the soldiers in the group of corporal Miller. I think the characters in the film are very well thought out because they contain characters that are very brave, but also characters who have a hard time in the war. With this they show that not every soldier was as heroic as everyone thought.
The film was made on a set that I thought looked very realistic. In the background you saw the buildings that were about to collapse and the shots. I also really liked the sound that came with the film. For example, when a tank arrived, you heard that it was slowly approaching."

I'm genuinely not even sure, but it's hard to doubt that it does suitably entertain.

It constantly hops between cringe/chucklesome and overacted/finely acted. The plot is mindless and impossible to take seriously, though the shenanigans that occur are mostly amusing. It would be a lot worse off without the likeable leads, that's for certain.

Peter Ustinov brings fun as Blackbeard, sometimes his acting is a little too over the top for my personal liking but he has more funny moments than lame ones. He and Dean Jones (Steve) join up well enough, as does Jones with Suzanne Pleshette (Jo Anne) - as already seen two years prior in <em>'The Ugly Dachshund'</em>.

Not what I had expected, I come away probably wanting something different from <em>'Blackbeard's Ghost'</em>. However, there is humour in there that's just about enjoyable. || Dean Jones (""Steve Walker"") arrives at Godolphin College to take charge of their pretty shocking track team. They put him up at ""Blackbeard's Inn"" where he encounters the Daughters of The Buccaneers - allegedly descendants of ""Blackbeard"" and his crew.

This is a fun fantasy adventure; Ustinov is great as the mischievous and recalcitrant ghost having quite a good time with all the people and mod cons of 1960s America - especially as only Jones can see him. It's a bit slapstick at times, and pretty uncomplicated - so don't expect your grey matter to be unduly taxed; it's just best to let the talent wash over you and smile occasionally at the really pretty basic, but acceptable, SFX."
14612.0,Candleshoe,"When ex-con artist Harry claims that a secret treasure is hidden inside Candleshoe, an English estate, he creates an elaborate plan to find and steal the prize.

<em>'Candleshoe'</em> starts in a greater manner than it finishes, but the full duration is entertaining. The early scenes are, for this era of Disney live-action at least, actually quite unusual, I wasn't fully sure where the story was going at first - which is a positive. Once everything becomes clearer, it does lose the slight edge it has at the beginning.

The cast, meanwhile, are very good. Jodie Foster (Casey) gives another strong performance from her early years, while David Niven is excellent as Priory. Leo McKern is also splendid in his role as Harry. They all work together really well. Elsewhere, you have some nice music from Ron Goodwin.

My only criticism would be the end few scenes, which round off all too quickly and don't show important parts to portray how they exactly got to where they are; notably between Casey and Gwendolyn. That aside, I'd certainly recommend this. || A wonderful, gentle, spin on the ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" tale with a great ensemble cast. David Niven always did thrive in the less-is-more style of acting and here it is never better displayed. Jodie Foster - an American street-urchin is engaged by unscrupulous gold-digger ""Mr. Bundage"" (Leo McKern) to travel to England where she is to impersonate the long lost grand-daughter of the Marchioness of St. Edmund (Helen Hayes) and help him to discover the whereabout of a hidden treasure of pirate doubloons. She duly arrives and ingratiates herself with the old woman. Soon though, she discovers that much of it is a façade; the house is mortgaged to the hilt with the delightful Niven (""Priory"") being butler, gardener, chauffeur - just about everything as they attempt to keep the alarming truth of their fiscal predicament from Hayes. As you might expect, Foster turns tables on her crooked mentor and what follows is a fun, comedy adventure with a suitably happy ending. It's all done in the best tradition of Disney - an engaging and light-hearted celebration of decency and humanity winning out..."

The rest of the cast aren't all that remarkable, even if there are a load of faces I recognise from other things. If I had to choose the most noteworthy, they would be Cesar Romero (Arno) & William Schallert (Quigley).

The plot is enjoyable, it's just as bonkers as you'd expect given it's in a similar vein to films like 1961's <em>'The Absent-Minded Professor'</em>. I'd say it's better executed than that Flubber premise. There's also a cool chase sequence in this, too.

<em>'The Cat from Outer Space'</em> is mundane. The concept of an alien cat invading is cool, but they choose to do it in a way that is boring - the cat, Jake, speaks via voiceover only, so there are many shots of the cat just staring whilst Ronnie Schell speaks. That just doesn't work, to get attached/become interested in a character you need emotion and/or expression... you get none of that here. I never cared for Jake, and that's coming from someone who loves cats.

Also with the plot they spend most of the time focusing on the cat helping the humans with dull things, like betting and freezing people. Quite inconsistently too, there's a number of times where the cat could solve their problem instantly but they avoid using him for some reason. It's only at the end when they, truly, tackle the overall story arc - which itself is held back by the (understandably, I guess) lame special effects.

Cast-wise it's very flat, none of them are particularly bad but they all give forgettable performances - even Harry Morgan (Stilton), who has done some fine things for Disney in these early decades.

I can think of at least ten worse live-action flicks from this studio up until 1978, but that's not to say this is anything worth watching - it isn't, unfortunately."

<em>'Condorman'</em> is nothing spectacular or entirely memorable, but it does produce a sufficiently fun 90 minutes. It crosses a whole host of countries, something I like when films do. With that said, in this it feels too broken up. One minute we're in Turkey, then Italy, then Monaco. It doesn't feel like the characters have travelled to me, it's too disjointed.

Michael Crawford (Woody) and Barbara Carrera (Natalia) are solid together, none of the others particularly stand out. Some of Condorman's gadgets/gimmicks are kinda neat, while there's one enjoyable chase sequence in there too.

Emilio Estevez remains the only actor really worth mentioning, the children and villains are very forgettable in this one. Some of the plot lines don't go far either, namely with María Ellingsen's character. There are also a few missing faces from the 1992 film, including Casey (Heidi Kling); her stuff involving son Charlie (Joshua Jackson) is ignored.

Of course it is slightly hampered by the fact it's a Disney film, but I feel it manages to leave a mark in what it does tackle in regards to the premise. I felt attached to the dilemma that Max (Elliott Gould) faces, despite it being a fairly predictable situation.

Gould is good in the lead role. He is joined by, um, Bill Cosby, who suitably plays a character from the less appealing afterlife. Julie Budd (Stella) is the best of the rest, especially when it comes to the music; she's got a great voice.

Disney's best film up until this point of the 1980s, which they begin poorly. Happy with this one though, I like it."

The special effects haven't aged amazing, yet they still suitably serve the intended purpose.

Joey Cramer is good in the lead role as David, while Paul Reubens is fairly amusing as Max. A young Sarah Jessica Parker (Carolyn) also appears. The film doesn't quite hit the intended heartfelt spots with the plot, but there is an element of care for David from me in there minorly; if only at the end.

Decent Disney. || This has stood the test of time remarkably well since it was released in 1986. Aside from a rather dated synthesised soundtrack, it's still quite a fun sci-fi adventure.

The police soon reunite him with his parents but where has he been for the last eight years? Scientists decide to prod and poke him, and that's when he discovers they have a space ship - and that ship is calling to him. Once onboard, he realises that he was an experiment that went wrong for the ship's super computer - but can they sort it all out and get the youngster back to the correct timeline before the authorities catch up?

The story is a simple family-friendly affair, with adequate visual effects as the ship changes shape, travels underwater, at high speed, etc. I like watching this every now and again - it has a inquisitive good-nature to it that makes for a good watch."
14140.0,Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo,"Herbie, the Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own, is racing in the Monte Carlo Rally.

Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) and his new mechanic (Don Knotts) take Herbie to France to compete in the Monte Carlo Rally where Herbie falls for the car of a female racer (Julie Sommars). Meanwhile thieves steal a valuable diamond and hide it in Herbie’s gas tank.      

""Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo"" (1977) brings back Dean Jones minus Michele Lee and Buddy Hackett, but Sommars and Knotts are fine in the corresponding roles. I like the switch to Europe, which is very scenic, but the way the fantasy elements are handled is lousy. This is easily my least favorite of the series.     

The best ones for me are “Herbie Goes Bananas” (1980), “The Love Bug” (1997) and “Herbie Fully Loaded” (2005) with the 1997 one arguably being my favorite because it has a compelling story that features the Dark Herbie and Alexandra Wentworth.

The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes and was shot in Paris & Monte Carlo, France, but also Laguna Seca Raceway, Monterey, California.

GRADE: C || Dean Jones (""Jim"") returns to the driving seat for this third instalment of the adventures of ""Herbie"" and though more akin to the daftness of the first story, this is a bit of struggle to wade through. After twelve years since their last race, they return to take part in the world renowned Monte Carlo Rally. What they don't know, though, is that ""Quincey"" (Roy Kinnear) and his mate ""Max"" (Bernard Fox) have stashed some gems in the gas tank. Obviously, they are going to stop at nothing to get them back. To further complicate matters, ""Herbie"" has taken a bit of a shine to the car driven by ""Diane"" (Julie Sommars) just as ""Jim"" has fallen for her - with neither of them exactly hitting it off. Can they thwart the jewel thieves and find true love before the final race down the Parisian Champs-Élysées? Jacques Marin steals his scenes as the double-dealing police inspector struggling to comprehend what appears to be unfolding in front of him, and there are plenty of standard car chase and ""Herbie"" antics to enjoy - but I think it's safe to say we've seen it all before and this story gets more and more silly and contrived as it meanders along for an overlong 1¾ hours of dodgy French accents. It's watchable, but there's way too much dialogue (especially from sidekick ""Wheely"" (Don Knotts) and the whole thing isn't really very memorable."
12129.0,Herbie Goes Bananas,The adorable little VW helps its owners break up a counterfeiting ring in Mexico.,"Yes, We Have A Bananza!","Fantasy, Comedy, Family, Adventure",93,1980-06-25,en,5.296,235,1.4485,"Cloris Leachman, Charles Martin Smith, John Vernon, Stephen W. Burns, Elyssa Davalos",Vincent McEveety,"mexico, chase, sequel, criminal syndicate, private detective, volkswagen beetle, counterfeiting ring, bananas, latin america","**_Madcap misadventures with Herbie in Latin America_**

Jim Douglas’ nephew (Stephen W. Burns) inherits Herbie, but has to pick the car up in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, with his mechanic friend (Charles Martin Smith) wherein they meet a mischievous little pickpocket that Herbie takes a liking to. John Vernon and Richard Jaeckel appear as dastardly villains while Harvey Korman plays a nutty cruise ship captain with Cloris Leachman & Elyssa Davalos on hand as passengers.     

""Herbie Goes Bananas"" (1980) is my favorite of the original four Herbie flicks. The amusing story is more compelling than the previous three and the star-studded cast is noteworthy with everyone giving it their all, especially Korman and Leachman. The cast were having a good time and it shows. A highlight is that this one shows Herbie talking, albeit cute car-language, not English. 

Meanwhile Elyssa Davalos is the most beautiful female to be featured in the Herbie franchise up to this point, plus there are several beauties in the periphery.

The next film would be the rebooted TV movie “The Love Bug” (1997), which is my favorite of the series, followed by the excellent “Herbie Fully Loaded” (2005). I favor the 1997 one because it’s the most compelling plus features the Dark Herbie and Alexandra Wentworth.

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in Mexico (Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara & Tijuana), Panama (Panama Canal & Panama City) and the Los Angeles area (Ventura and Burbank).

GRADE: B || Couldn't they just have let poor old ""Herbie"" go get pampered in a motor museum somewhere? Plenty of Castrol GTX and some luxury screen wash? Nope - we had to drag him along to get involved in some dodgy Mexican counterfeit malarkey. He's been inherited by ""Pete"" (Stephen W. Burns) who is frankly a little disappointed that he's not a Ferrari. Together with his pal ""D.J."" (Charles Martin Smith) they soon discover that ""Herbie"" is a car with a mind of his own, and so determine to enter him in a race in Brazil. It's on their way that they get hustled by the hugely annoying ""Paco"" (Joaquin Garay III) and in trying to get their wallets back, discover they are now immersed in a crime ring led by ""Prindle"" (John Vernon) who is after a secret photograph the got pinched by the same urchin from his own wallet. The fleeing child takes refuge in ""Herbie"" who takes refuge on an ocean liner heading to Panama. This voyage gives ""Aunt Louise"" (Cloris Leachman) a chance to pair off handsome ""Pete"" with her bookish neice ""Melissa"" (Elyssa Davalos) and pretty soon we are all juggling way too many plates as this glorified edition of the ""Dukes of Hazard"" fails to get out of second gear. There are a few moments that raise a smile from the Bligh-esque ship's captain ""Blythe"" who has a hang 'em and flog 'em ethos that could have been usefully used on the writers of this banal and unnecessary outing for our VW that I found really struggled. It's peppered with the usual car chase and slapstick antics, but please now, no more...."

Even as a child of the 90's I had never seen Hocus Pocus and knew little of it, so I had no prior attachments to this film. If you have seen any of the Disney Channels terrible made for TV movies, Hocus Pocus is like a particularly bad one with some questionable language and sexual innuendo. The acting is really bad from the entire cast, which is a little surprising considering the witches (who I had always assumed you the heroes of the story, but are clearly not) are two D-List actresses (Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy) and a C-lister (Sarah Jessica Parker) who aren't exactly known for their acting abilities, but are actual professional actresses. The CG effects are bad, even considering this is a 1993 movie and the practical effects aren't even an honest effort. All of this could be forgiven if it was part of a fun, campy family movie, but Hocus Pocus can't even pull that off. The plot is lame and full of inconsistencies and just unreasonably unrealistic moments. The witches have been ""dead"" for 300 years, but will be brought back if a virgin lights the black flame candle. In 1990 a high school boy says multiple times publicly that he is a virgin. Let me just say that again, they think a high school boy would go around announcing himself to be a virgin repeatedly to his peers. This is a public high school in Massachusetts in the 90's, not a Mormon town or a private Catholic school. When the witches return, they have been gone for 300 years and don't even know what the paved road is, thinking it to be a river or what a bus is; they have no knowledge of any of the advances since the 1600's. Having established this, one of the witches flies up to the side of a car on their broom and asks him for his license and registration. So, they don't understand asphalt, but they know motorist jokes? The movie is littered with inconsistencies and a wild lack of understanding of how teenagers and children think and act. Even the three witches can't maintain a consistent character. Bette Midler is supposed to be the smart older sister, but she acts the most irrationally and whines like a child. Sarah Jessica Parker is a horny dumb blonde and Kathy Najimy is a mentally challenged woman who barks an talks out of the side of her mouth, but they are always the ones to reason and plan. Najimy is the worst, with her constantly swinging from offensively stupid the brains of the operation. This was an actual movie released in theaters. Had it been a cheap Disney Channel original, it would still be terrible, but excusable. As a real theatrical film, Hocus Pocus is embarrassing. Unless you grew up with this film, I can't imagine you getting much out of this. It's fairly unoffensive children's drivel, with some questionable language if that's all you need, but it's not a good film. It wasn't fun or interesting and it was probably best left in '93. || Good.

<em>'Hocus Pocus'</em> is a fairly amusing film about witches from the Salem trials era, not that it hasn't any real connection to those events. It's very much a fun fantasy film, which looks pretty neat by the way.

Bette Midler (Winifred), Kathy Najimy (Mary) and Sarah Jessica Parker (Sarah) play three witch sisters. They are main reason why the film is as enjoyable as it is, all are entertaining but Midler is definitely the pick of the bunch. The trio of younger actors in Omri Katz (Max), Thora Birch (Dani) and Vinessa Shaw (Allison) are OK, nothing special but passable.

I didn't fully connect or like the plot itself, but it's one that suits everything else on screen well so it kinda works to be honest. All in all, for me, this is a solid, mid-range production from Disney. || Bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

Sometimes it is fun to get in the way back machine to visit ""classic"" movies, but they don't always hold up.  And in some cases, like this, it is a wonder they EVER worked at all.  Especially that it is a 1993 Disney movie and focuses on sex, plus a lot of witch lore being based on women being sexual in a time where it was so inappropriate they would be burnt at the stake.  I digress.

While the Sanderson sisters are a compelling premise, if sloppy, and an interesting metaphor for the desires of power, hunger, and sex, it goes to an almost cartoonish levels of ridiculous for next to no reasoning.

All the non witch cast do a fine job, and I especially liked Thora Birch's performance, I can see why she took off so well.  As for the witch cast, I have no doubt they did was in the script very well, but the script is overly ridiculous, and even just trying to relax there are jokes that make no sense and just aren't all that funny.

Ultimately it comes down to being a Halloween themed sub-par Babysitter's Club, or your choice of child adventure groups."

However, I did find myself enjoying it, albeit on a minor level. There are a few amusing moments, while it does create some interesting shenanigans with the big kid.

Rick Moranis is the only cast member worth talking about, he doesn't give an incredible performance or anything close but remains - just like in the 1989 production - the best part of the film.

I expected it to be terrible, it's actually alright - not one to be taken at all seriously, it's purely childish.

How can they reduce him back to normal before the lights of Vegas attract him and even more chaos ensues? I suppose it's quite fun to look at things through the eyes of a small child - everything is bright, colourful and an intriguing plaything - but so much of the execution of this reminded me of a 1960s Godzilla film with really quite forced humour emanating from some cringeing performances and some seriously contrived attempts at keeping this from degenerating into a slapstick farce of a film. Moranis worked OK as the family-orientated geek last time around, here there is something almost desperate about his attempts to please. His bosses, his family, us... I think this genre works best when there's something natural to it, we smile or laugh because we want to, not because the director has left convenient moments where someone off-set would hold up a board. I'm not sure this ever really had any sequel value, but this is a feeble attempt I'm afraid and please let's keep ""Wayne"" away from any more gizmos."

It's just, the practical effects weren't that great and kind of cheap, even in 89, because they figured... kid movie.

Unfortunately such rapidly outdated sentiments as these will undoubtedly ring hollow for many people, but in any case the miniaturised children in jeopardy here are the main focus - the backyard itself has never looked so daunting before - and their adventures are filled with varying degrees of action and danger and fun making this a solid slice of family entertainment which showcases the forementioned traditional values to illustrate what we would like life to be, so it is a shame the reality we see around us each day is completely different."

I mostly like the adventure elements, as they cross land and sea in search of castaways. Despite that, I never properly felt attached to the story as the aforementioned isn't stitched together well with the characters and their motives/feelings. It's also paced too slow, at least for me.

As noted, Chevalier (Paganel) and Hyde-White (Lord Glenarvan) are solid in their respective roles, if only due to their amusing moments both together and on their own with the younger cast members; who aren't all that memorable, Hayley Mills (Mary) is the standout if I had to pick one.

The film hasn't aged beautifully in regards to the effects, a load of the scenes look rather awful nowadays but I can always let that pass in these older films; it's still worth noting, that's all. Away from that you have a few musical numbers, the ones featuring Paganel are pretty good.

I feel giving it less than this rating would be harsh, I definitely didn't enjoy it but I can see how others might. || _**Ridiculous set-bound Disney adventure with Hayley Mills**_

In Scotland, a sister (Hayley Mills) and her little brother team-up with a French professor (Maurice Chevalier), a shipping magnate (Wilfrid Hyde-White) and his son (Michael Anderson, Jr.) to search for the siblings’ missing father, a sea captain. Their journey first takes them to Patagonia, South America, where they have misadventures in the Andes of Chile and the Pampas of Argentina. But, eventually, they realize they must travel to Australia and New Zealand to find the missing castaways. 

""In Search of the Castaways"" (1962) combines Hayley Mills with a Jules Verne adventure, which made me expect a combination of “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” (1954) or “Mysterious Island” (1961) with “The Parent Trap” (1961). Wrong. This movie is nowhere near the same league as those great films, even though it’s a Disney production like “20,000 Leagues” and “The Parent Trap.” 

One problem is the too-cutesy take on the material wherein the professor & others are beaming with giggly smiles during life-or-death situations. While this disappears for the most part after the first act it’s still an eye-rolling issue. Another hitch is that the whole flick is set-bound with F/X of the matte painting and miniature variety. Another problem is the preposterous nature of the journey and misadventures thereof, which I’m sure bears little resemblance to Verne’s original tale.

Lousy writing is reflected in how several minutes are blown on tediously discussing the dubious message in the bottle. This idiotic element of the script could’ve been thrown out altogether with no harm done.  

On the positive side, bubbly Hayley Mills was 15 during filming and clearly blossoming into a winsome woman. She looks best in the first half with her semi-tight khaki pants. I liked the jaguar and Maoris too; and there are some fun moments but, otherwise, this is strictly for the 6-and-under crowd. 	

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot at Pinewood Studios, just west of London, England.

The only real issues I have with this are the effects and some of the pacing, the latter is quite slow around the midway mark.

Moving onto the cast. Jim Dale does a great job playing not one, not two but three characters! It's actually rather impressive, though the effects used for when Billy and Eli are 'next to each other' are rather poor. Still, big credit to Dale.

The film is basically split into three viewpoints: Billy & Eli, Jasper (Dale) & Mansfield (John Williams) and Sheriff (Don Knotts) & Rattlesnake (Jack Elam). Surprisingly, they make it work. I liked following all the shenanigans that they each got up to.

I also rate the music used. All in all, an entertaining film that I would definitely recommend."

This does unfortunately have yet more questionable care of animals, but it's definitely less prevalent than in their previous animal-themed productions.

As with <em>'Nikki, Wild Dog of the North'</em> and <em>'The Legend of Lobo'</em>, this is practically a documentary with added story. I didn't like those aforementioned films as I felt they were too boring and a tad all over the place, but this 1963 release finds a better balance between storytelling and nature.

There are more prominent roles for humans in this, with Émile Genest again portraying a role as he did in Nikki. Rex Allen narrated Lobo and does so again here. Zero special from the humans, Allen is good though.

It's maybe a bit on the long side, it does take a while to get up an head of steam - but once we get going, it is at the better end of the genre. || The Negotiator is one of those classic thrillers that still holds up well today. The plot is engaging from the start, throwing you into a tense, high-stakes standoff where trust and deception play a big role. The pacing is solid, though it stretches a bit in parts, but the setup and execution make up for it. 

F. Gary Gray's direction keeps the tension tight, balancing action and drama without overcomplicating things. The cinematography isn't flashy, but it works well in capturing the claustrophobic feel of the hostage situation, making you feel right there with the characters.

What really makes this movie stand out is the acting. Samuel L. Jackson delivers an intense, gripping performance that makes it easy to connect with his character and root for him. Kevin Spacey plays off him perfectly, creating a dynamic where their back-and-forth feels natural and engaging. 

The supporting cast is strong too, though some characters feel a bit underdeveloped. The script does a good job keeping the dialogue sharp and the tension high, but at times, it leans into familiar tropes that might feel predictable.

The score and sound design do their job well, enhancing the mood without being too overpowering. While the soundtrack isn't particularly memorable, the way sound is used to heighten key moments is effective. 

Overall, The Negotiator is a well-crafted thriller with strong performances and a gripping story. It might not be flawless, but it delivers where it counts, making it an easy movie to rewatch and appreciate."

As far as remakes go, this one has a lot to offer for both the adults and kids. The humor and hijinks are hilarious and very well-done, similar to ""Home Alone"" and ""Dennis the Menace"". The cast does a good job portraying their characters and there are times you can feel the emotions they are going through. It's a wonderful remake and a very good film from Walt Disney Pictures. Highly Recommended. || Really good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

Having recently watched the original, this movie does a rather nice job of following it beat for beat.  Now, it's not the same movie, but it follows the same format, with modernization and punch-ups throughout the movie.  

As someone who complains about deviation from the source material, I approve the changes here.  Sadly, they kept the twins carrying the movie, which means Lindsay Lohan was doing double work, but you could hardly tell.  The green screen and clone work in this is actually really well done for late 1990's.

The most important aspect is that the movie retained its charm in re-uniting a lost / separated family. || Entertaining and sweet. Just as good as the 1961 original, which probably edges this ever so slightly but they are both terrific films.

1998's <em>'The Parent Trap'</em> features Lindsay Lohan in the dual role, she is excellent as Hallie and Annie - Hayley Mills from '61 would be my pick as the sisters, but again it's a tremendous piece of casting.

It's also a tight call between the parents, with Dennis Quaid (Nick) and Natasha Richardson (Liz) in those roles here - they have believable chemistry, which is key. Elsewhere in this '98 remake, Elaine Hendrix (Meredith) and Lisa Ann Walter (Chessy) are good.

The camera work et al. is impressive. Though, just like the first film, the run time could probably have been shorter. Not that that's a big negative, as this film is very much enjoyable to watch. Recommended."

Despondent, she heads to the cinema to see the “The Purple Rose of Cairo” only for it’s star “Tom” (Jeff Daniels) to quite literally leap off the screen at her and soon her world is in turmoil. It’s not just her, neither. The studio is complaining that he is doing exactly the same in cinemas all over the shop. That gives “Cecilia” quite a quandary as she knows this man of her dreams cannot be real, whilst the rest of the nation wants to know what happens at the end of the movie - and without it’s star, well we can never find out! What is “Tom” going to decide, too? He is quite taken by his time amongst us non-celluloid types, but… I am not really much of a fan of Daniels, but he works well here as this comedy works on quite a few different levels.

It’s monochrome photography, Dick Hyman’s quirky score and a charming chemistry between an on form, flighty, Farrow and Daniels all contributes to another piece of gentle nostalgia from a Woody Allen who is very much at the top of his game and from a Stuart Wurtzel whose production design is engaging and sympathetic to the era and to the gently poignant and often quite witty dialogue.

After all, this is a movie about protecting the working class, about saving factories, about the devastation that outsourcing does to communities... and, as of writing this in 2019, Moore is siding with the party that wants to outsource jobs, that refuses to protect labor, and that calls any protecting of domestic labor evil and nationalist. And all of this while Moore himself just called the working class dangerous and implied that they are all evil racists for not supporting the party that is currently against protecting labor.

What the heck happened to Michael Moore? He kind of turned his back on the people that made him famous.

Regardless, once upon a time, as far back as Roger & Me and as recently as Capitalism: A Love Story, Michael Moore supported the working class. He made documentaries about their plight. He championed them.

This started it all.

Before Michael Moore traded people for party he made movies like this that showed the devastation that NAFTA economic policies did to the rust belt. He was a friend of the people.

Now he calls the Rust Belt ""Trumpland"" and the people he once championed ""racists.""

But back in the day, he was able to make films like this that advocated for the people. He was able to make films like this that fought for the working class. Once upon a time, he was fighting for us, he was giving us hope.

678.0,Out of the Past,The peaceful life of a gas station owner is disrupted when a man from his past arrives in town and forces him to return to the dark world he had tried to escape.,"OUT of the Sun, OUT of the Moonlight, OUT of the Past.","Crime, Thriller, Mystery",97,1947-11-25,en,7.619,612,1.6029,"Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, Kirk Douglas, Paul Valentine, Virginia Huston",Jacques Tourneur,"small town, gas station, suppressed past, gangster, detective, deaf-mute, briefcase, deception, femme fatale, partner, film noir, black and white, double cross, tax evasion, framed for murder","www.noiroftheweek.com


Out of the Past is the masterpiece of film noir. Combining actors, writer, director, composer and cinematographer at their peaks makes what could have easily been a forgotten B movie a great film.

The cast is just about perfect. The trifecta of Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer and Kirk Douglas isn't just a winning combination but one necessary for the film's success. Replace any of the three and the film becomes just another thriller. Mitchum as the private detective shows a slouched-over vulnerability behind an indifferent exterior that's both believable and tragic. Jane Greer is beautiful and charming. She spends most of the time looking up at Mitchum with her doe eyes - transforming the cool and laconic PI into a love sick sucker with just a bat of her eyelashes. Douglas – not yet a movie star- is rigidly confident, young enough to be Mitchum's rival and so sure of himself that it's scary.

Casting rumors had Dick Powell in the lead role at one time. I just can't see him pulling off the rugged outdoorsman by the lake Mitchum does. Also, I find Mitchum to be more like Bogart. He's cool and confident until he meets up with the woman that will be his demise. Bogart would have approached Kathie Moffat with caution, however. Mitchum is heads-over-heels for her the second she makes that angelic-like walk into the Acapulco bar out of the bright sunlight. When he utters, “Baby, I just don't care.” after their romance gets hot and sticky in Mexico you know it's the truth. He really doesn't care if she's manipulating him. As long as he can be with her he's fine. Whenever there's backstabbing or dumping to do it's done by femme fatale Kathie. And Jeff (Mitchum) knows it.

Explaining the plot of Out of the Past would be a chore and frankly the film's plot isn't meant to be clear. It's a dream-like puzzle that Mitchum is walking through. It's the journey from present, past and present again all the way to the fatalistic ending is what makes the film so interesting. It's not about the mystery. The same could be said for The Big Sleep. A brilliant movie that both writer and director had no idea who the killer was. That wasn't the point.

Out of the Past is a collection of great scenes at different locations with a number of different sub plots. Determined to understand the plot, I took notes watching the DVD a few years ago and was surprised to see that the movie becomes a totally different film just about a third of the way through. Try to explain that to a screenwriting class.

Most of the film doesn't even look film noir. The uncloudy High Sierra country and summery Mexico seem too bright for noir. Later the story does drift into the familiar rain soaked streets of the city – with cigarette-sharing cabbies and seedy night clubs. Markham noted in his previous article on Out of the Past the contrast “between the bright and sunny world of Bridgeport and the dark, corrupt streets of San Francisco.” Nicholas Musuraca uses that over and over again in the film.

Daniel Mainwaring's dialog - like half-learned foreign language – makes the film sound noir even when the locations do not. Everyone – from the small time Bridgeport residents to Kirk Douglas's cronies - speak noir. They're always ready with a quick, witty comeback. No ones ever left speechless. Not even Mitchum when he finds Kathie back in Whit's (Douglas) arms.

One of the finest scenes in the film – and the most “noir” looking - takes place in a cabin in the woods. It's also the second best entrance in the film, after Kathie walking out of the sun into Jeff's life. Noir vet Steve Brodie plays Fisher – Jeff's former PI partner who's now following him. After Mitchum drives around for days knowing that Fisher is on his trail finally convinces himself that he has lost his tail. He goes to the couple's rendezvous spot confident he's shaken his former partner. You see Fisher in the shadows slowly walk up to Kathie and Jeff's cabin in the woods his identity revealed by a low-angle light. Jeff -via voice over- explains what's happening, “We had played it smart and forgotten nothing. Forgotten nothing except one thing... He had followed her.” The music stings. Then comes the fist fight between Fisher and Jeff inside the cabin. Kathie watches the fight. She looks both aroused and at the same time seems to be calculating out the odds in her head. Finally, she comes up with the best possible solution for her. A bullet in Fisher's gut. Mitchum is shocked. Before he can even ask what the hell she was thinking she's taken off. Jeff finds out that she was lying to him all along. He leaves her and the sorted business in the past. But he can't run from it.



This scene is a real showcase for Musuraca's camerawork – inside of the cabin is lit low and sideways with only a fireplace's flickery lighting the dark space. Add to that Roy Webb's dramatic score and you have one of the most memorable film noir moments ever.

Of course director Jacques Tourneur should get credit for putting this film together. Horror/noir Cat People and the superior western Canyon Passage were made before this but Out of the Past is unequaled.

Want to see how this story could fail under lesser talent? Check out the remake Against All Odds. The scene described above is reshot with Alex Karras taking over for Steve Brodie. Instead of being a private eye, he's a football athletic trainer shot to death in a Mayan pyramid. I'm not kidding. The isn't even a flashback in the movie! The only thing making the remake worth watching is seeing Richard Widmark and Jane Greer. Both look strong and dominate every scene they're in.

Though the great auteur lived on another 25 years and even wrote and directed some smaller projects, <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> can still be seen as a great capstone to decades of legendary cinema.

FANNY AND Alexander deals with the great two preoccupations of Bergman's career, namely the absence of God and the unbridgeable gaps between human beings, but the result is wonderfully life-affirming. Fanny and Alexander are the children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl, actors in Uppsala circa 1907, but the film gives a panorama of the extended Ekdahl family, presided over by grandmother Helena, uncles Gustav Adolf (a restaurateur and the film's most comedic presence) and Carl (a professor who has fallen into debt and is trapped in a loveless marriage), their wives and children, and the selfless Jewish shopkeeper Isak Jacobi. This Swedish family lives in an Old World opulence that is hard to believe for audiences today, especially for a country whose class system by and large disappeared after the war. The rigid interaction among people not closely acquainted and the deference of servants to their employers make for gestures as alien to us 21st century viewers as a Noh play.

In a way, <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> is like those big novels of a century ago, by Tolstoy or Galsworthy, dealing with the vicissitudes of a whole family. The vaster family drama, however, is only a backdrop to a more personal one: Fanny and Alexander are soon orphaned, and their widowed mother eventually remarries, this time with a cruel clergyman. The children move from the freedom and comfort of the Ekdahl home to the austere bishop's place, where the children are punished for the slightest infraction by beatings or being locked up in the attic. The Ekdahls' torment living under the bishop is the great crisis of the film, and their unexpected liberation from it presents Alexander with a burden that he will carry into his budding manhood.

The original television version is the way to see Bergman's final masterpiece. Don't be daunted by the length: 5 hours should not be a problem in an age when people will watch an entire season of a sitcom in one sitting. <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> is not slow, meditative cinema like, say, Andrei Tarkovsky or Béla Tarr, but rather Bergman is always presenting the viewer with some engaging little drama. The theatrical cut, which Bergman made only with the greatest regret, is a very different (and much weaker film), cutting out much of the film's magical realism, the touching meditations on growing old represented by the character of the grandmother, and some vivid depictions of early 20th-century Sweden. || The eponymous children (Pernilla Allwin and Bertil Guve) live an happy upper-middle class life with their theatre-manager father ""Oskar"" (Allan Edwall) and mother ""Emilie"" (Ewa Fröling) and are looking forward to Christmas. Parties ensue and a good time is had by all until the father is suddenly taken ill. His death follows swiftly and their mother is soon being wooed by the rather puritanical bishop ""Vergerus"" (Jan Malmsjö) who has a rather different, more disciplinarian, attitude to bringing up the children. When they marry, the life of ""Alexander"", especially, becomes nigh on intolerable. ""Emilie"" is initially tolerant of her new husband's policies, but gradually she grows to hate him and to start finding a way to get herself and her children back the safety of her own, loving, family. It's slightly episodic, this film. Phase one shows us the happiness, the second the marriage, the third - well that's the escape from the marriage - and it's the second phase that works best for me. A really quite chilling performance from Malmsjö as the cruel man of God also brings out a spirited effort from the young Guve who proves that ""Alexander"" is definitely not a quitter. The design of this film contrasts well the relative, red-velvet, luxury of their original home with the austerity of the bishop's much more sparse and chilled residence - and of that comparative change in their familial dynamic. Daniel Bell provides us with a score that accompanies the ups and downs of these two children, and increasingly of their mother, well too. Fröling's is another robust contribution - we can sense her character's infuriating frustration as she realises that it's a man's world, and she is largely trapped by her husband's status and subject to his will. It's a bit of a slow starter this, Bergman takes his time introducing us to characters that have varying degrees of tangentiality to the ultimate thread, but it does ultimately create the feeling that this is a family, a community - and some of the pieces starts to fit nicely as we head to the denouement. That conclusion? Well, I rather liked that! It's best on a big screen this film. The aesthetic is more effective and appreciable that way and don't be put off by the three hours - it really does move along quickly once we're underway."

""Yuri"" falls in love with the enigmatic ""Lara"" (Julie Christie) who just happens to be the love interest for ""Komarovsky"" (Rod Steiger) who would sell his own mother, he is certainly cheating on her's. Frustrated on that front, he ends up marrying his own cousin ""Tonya"" (Geraldine Chaplin) but with the end of the Great war looming and the October Revolution subsequently reducing the country to war-torn chaos, nothing is simple as families are split asunder trying to flee the guns and bullets. It turns out that ""Lara"" ended up marrying Communist big-wig ""Pasha"" (Tom Courtenay) but the war put paid to that relationship and when ""Yuri"" discovers this he wonders what might have been! This is a collection of love stories. Love for people, for their country, for a cause - and Lean manages to weave the complexities of the themes without bogging us down in doctrine or too much brutally. We know all of that is going on, but Robert Bolt's inspired screenplay drip feeds us the politics in an eminently appetising fashion whilst ensuring the human stories prevail. The vast expanses of Russia - especially as seen during their train journeys - are impressive, chilling, and allow us a respite from the constant barrage of dialogue that is usually pretty essential in enabling us to follow the plot. If you ever get the chance to sit for three hours and watch this on big screen then take it. This is cinema at it's more powerful and the sheer logistics of mass participation, mass transportation and glorious photography - without a computer to be had - is certainly worth sitting through as this epic washes over you."

A single mother (Tess Harper) runs a motel & gas station in the lonely plains between Dallas and Austin. She hires an alcoholic man who couldn’t pay what he owed (Robert Duvall) and discovers that he’s an ex-Country star.

“Tender Mercies” (1983) is a lowkey drama set in rural Texas, reminiscent of ""Resurrection"" (1980) mixed with “Coal Miner’s Daughter” and the later “The Apostle.” While it’s better than “Resurrection,” it’s not quite as good as the other two. However, if you like subdued storytelling, like “Places in the Heart,” you might prefer it. The film was reimagined as “Crazy Heart” 26 years later with Jeff Bridges, which also features Duvall.

On the female front, Tess is winsome in a humble way while Betty Buckley is great as the ex-wife and country entertainer, Dixie. Whenever she performs, the movie perks up. Lastly, Ellen Barkin is notable as the beautiful 18 years-old daughter. She was 28 during shooting, but easily fit the role. By contrast, both Tess and Robert were slightly long-in-the-tooth for the ages of their characters (if you do the math), but that’s a minor cavil. 

There’s a welcome spirituality to the proceedings and the movie doesn’t skimp out on addressing tough theological questions in its understated way.

The flick runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot in Palmer, Texas, which is a half hour drive south of Dallas.

Blue Velvet is written and directed by David Lynch. It stars Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, Hope Lange, George Dickerson and Dean Stockwell. Music is by Angelo Badalamenti and cinematography by Frederick Elmes.

The discovery of a severed human ear found in a field leads Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan) into a vortex of troubled mysteries involving a beautiful nightclub singer and a group of crimninals led by the psychopathic Frank Booth (Hopper).

Such is the diversity of David Lynch, you will find many anouncing this to be his last accessible piece of genius, others that it was merely the start of his shift into mainstream majesty. Personally, I just find it a fine movie, easy to follow, even if it's nightmarish at times and brilliantly off kilter at others. 

From the off we are in no doubt that Lynch is setting out to show what crawls beneath the happy facade of suburban small town Americana. We are pitched into a detective story with a difference, one that is fronted by the naivety of a young man aided from the sidelines by the young girl who is falling for him. Both of them stumble into a world of adult pschosexual murk, flanked by the outrageous malignant menace of Booth and his merry band of odd balls. One of the joys to be had here is observing the things and reactions that Booth's group do in the background, splendidly weird. Superbly perfomed by the cast, most of them daring and real for their director, Blue Velvet did earn Lynch a Best Director Oscar nomination. Which considering it was 1986 and the controversial themes at work are troublingly biting, makes the nomination something of a surprise. 

Frederick Elmes also photographed the equally controversial ""River's Edge"" this same year, and once again he considerably pumps Neo-Noir textures acrosss the pic. While Angelo Badalamenti's musical compositions are lush and pin sharp for scene accompaniments. Main music tracks are Bobby Vinton's title tune and  Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams,"" both certain to never let you forget this film whenever you hear them again. Lynch's film is plot conventionality, yet disturbing in the blending of beauty and violence, both visually and orally - and of course there's some sly humour to be found as well. To me it's not the masterpiece some claim it as, for there's more style than substance, more shock and awe as opposed to character depth, but it is a great, clever and unforgettable film. 8/10 || When “Jeffrey” (Kyle MacLachlan) finds a severed ear as he walks through a field, he takes it to the police who advise him to keep schtum! Maybe if he had, he wouldn’t have become embroiled in the nefarious activities of the violent “Frank” (Dennis Hopper) nor his girlfriend “Dorothy” (Isabella Rossellini) with whom he soon becomes infatuated. Together with the cop’s daughter “Sandy” (Laura Dern) they pair try to get to the bottom of the mystery but this is a perilous affair, exposing them to a dark and dangerous societal underbelly, but for him it’s also quite an addictive one too! It’s the oxygen-mask wearing Hopper who steals this for me, mixing a toxic blend of angry, maniacal and erotic engagingly, but I’m afraid the rest of this rather fell a bit flat for me as the story ran out of steam and the sexual tensions became all too repetitively staged and the overacting from Rossellini failed to convince. It addresses issues of sadomasochistic tendencies entertainingly at first, too, but there’s only so many times you can peep through the louvre doors of a wardrobe before even that cinematic prurience becomes dull. Dern has never been my favourite actor, and she adds little here until perhaps at the end when the denouement brings things to an head. Like most Lynch films, I felt I was on the sidelines - I’m not a fan of surrealism or excess for the sake of it, and that’s what I found here. I know I’m in a minority but even with a fine soundtrack, this just didn’t do it for me, sorry."

<em>'The Journey of Natty Gann'</em> is an excellent adventure drama. This absolutely flies through its 101 minute run time, that's mostly - though not entirely - thanks to how well paced the film is. It never stays in one spot for too long, which makes it entertaining. It doesn't sacrifice any character development by doing that either.

Meredith Salenger portrays the titular character. She is fantastic, from start-to-finish. A terrific debut! A young John Cusack makes an appearance, he is good in the role of Harry.

During a lot of the movie, I was kind of in nostalgia mode, remember things I saw / felt when I was a kid, just sort of enjoying the way back machine experience.

It wasn't until almost the very last scene that it clicked how good the writing is in this.  I know this is known for the excellent animation styling, the catchy tunes, and charming coming of age semantics, but this uses several strong formulas that have been used since Aesop's fables.

And that's what made me realize the writing quality, I felt as if I was watching an on fable with moral lessons of consequence.  Up until that point I was mentally preparing how this 1967 animation is actually a perfect metaphor for 2020 entitled child entering the real world: never being told no, even to the threat of great, potentially lethal, loss because even in the face of danger, they've been taught that they deserve, even in the logic that it can't be true on both sides though both believe that.  Hmmm, that sounds a lot like religious war.

Digressing back to the writing: Mowgli embodies naivety, narcissism, entitlement, whatever you would like to call as he's a victim / ward of extreme chances of compassion: he just happens to luck into survival wherever he goes.  While Tarzan makes more sense, this is character development for the series of situations (each one their own potential fable) with the main character shifting to and fro from Bagera to Mowgli to Balloo, each one being taught lessons as the adventure continues.

With the representation of the jungle and the adversities that Mowgli faces, Mowgli slowly learns what Bagera and Baloo both know: most people are only interested in their own interests, but sometimes those that have enough can be in a position to help others.  The xenoism (racism) that Sher Khan has for Mowgli as a human is enough for these predators give up his companionship to help him to the man-village.

The really odd lesson is that Mowgli embraces the self-interest needed in the jungle, despite dialogue to the contrary. || This has probably the most perfect balance of story and soundtrack of any film I've ever seen - animated or otherwise. Adapting Rudyard Kipling's tale of ""Mowgli"" the child abandoned in the Indian jungle, but rescued and raised by a family of wolves. ""Bagheera"", the sagacious panther realises as the boy starts to grow to manhood, that he ought to return to his own kind but ""Baloo"", the avuncular bear thinks otherwise and so takes our young man-cub on some fun adventures in the jungle - including some near-misses with the wonderfully menacing, sardonic tiger ""Shere Khan"" and ""Kaa"" the hypnotic python. The voice cast - especially Phil Harris as the bear and George Sanders as the tiger are great; Louis Prima as ""Louie"" the King of the Apes provides us with one of the best songs ever to feature in a Disney film - and the Sherman brothers provide a great slew more of them for us to enjoy, too. The detail in the animations and the humour in the script are super - this really is a must watch."

Got to see it at the cinema today, and it brought back joyous memories!

Out of all the previous adaptations on A Christmas Carol, this version is my favorite! || There are certainly one or two toe-tappers in this enjoyable Muppetisation of the immortal Charles Dickens tale of Christmas humbug and redemption. ""Gonzo"" adopts the role of the author/narrator and guides us through this (pretty heavily) abridged version of the story as Michael Caine's arch-miser ""Ebenezer Scrooge"" is visited by the three kindly spirits on Christmas morning - each trying to point to the errors of his ways and to encourage him to engage a little more with the Christmas spirit. To be honest, I am not a fan of puppets - and these ones never worked for me on television when I was young. This film does, however, deliver well. A combination of very gentle comedy, a strong and emotional story and a star who was certainly up for joining in, all combine well to offer an engaging and colourful take on the story without descending into too much sentiment that ends, fittingly, outside the east London branch of Mickelwhite’s. Paul Williams has composed some frequently poignant lyrics for the ""Scrooge"", ""Bless Us All"" and ""It Feels Like Christmas"" numbers and, mercifully, the more irritating ""Kermit"" and ""Miss Piggy"" characters actually feature quite sparingly as that huge turkey in the butcher in the next street gets ever closer to finding a generous buyer. Good fun to watch. || EVERYONE TAKES IT SO SERIOUSLY, at least every human.  The Muppets don't, but the humans act like they are living in a world without Muppets, they act like they are doing the most serious version of a Christmas Carol as they possibly can...

... and it works.  It really works.  It's a Muppets movie with Shakespeare quality acting... which makes it one of my favorite adaptations of A Christmas Carol.  It's deadly serious and hysterical.  It's well acted, it looks brilliant...

.... AND THE SONG IS STILL CUT!!!!  Which is a shame, because it's one of those songs that brings a tear to your eye, and, as far as I know, is only available in one addition, and it wasn't the one I just streamed.

It breaks the heart, but who cares, it is still well played, well acted, beautiful, funny, and heart warming, and that is what it should be... for a Muppets film.

Great for all children and adults. Not really for me but I'll watch it if the family wants too. I prefer the live version more. || Walt Disney's classic film, 101 Dalmatians, may not be completely original as it is based on a previous book, but it has turned its characters into beloved favorites, especially Pongo and Purdy. The movie will make you fall in love with all the adorable puppies like Lucky, Penny, Patch, and Freckles.

The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville. Speaking of the villain, Cruella is an iconic and fantastically over-the-top character, with Horace and Jasper adding to the trio's incredible dynamic.

The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs. Moving forward, the live-action films, 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, are based on the cartoon and offer a fresh take on the story with Glenn Close's portrayal of Cruella Deville being particularly outstanding.

While the movies may have a few plot holes, they are still top-notch entertainment. The sequel, 101 Dalmatians Part 2 in the Animated Series, focuses on Patch's adventures in London, adding a new dimension to the beloved story. Although the animated series may not reach the same heights as the original or the movies, it is still worth a watch for fans of the franchise.

Overall, the four films together create an enjoyable and incredible experience. They are definitely worth checking out, with Patch's story adding an extra layer of fun to the beloved Dalmatian universe."

Wow, I feel as if I've never seen this movie before: this is something that happens when you learn to watch movies critically and rewatch childhood favorites.

I'm continuously enlightened to how awful Walt Disney was.  This movie is filled with insensitive nonsense, particularly to Native Americans, and the majority of the characters are just awful people, to include Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.  Wendy is the only ""pure"" character in the entire movie, and I feel as if I'm reaching there.  Tiger Lily might be a competitor, but she doesn't DO much, so it's hard to tell.

With such a wonderful premise, and Disney's level of production value, you would think this would hold up, even after 70 years, but I honestly am beginning to think this was so widely accepted for a lack of options.

Don't get me wrong, the actual story is both ""close enough"" to the original story, and well enough structured that a reboot would probably be very close to this version.  It's all stylistic choices in both animation, dialogue, and character presentation that could easily be cleaned up, and likely should have been.

While I could probably rant for an hour just on the ""love"" triangle happening in this (I am completely in camp Tinkerbell), this is supposed to be ""boy who never grew up"".   While that lends to the jealousy factors, the amount and inconsistency of details on everything about the place being magical tends to distract from it.

You'll notice that Peter no longer has human ears, he has pixie ears, and the boys supposedly killed and skinned giant animals so they could wear their skins as pajamas: where are the rest of the animals?

The pirates have been there long enough to get restless, though there are enough of them left, despite Hook just shooting them dead on occasion, but not long enough to mutiny or properly search the one island, but long enough to have a weirdly specific history between Peter Pan and Hook and the crocodile.

It's a weird movie: it's still worth a watch, but I'd watch it with your kids as opposed to just on their own. || An ideal subject for Walt Disney this one - a charming, humorous adventure with great characters. Before you start watching, do bear in mind that JM Barrie created the ""Peter Pan"" character at the very start of the 20th century, so some of the language and roles are a touch on the stereotypical side - but that ought not to unduly spoil this experience. The ""Darlings"" are a loving, but pretty dysfunctional family with a huge great dog ""Nana"" whose three children all share the nursery in the attic of the family home. ""Peter"" visits and with the help of his friendly sprite ""Tinker Bell"" takes the youngsters on a series of magical adventures in ""Never Land"" where nobody ever grows up. The legendary ""Captan Hook"" is his local adversary, hell bent on repaying ""Peter"" for causing him to lose his hand to a crocodile who is equally determined to eat the rest of him! There's a bit of depth to the characterisations - the story might be a ""love"" story; but it is certainly one that introduces loyalty, trust, jealousy and comradeship to youngsters in a thoroughly engaging, plausible way. There is plenty of action too - a wonderful sword fight; lots of flying and the carefree attitude of the children is really quite contagious. The animation is once again, expertly hand-crafted, with vivid colours that help convey a lot of the joy of the film. Bobby Driscoll does a super job with the title role, too - it's a smashing film."

I've noted before that musicals aren't my favourite (the more I watch, the more they grow on me to be honest), but I had a fun time viewing <em>'Newsies'</em>. It manages to maintain the entertainment whilst keeping strong focus on both the music and storyline, a lot of the musicals that I've seen tend to focus on the tunes first and almost forget about the plot, this doesn't. I thoroughly liked seeing the premise unfold.

Talking of song and dance, I rate the musical numbers. I wouldn't say I'll remember or revisit any of the songs but that's not really important, the fact that it all suits the onscreen stuff is what matters most. I do like ""Santa Fe"" by Christian Bale, who is excellent by the way. Best actor on display, though David Moscow (David), Bill Pullman (Bryan) and Robert Duvall (Pulitzer) are good too.

This overtakes <em>'Babes in Toyland'</em> as my standout Disney strictly live-action musical so far; not including films like <em>'Mary Poppins'</em>, which is a live-action/animation mix. || This was a financial flop for Disney that became a cult classic and finally turned a profit in video rentals.

Let's look at this logically (especially since I was 12 when it came out and as a 12 year old I was about all things movie related), this wasn't a failure of the film, it was a failure of marketing.

No one heard about it, no one knew about it, they failed in the marketing campaign, no real buzz was around it, so it flopped.

Now if you ask me... don't cast Bill Pullman in musicals, that could be a correction.  But in all honesty, the songs were catchy, the case was great, the setting was appropriate and the plot was engaging.  It has everything it needs to be a decent film...

This was the perfect way to forget about Hamilton from this weekend trilogy.
Watch this - it is cheesy messy fun. || Very poor.

Safe to say, I didn't enjoy <em>'Popeye'</em> one bit - despite the presence of one Robin Williams. He is pretty alright in the role of Popeye, but I personally didn't like the uneven/whacky nature of the film. I see - and appreciate - what they were going for, it just doesn't come off in my opinion. It's all very pedestrian.

The characters around Popeye are annoying, as are the very forgettable musical numbers which don't fit in. I had high hopes for this, given I had heard good things of the titular character (not necessarily from this, just overall) as well as the fact of Mr. Williams appears. For me, in terms of his films that I've currently seen, this is closer to <em>'Hook'</em> than (the awesome) <em>'Bicentennial Man'</em>.

I'm sure many out there would disagree on that latter point, as well as my view of this film itself. That's fine, each to their own of course. I, though, couldn't wait for it to finish. || Popeye (1980): A Nostalgic Cartoon Come to Life

Robert Altman's Popeye isn't going to change anyone's weltanschauung. But good grief, is it delightful. A loving, slightly mad translation of the comic strip to screen, the film is a triumph of pure, unapologetic whimsy.

Harry Nilsson's musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre - strange, singable tunes that capture the film's cartoonish spirit. Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall don't just play Popeye and Olive Oyl; they become living, breathing cartoon characters. Their physical comedy is so precise, so exaggerated, that each movement feels like a panel from E.C. Segar's original comic strip.

The visual style is extraordinary. Sweethaven, built entirely on location in Malta, looks like a three-dimensional cartoon - all tilted angles, saturated colors, and impossible architectural perspectives. It's a world that exists somewhere between reality and illustration.

For those of us who grew up with these people - Williams, Duvall, Ray Walston, and Jules Feiffer (screenplay) - the film is pure nostalgic joy. A reminder of a simpler, more sane period in our lives.

Not every film needs to be serious. Sometimes, it just needs to be fun."

I did like the horror edge it has to it for the first portion of the film, it's something I wasn't necessarily expecting so it was pleasing to see. That's about all I did rate from this though, with Oz itself not looking as magical as it should while the non-human characters are boring to me.

Talking of the onscreen lot, Jean Marsh as Princess Mombi is the only performance I felt entertained by - she's very good. Away from her, there's not much to note. Fairuza Balk is solid in the role of Dorothy, nothing really to say about her other than she does an OK job; considering her age. The Wheelers are kinda interesting, they do look cool.

It's a shame they don't make use of Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - the latter I'm actually glad they didn't, given how awful his design was. I get why they don't feature more, given the source material, but it feels a needless change-up especially with Billina, Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead being so lame.

I read that this is apparently true to the original book series, which is respectable. However, the point of a film is to make it a good film first and foremost - this doesn't quite do that in my opinion. Each to their own, of course! || There are some positively darker elements to this follow-up story of the young ""Dorothy"" (Fairuza Balk).

The yellow brick road has been torn up and the emerald city is but a ruin. It turns out that the subterranean ""Nome King"" has determined to reclaim all the precious stones stolen (as he sees it) from his realm, and so together with the Princess ""Mombi"" has reduced the once mighty city to rubble. It falls to young ""Dorothy"" and her new friends ""Jack Pumpkinhead"" and the rotund tin soldier ""Tik-Tok"" to find the mysterious powder of life and try to outsmart the pair and restore the kingdom. This story has much more menace to it. The treatment scenario at the start (aided well by Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh) works effectively, and the multi headed Princess gives Sophie Ward and Fiona Victory an opportunity to spread a little mayhem too. My biggest gripe with this is that Miss Balk looks much younger that Judy Garland, and she isn't a terribly engaging actress either. The animation is a bit on the basic side, too, but it does move along well with plenty of flying sofas and a message that green is always good!"

It is based on Dave Stevens' comic book The Rocketeer. It stars Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton and Paul Sorvino. Music is scored by James Horner and cinematography by Hiro Narita.

It took eight years to get to the screen, with many rewrites, changes in personal, changes in setting and etc, the only thing consistent was Disney's inconsistency. Once out the film received generally positive reviews but posted only a small profit, in the wake of a Tim Burton inspired reinvention of the Super Hero genre, Rocketeer fell away into cultdom, sequels planned were shelved and its reputation remains to this day one of being a misfire. Unfair say I! Rocketeer is a lovingly crafted adventure film, nodding towards the serials of the 1930s, it's awash with period Hollywood delights, Art Deco imagery, has a damsel in distress, square jawed heroics, Nazi villains, wonderful effects and a blunderbuss Zeppelin finale. Backed by beautiful smooth tone photography and an evocative heart stirring music score, it's a family friendly blockbuster that ticks all the requisite boxes. The quality of the action sequences still hold up today, and Johnston, who wanted the job big time, directs with a knowing grasp of the setting, and crucially he never once loses a grip on tone and pacing. There's no self parody here, no deep Fruedian dissection of the main character, just a honest to goodness good against bad axis, with a romantic cause deftly wafted over proceedings.

The role of Cliff Secord (Rocketeer) proved hard to cast, where Vincent D'Onofrio turned it down and ""name"" actors such as Dennis Quaid, Emilio Estevez, Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton auditioned for the part. Paxton, it's believed, was very close to getting it as well. Disney wanted an A list man, Johnny Depp and Kevin Costner were mooted, but Johnston had a feel for unknown Billy Campbell and managed to convince nervous Disney heads that he was perfect. Much of the scorn that has flown towards Rocketeer has landed at Campbell's door, again, this is unfair. It's hard to tell if one of those A list actors could have made the character work better, for it helps in this instance to not have a familiar face propelling the adventure. There's an innocence, an awkwardness to Campbell's portrayal that just sits right for a guy stumbling upon a rocket pack and finding himself submerged in a chase and harry battle against bad. He also has the looks, a handsome dude who creates a homespun based chemistry with the sensuous Connelly. It's Dalton's movie, though, he's having a devil of a time as the chief villain. Modeled on Errol Flynn and the spurious notion that he was once a Nazi spy, Dalton has the looks, the gusto, the moustache twirling shiftiness and a voice perfect for such material. A roll call of great character actors fill out the support slots, with Terry O'Quinn, Paul Sorvino and Ed Lauter particularly striking the right chords.

A smashing piece of escapism, no pretensions or ideas above its station. The willingness to tap into the basic premise of a comic book actioner and entertain in grand Hollywood terms, to be applauded. And I do, and I do love it so. 8/10 || Very much enjoyable, this.

<em>'The Rocketeer'</em> exceeded my expectations in truth, I wasn't expecting much given the opening few minutes. However, thankfully, it ends up producing an entertaining 108 minutes. Cool superhero, great score and a likeable cast list.

The premise is properly bonkers, especially towards the end, but they make it work and deserve credit for doing so. There are numerous recognisable faces onscreen, all of the main talent give good performances.

Billy Campbell plays the lead role, Cliff. I've (relatively) recently become aware of him via television's <em>'Cardinal'</em> - which is outstanding btw, check it out if you can - and loved him in that, he's also very good in this. Jennifer Connelly (Jenny) and Alan Arkin (Peabody) are also involved, as are Paul Sorvino (Eddie) and Timothy Dalton (Neville). I enjoyed Dalton, he portrays his role very well.

The pacing is solid, thanks also to the noteworthy action and James Horner's score. All in all, this is a film I would definitely recommend; it's certainly nearer the top than the bottom of Disney's live-action offerings up until 1991. || Billy Campbell was actually extremely believable in this and, honestly, I don't think that they could have found anyone better to play the evil Nazi Erroll Flynn styled actor than James Bond's Timothy Dalton.

But, also, I always kind of feel that Campbell has gotten the short end of the acting stick.

In all honesty, it's really a horribly fin superhero movie, right down to that amazing retro 1930s serial feel.

The entire thing was great and warranted far more fan fare than it received."

When an evil witch places a curse on an infant princess that will cause her to fall into eternal sleep on her 16th birthday, her three fairy godmothers whisk her away to a life of normality and ignorance of her birthright. But can they stave off the curse when the 16th year of age arrives?

It upped the ante in costing for Disney, also taking a decade to produce. The ambition was high as new techniques were being used such as rotoscoping, while the musical score is brilliantly devised from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet. The story itself is a pure joy, based on Charles Perrault's ever enduring fairytale, it's awash with rich characters, led by the delightful three fairy godmothers - Flora - Fauna and Merryweather, all plumpy and sweet, while evil witch Maleficent is brilliantly produced, with a long pointy chin and devil horns on her head.

There's a whole bunch of charming fun on show, as the three ladies bring the magic and potter around while gently ribbing each other, but it's with the drama where Sleeping Beauty most soars. The nightmare sequence luring Briar Rose (Princess Aurora) to the dreaded spinning wheel is unnerving, and the battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficent is exhilarating and shows the animators at their best. As for the colour? Spanking!

Upon release it wasn't the roaring success Disney had hoped and planned for, but the decades since then have been very kind to Sleeping Beauty. For it's a magical film for children and adults to dreamily get lost in. 9/10 || Now then, for any fans of the more recent ""Maleficent"" films - this is how it is supposed to be done! I think this film goes a long way to explaining why I almost always support the baddies in films. A princess (""Briar Rose"") is born and the three good fairies are summoned to the Christening to bestow their blessings on the newborn. Just as the third is about to lavish her gift on the baby, the ominously evil witch arrives with her trusted black raven. Not invited, how rude - but she still generously gifts the child a Christening present. Needless (or should that just be needles?) to say, the spindling trade in the kingdom took a bit of a hit after that and the girl is secreted deep in forest trying to keep away from the dreadful consequences of this nasty curse. Amongst the best ever sequences in animation - the three fairies try to make a cake and a dress for her impending 16th birthday and their efforts turn out to be disastrous. After 16 years - they resort to using their wands and we have five minutes of pure Disney magic. They cannot agree on a colour for the dress, have a bit of a magical colour-fight which is noticed by the evil sorceress's searching bird and their cunning secret is carelessly exposed... The colours, gently humorous dialogue and George Bruns' (with some Tchaikovsky) score makes this a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy romantic adventure - in my book, the best Walt ever produced."

Beset by production issues, Disney being horrified by the horror of the piece and etc, Something Wicked This Way Comes proved to be a most divisive picture. Yet it's actually a spooky family friendly horror yarn.

Plot sees the Pandemonium Carnival roll into a small American town and mysteriously grant the residents their wishes. Of course it's a ""too good to be true"" set up, and after two young boys discover the carnival's secrets, they come under threat from the owner, Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce deliciously sinister).

Directed by Jack Clayton (The Innocents) and photographed by Stephen H. Burum, pic is far darker than what Disney envisaged at the outset. Missing the crux of Bradbury's literary bent, the makers do however put forward a thoughtful and atmospheric story, one that looks and sounds terrific with its ethereal beats. It's a crafty puritan bad dream, where although it's true to say that the allegories and message at the core are driven hard, it still a devilish blend of horror and whimsical wonder. 7/10 || It might not be as great as it could've been, but I did enjoy watching <em>'Something Wicked This Way Comes'</em>.

Jonathan Pryce definitely carries events as Mr. Dark, who is a character that suits him very nicely. I'm a fan of Pryce from other films, so it's little surprise that I like him here. Jason Robards is good too, if a little muttered throughout. The child actors, meanwhile, are passable.

The premise is filled with intrigue, it doesn't quite deliver on a grand scale and yet I still felt suitably entertained. The film is shot quite neatly, the main town in particular looks pleasant.

Good, admittedly mostly thanks to Pryce. || _**Something Slow & Dull This Way Comes**_

In 1932, a mysterious carnival comes to an Illinois town where weird things start happening and people strangely go missing. Jason Robards plays a librarian while Jonathan Pryce is on hand as the shadowy head of the carnival  

“Something Wicked This Way Comes” (1983) is spooky fantasy written by Ray Bradbury (based on his book). The studio, Disney, wasn’t happy with director Jack Clayton’s original cut and so took it out of his hands and undertook expensive reshoots, reediting and rescoring, plus adding a narration.

I was expecting to love this movie since I favor flicks set in carnivals or circuses, like “Water for Elephants” (2011), ""Berserk!"" (1967), ""Circus of Horrors” (1960) and “Funhouse” (1981) — even films like ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (1952) and ""Roustabout"" (1964). Unfortunately, I was let down. 

Everything is here for a magical picture, but I guess too many cooks spoil the broth. The pace is overly slow and the film never recovers. It doesn’t help that the bulk of it was shot on Disney’s town set in Burbank, which elicits a low-rent vibe. 

Sure, the concept is great, Mr. Dark is an intriguing character, the Dust Witch is darkly beautiful (Pam Grier) and some of the weird happenings are well done, yet they don’t add up to a compelling story. Even the last act drops the ball with a talky sequence in the library, followed by an equally boring sequence in a mirror maze. The explosive close is impressive, but it’s too little too late.

“Needful Things” (1993) wasn’t exactly great, yet it took similar material and made a more entertaining movie. For a superior spooky Disney flick from the early 80s check out the original version of “The Watcher in the Woods” (1980), I’m talking about the version that includes the titular skeletal-insectoid entity at the end (available on Youtube as a “fan edit”).  

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot at Disney’s Golden Oak Ranch (the carnival scenes), which is a 20-minute drive north of Hollywood, as well as the Disney back lot in Burbank (the town set), with establishing shots done in Vermont (Morrisville and Waterville).

<em>'Son of Flubber'</em> is inferior in every department. I praise the original for its amusing humour, but this film manages to lose it almost entirely. There are a few smirk-worthy moments, but it's mostly stale.

A large reason for that is the lacklustre plot, which isn't ever interesting. The Flubber itself is rarely used, as they instead focus of its ""gas"". The conclusion is, like with the 1961 film, rather dull and adds little.

Fred MacMurray, to his credit, is again good in the role of Prof. Brainard. Nancy Olson (Betsy) and Keenan Wynn (Alonzo) are both involved again, while Tommy Kirk (Biff) is shoehorned into a bigger part; not sure why.

Speaking of forced characters, James Westerfield and Forrest Lewis again appear in the roles of officers Hanson & Kelly; they were, in my opinion, only funny in <em>'The Shaggy Dog'</em>, which these films evidently share the same universe with.

Surely this sequel needed to be bigger and grander than the earlier film? Instead it practically follows the same path without setting the world alight. Still, I'm intrigued to see where the story goes for the Disney Channel produced sequels - though I'll have to wait to view, given they oddly aren't on the studio's streaming service or anywhere else.

It being a mermaid movie definitely makes some allowances, and makes the movie more memorable.

Thing is, though, ""Dillinger"" has now designed a ""Master Control Programme"" (Think ""Forbin Project"" from 1970) and when ""Flynn"" tries to break into this system, he is reduced to a player in a game of survival where he encounters fellow rebels ""Tron"", ""Ram"" and ""Lora"". Adventures ensue as they must try to destroy this ""MCP"" before it bores of industrial aspirations, and sets it's sights on the Pentagon and the Kremlin. By any modern day standard, the graphics are linear and static - but there is no doubt that they were groundbreaking and quickly-paced for 1982. The use of light - blue and red for good and evil; the slightly over-exposed imagery to try and create the feeling of an alternative digital environment works well enough and though there isn't the slightest amount of jeopardy as to the ending, it's actually quite an entertaining 90-odd minutes that reminded me that every oak tree starts with an acorn. The attempts to incorporate technical or gaming language into the dialogue are a bit contrived, but there is a fun sequence with a ""bit"" that can only say yes and no as ""Flynn"" drives his wonky thing (""Max"" from ""The Black Hole"" (1979), anyone?) through the maze of circuitry. Warner is not very convincing, it has to be said - he was rarely much good, I thought - but once it gets going it's an enjoyable piece of cinema nostalgia that looked quite reasonable on a big screen. || **Once avant-garde and innovative, this film feels archaic and old as an arcade game, and has an absolutely miserable script.**

I'm not sure what Disney was thinking when they decided to make this film, but I understand the concept and the reasons that led the studio to bet on something like this. In the 1980s, the creation and gradual massification of the computer (a huge box that we see in the movie and which is now primitive compared to the machines we use) generated a “fever” around computing and led to the creation of games that, later, the World Wide Web has taken it to another level. The movie came out when personal computers started to become popular in the US, but here in my country it took about fifteen years to happen. It's extraordinary to think about this, and how quickly things have evolved. I am thirty-two years old, I belong to a generation that still lived its childhood without technologies, but I was a teenager when they started to become something more visible in our lives. So I can understand why this movie was made, but being a Disney movie, I confess I was expecting better.

The film has an uninspired cast made up of third-rate actors. Among all the (almost) anonymous names, only David Warner stands out. The film also has one of the worst dramatic interpretations of Jeff Bridges' life. He was still young here, but the film's material and style didn't help him do a satisfying job. In fact, I blame the screenwriters for most of the film's problems, as they weren't able to come up with a decent story that would justify the feature film. The story that the film brings us is based on the journey of a human being inside the computer, where he will basically have to play and beat opponents. This is very little and it bores us quickly. It seems like a mere excuse for the studio to make an experiment in the field of CGI and the application of technology in cinema.

Where the film really bets heavily is on the visuals, heavily stylized and inspired by two obvious elements: the integrated circuits used in engineering and the colorful and (now) somewhat forgotten neon lights. In those late 1980s, neon was something that drew attention in the urban landscape, and there was no street or square where, at dusk, dozens of neon signs did not light up. It's something that has virtually disappeared in the last decade, but that gave the city a certain life. I confess that I felt some nostalgia when feeling the aesthetic influences of all that, but I recognize that the film tried to do something far ahead of its time: the Hollywood Academy itself refused to nominate this film for an Oscar because it considered that CGI was a form of cheating. And perhaps also because they did so early, the resources used were so rudimentary (even though they were the best there was) that they gave the film an extremely heavy and dated look, which aged very poorly. The same can be said of the sound effects and even that soundtrack, so dominated by the synthesizer."
11675.0,Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,"Two decades after surviving a massacre on October 31, 1978, former baby sitter Laurie Strode finds herself hunted by persistent knife-wielder Michael Myers. Laurie now lives in Northern California under an assumed name, where she works as the headmistress of a private school. But it's not far enough to escape Myers, who soon discovers her whereabouts. As Halloween descends upon Laurie's peaceful community, a feeling of dread weighs upon her -- with good reason.","This summer, terror won't be taking a vacation.","Horror, Thriller",86,1998-08-05,en,6.0,1698,2.3634,"Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett, Adam Arkin, Michelle Williams, Adam Hann-Byrd",Steve Miner,"california, boarding school, brother, new identity, halloween, witness protection, uncle, school party, sister, sequel, underage drinking, slasher, principal, death, evil, holiday horror, teen scream","Brotherly love just went down another notch.

It's 20 years since Michael Myers Haddonfield, and in particular Laurie Srode, his sister. Laurie faked her death and is now a divorced mom with a teenage son. Michael is on his way to finish the job he couldn't finish two decades ago.

A true and honest Halloween/Michael Myers film this one, there's the distinct feeling that the people behind the series wanted to show that they remember what made the series popular in the first place. It's still the stalk and slash formula of course, but Jamie Lee Curtis returns and her character is nicely written. She's obviously still haunted by events passed and needs a stiff few drinks from time to time to keep the edge off. Yet she's in charge of a private school and is a stern but adoring mother to her son (Josh Hartnett). And she has a boyfriend (Adam Arkin) who cares for her.

The first half of film sets up Laurie's new world, while we jump back and forth observing Michael on his journey to final destination. Once the second half revs up, it's the scare time as Laurie's son and his friends come under great peril, which we know will lead to a final confrontation with Laurie. The kills strike hard, the suspense is ramped up, and then it's a frenetic action based finale capped off by a coup de grace of some distinction. All in all it's just a very good and proper Halloween/Myers movie. It didn't reinvent anything, it just turned the wheel full circle and arrived at a fitting closure. 7/10 || Of course we all know now that _H20_ went on to have a sequel, a reboot, a sequel to the reboot, and another _Halloween_ film coming out next year, but props to _Twenty Years Later_ for at least *trying* to end the franchise. It's nice sometimes to watch a horror go out on something other than a final-scare/cliff-hanger. Also notable for being the first Michael Myers movie that's any fun. Not a great movie, but credit where credit's due.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || ***Jamie Lee Curtis returns and the franchise redeems itself from the crappy part 6***

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is living in Northern California under an assumed name as a dean of a remote private school. It’s Halloween season and her son (Josh Hartnett) is turning 17. Will her evil brother show-up to wreak terror once again? Of course he will. Adam Arkin, LL Cool J and Janet Leigh have side roles.

“Halloween 4” (1988) was great and IMHO even better than the original 1978 slasher while “Halloween 5” (1989) was good, although it added a little campy humor. The next film, “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995), was surprisingly a mess with weak characters, lousy story development and stale & pedestrian jump scares. So I didn’t know what to expect with 1998’s “Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later.”

The movie starts in Illinois with a glimmer of humor and the final scene of the character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt made me bust out laughing. From there, the tone turns dramatic as events switch to the posh boarding school in California. The characters are confidently established and we feel we know them as Michael Myers stages his assault.

I’m glad the creators decided to finally switch the setting from Haddonfield, Illinois, to a wholly different locale across the country. Haddonfield was getting tired. The plot is similar to “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,” which was released a few months later. “H2O” is arguably the second best sequel in the series after 4 and is at least on par with 5.

It’s great to have Jamie Lee as the ‘final girl’ again. Michelle Williams also appears on the female front. She was only 17 during shooting and cute as can be. The attractive Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is also on hand.

The film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (La Puente, Silver City, Chatsworth, Calabasas, Universal City and Los Angeles).

“The Jerk” (1979) has several laugh-out-loud scenes like the eventual confrontation between Patty (Catlin) and Marie (Peters), but there are also some flat, overlong parts, like when Navin departs the mansion in the last act. “Forrest Gump” (1994) was obviously inspired by “The Jerk” and made a more serious, popular picture.

A brain surgeon and widower in Los Angeles (Steve Martin) unknowingly marries a malevolent gold-digger (Kathleen Turner), but stumbles upon a living female brain in Vienna in which he has an affinity (voiced by Sissy Spacek). David Warner is on hand as a mad doctor in Austria.

“The Man with Two Brains” (1983) is similar in style & humor to “The Jerk” (1979), obviously because it’s by the same director/actor team. It’s a nutty send-up of mad doctor flicks and is quietly amusing, but rarely laugh-out-loud funny.

The film scores pretty well on the feminine front showcasing voluptuous Turner in all her glory, tastefully. Randi Brooks is also on hand as Fran, but her voice is really annoying, lol (the voice of Fran, that is). There’s a little top nudity, but the film somehow eludes the rut of raunch.

""Grand Canyon"" (1991) is essentially about the 'grand canyon' that exists between the races and the haves & have-nots in America. It starts out powerfully with a middle-aged lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) taking an unwise detour in L.A.; the situation turns threatening when a group of thugs harass him, but a tow truck driver comes to his aid (Danny Glover). Thus begins a relationship that positively impacts both of their lives and the those connected to them.

One subplot involves Mack's love/lust for women (like any red-blooded male). He and his wife (Mary McDonnell) are starting to experience the empty nest syndrome; he naturally veers toward an affair at work. There's an early scene where the potential ""other woman"" (Mary-Louise Parker) comes into his office and puts her hand on his. It's a simple yet potent scene. Is it wrong for Mack to have feelings for this woman? Should he risk destroying his marriage by pursuing a more intimate relationship? And, if he does commit adultery, can he still change his mind before it's too late? Will he?

That's just one subplot amongst many. Some reviewers feel there are TOO many stories going on. I suggest they stick to lighter fare.

Here’s a sampling of themes explored:

Miraculous life-saving encounters; white/black relations; the rich/working class/poor divide; homelessness. Why do kids join gangs/become hoodlums? The challenges of a nigh romance-less marriage; the drive to improve one's living standards. Does violence in film escalate violence or is it simply a reflection of society? Does a filmmaker have a moral responsibility to society? Life-changing experiences that aren't so life-changing after all. How many split seconds do you have to make a left turn in downtown traffic? What do you do after miraculously finding/saving an infant? Divine intervention; matchmaking, blind dates and finding Mr. or Ms. ""right”; the ripple-effect each person's actions have on others, revealing humanity's significance, which is contrasted by the idea that humanity is inconsequential compared to the Earth & Universe's timeless marvels, like the Grand Canyon itself.

The picture obviously bites off a lot, but is well able to chew it. It bespeaks of real life and doesn't come off contrived at all. Take for example the teen's driving lesson: He makes a serious mistake and then pulls over. After his father explains a few things he attempts to start the vehicle which is ALREADY running. We've all done that. Another example would be the filmmaker’s beautiful redhead girlfriend Vanessa (Sarah Trigger): She's calm, happy and pleasant one moment but then suddenly starts crying (obviously provoked by a statement). A rambling and uncomfortable emotional rant ensues. It's real. Another example would be Claire's reaction when her son asks if she and Mack are getting a divorce. Shocked, she replies, ""Why would you ask that?! Do we seem like a couple on the verge of divorce?"" She KNOWS that her son wouldn't ask such a question unless he sensed there were problems in the marriage on some instinctual level. These are just three minor examples off the top of my head.

I've heard some complain that there's no humor. Did we see the same movie? There's actually quite a bit of humor or, at least, amusing and light-hearted moments. (How could there not be with Steve Martin in the cast?). Even though the picture is essentially a serious drama I busted out laughing, snickering or smiling on several occasions.

Scanning through the reviews you'll note that ""Grand Canyon"" is a love it or hate it piece. I love it. The acting is, for the most part, great and you really come to care for the characters; you care about the outcome of each of the story lines. One reviewer commented that ""Grand Canyon"" is a depressing film; he couldn't be more wrong. Yes, there are some disconcerting story elements, but watch it till the end. Other reviewers criticize Steve Martin playing a filmmaker with a beard. These people need to get a life; Martin was perfect for the role.

I appreciate that “Grand Canyon"" respects the intelligence of the viewer; it's not dumbed-down, nor is everything spelled out. Some things you have to read in-between-the-lines, others are left to the imagination. It also provokes you to ponder the numerous issues it addresses for days afterward. Few movies have this effect. In fact, there's so much to ""Grand Canyon"" that you'll get something new from the picture with each viewing.

When the movie was originally released a New York Times critic it as the worst movie ever made (Why sure!). First of all, who cares what some moron from the NY Times says? The very fact that he writes for The Times tells you that his artistic judgment shouldn't be taken too seriously.

Also, most critics hailed 2004's ""Crash"" as a masterpiece but it obviously borrowed much from ""Grand Canyon”; the difference is that the latter is the better film. Although ""Crash"" has its merits ""Grand Canyon"" is more entertaining and actually inspiring rather than downbeat.

""Grand Canyon"" is a film of the most eminent order; a masterpiece.

It runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

In the Tulsa area in 1965 the rivalry between the Greasers (poor kids) and the Socs (rich kids) heats up after a gang member is killed. The Greasers supposedly responsible flee the area (C. Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio), but ironically end up being viewed as heroes. Matt Dillon costars while the notable peripheral cast includes the likes of Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, Diane Lane and Leif Garrett.     

“The Outsiders” (1983) was one of two films Francis Ford Coppola shot back-to-back based on S.E Hinton’s young-adult novels. This one was successful at the box office while the even more artsy “Rumble Fish” (1983) failed to draw an audience.

Hinton began writing “The Outsiders,” her most popular novel, in 1965 when she was 16, inspired by two rival gangs at her school, Will Rogers High School, which is about 2.5 miles west of downtown. I bring this up because the movie definitely comes across as an overdramatic tale from the perspective of a teenager. The most mundane, trivial events are presented as life-or-death happenings, like going to a drive-in theater or facing your nemeses at a park where one person idiotically brings a switchblade to a fistfight.

This explains why some people write the flick off as “the cheesiest and corniest movie ever.” In its defense, you have to acclimate to it in order to appreciate it. Go back to what was happening in your life when you were in your mid- teens and how a fistfight or breakup was an earthshattering event. The movie captures this very well.   

The original theatrical film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, while the 2005 Director’s Cut runs 23 minutes longer and includes new music. It was shot in the Tulsa area.

GRADE: B-/B || Hmmm. Francis Ford Coppola has creatively produced a piece of superbly photographed and frequently quite intimate observational cinema here this is far more remarkable for it's casting than for anything especially innovative about the story or the characterisations. Indeed had seven of this cast not gone on to great and good things - to varying degrees - then I'm afraid I can't think this film would rate much better than as an interesting, ""West Side Story"" style derivate with neither the style nor the personalities. It is essentially a gang enmity film - the ""Greasers"" consisting of those at the top of the bill - (a rather toothy) Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze et al having a constant rivalry with their wealthier rivals from the other side of town - The ""Socs"" (Soshes). Every day there are skirmishes between the two until one evening, young Macchio (""Johnny"") and pal ""Ponyboy"" (C. Thomas Howell) are set upon by a group of older lads and tragedy ensues, a tragedy that leads to all concerned discovering and displaying their true colours. Unfortunately, the acting here is all pretty wooden - except, perhaps, for a decent last minute effort from Rob Lowe. Dillon was a good looking man, but like the others here he was never an especially versatile actor and much of the emphasis here is upon the fact they look good in 501s. The story is otherwise a rather humdrum, violent, coming of age effort that ends in sadness and salvation - but is delivered in an almost rushed fashion. Time hasn't been terribly kind to this, it has lost much of what made it potent at the time - but it is still a story worth a watch."

_Raiders_ was great but suffered patches of slowness where the momentum was damaged - I know people who actually fast forward Raiders when Indy and Sallah discover the Well of Souls and begin watching the film again at the plane fight sequence.

_Temple of Doom_, however, is a non stop rollercoaster ride - a thrilling, violent and funny adventure. Spielberg's best action film, in my opinion. Violence, horror, sentimentality, thrills, comedy - _Temple_ has it all! _And more_!!!

John Williams provides a superb Indian infused score performed beautifully by the ever reliable _London Symphony Orchestra_  probably my favourite musical score of the series too. Indy takes a severe beating in this adventure, famously losing his shirt sleeve in the process - whereas in the toned down Raiders rehash, _Last Crusade_, he merely gets a bit of dust on his hat.

A great whirlwind of energy this film is. Love it!

- Potential Kermode || Simultaneously both more grim and more silly than the Indiana Jones films either side of it, _The Temple of Doom_ was my favourite of the series as a kid. As an adult though, it seems it is objectively the worst movie in the trilogy, but damn if there isn't a lot of memorable parts to love about it.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Spielberg on devilishly OTT form!  

Prior to the long mooted and eventual release of part 4, Temple Of Doom was often thought of as the weakest part of the series, yet it actually appears to me to be maturing nicely with age. With honest appraisal I see the only crime that Temple Of Doom can be charged with is is not being as good as Raiders Of The Lost Ark. But since few films can match that movie's classic status I find it churlish to do the second film down for it.

Temple Of Doom is a frenetic roller-coaster ride, full of enough crash bang wallop fit to grace any action adventure in the history of cinema. The set pieces are pure outrageous fun; life raft escape from a crashing plane, mine cart thrill ride & a bridge sequence that is pure boys own brilliance. And while the film finds Spielberg cramming the action with a darkly sinister streak (hence the PG13 rating), we find that the fun still far outweighs any horror that junior viewers might get from certain scenes.

The film also finds Ford giving his best performance as Indiana Jones since the plot calls for a more humane Jones. In fine physical shape, his witty interplay with Short Round is coupled with a textured feel of friendship that plays real well up on the screen. Kate Capshaw was always going to struggle to get close to Karen Allen's wonderful turn as Marion Ravenwood in Raiders, for where Marion was feisty and tough, Capshaw's Willie Scott is more scare-d-cat and reliant on Indy's guile to save her from peril, but she does OK and looks gorgeous into the bargain.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a massive hit at the box-office and firmly bought Spielberg the time to then go out and make two dramas in Empire of the Sun (1987) & The Color Purple (1985). He would then return with the third Indiana film to finish what was then a marvellous trilogy; of which Temple Of Doom is the prime piece of meat in the delightful (original) trilogy sandwich. 8.5/10"

Horrified by the recent atrocities by the Germans and Russians, and fearing that England and America might take a similar turn, Orwell had painted a frightening portrait of the ultimate dictatorship, and the movie faithfully followed him.  Some of the details were:

(1) Continual surveillance, in this case carried out by cameras hidden inside television sets.

(2) Decaying infrastructure and shoddy merchandise produced by the Party's monopoly of the economy.

(3) A political language, NewSpeak, full of euphemisms and code words for the government's activities.

(4) A brutal law-enforcement system in which being suspected even of disloyal THOUGHTS can bring barbaric punishment.

The movie stars John Hurt as the beaten rebel, Susanna Hamilton as his mistress, and Richard Burton as the government official on whom they pin their hopes  (like Orwell himself,  Burton was fatally ill during the production and died before the movie's release) || Do not watch this movie if you are feeling pessimistic or depressed, because the kind of catharsis won’t help you. Nineteen-eighty-four is a bleak movie based on a dark novel that paints a totalitarian world that really sucks. Although they don’t merely tell lies over and over until devotees believe them - instead they actually rewrite historical details in newspapers — still it bears a striking and chilling parallel to the current moment.

The acting is excellent and the sparing use of color is very effective, but I felt there were holes here and there details perhaps explained more fully in the novel. I want to read the book now for comparison, though I gather the film hovers close to its plot. It would be fascinating to know what the other societies were like, especially the ones they are alternately supposed to be at war with or allied to, but I imagine even the novel only deals with this thought-crime ridden hellhole.

It is worth watching for sure, but not at 2 a.m. after your partner has broken up with you and you have lost your job. || This adaptation is a fairly faithful, if a little too abridged, version of the Orwellian story of absolute power, sedition and oppression but it's really John Hurt who makes this version stand out. His performance as the weedy ""Winston"" - a low level bureaucrat in the Ministry of Truth, is visceral as he depicts a character who has found his own way to rebel against the not so benevolent rule of ""Big Brother"". Everything they do, say - even think, is being monitored and so his life is conceivably now in considerable danger. That is only likely to increase after he encounters the like-minded ""Julia"" (Suzanna Hamilton) and together they begin to think the unthinkable! Richard Burton starts to make his presence felt around half way though with his perfectly pitched vocal tones and even more measured delivery creating a sense of torturous menace that you could cut with a knife, and though he features quite sparingly his contributions when the two are together put an whole new meaning on cat and mouse. It's a brutal watch, both physically and psychologically and the use of militaristic archive and the simplicity of it's own production help give this an edge that's gritty and philosophically quite savage as we head even deeper into a society controlled by machines, tyrants and indifference almost eighty years after it was written. It's bleak!"

It also reaffirms in my heart the great adoration I have for Brooke Adams. || Pretty good paranormal thriller with a nice, and strangely normal, performance from Christopher Walken. Kept my attention throughout even if the finale felt a bit rushed and, the final scene, pretty laughable. Still found it entertaining though not sure how much desire I have to re-watch, although I may give the TV series a shot down the line. **3.25/5** || The Dead Zone is a movie that hits several genres and carries itself very well.  It's able to do so due to the strength of the main character, Johnny Smith, played so well by Christopher Walken. Walken's performance is casual at times and absolutely stunning at others.  To think that Bill Murray was thought by Stephen King to be a better option is crazy.  Walken's performance brings out the best in the rest of the ensemble as the movie goes through 3 acts, with several stories intermingled quite nicely with each other. While it is not a true horror movie, in my opinion, the work of David Cronenberg comes out nicely in some scene's that remind you he is in charge of our minds during the 100 minute or so feature.  

I highly recommend this to anyone that loves Stephen King adaptions or psychological thrillers.  It is a movie, that in my opinion, has aged very nicely and holds it's own in any era.  Great film! I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10."
10657.0,Needful Things,"A mysterious new shop opens in a small town which always seems to stock the deepest desires of each shopper, with a price far heavier than expected.",Buy Now. Pay Later.,"Drama, Horror",120,1993-08-27,en,6.2,559,1.2308,"Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, Amanda Plummer, J. T. Walsh",Fraser Clarke Heston,"small town, sheriff, based on novel or book, pain, strangeness, manipulation, malice, prank, devil, desire, occult","The young carpenter from Nazareth? I know him well. Promising young man. He died badly.  

Needful Things is directed by Fraser C. Heston and is adapted for the screen by W.D. Richter from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, J. T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. The community of Castle Rock in Maine is all a tizzy when a new curio gift shop called Needful Things opens its doors. The proprietor is the mysterious Leland Gaunt (Sydow), who agrees to part with special goods in return for the buyer playing pranks on somebody in the community. Pranks that will have far reaching consequences for everyone in Castle Rock. 

To enjoy Needful Things a number of factors will need to be taken into consideration: have you read the book, do you like the book, do you even like Stephen King as a rule and are you expecting another adaptation like Misery (1990)? I wouldn't dream of trying to sell this as a great King adaptation for the big screen, because it's not, but that's no great surprise since great King adaptations seem to come around about as often as Halley's Comet! But it does have much going for it as a time filling piece of entertainment. The book was a door stopper (I personally thought it was great), but Heston (son of Chuck) and Richter have trimmed off the edges and condensed the core aspects of the book into what is now a two hour movie (it was originally a three hour cut). The result is a pacey piece of devilment that's flecked by horror as it sneakily observes human foibles. 

Boasting a better budget that's normally afforded a middle tier King adaptation, Needful Things also benefits from being able to assemble a very strong cast. And on the money they are too. Sydow has a great time, relishing another chance to play charismatic villainy and Harris as the Sheriff is a bastion of hard working honest Americana. Among the supporting cast of the unstable variety, Amanda Plummer nails the role of timid waitress Nettie Cobb, playing it like a coiled spring waiting to unwind, while J. T. Walsh (always value for money as a character actor) does a neat line in corporate bully boy loony on the edge. It's here with the number of characters in the story that the negative flip side of the film shows its hand. With the trimming and cutting comes the inevitable absence of character development, something that is evident both in the book and the film's extended form. So here's the final question on if you can enjoy the film: can you accept lack of depth in the narrative to get a brisker film? 

As it stands it asks a lot from its audience, and without doubt it doesn't have all the answers. But if entering with average expectations, and able to answer yes and no in the right places to the questions posed above? You might just enjoy this more than you thought possible at the outset. 6.5/10 || **_What if the devil literally came to town?_**

What would happen if satan actually visited an American town, albeit undercover? In this case it's a small New England coastal village (shot in British Columbia). Ed Harris plays the main protagonist while Bonnie Bedelia appears as his girlfriend, and Max Von Sydow is on hand as the mysterious shopkeeper who moves into town and causes havoc by selling the villagers their most deepest desires for the price of a ""deed."" So, what would happen if the devil came to town? Would he make it a heathen paradise? A fun, hedonistic haven? Not bloody likely.

Like all Stephen King films based on his books, ""Needful Things"" (1993) takes place in a small town and has a comic book air. It borrows the concept used in ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" (1983) and makes a more compelling flick.

Since the movie utilizes biblical themes I'll consider it from that perspective for the sake of reviewing. According to the bible, the blessing of the Lord produces the qualities of the Garden of Eden, that is, paradise, which is why it says that the kingdom of heaven is a matter of righteousness, peace, joy and power. By contrast, the devil's kingdom produces un-righteousness, strife, war, anxiety, depression, misery, bondage and helplessness.

The fictional town of Castle Rock was a veritable haven before Leland Gaunt (Sydow) moved to town. Sure, there were the typical petty dislikes and rivalries, etc. but, generally speaking, it was a nice place to live, a small coastal paradise, which is what motivated Ed Harris' character to live there. Of course, Gaunt is intent on changing all this.

I just find it interesting the way the new shopkeeper slowly turns the town into a literal living hell. He utilizes the people's petty dislikes, paranoias and jealousies against them.

""Needful Things"" may not be great and it's definitely not scary, but it's effective in a theological sense as a creepy satanic take-over through simple manipulation of human nature. 

The theatrical version runs 2 hours and the TV version 3 hours. I've never seen the latter, but I'm sure it's the better version in that it further fleshes out the characters.

GRADE: B- || Well.... it has a really good cast, I have to give it that. Max Von Sidow SHOULD have been an Oscar favorite and Ed Harris is always watchable.

... but this is a King adaptation and, IDK, maybe it's because like so many others I read the book first...

... but this stinks. It's higher budget than some of the adaptations of his book, but doe the most part it just falls short time and again.

Maybe it would have worked as a miniseries, but as a movie... stay away."

Stephen King’s Cujo was brought to the screen and met with indifference back in 1983, yet it’s aged surprisingly well and comes out as one of the better “mad animal” movies that followed in the wake of Jaws.

A big cuddly St. Bernard dog is bitten on the nose by a bat, cops a serious bout of Hydrophobia and then terrorises anyone in its path. Which spells bad news for Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) and her young son Tad (Danny Pintauro), who have the misfortune to be stuck in a battered old Pinto that has broken down in Cujo’s territory.

Lewis Teague directs with no little skill here, wringing out pot loads of tension and inserting genuine moments of terror as mother and son literally fight for their lives. There’s a school of thought that the film’s first half could have been trimmed, for this is the area that defines the Trenton’s as a family. 

Donna has been having an affair and her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) has found out, so for forty minutes we are investing in family strife and foundation building of the key characters. This is judged perfectly, because once Cujo is unleashed on Donna and Tad, it throws up a number of emotional connections to not only the humans, but also the dog as well.

Wallace and Pintauro are excellent, providing the film with its beating heart as they prove to be a believable mother & son pairing. Teague meanwhile uses some invention with his camera work, though never to the detriment of claustrophobic terror. Elements of the source novel have been left out, while the ending – unfortunately in this viewer’s opinion – has been changed, but this is a tightly wound horror and it’s well due re-evaluation in this day and age of franchise sequels and remakes.

Could have done with more of those bats though, they are awesome! 7/10 || This was solid and unexpectedly fulfilling--perhaps because I'm a cat enthusiast and am neutral towards dogs to begin with. My 13-year-old son and I enjoyed it very much. I haven't read the book yet, so it's unnecessary for enjoyment of the movie IMHO. Worth both a purchase and rewatching for genre aficionados. || God I forgot how fuckin' annoying that kids screaming is... Mad props to the titular Cujo, but I think this particular King adaptation maybe doesn't hold up as well as I thought it might.

Who would have thunk it, that one of Stephen King's short stories would spawn a gargantuan movie franchise? Children of the Corn is one of those movies that horror fans of a certain age, who started to blossom in the 1980s, remember fondly but agree that now it's a bit, well, corny.

Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton get trapped in a village of the damned where the children have killed the adults and established a religious order that gives worship to the devil of the corn. Isaac Chroner (John Franklin) and Malachai Boardman (Courtney Gains) head the creepy kid cult, corn does sway, blood does flow, poor special effects do down the devil, yet it's atmospheric as heck fire and still a bunch of fun if you forgive it its dated foibles. 6/10 || ***Children of the damned… in the cornfields of the American prairie***

A young couple traveling through the endless cornfields of Nebraska (Peter Horton & Linda Hamilton) visits a town so far off the beaten track it’s not even on the map. Yet it seems abandoned, except for some kids scurrying around. Horror ensues.

“Children of the Corn” (1984) takes the remote Plains town setting of “The Last Picture Show” (1971) and gives it a horror spin based on Stephen King’s short story. The later “Husk” (2011) used the same template. King, however, wasn’t pleased with the results, as conveyed in his statement: ""My feeling is like a guy who sends his daughter off to college. You hope she'll do well. You hope she won't fall in with the wrong people. You hope she won't be raped at a fraternity party, which is pretty well what happened to Children of the Corn.""

The uninhabited town with scavenging kids makes the film come across as a post-apocalyptic flick. The protagonists are likable and the movie works up some creepy rural mood. People have described the film as sacrilegious, but it’s clear that the kids’ hybrid religion is not a true expression of Christianity since it’s clearly sullied by “he who walks behind the rows.” One of the picture’s criticisms is the ambiguity of this thing, but I suppose enough is revealed to put the pieces together. Still, the lack of exposition is disappointing. And the gaudy effects in the last act are lousy.

Another arguable negative is the portrayal of the cult with the use of child & teen actors. I think they did pretty good all things considered. The growing schism between leader Isaac (John Franklin) and chief disciple Malachai (Courtney Gains) is interesting. It’s just difficult to portray diabolic cults, like witches and satanists, without getting eye-rolling and laughable. 

In any case, imagine the casting auditions for Malachai wherein the producers are looking for a tall teenage boy with a mean face and shocking mane. Courtney Gains enters the room and answers some questions when the producers state: ""This is going well; you've just about got it clinched. But, as a formality, could you shout ‘Outlander’ at the top of your lungs?”     

The movie runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot mainly in Iowa.

Judith Barsi’s performance as Anne-Marie is unforgettable. Knowing she recorded her final scenes before her tragic passing adds a bittersweet layer to the movie.

Their idyllic existence is put under threat, though, when their erstwhile kindly uncle ""Fester"" (Christopher Lloyd) is duped by a couple of arch-cons to try and claim their family fortune - and home - and thus render them broke and homeless. Now, can ""Gomez"" thwart this cunning plan before his family are actually reduced to sleeping in graves - for real? The casting, writing and direction from a top-of-his game Barry Sonnenfeld make for an entertaining spoof of all thing macabre whilst still extolling a semblance of family virtues and loyalty - told in real time and using some amiable flashbacks from when they were all ""younger"".

Initially they are sympathetically embarrassed but then that morphs into something a little more participative as the brandy and the bourbon starts to take effect on everyone. In vino vertitas has never been more true as it emerges that the older couple have a son, the other bugger, and it's clear from early on that something on that front is not right. The younger couple are not immune from the prevailing toxicity and before long they are also starting to question some of what underpins their own relationship. As tempers flare, things become even more unpleasant - even violent, as there are no holds barred and psychological cruelty becomes the benchmark for just about all of them. I saw this on stage and loved it. On the big screen, Mike Nicholls has used his cinematic advantages to make it even more potent. By using the cast together, splitting them off into pairs, changing the location from their increasingly small living room, occasionally involving an innocent bystander to temporarily lessen the stress levels and even pouring some coffee into them, we tell a remarkably hard-hitting story of grief. A festering, poisonous emotion that when not dealt with can grow to throttle just about any relationship - especially if the vintner is on it, too. Taylor and Burton excel, there's no other word for it. Her performance makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up and is perfectly foiled by the more understated but just as brutal characterisation of ""George"" by a Burton rather benignly bedecked in his middle-aged cardigan - but don't be fooled. Though the plot doesn't focus so much on the others at the start, both Segal and a strong effort from Dennis come into their own too as the ghastliness of their new friends proves contagious and noxious. It's also directed as if we were watching from various points in the room, which adds extra impact as we see things from differing perspectives - but always with a horribly natural flow. It often comes across as a continuous stream of filming akin to how it would be presented live on a stage. This is cinema at it's most visceral with compelling characterisations and dialogue that really does hurt. Maybe don't watch if you've just had a row, or a few drinks, or both? No remakes, please."

Unfortunately, the movie fumbles the ball on the female front a little bit. There are quality women in the cast, for sure, but the director never milks these resources for their worth (and I’m not tawkin’ bout nudity or sleaze).

Jerry Lewis stars, directs, produces and co-writes (with Bill Richmond) this comedy take on Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

The Nutty Professor is a film I adored as a child, and truth be told most of Jerry Lewis' films made a humorous mark in my spotty youth, but not many can now be viewed in adulthood and still tickle the rib cage with the same mirthful impact. The Nutty Professor still does to me now what it first did many many years ago.

Reading some of the reviews around the internet you can see some people going a bit deeper than is really necessary, yes there are some interesting things to delve into if you so wish, (beauty skin deep, the meek rising, be yourself, social acceptance issues etc etc) but ultimately it's a comedy spin on the Dr. Jekyll & Mr Hyde story with Jerry Lewis in sublime pratfall mode.

Lewis' reading of the ""good & bad"" side of one man is basically he expressing he himself, and he has great fun with both sides of the character. There's some very funny sequences along the way, reference Kelp's attempt at bulking up at the gym and jitterbugging at the dance, and all things build to the climax where common sense prevails as the heart strings get tugged and the smile lands firmly on the face. Joining Lewis in the froth broth as the love interest is Stella Stevens, who is not only socko sexy and gorgeous - splendidly attired in Edith Head's figure hugging costumes - she also proves to be great foil for both of Lewis' characterisations. 

Awash with Technicolor and comic vibrancy, The Nutty Professor is a classic case of comedic film making done with invention and a sheer willingness to entertain. 9/10"

The sole thing I knew about <em>'Watership Down'</em> pre-watch was that it's relatively graphic and had an impact on children at the time of its release. Well, I can certainly see why! Heck, even by today's standards it's still pretty out there in terms of how it portrays the violence.

The animation, for its time, is absolutely splendid - super effective! The music is also noteworthy. I will say that I don't think the characters are anything above solid, like post-watch I can't really remember any of them individually; visually at least, because the voice cast are very good. || The instantly recognisable tones of Sir Michael Hordern set the scene as he tells us a tale of yore about the rabbit.

Together with ""Fiver"" they go anyway but it's not long before they encounter the rather more militaristic one run by the menacing ""Woundwort"" who rules with claws and blood. I aways though their something Orwellian about Richard Adams's novel, and the selection of the sweet and docile bunny rabbit as the subject for this rather ferocious analysis of societal dysfunction adds even better to the anachronisms as even they prove to have a class system, an hierarchy and even their own furry version of a secret police! The animation is gorgeous to watch. The innocence and frivolity; the violence and the brutality - they are all captured quite graphically at times as the story unfolds. Art Garfunkel's song ""Bright Eyes"" doesn't actually feature so prominently as I'd remembered, but it does add quite potently for the few moments it's used to illustrate that which is tantalisingly close for ""Hazel"" and co. There's something truly fitting about a conclusion that seems righteous, even if it does rather reinforce the survival of the fittest mentality that these critters are trying to escape - with four legs or two."

I was hoping that this movie was going to be a lot better than it was. To myself, I thought it would be great as this was one of Jim Henson’s more notable films. However, the story didn’t really grip me all that much. That could be because today we have a ton of these movies. The one where the is the hero who must overcome an orphan story to become the hero that they are today. 

However today, that has been all, but played. There could be the argument that it wasn’t done at the time all that well, and that is why this movie is good. However, I’m not a fan of that argument. As older movies can still hold up even though they have the same overarching story as the movies in the genre that succeed them. This one, I didn’t feel like had any real differences except it was done with puppets. The fact that you have puppets in a movie should not be the selling point. The selling point should be that you can use those puppets to tell a better story.

In summation. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t all that good. It was right in the middle of the road for a movie. || When the old emperor dies, a new even nastier ""Skeksis"" one takes his place, and so begins this latest reign of terror for all the ""Gelfling"" on the distant world of ""Thra"".

That onerous task now falls to the timid ""Jen"" and his friend ""Kira"" and so they set off on a series of perilous adventures as they must locate the crystal and get it to the temple so that it can regenerate and defeat the vulture-like (look at my avatar) creatures. It's a cracking story of good versus evil, with the monstrous creations of Jim Henson delivering quite an effective, in a pantomime sort of fashion, degree of peril as the tension builds up. The humans I didn't care for so much - they're a bit weedy; but the monsters are crafted with detail and originality and the use of colourful visuals to augment the story whilst evoking a sense of mystery and danger works well too. It's got plenty of action, mysticism and even if I did hate the predictably goody-goody denouement, I did enjoy the film and though it has dated, that didn't spoil it too much."

It's Samantha Baker's 16th birthday and her family are so wrapped up in her sisters impending wedding, they have completely forgotten Sam's big day. Not only that but she has the hots for school hunk Jake Ryan who, apparently doesn't know she even exists. Her existence, however, is noted by freshman Ted ""The Geek"" who lusts after her at every opportunity. Being 16 really isn't all it's cracked up to be, maybe?

John Hughes directs his first feature film and sets out his marker for the career that was to come for the astute observer of teen angst and coming of age drama.

Featuring Hughes faves Molly Ringwald (Sam0 & Anthony Michael Hall (Ted), Sixteen Candles is frothy on the outside but not without cunning substance on the inside. It's the sort of film that is easy to forgive its obviousness on account of its understanding of its characters, something that Hughes was a master of. Even as we run through the staple requirements of the teen comedy movie (dance, party, making out etc ) Hughes manages to avoid the cliché pitfalls of such sequences by fuelling them with believable patois. 

His cast, with the exception of the dull Michael Schoeffling (Jake), are sparky and engaging throughout. With the Cusack siblings, John & Joan also showing up in the strong supporting cast. There's an Asian exchange student thread that some have tried to paint as stereotypically offencive, but that is nonsense! Gedde Watanabe ensures the role is the fun and harmless one it's meant to be.

The soundtrack is kicking and very at one with the story (another knack of Hughes), it features the likes of The Specials, The Revillos, Billy Idol, The Stray Cats and The Thompson Twins. And the Evanston, Illinois location work really fleshes out the feeling of the piece.

Not just a film for 80s nostalgists then, one for pretty much anyone who was 16 and had their emotions pulled all over the place. 7/10 || Really fun, and funny, romantic-comedy that is to me akin to Ferris Bueller's Day Off style of humor from John Hughes (vs. something like The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink with a more serious tone or themes). Anyway, this was my first time seeing this and while I still place TBC and FBDO over this, still another great film from Hughes to come out of the 80s and, like those, still works so well today. **4.0/5**"
11522.0,Pretty in Pink,"Andie is an outcast, hanging out either with her older boss, who owns the record store where she works, or her quirky high school classmate Duckie, who has a crush on her.

And Duckie's pretty crazy.,"Romance, Drama, Comedy",97,1986-02-28,en,6.723,1145,2.3481,"Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy, Jon Cryer, Annie Potts, Harry Dean Stanton","Howard Deutch, John Hughes","high school, jealousy, bullying, outcast, crush, clique, first love, fashion design, peer pressure, social differences, school life, abandoned by mother, 1980s, wealth differences, teenage angst, record store, crush on friend, high school prom","You're ashamed to go out with me.

Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) is different to most kids at school. Being solely raised by her unemployed father, Jack (Harry Dean Stanton), and dressing in hand made clothes, she's very much from the wrong side of the tracks. It's tough in school as Andie and her pals are looked down on by the more wealthy students who make up the majority of the student body. With the prom on the horizon, Andie is feeling a little more bluer than normal, but hope comes in the form of Blane McDonough (Andrew McCarthy), a so called rich kid, who in spite of peer pressure asks Andie to the prom. This is something that alienates Andie and Blane from their so called friends.

As it turned out, ""Pretty In Pink"" was another in the line of John Hughes films that really hit the mark with the teenagers of the time. In fact it's fair to say it impacted with almost everyone who had suffered a less than straight forward climb through some angsty teenage years. It's not a perfect piece by any stretch of the imagination, for at times it's twee and at others a little trite, it is nevertheless a finely crafted piece that deals with teen perils and the ugliness of class division. Unfortunately the class divide is something that rarely gets associated with the pic, because focus tends to be drawn to the love story at its heart. Which is a shame, because although audience expectation will undoubtedly be met in that department, Hughes has plotted it nicely to make a valid point. There is also the real notable thread of the single parent here, where the single parent is a man and a man who is unable to break free of the escalating distress caused by the break up of his marriage to Andie's mother. The two best serious scenes in the film both involve the father/daughter axis, where both Ringwald and H.D. Stanton are simply terrific. Comedy relief comes in the form of Andie's best pals, Duckie (Jon Cryer our hero) and Iona (Annie Potts), with both characters neatly inserted into the structure of the piece. While the direction from Howard Deutch is careful and brings about reality based performances from the predominantly youthful cast.

Containing a kicking 1980s soundtrack from the likes of ""New Order"", ""Echo And The Bunnymen"", ""Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark"" and ""The Psychedelic Furs"", ""Pretty In Pink"" is a special movie on the CV of John Hughes. It will not be special to all comers, but for many, myself included, it strikes a mighty chord, one that was first heard back in the 1980's and for sure can still be heard today. 8/10 || Enjoyable enough teen rom-com from writer John Hughes, though, and this only after my first viewing, not a favorite of mine of his. Still, for the most part I liked the core cast and thought it had its moments. However, this is near the bottom of John Hughes' brilliant career in the 1980s. **3.5/5** || The opening bars of the Psychedelic Furs' song are probably all that really lingers in the memory from this teenage romance; that and the cracking rendition of ""Try a Little Tenderness"" by the star of the film Jon Cryer's lovelorn ""Duckie"". The thrust of the plot revolves around the eccentric outsider ""Andie"" (Molly Ringwald) and her burgeoning romance with posh boy ""Blane"" (Andrew McCarthy) much to the chagrin of his odious pal ""Steff"" (James Spader). Now the latter man tried it on with her, but was given short shrift and so is now pretty disdainful of her to the rather drippy and spineless ""Blane"". Will they manage to get it all sorted out before prom (where we hear what has to be the 24"" version of OMD's ""If You Leave"" accompanied by some dancing that, well, just doesn't work!)? Cryer steals the film really, and along with the soundtrack of predominately British hits from the 1980s helps to deliver an amiable degree of nostalgia. It's still worth a watch, but it really has lost much of it's lustre now and shows just how little actual acting talent was around at the time - very much style and songs over substance"

St. Elmo's fire is not comedy-driven and there isn't much of a plot. This is more of a slice of life piece about a group of young people embarking on their careers and lives. The soundtrack works well, the music was good for the time. 

Andie MacDowell and Andrew McCarthy are great in their respective roles even if Andie's character doesn't speak much. Emilio Estevez and Judd Nelson make honest attempts with the material they are given, and they aren't horrible, but both actors have done much better in lesser roles or maybe they needed more of a role.

When his aunt suddenly dies, a grieving horror writer and Vietnam vet (Katt) moves into her manor wherein he experience strange and frightening things. What’s going on? Wendt plays his neighbor, Kay Lenz his ex-wife and Richard Moll a soldier pal in Vietnam. 

""House"" (1985) takes the done-to-death haunted house genre and adds creativity and humor along with the expected frights. It’s an entertaining horror/comedy where everything ‘clicks,’ mixing elements of “Poltergeist” (1982), “Basket Case” (1982) and “Ghostbusters” (1984). The Vietnam sequences are odd for the genre, but the pieces of the puzzle fit by the last act. 

Mary Stavin (Tanya) stands out on the feminine front with a couple quality scenes.

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in Monrovia, California (house exteriors), which is just northeast of Los Angeles, as well as Doheny Mansion at Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles (interiors).

Based on just the first half of Michael Ende's original novel, it's a gentle fantasy tale of a young boy - ""Bastian"" (Barret Oliver) - who is being bullied by three classmates. When one day he seeks refuge in a bookshop, the owner shows him a mysterious book that he ""borrows"" and reads - introducing him to the magical, and dangerous, kingdom of ""Fantastica"" where he learns that it's benign, kindly young ""Childlike Empress"" is dying and that only he can help ""Atreyu"" (Noah Hathaway) save her and everyone from disaster at the hands of ""The Nothing"". The youngsters are strong with their performances, and Wolfgang Petersen's adaption of his own screenplay remains reasonably faithful to the delicate story with clever, engaging animation - a combination of intricate puppetry and blue-screen effects that is both charming and fun: the luck dragon (""Falkor"") and the ""Gmork"" greatly add to the story of wishes and secrets as ""Bastian"" races against time to accomplish his task. Time has been quite kind to this film (apart from, maybe, the haircuts!) and it still holds up well. || A fantasy flick of real quality!

I got to watch this at the cinema thanks to its release as part of its 40th anniversary, the second movie I've seen re-released on the big screen after <em>'Trainspotting'</em> back in May. That Danny Boyle flick from 1996 is great, as is this Wolfgang Petersen feature from 1984. I wasn't sure what to expect, I only knew of its genre and that famous theme song.

One of the first things to note about <em>'The NeverEnding Story'</em> is how well it has aged, it looks awesome. The practical effects still look top quality and are super effective, I watched <em>'Big Trouble in Little China'</em> yesterday and that has aged rather poorly in the effects department - and was released two years after this!

I really loved seeing the world come to life. The effects are a big reason for that, though this shows the importance of getting strong voice actors. Alan Oppenheimer is fantastic in the roles of Falkor, Gmork and Rockbiter, credit to Robert Easton as Morla too. As for the 'normal' actors, Sydney Bromley, Moses Gunn and Tilo Prückner are excellent in their respective roles.

Younger actors Barret Oliver, Noah Hathaway and Tami Stronach all do good work. I could've done without, and this my only thing close to a criticism (which it even isn't), the constant leaps back to the reader (Oliver's Bastian), it's not bad but sometimes doesn't feel necessary; less is more, sorta thing.

A brilliant film, one with an edge to it as well... 🕊️🐎"

She is becoming increasingly paranoid, confused and resentful of a seemingly indofferent husband who seems content to let just about everyone interfere as the due date approaches. This is also Roman Polanski at his best as he manages to amalgamate the sinister and the coercive with the religiosity of a story that exudes menace and panic whilst also calling into question established societal values around faith and trust. It's almost claustrophobic by design, and their small apartment soon takes on the mantle of a cell occupied by a woman who is very much not in control of her own destiny - whichever way she tries to turn, and with the careful use of a score from Christopher Komeda that could rival Bernard Herrmann then we have a story of visceral fear that looks great on a big screen.

Given that <em>'The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter'</em> released six years after the original, has no cast carryovers aside from Thomas Hill and is missing prior director Wolfgang Petersen, it isn't exactly a surprise to see it fall far adrift of the great 1984 movie.

The effects for the likes of Falkor aren't that different to before, though with voice actor Alan Oppenheimer missing the character doesn't stand out at all really - I did mention in my review of the first film that I felt Oppenheimer was a major reason for its success, his absence here only proves that. Donald Arthur doesn't quite do as well.

For those onscreen, Jonathan Brandis' performance is actually solid enough - but what lets things down is his dialogue, a lot of which feels unnatural. Kenny Morrison, as Atreyu, is probably the only performer that puts in a showing that is on similar level to their counterpart from the preceding feature.

With all that the case, I can't quite class this as good. I will say that I wasn't begging for the credits to come at any point, I just wasn't all that invested either. A standard 6/10 flick, for me."

""Return to Paradise"" (1998) is about three Americans in Malaysia. Two of them are friends from New York City (Vincent Vaughn and David Conrad) and the other they meet there, an environmental-hippie type (Joaquin Phoenix). The three have a great time partying together and then the two from New York go back to the grind in the USA. Two years later they find out that their friend in Malaysia has been in prison for having too much hashish, which the three purchased together. Due to the country's severe drug laws, those considered traffickers are put to death and, unfortunately, the hippie possessed beyond the limit. He'll hang in eight days unless the other two go back and they'll all get 3 years in prison; if only one goes back it's 6 years each. Will they go back?

That's the set-up of the film and it's not a spoiler since this all unfolds in the first 20 minutes, which means that most of the rest of the movie takes place in New York and focuses on whether or not the other two will go back and save their friend. Keep in mind that this was a dude they met in Malaysia so it's not like they were bosom buddies from their youth or anything.

The trailer of ""Return to Paradise"" miss-advertised the film as a thriller largely taking place in exotic SE Asia, but that's not the case. This is a drama that involves a moral conundrum, a Christ figure and possible redemption. The story concentrates on Vaughn and Anne Heche, the latter as the lawyer of the hippie who tries to convince the other two to go back to save their friend. Complicating the situation even further is the fact that there are no legal documents involved since Malaysia is a third world country and, as such, there's no guarantee that the two will ""only"" get three years. And what about the other potential negative possibilities, like never making it out of the hellhole alive?

This is a top of the line film and the producers went all-out to serve up a quality picture; for instance, the Malaysian prison scenes are very convincing. Also, the actors are great across the board and Vaughn proves that he can nail a dramatic role. Moreover the moral is to die for, no pun intended. Unfortunately the actors are strapped to the contrivances of the plot and I had a hard time seeing them as real people in a real situation. In other words, it seemed like the characters do this-or-that merely because the screenplay says he or she is supposed to do this-or-that at that moment. And so I was never really able to embrace them as real people, but rather as puppets manipulated by the script. Still, it's not bad and it's worth catching if you like the actors and the story trips your trigger.

The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in New York City, Thailand, New Jersey, Philadelphia and China.

It's also worth noting that the success of this movie - an R rated vampire flick with an African American lead - gave birth to the comic book movie era. The action, effects, and music are silly and dated, plus the story makes no sense. But Blade is nevertheless still fun. || First released in 1998, Blade brought commercial success back to Super Hero films, after the woeful distribution of films like Batman & Robin and Steel stopped the genre in its tracks.

Starring Wesley Snipes as the eponymous Half-Vampire/Half-Human hybrid come Super Hero/Vampire Hunter, Blade works with Dr. Karen Jensen and Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) in order to defeat vampires Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and Quinn (Donal Logue) and their host of undead soldiers before they can kill Gitano Dragonetti (Udo Kier) and the other vampire Elders in a ritual that will transform Deacon Frost into La Magra, the vampire Blood God.

With me so far? No? That figures. The script's interesting, but it's not terribly sense-making. What I mean to say, is, the script's rubbish, but the *story* is great. The whole film is really rather story and effects driven, but the characters are pretty lacking. Quinn is sort of fun, and Deacon's... well... he's attractive, but not a lot else. Still, there's more to him than most of the characters, including the titular Blade.

Straight up, just putting out there, I think goth-culture is attractive, so, my aesthetics may go quite a way to influencing my decision in the final score, if you disagree with me, you might want to keep that in mind, seeing as most vampires have at least a little bit of that going on. All that aside though, the opening of Blade is one of the strongest ways a film can start off that I've ever seen. It has basically everything you could want for a modern vampire tale. Including the Blood Rave song, Confusion (Pump Panel Remix) by New Order.

The cinematography was another cool point, lots of ins and outs in a non-nauseating way. Although the fight choreography suffered from a serious case of ""Only-One-Guy-Attacks-At- A-Time"" Syndrome. Come on guys, this ain't Tekken. When there's an army to fight, fight an army. Maybe not all at once, I know that could get a tad pointless, but it really didn't transfer well in this film.

To end with, there's one plot-hole I'd like to bring up, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything too badly, but if you want to go in completely fresh, stop reading. There's one point when Frost says he needs to kill the 12 Elder vamps in a big underground ritual in order to complete his ascendancy into the Blood God (Khorne?), but he kills the leader earlier, on a beach. Okay, so maybe he wasn't counted, and he was actually number 13. But, Frost's lady-friend Mercury kills another with Blade's sword, before the ritual gets started, and nobody seems to care... I am dubious- faced.

After all that though, Blade is a vampire film that's not slow like Nosferatu, and not indescribably awful like Twilight, so for people with tastes like mine, it's certainly worth a geez.

-Gimly || The Daywalker. 

Half human and half vampire, Blade's function in life is to rid the world of vampires, he is driven forward by the notion that his mother was killed by his half brethren.

This is no ordinary vampire film, this is nothing to do with bearing crosses and creatures making music of the night, this is armoured weaponry, dazzling swordplay and a protagonist that is as cool as anything that has leaped off of the comic book page. Wesley Snipes (perfect piece of casting) is Blade, a much troubled superhero (aren't they all?), he has to take a formula suppressant to keep away his inner vampire cravings. Aided by trusty pal, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), they wage war against all blood suckers and here they must stop the sinister Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) from executing his monstrous plan.

There are no cranial pondering's here in this piece, this is a joyously high velocity action horror movie, containing great choreography and retaining its comic book heart. Blade is pure popcorn fodder for the MTV generation, in fact director Stephen Norrington utilises his music video background to great effect as the combat scenes are scored with delightful sledgehammer precision. Blood brains and gore flow freely as the film hurtles towards the head splitting conclusion, loud, dark and tinged with brooding menace, Blade is hugely recommended for a ripper of a night in. 7.5/10"

It's great. Basically a play. There couldn't have been more than 15 shots. Ending had me in tears. Shouts out || Rope was the first Alfred Hitchcock/James Stewart collaboration.  They would go on to do ""Rear Window"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", and finally, ""Vertigo"".  This being the first, and also a kind of experimental film on Hitchcock's part, it is the weakest of the four.  Shot as a play, mainly in one room, and with only a handful of cast members, the concept of how it was done is intriguing even today.  Done in roughly a dozen takes, the only times that the camera ever cuts are when it closes in on someone's back and then angles around to the other side.  That's the tell-tale sign of the only cuts in the entire film.

John Dall's acting is commendable, in the part of the more ruthless killer, Brandon Shaw.  He's a very cool character, and feels no guilt over the brutal murder he's just committed.  James Stewart, great as he is, seemed a bit out of his element, as intellectual publisher Rupert Cadell.  Stewart is always immensely enjoyable, and I have massive respect for his talent.  However, he does appear somewhat uncomfortable with his part throughout the film.

Another aspect that detracts from the tension is the opening scene of the murder taking place.  After David Kentley is dead, he is placed in the wooden chest and the audience knows he's dead from scene 1.  Had Hitchcock omitted the scene of the murder, the audience would no doubt be wondering ""Is there really a body in that chest?  Did they really do it?  What's going on here?""  And the red herrings in the film would only add to the suspense.  As it is, we know from the start who's dead and who-done-it.  That said, it's a decent movie, and certainly still worth the watch. || Now I may be completely off beam here, but there is something ever so slightly homo-erotic about the relationship between John Dall (""Brandon"") and Farley Granger (""Philip"") in this rather clunky murder tale that is less of a mystery and more of a bragging exercise. The two, having murdered their college friend ""David"" invite some folks round for a dinner party that shows the pair - especially Dall - as obnoxious men with a profoundly mis-placed superiority complex. As their odiousness is enhanced by over-confidence and drink, their former school master ""Rupert"" (Jimmy Stewart) starts to suspect that there is more to the absence of ""David"" (the more suspicious because his father, Sir Cedric Hardwicke has come to the supper) than meets the eye; and soon he begins to put two and two together. I found the long takes helped build the tension quite effectively, but the dialogue was relentless and the fine line between characterisation and irritation - for me, anyway, was well and truly crossed. If Dall's purpose was to alienate the room and the audience, then he succeeded spectacularly - and it says in the trailer - it's certainly not a film you will ever forget."

It's always great to take a revisit to Frenzy some years after your last viewing, to re-evaluate it post haste. As a proud Englishman it gives me great pleasure to see the Master back in England capturing the English time frame of London perfectly, for the film works because we really get the vibe of the place and believe in the characters who frequent the area, Hitch delivers this no problem at all.

The story stands up as genuine thriller material, some crazy fruit loop is strangling women with neck ties and the police are trailing the wrong man...Sound familiar? Well yes it is, but Hitch being Hitch, he manages to bring dashes of humour to go with the tense taut terror unfolding on the screen.

The cast do fine here, and I do believe that the fact that none of the actors are top draw names actually helps the film bring out an uneasy feel, here the interesting fleshing of the characters is one of Hitchcock's great strengths in this particular piece. The villain of the piece stands up as one of the best because he could easily be your best mate, someone you readily turn to in times of need, yet strip away that facade and you get the savage murdering rapist that Hitchcock takes great delight in assaulting our eyes with.

Lovely...Lovely...LOVELY....LOVELY !

Although its rating on the IMDb movie site hovers around 7.5 I have always been led to believe that Frenzy wasn't all that well thought of, with tales of America refusing to embrace the film because of the London sensibility, and tired old arguments about the great man being past his peak etc. I have no idea if any of those statements are true? But what I personally know is that Frenzy is a very good film that has me squirming and laughing in equal measure. So with that it may just be shy of being a Hitchcock classic, but still it stands up as better than what most other thriller directors could ever have hoped to have achieved back in that era.  8/10 || This is one of those thrillers that is in no way a whodunnit as it becomes evident very early on that the killer is who you think it is going to be.
But that is not sloppy film making, it is entirely deliberate, for the mystery here is not who is the killer, but will he get away with it, and what will happen to our hero?
It is a well plotted piece, and, oddly, based on a true story.

The general feel of London in the early 70s is well presented, and the locations are well chosen to give the overall viewing of the film a very satisfactory glow.

Not one of Hitchcocks classics, to be fair, but still a great film and one that will certainly entertain. || This is probably my least favourite Hitchcock story. It is still cleverly constructed, but somehow it has a vulgarity to it that I rather struggled with. The premiss is a serial killer who has been brutally killing women using a neck tie, then dumping their bodies. The police are baffled until ""Brenda Blaney"" (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) is found raped and killed in her office, and suspicion falls on her ex husband ""Dick"" (Jon Finch). He flees, is apprehended and judicial process takes it's course. We all know who actually killed ""Brenda"" so insofar as this is a murder mystery, then that's that. It is, though, quite a curious character study of the mind of a man who is jovial and engaging one moment, then brutally lethal the next - a sort of deadly schizophrenia that might be borne out of sexual frustration, or misogyny, childhood - all of the above? Barry Foster is efficient, if a little lightweight as ""Rusk"" and there are enthusiastic efforts from Anna Massey and pub landlord Bernard Cribbins. What raises this (slightly) above the norm, is the fun sub-plot between Alec McGowen (""Chief Insp. Oxford"") and his wife Vivien Merchant - she a budding gourmet who seems intent on offering the poor man the most complex dishes when all he wants is pie and mash; and - as ever with Hitch - intimate and clever use of the camera. What suspense there is all comes to a rather weak head, I felt, and though this is still an eminently watchable film, it is all just a little bit tacky, and it lacks much that made it's director great. It might have worked better in black and white?"

Sometimes cited as the last decent Hitchcock film, Marnie actually should be regarded as one of the maestro's best films full stop! A swirling mysterious tale of repressed sexuality and traumatic falsehoods, Marnie to me is one of Hitch's more accomplished works.

Tippi Hedren is Marnie, a woman who is both a kleptomaniac and a pathological liar, but her problems are more deep rooted than the surface ones we see. Sean Connery is Mark Rutland, he catches Marnie out for robbing the safe at his company and we then follow the two on a journey to get to the bottom of the demons that are gnawing away at Marnie - to the point that flashes of red and the touch of Mark send her into terrified panic.

With bleak back drops and fluctuating climate conditions, Hitchcock pulls the audience into Marnie's troubled psyche, and with Hedren's perfectly tense and wrought performance fittingly snug, the film delivers the goods for a fine Hitchcock viewing. As usual some scenes are priceless Hitch, a nightmare sequence with a tapping hand at the window hits the mark, while a scene involving a horse thumps the emotive heart and steers the film towards the special finale.

Is his wife that bad, or is Guy really a social climber who wants to be rid of his unfashionable spouse in order to acquire a trophy wife?   Does he send mix signals to Bruno because he really wants Bruno's plot to succeed?  The notion of hidden, shadowy evil is what gives this thriller its power. || Tennis pro ""Haines"" (Farley Granger) is quietly travelling in the club car of a train when his neighbour ""Bruno"" (Robert Walker) strikes up a conversation. It all seems innocuous enough, the former man is an accomplished player and it seems to him that this is a fan, of sorts, who just wants some company as he drowns his journey in Scotch. What quickly becomes clear from this chat is that both have people in their lives they'd rather be without. ""Haines"" is married to ""Miriam"" (Kasey Rogers) but would far sooner be married to senator's daughter ""Anne"" (Ruth Roman) whilst ""Bruno"" desperately wants shot of his overbearing father (Jonathan Hale). How about these two complete strangers carry out a cunningly planned murder each that will solve the other's problem? The athlete is having none of this, but when ""Bruno"" takes matters into his own hands a bit of menacing blackmail rears it's ugly head before the suspicious police start sniffing around and ""Haines"" finds himself in quite a spot. This is one of Raymond Chandler's better structured stories with quite an intricate series of layers to it - each more perilous for the hapless, lovestruck and out of his depth ""Haines"". There develops a palpable chemistry between the on-form Walker and Granger who both manage to keep this story compelling as director Alfred Hitchcock turns the screws gently but firmly on both of these characters. It all comes to an head in a fairground where the dazzling lights, highly pitched music and accumulating sense of panic complete a tautly presented and powerfully scored (by Dimitri Tiomkin) drama that looks at human vice, betrayal and temerity. Trains always provide well as conduits for crime thrillers, and with strong, if sparing, support from the likes of Marion Lorne, Leo G. Carroll, Hitch's own daughter Patricia as the meddling ""Barbara"" and a short cameo from Norma Varden (before she discovered large, ugly, hats) to add some richness - and diversion - to the machinations, then it might just make you very wary of striking up any conversation with any stranger ever again!"

I always support the baddies in movies, and here was no different - but I was very nearly tempted by the courage and decency of ""Willow"" to switch sides. Kilmer is on good form, his role allows him to flourish with some witty dialogue and plenty of swash and buckle as the denouement - and a magical one at that - looms large. Ron Howard and George Lucas have let their imagination take control here, and I felt it worked rather well. The photography and action scenes work well, and though maybe the story is a bit of an hybrid of others, it still doesn't stop this being an enjoyable David and Goliath style battle that is peppered with some strong supporting performances, some familiar faces and , I think, gets better with age. || **Warwick Davis' life movie isn't bad, but it's not really good either.**

Fantasy cinema has experienced moments of brilliance thanks to the creativity of a good number of directors and screenwriters, and also due to the possibilities brought by technology. However, in the past, things were simpler: directors and technical teams of fantasy films were those people used to improvising a lot and thinking outside the box. That skill is a talent, surely, and sometimes it's preferable to do something more traditional than to use CGI resources so absurdly fake that they don't even deserve to be there. This film, despite being far from being good or deserving a praise, is not a waste of time and there are several details where we can observe redeeming qualities.

The film's value begins with the more or less direct involvement of several prominent people in the film industry at the time: a film written by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard cannot properly be considered a B-movie. Howard directs impeccably, but the truth is that Lucas could have made an additional effort in the script: the story that guides the film is funny, it has good moments, but it is also full of clichés and strange little peculiarities that do not fail to lift us up doubts every moment.

Despite the projection given to Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley in advertising (it is an understandable maneuver since they are well-known actors), the real protagonist is the dwarf Warwick Davis. Yes, it's not a pristine performance worthy of an award, but he couldn't be much better: the actor was still young and inexperienced, but he managed to show talent and resoluteness, making the most of this beautiful opportunity that appeared in his life. Val Kilmer, although more famous, doesn't need to do much and has few real challenges, while the beautiful Whalley and Jean Marsh are authentic attention grabbers and do an equally satisfying job.

Technically, it is a film whose value lies in the very well-designed sets and costumes, and also in the soundtrack, skilfully composed but a little forgettable. It has several special effects, most of them quite dated, but functional. The problem is that, for a film of the fantasy genre, it ends up having a little less ""magic"" than would be desirable. And despite the story being a little convoluted, the film picks up a high enough pace that this ends up not being a problem. || After watching the film ""Willow"" for the first time, it was perceived as a corny yet lovable movie with entertaining moments, albeit with cheesy and lacking depth. While the film has its charm, it may not be one that warrants repeat viewings, as it falls short in terms of overall enjoyment. The storytelling and character development were deemed subpar, failing to create an enchanting or immersive experience as initially anticipated.

Despite ""Willow"" becoming a cult classic, it ultimately fell into the category of films that are predominantly corny and cheesy. The television series that attempted to capitalize on the movie's cult status failed to live up to expectations, leading to its cancellation after one season. The series struggled to capture the essence of the original film, resulting in a lackluster and unengaging viewing experience.

In conclusion, both the movie and the television series based on ""Willow"" failed to leave a lasting impact and were ultimately deemed uninspiring and difficult to follow. While the film may have its moments, it may not be enough to warrant a recommendation for viewers looking for a captivating and enjoyable cinematic or television experience."
117.0,The Untouchables,"Elliot Ness, an ambitious prohibition agent, is determined to take down Al Capone. In order to achieve this goal, he forms a group given the nickname “The Untouchables”.",What are you prepared to do?,"Crime, History, Thriller",119,1987-06-03,en,7.757,5859,5.6636,"Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro, Charles Martin Smith, Andy García","David Mamet, Brian De Palma, Chip Miller","chicago, illinois, prohibition era, gangster, baseball bat, white suit, tough cop, treasury agent, untouchable, tax evasion, jury tampering, 1930s","Never stop fighting till the fight is done, here endeth the lesson.

As good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet's electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.

I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters the last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is?. It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).

Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film ""The Thing"", they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks... || If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @

Capone starring Tom Hardy is being released this week, so I decided to visit a classic from the late 80s that also features Al Capone (this time portrayed by Robert De Niro). One of my 2020's resolutions is to review older films, classics that I never wrote about, and maybe go through a director's filmography before his/her next big movie. I'll also try to review previous films inside a franchise, for example, before the live-action Mulan is released, I'll definitely rewatch and review the 1998's original. You get my point.

The Untouchables is one of those classics I've already seen a few times, but I can't quite recall the last time I watched it, so it almost felt like a whole new release since I didn't remember most plot points. I really enjoyed experiencing such a great period gangster movie again. The cast is incredible, and I'll get there, but I need to start with the impressive production level for a 1987's flick. From the set design to the well-crafted action sequences, everything looks and feels like Chicago during the Prohibition Era.

I love how the dialogues are played out. Nowadays, it's not that common to have an entire film filled with long, uncut conversations between the characters. Most directors just employ the unimaginative ""line-cut-line"" type of dialogue. I'm not the biggest fan of Brian DePalma, even though he started one of my favorite action sagas of all-time (Mission: Impossible). However, his blocking/framing skills are outstanding in this movie. Every actor's movement is followed seamlessly by the camera (DP: Stephen H. Burum), making every single shot count.

The screenplay is very well-structured. Every time the film starts lacking energy, something impactful occurs. A great action scene, a new story development that changes the course of the narrative, or a character's decision that makes the viewer worried about an inevitable outcome. Consequently, The Untouchables rarely loses its momentum, it's always entertaining in some shape or form. The four characters that constitute the title group are all emotionally compelling, and their actors offer extraordinary performances... except for the lead, Kevin Costner.

I don't know if people might consider this a hot take or not, but I find Costner's display extremely one-dimensional. During the movie, he goes through life-threatening situations, people that he cares about die, and he eventually gets face-to-face with Al Capone. His facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical in all of these scenes, and many more. It's his first big film, the one that catapulted him into stardom, but I'm not the first to find his acting rangeless in this flick. Nevertheless, it doesn't become that big of a distraction that I can't connect with his character.

Regarding the rest of the cast, Sean Connery steals the show with his portrayal of Jim Malone. He's charming and funny, but when he needs to take his character through a very dark and dramatic scene, he has no problems in delivering an exceptional performance. The young Andy Garcia (George Stone) proves that he had the chops to become a great actor (which he did), and Charles Martin Smith is surprisingly witty as Oscar Wallace. My main issue with the movie involves the lack of screentime given to Robert De Niro as Al Capone.

Sure, it's a story about the people who got the famous gangster, and not a biography of the latter. However, not only it's a waste of a phenomenal actor, but also a waste of a potentially great character. Al Capone is supposedly a quite clever businessman and ruthless crime boss, possessing an unusually well-protected organization, but he only appears in a few scattered scenes, like he's just some random villain that the good guys need to defeat. Granted, they're really cool scenes, but he doesn't feel like the massive threat that the film assumes he is since the viewer barely gets to know Al Capone and how he holds so much power.

All in all, The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma's technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987's movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn't allow the viewer to understand Al Capone's motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it's a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.

Rating: A- || Howard Hawks defined a great film as “three good scenes and no bad ones.” The Untouchables has one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema, and not just because it’s patterned after the best known scene in Battleship Potemkin; this has actually become iconic in its own right.

This Brian De Palma movie has several other good scenes, and arguably not a single bad one; it does have, however, a couple of scenes that don’t make a lick of sense — some of the good ones, even.

The bat scene, in particular, is a lot of fun, but I still have no idea who the guy is that Al Capone (Robert De Niro) beats the ever-loving crap out of, nor what he did to deserve such fate (I’ve come across a few explanations on Internet, including what my best guess would be, but nothing that stands up to scrutiny).

Of course, Al Capone personally and literally whacking some random asshole to death is as likely as Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) fatally pushing Frank Nitti (the diabolical Billy Drago) off of a roof — that is to say, not bloody likely; Nitti shot himself dead long after the events of the film (though in a possible nod to the historical facts, De Palma has Ness shooting a hole in Nitti’s hat; according to Wikipedia’s account of Nitti’s suicide, “The first shot fired by Nitti’s unsteady hand missed and passed through his fedora”).

Now, historically inaccurate movies usually make me go ballistic; however, The Untouchables is not a history lesson — if anything, it’s a tall tale with a folk hero (and they don’t get any folksier than Costner) and an archetypal villain (and that’s as close to an answer as we’re going to get to the bat scene question; Capone does what he does For the Evulz).

More importantly, the facts may have been tampered with, but the film’s moral compass always points towards true north, and it knows that dura lex sed lex."

Shadow Of A Doubt was believed to have been Hitchcock's own favourite movie, the one that he was most proud of as he felt his critics hadn't got any justifiable ammunition to shoot him down with. The film stands out because it doesn't have the tongue in cheek dark humour traits that light up most of the maestro's classics. The cheeky bonus is that of having the central premise of the main protagonist being a hero of the people. His family all adore him, where he is on the surface a man that all men want to be, and it's here that Hitchcock moulds a chilling filmic arc, in fact, it's a masterstroke of filmic manipulation.

The plot involves Uncle Charlie returning to his adoring family in Santa Rosa after avoiding his apprehension for the murder of a widow. His niece Charlie treats Uncle as a hero, she worships the ground he walks on, but as the detectives close in, niece Charlie starts to piece together things and suspects herself that Uncle may just in fact be The Merry Widow Murderer. We are then pitched into the cat & mouse story and become privy to Uncle Charlie's switch from debonair handsome hero, into that of the devil incarnate. The reoccurring theme of The Merry Widow Waltz adds to the uneasy feel, while the relationship between Uncle & Niece is one that I'm sure Hitchcock was revelling in. Make no bones about it, it's in itself bordering on being unhealthy, and it's something that helps make this a more edgier thriller than other genre pieces of the era.

Joseph Cotten is special as Uncle Charlie, his duality acting hits the spot on both fronts, whilst Teresa Wright is beguiling as the niece because she really makes the character infectious. Thus it's with these two great performances that the pics final reel brings socko results. Screenplay is written by the wonderfully talented Thornton Wilder, and with the master directing with swagger in tow, this rounds out as a triumphant classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of such terminologies. 10/10"

This is one that I actually feel deserves a higher rating on internet sites, is it fair to say that this film can be called the black & white North By Northwest? since thematically it's the same so it is something of a forerunner to that great film. Simplistic plot of innocent man on the run trying to find the real culprit after he is blamed for a fire that killed his best friend. Whilst on the run he meets an array of interesting Hitchcockian characters, from spies to circus freaks and of course the delicious lady of the piece, in this case Pricilla Lane. Enough suspense to mark it out as a film from the maestro, witness a scene as the main protagonist Barry Kane is trying to split his handcuffs on the roadside, and the ending at the statue of liberty is a cracker, making this a very tidy suspenser that earns 8/10 from me.

Tidbid; Hitchcock had wanted Gary Cooper & Barbara Stanwyck for the lead roles here and although that sounds mightily great, he didn't have to worry because Lane & Robert Cummings did just fine. || A rather run-of-the-mill espionage thriller, this one, with Robert Cummings wrongly accused of complicity in a fire that destroys a large part of an aircraft construction factory. He manages to avoid the police long enough to travel the breadth of the United States on the trail of a group of wealthy, powerful, fifth columnists. Priscilla Lane is the initially sceptical sidekick as they try to ensnare Otto Kruger and his network of traitors. Unfortunately, there is just too much inevitability about the story; very little suspense and the performances are really quite dry - especially the rather daft circus act storyline. It is fine to watch, but nothing notable to remember, I'm afraid."

Hitchcock's storytelling - at times the camerawork makes us feel like a peeping Tom - and Franz Waxman's tension-laden score add loads to this strongly character driven effort. Bruce shines as the jovial gent to whom ""Lina"" takes rather a liking, Fontaine herself treads the cinematographic line between reason and paranoia with some considerable skill - but it is Grant who really stands out. His character is likeable, plausible and if you've ever read Anthony Berkeley's rather wordy book ""Before the Fact"" then you'll recognise that his portrayal is really pretty spot on - can we believe him, do we (want to) believe him - and at the end, well....

While Cube presents an intriguing premise of individuals trapped in a deadly maze, the execution leaves much to be desired. The film attempts to blend horror with existential themes, however it's lackluster the result is more confusing than thought-provoking. The lack of clarity regarding the Cube's purpose and the characters' motivations creates a narrative void that fails to engage the audience meaningfully. Instead of offering insightful commentary, it often feels like a series of contrived scenarios designed solely for shock value and being gory.

The performances are generally subpar, with characters portrayed in exaggerated manners that detract from their believability. For instance, Quentin's descent into madness is depicted through over-the-top acting rather than nuanced character development. This makes it difficult for viewers to empathize with any of the characters, as they come across as unlikable or poorly developed archetypes rather than fully realized individuals which results in unstickable mediocre act.

The film's reliance on mathematical concepts as a means of escape is both its unique selling point and its downfall. While the idea of using advanced mathematics to navigate the Cube is intriguing, it ultimately feels forced and unrealistic. The plot hinges on the assumption that a specific character possesses unique skills necessary for survival, which raises questions about fairness and logic within the narrative. This reliance on improbable scenarios leads to significant plot holes that undermine the overall tension and coherence of the story and popping more questions than giving answers to the ones that are already there.

Perhaps most frustrating is the film's ending, which resolves the intricate buildup with a lackluster conclusion that feels like a betrayal of its earlier promise. After building tension through complex character dynamics and deadly traps, the resolution appears rushed and unsatisfying. The film ends without providing any real answers or closure, leaving viewers feeling cheated after investing their time in a convoluted journey of nothingness.

In summary, Cube offers a fascinating concept but falters in execution, character development, and narrative coherence. Its potential as a thought-provoking horror film is squandered by poor acting and an unsatisfactory conclusion, making it difficult to recommend despite its cult status (Other ones are spectacular disasters in their own right, so it's best to just steer clear of them altogether). || Cube is a fascinating, low-budget sci-fi thriller that makes the most of its minimalist setup. The concept is simple but incredibly effective, a group of strangers trapped in a deadly maze of cube-shaped rooms. The movie thrives on its tension and psychological undertones, diving into how humans react under extreme pressure. It’s a smart, inventive film that doesn’t spoon-feed answers, leaving you to wrestle with its deeper themes about survival, human nature, and systems of control. While the traps and puzzles are memorable, the true focus is on the characters and how they clash as their desperation grows.

That said, the film isn’t without its flaws. The constant use of tight close-ups and high focal lengths creates an almost unbearable sense of claustrophobia, but not always in a good way. At times, the cinematography feels disorienting and can pull you out of the moment. Combined with some uneven performances and occasionally stiff dialogue, these elements might not work for everyone. Still, Cube is a must-watch if you enjoy tense, thought-provoking thrillers that make you question everything by the time the credits roll. It’s the kind of movie that sticks with you, even if it leaves you a little shaken."

Not having her problems to seek, things only get worse for ""Angela"" when the FBI hove into view, hoping to coax/cajole/coerce her into helping them fit up her new suitor. They've had the rookie ""Mike"" (Matthew Modine) and has partner ""Ed"" (Oliver Platt) tailing the late ""Frank"" for ages, but to no avail. Maybe she can help? What now ensues is a comedic send up of all things ""Godfather"", only largely told from the perspective of the women involved. Pfeiffer delivers engagingly and the sparingly used Ruehl gives us a clue as to whom ""Tony"" is really afraid of! Stockwell does the parody role really well here, his dapper, suave murderer routine isn't remotely menacing, but it's good at sending up much of the genre as he proves to be anything but a ""tiger"". Jonathan Demme piles loads of action and smarted-mouthed wit into this, the humour is a little more subtle and the film flies by. Sure, it's a wee bit dated now with big hair and shoulder pads, but it's still a decent watch. || ""Married to the Mob"" is a very entertaining film and the mob element does have shades of ""Midnight Run"" (1988), especially when Angela - she believes she has finally found the normality she has been so desperately seeking with a man called Mike Smith - discovers he is actually an FBI agent and she then becomes reluctantly entangled in an FBI sting operation to arrest crime boss Tony ""The Tiger"" Russo. The depiction of the mob throughout this film is a ruthless and uncompromising one and it is common knowledge that there is nothing glamorous in the life these well dressed criminals have chosen to lead. It is admittedly a seductive life of extravagant rewards and it can provide an over abundance of indulgent luxuries, but this fool's paradise is fleeting and dangerously illusory."

I can't make out why this movie has has a _user score of JUST above 70%_...I guess because people don't find an honest romantic movie equaling an intriguing, exciting, intelligent, thrilling, action packed or any other brain tickling director's master piece..

But to be honest, this movie is climbing the charts on being my favorite movies, and not just the romantics, of all time.Speaking of which i don't even watch too many romantic movies because however beautiful they are they almost always make you feel that the fairy land exists.That's what is so beautiful about SAY ANYTHING that it doesn't make you believe that there is a fairy land instead its so honest and assures you that you really don't need a lot of things to live happily if you've got a person for whom you have love in your heart and the feeling is reciprocated in the exact same manner!! This movie is special in the sense that it was made way back in '89 and still holds the same relevance...because **LOVE is TIMELESS**...

Do not miss it if you wanna feel what love is in the truest sense of the word... _""I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen""_ - it kills me but if you hold on, you'd find out that she gave the pen because she couldn't give him his love filled heart back !!

A great and successful effort on the director's part to not try and make something special out of this movie because in the end that's what really makes it so special..A _10/10_ for sure...one of the best movies about LOVE !! || _**The summer after high school in Seattle in the late 80s**_

Ione Skye plays Diane, a misfit ""preppy"" girl who suddenly comes alive upon graduation after striking up a relationship with Lloyd Dobler, played by John Cusack. Diane has a scholarship to a prestigious college in England and her Dad, played by John Mahoney, doesn't want some aimless kickboxer getting in the way of her success. Joan Cusack fittingly plays Lloyd’s sister while the alluring Bebe Neuwirth shows up for a cameo as his teacher.

""Say Anything"" (1989) is a coming-of-age drama/romance praised by critics and has loads of fans. 

I agree to some degree: The situations and relationships smack of real life and you can tell that writer/director Cameron Crowe and the cast put time & effort into creating this ""reality."" For instance, two of Lloyd's best friends are girls, Corey and D.C., who try to advise him on his new relationship. Another example is Diane’s honest relationship with her dad. The first half is filled with quality scenes, like Corey playing her guitar at a party, still venting emotions regarding a past flame. Plus unlike, say, ""Porky's"" and ""American Pie"" there's thankfully no juvenile raunch. In other words, ""Say Anything"" is a classy teen-college flick.

Yet I’m not a big fan of Cusack and Crowe apparently doesn’t know how to lens beautiful women, like Skye (and I’m not talking ‘bout nudity or sleaze). Meanwhile the second half isn't as entertaining as the first because it leaves the high school graduation antics behind to focus on Diane and Lloyd's increasingly intimate relationship, as well as unexpected revelations about Diane's father. Those who like stories about romantic relationships will no doubt appreciate the second half more than me.

It’s decent and I respect it, but Crowe did far superior work with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982) and “Jerry Maguire” (1996).

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Seattle; Kitsilano Beach, Vancouver (the graduation scene); Los Angeles and North Hollywood (the boom box scene).

My Blue Heaven is fine; there isn't anything terrible, nothing drew me out of the film (except Steve Martin's casting and the choice to use title cards to occasionally change perspective), and I never was confused or disappointed with the story beats, but I was never impressed or fully invested. I picked this movie at random and didn't know what I was watching until the title appeared.

""People are always talking ya about truth. Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or somethin', and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn, as you get older, is there ain't no truth. All there is is bullsh**, pardon my vulgarity here. Layers of it. One layer of bullsh** on top of another. And what you do in life like when you get older is, you pick the layer of bullsh** that you prefer and that's your bullsh**, so to speak.""

It was one of his most favorite quotes and he'd paraphrase it all the time. Honestly I can say why, it's funny and true and that really works. it also really explains the movie.

It's about redemption, people that you'd never would expect anything good out of are honestly capable doing some amazingly heroic things. People that you would expect to be honest are capable of the worst lies.

The comedy is about perceptions and expectations and reality and it manages to have a profoundly honest message hidden in the layers of bullsh** that it builds up around it.

And, most importantly, it entertains while it's doing it."

A doctor/scientist in post-nuclear America (Robert Glaudini) heads to a remote desert town north of Los Angeles to find a way to eliminate a new strain of parasitoid. He runs into a gang of desperate delinquents (led by Luca Bercovici) and teams-up with a young woman (Demi Moore). But a government-linked “merchant” is on his trail (James Davidson). 

“Parasite” (1982) is a ‘B’ flick by Charles Band that only cost $800,000, which would be $3 million today (factoring inflation). It takes the chestburster scene from “Alien” and mixes it with the milieu of the TV flick “Where Have All the People Gone,” as well as “Mad Max,” along with the gang thugs of “The Warriors” and bits of “Gargoyles.” While it lacks the bigger budget artistry of “Alien” and “Mad Max,” it’s more thrilling than the mundane “Where Have All the People Gone,” albeit more comic booky. Still, I’d watch it any day over Roddenberry’s lousy “Genesis II.”

This was Demi’s second movie, which she called the worst film she’s ever done in a 2019 interview. It was likewise Cherie Currie’s second movie, after “Foxes,” although she didn’t go on to cinematic success like Moore. (For those not in the know, Cherie was the lead singer of The Runaways from 1975-77). I shouldn’t fail to mention Natalie May, who’s notable as the petite early-teens girl, Shell. She appeared in three movies at the time before dropping out of acting, except for giving it another stab a decade later in three episodes of a UK TV series.

“The Hidden” came out five years later and was obviously influenced by this. It’s obviously the better film but, then, its budget was five times greater.

The flick runs 1 hour, 25 minutes, and was shot in the dry hills northeast of Los Angeles at Piru and Agua Dulce (Vasquez Rocks) with a 40-minutes drive between the two.

Two well-to-do Americans from the big city are having marital problems. So they take their 18 years-old daughters to Rio de Janeiro to refresh. The liberal one (Joseph Bologna) doesn’t waste time in finding a dubious mate for his carnal pleasures while the conservative one (Michael Caine) makes the mistake of being with the daughter of the other on the beach wherein she confesses her crush (Michelle Johnson). Nothing good can come from this. 

“Blame It on Rio” (1984) is effectively quirky amusement with can’t-beat-’em locations. The best comparison would be “10” from five years earlier, but this isn’t as good all things considered. There’s a great message on forgiveness at the end, but there’s a little too much sleaze for my tastes. For instance, Michelle Johnson was five months shy of being 18 during shooting, yet she’s shown totally nude at one point. Why? The movie suggests that the hedonistic spirit of Rio sets loose one’s carnal passions. 

Also on the feminine front are Demi Moore as the other daughter (she was 20 during shooting); and Valerie Harper as the wife of Caine’s character. Valerie still looked great at 44 during filming.

The movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Rio de Janeiro.

""One Crazy Summer"" (1986) is a quirky youth misadventure with just enough good to give it a marginal thumbs up. It's zany and creative, highlighted by Demi in one of her early roles. She was 22 during filming and looks great, but she curiously wears big, loose clothing throughout, which conceals her physical beauty. But there are a few notable females in peripheral roles, such as Kimberly Foster as cookie. There's also a Godzilla parody that's great fun.

It's actually not a bad fantasy concept, but it's pretty poorly cast with Moore well off form; the wooden as a spoon Prochnow spends much of it standing around looking like an extra from an horror movie and Biehn, well he only ever really was good for eye-candy - so... The narrative takes far too long to get interesting and the conclusion is all rather rushed and underwhelming.

RELEASED IN 1992 and directed by Rob Reiner, ""A Few Good Men” is a military drama about a smart-axx young Navy Lawyer (Tom Cruise) who’s never seen a courtroom because he lazily arranges plea bargains. Perhaps this is why he’s assigned to defending two young Marines stationed at Guantanamo Bay who are accused of murdering a fellow Marine. They maintain that they were ordered to enact a “Code Red,” which took an unforeseen turn. Demi Moore and Kevin Pollak co-star as the lawyer’s partners while Kevin Bacon heads the prosecution and Jack Nicholson plays the arrogant commanding officer of Guantanamo. J.T. Walsh is on hand as the Colonel’s weak subordinate.

The movie does a good job of depicting the honor code of hardcore Marines, particularly in the sequence where Lance Cpl. Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) refuses to confess to something he didn’t do in order to get a minor sentence. The characters are well written and casted, e.g. Kaffee (Cruise) and his penchant for baseball. The story is dialog-driven and maintains your attention without action/thrills.

Nicholson is commanding and intimidating as the pompous colonel. Kaffee discovers his talent as a courtroom lawyer and realizes that the only way to take him down is to use his egotism against him. Other than the cringe-inducing “A Ten Hut” scene at the end, this is a gripping drama.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 18 minutes and was shot entirely in Southern Cal (Point Mugu, Crystal Cove, etc.) and Washington DC. WRITERS: Aaron Sorkin (play) and Aaron Sorkin (screenplay).

GRADE: B+ || I think this my favourite outing for Tom Cruise. He is the cocky young navy lawyer ""Kaffee"", who usually plea-bargains and as yet has never seen the inside of a courtroom. Surprisingly, he is drafted in to investigate the death of a young soldier at Guantanamo Bay. Two marines have been arrested for his murder, but they claim that they were ordered to administer a ""Code Red"" - a fairly brutal form of discipline used on their fellow soldiers deemed to have broken their code of honour. Teamed up with his pal ""Sam"" (Kevin Pollak) and with the more by-the-book ""Galloway"" (Demi Moore) the three face a subtle, but definite, hostility from the commanding officer ""Jessep"" (Jack Nicholson) and his enforcer ""Kendrick"" (Kiefer Sutherland). Soon their search uncovers evidence that not only was this attack authorised but that the instructions might have come from the top. Cruise is at his most natural here; his character comes across as arrogant and selfish, but also quite likeable and engaging - and he plays ball with Moore and a slightly over-played Nicholson really well too. The courtroom drama elements are kept tight and intense - thanks to a stronger than usual effort from Kevin Bacon (""Ross"") and though I thought the ending rather flew in the face of the whole point of the narrative, it is still a well structured and delivered evaluation of trust and of the nature of human behaviour when faced with abusive authority figures. Rob Reiner resists any temptation to introduce any sloppy romance into film, and though there are the odd distracting sub-plots here and there, for the most part this stays on track as a strong and enjoyable thriller. || Another good all stars ensemble movie were everything is perfect, the actors and the script.

Even though Ronin had shootouts, great chase sequences, and classic actors, I was bored and on my phone throughout the whole thing. Nothing was particularly bad about this film. There were actually great parts! But somehow, the sum of all its parts just equaled a movie that left me wanting. Releasing four years after Leon: The Professional, this could have been much better. || It would not be fair to describe a ""Ronin"" as a rogue; more a mercenary without loyalty to any one particular person or cause. So, Natasha McElhone ""Deirdre"" hires a few of these to relieve a man of a suitcase that is bound for the Russians. What follows is as internecine a thriller as you will ever see. It's full of scheming and double-scheming with ""Sam"" (Robert De Niro) and ""Vincent"" (Jean Reno) never quite sure who is or is not on their team as the suitcase changes hands more times that the wonderfully elegant Katarina Witt changes her skates. Stellan Skarsgård; Sean Bean; Jonathan Pryce and Michael Lonsdale all help to keep them, and us, guessing pretty much right to the end. It does suffer a little from a preponderance of shoot outs that couldn't hit a barn door with a shovel; and the car chases do begin to get wearisome after a while, but over all John Frankenheimer manages to keep the quality of the action to a high enough standard to compensate. The dialogue is a bit basic, as are the characterisations - this has no depth nor underlying political agenda/statements - not the I could discern, anyway - it is just a good old fashioned thriller with a first rate cast who are unchallenged by their tasks - and therefore are perfectly plausible. || <em>'Ronin'</em> was somehow an unknown to me as of weeks ago. I say that because... what a cast! How have I at least not heard of this in passing in all my years on this Earth? That plus the type of plot makes this right up my alley, on paper I'd love it and, pleasantly, in reality I do too.

The film is particularly excellent visually, the cinematography is quality and the stunts are outstanding; even little things, like the initial old movie-esque end credit font is nice to look at. The score is also a plus point, which is evidently one of many bits that this has going for it.

Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgård, Sean Bean, Jonathan Pryce, Michael Lonsdale... as already noted, this 1998 release features a stellar cast list. De Niro is the main ace of the pack here, though Reno and McElhone are especially worthy of note.

I will say that the ending is less entertaining than anticipated, which is a surprise. It's not a disappointing conclusion whatsoever, I still liked it, but it did feel like a weird sorta drop-off from what proceeds in terms of pacing and all that. Again, not really much of an issue to be honest."

This is far better than its reputation would have it. Among the better features here is the fact that back when this movie came out the gimmick of using the deaths based on urban legends allowed for some pretty inventive and original kills. The opening backseat driver decapitation is a great one to open a film on, the dead boyfriend suspended over a fleeing car in the woods offers some rather nice suspense with the killer appearing and continually trying to break into the car and the sex/strangulation misidentification is really cool mainly because the circumstances needed to make it true, from the back-story needed to make sure she shouldn't see anything, the killer gaining access to the room without violent means, and the actual sounds of the incident, are all mixed together and makes a marvelous scene. These here really work nicely due to the way they incorporate the whole mythology of the premise into their stalking and work incredibly well at bringing these together. Other great scenes, where she watches someone in the killers known attire stalk one of her friends in a swimming pool while she is helplessly trying to get her attention or the tense stalking of the DJ in the radio station during the thunderstorm make for some additional tense, thrilling scenes, and the way it works out due to knowing what the killer is dressed like is effective enough. That also leads into the twist about the identity of the killer and how their secret is kept, as the way there are so many different red herrings involved and all of them given good alibis to clear them, so by gaining more clues to their identity, it broadens the suspense by making an extra clue for the people to solve. These here really work nicely for the film as there isn’t a whole lot really to dislike here. The main problem with this film is that it was aimed for the masses to consume, so it has a lot of toned-down gore. Many of these killings should've been gorier, and it will probably disappoint many out there looking for a good gory slasher film. It also falls into the realm of those films where they're trying to poke fun of the genre at the same time as trying to scare, and here is one example that having a ton of cheap scares aren't that frightening. What makes it worse is that many of the jokes aren't funny, so it is a bit flat in some places. The pacing is a little off in the first half with all the build-ups to the class and what they all mean, but there’s not a whole lot else wrong here.

Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, some alcohol use, a scene with a dog drinking and a brief mild sex scene. || Urban Legend is a movie I watched during a long weekend marathon of older slasher movies that seem to have been forgotten, or at least aren't as heralded as the more well-known movies of the genre (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, etc.). Among these lesser known movies, I would have to say that Urban Legend deserves to stand above, as it is more entertaining, more enjoyable, and more slick than you would expect.

The concept here is more important than the story. Whereas Scream created a slasher movie where the characters and the killers were horror movie obsessives, Urban Legend does the same for...well, urban legends. The concept is inherently clever, as urban legends are stories and bedtime tales that are meant to induce a sense of fear and paranoia about whether they're true. As our final girl learns the hard way, convincing people to believe in these stories is a difficult task.

The main attraction here apart from the premise is the cast. Ignoring their late-90s star power, the cast is still packed with beautiful people knowingly playing up the qualities that the audiences will enjoy the most. Fans of Jared Leto will enjoy guessing whether his mysterious character is the killer or just a red-herring. Alicia Witt and Rebecca Gayheart prove to be believable and relatable best buddies who each keep a dark secret from each other. Meanwhile, Joshua Jackson shows up long enough to deliver the movie's best laughs and a fresh-faced Tara Reid gives the teenage boys bouncing cleavage while she runs. Lastly, Loretta Devine gives us an authority figure who is absolutely worth rooting for.

The movie is not shy about its self-awareness. It knows it's silly, it knows it's preposterous. It knows that you know this as well, and it takes that knowledge and runs, well aware that you can keep up. And the kills are fun, exciting, and clever, which is what everyone wants most of all from a slasher movie, right? || One of many lame slashers that sprouted in the late 90s thanks to the mega success of 'Scream'. Good cast utterly wasted with stilted dialogue and a nonsensical story, a half-assed motive and tame kills that weren't all that memorable."

It’s upon this journey that we realise, through some narration, that nobody here has ever been especially honest with the other and that any solution that may emerge here will be, at best, an hybrid of what they wanted/expected or even dreamt. Though both Winger and Malkovich take the lead here, and deliver competently, I found it was actually the supporting cast that worked better at illustrating the toxicity of this scenario. Spall, especially, but also the native tribespeople who take part and who viscerally illustrate the contrast between our two amidst marital turbulence and societies that subsist amidst the arid, fly-infested yet beautiful villages of the northern Sahara. It’s that photography, reminiscent of the Jack Cardiff, that conveys a marvellous combination of the passive, the manic and the serene as the people gradually diminish into a timeless vista that for me, anyway, symbolised the superfluous nature of mankind and the irrelevance of our, largely self-inflicted, problems. As to the conclusion of the story, well I have to say that I didn’t really care one way or the other about these spoiled and rather selfish characters whose melodrama and peccadilloes didn’t really matter in a grander scheme of things. It’s that uninteresting story that dragged this down for me, that and the fact that Bertolucci seemed intent on peppering the film with sex scenes as if to compensate for a broader lack of something more substantial to demonstration any kind of emotional connection between just about any of these characters.

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.

The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.

Be it an horrific scene or a ""what is in the shadow"" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.

The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and see what happens indeed. 10/10 || It was a good and original movie but some parts were still too boring, am i the only one who thinks like this? || Stuck on a remote station in Antarctica with… The Thing

RELEASED IN 1982 and directed by John Carter, “The Thing” stars Kurt Russell as the helicopter pilot of an eleven-man crew at a research station in Antarctica who encounter a ghastly shape-shifting alien that perfectly replicates the appearance of its victims.

This is basically a sequel to the 1956 film and even includes footage from that classic sci-fi/horror. The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting.

There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can. The nature of the gruesome entity, how it functions and how it can or cannot be killed leaves you with a lot of questions. The ending is haunting.

“The Thing” may not be as great as gushing devotees insist, but it’s solid sci-fi/horror with some pretty horrific scenes, although only one really creeped me out (the blood scene) while another made me bust out laughing (the torso jaws).

Trouble escalates to the big city of Los Angeles when one of the giant queen ants escapes to L.A. and starts laying eggs that could lead to the end of mankind as we know it.

This is a cautionary tale about scientific tampering fused with a Cold War theme of destroying a threat to the country. Boasting some wonderful scenes such as the first desert encounter (cloaked in a sandstorm) and the final underground battle, Them! is a truly enjoyable viewing experience. It oozes the right amount of paranoia that became ever more prominent as the nuclear age began grow. The puppetry and special effects on show is of a very high standard for the time (well done Academy Award Nominee Ralph Ayres), and the direction from Gordon Douglas is one of the better efforts in the genre.

The tight story vanquishes any gripes about the plausibility factor, while the acting is, perhaps given the type of genre piece it is, of a surprisingly good standard. With James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn, and Joan Weldon giving it a bit of oopmh. It went on to become Warner Brothers highest grossing film in 1954, and it's really not hard to see why.

This is one of those films that I decided to watch without having a clear idea of ​​what I was going to find. I know that there are many people who like to know, read and even watch the trailers to decide what to watch, and I also do this moderately, but one of the sensations I like most in the cinematic experience is surprise, that feeling of pleasure, difficult to describe, that happens when a film pleases us and surprises us. Of course, the opposite could happen, the surprise could be bad, and the film could be magnificent rubbish. It happens! But I think you understand me...

Robert Altmann is not a director I know much about. As far as I remember, I've only seen one film of his, “Shortcuts”, and I wasn't particularly impressed. However, I think any director has their ups and downs, and you can't categorize anyone for just one film or two. In this film, Altmann surprises in a positive way, with very careful direction and an attention to detail that I was very pleased with. The cinematography is good, the editing is very well done, and the rhythm is quite pleasant, with no dead moments. The opening scene is a true cinematic masterclass, with almost ten minutes without cuts and lots of camera movement. And throughout the film, the feeling that prevails is that we are led to peek, in secret, into a story that no one wants to be known.

The script fits perfectly into this feeling of secrecy, taking us behind the scenes of the film industry through the hands of an arrogant and obnoxious producer who finds himself the target of anonymous death threats. He decides to question the person he suspects of, a screenwriter he ignored for many months, and ends up killing him. From then on, viewers are invited to follow him in his attempts to hide everything, along with the studio he works for, which has little interest in scandals. This is, obviously, a punch in the stomach of the Hollywood industry, where there is no shortage of unscrupulous, arrogant, pedantic, obnoxious people, willing to do anything for ambition, and where the moral conduct of the studios has not always been the most immaculate, preferring to ignore and /or hush up compromising situations whenever possible.

With these characteristics, the film had everything to cause hives in many people within the industry. However, it did surprisingly well, garnered a lot of praise, a good box office and was nominated for three Oscars, continuing to be, even today, a film that is regularly shown on TV channels specializing in films. If the technical quality and the intelligent and scathing story are fundamental, the cast also contributed with the union of talents of several renowned actors. Tim Robbins leaves us with one of his most notable works as an actor, with a consistent and impactful acting, and is elegantly accompanied by Greta Scacchi who, in addition to resisting the idiotic idea of ​​appearing naked for no reason, knew how to interpret her character in a deep and controversial. In addition to them, the film also features good performances by Pater Gallagher and Whoopi Goldberg in minor characters, and with a veritable rain of cameos and brief appearances by actors, screenwriters and others, playing themselves, with many of them agreeing to donate the salary for that single day of filming for a social project at the time. The procession of notables is almost endless, making this film perhaps the American film with the most cameos and guest stars in the history of commercial cinema. || It’s the job of “Griffin” (Tim Robbins) to secure good storylines for his Hollywood studio and he’s good at filtering out the wheat from the chaff. The thing is, though, he’s getting on a bit and there are rumours abounding that he is on his way out. When “Levy” (Peter Gallagher) arrives from an erstwhile competitor, the writing looks more like it’s on the wall than on the page. He’s also been having some difficulties with a mysterious stalker whom he’s spurned, professionally, at some stage and who is now bombarding him with threatening postcards. Finally, there’s his more off than on relationship of convenience with “Bonnie” (Cynthia Stevenson) to which he is surprisingly indifferent. Under pressure and under siege, his tormentor starts to get under his skin so he determines to get to the bottom of that whilst cleverly manoeuvring his new rival into a cul-de-sac that can only end one way! What now ensues sees a plethora of genuine stars pepper a film that allows Robbins to show us a character that’s shrewd, ruthless and charmingly shallow whilst at the same time not averse to taking drastic measures. It’s those that attract the attentions of tenacious detective “Avery” (Whooping Goldberg) who has a dead body, nobody to pin it on and is curious about the burgeoning relationship between the girlfriend of the deceased (Greta Scacchi) and this outwardly brash and smarmy film executive. This has all the ingredients of a comedy thriller with loads of glamour, a good deal of pithy dialogue and it sends up the Hollywood mentality satirically and plausibly. Robbins is in his element and exudes a sort of selfish obnoxiousness that’s actually quite likeable as he treads on the eggshells of a fickle and unforgiving business. It packs a lot of story into two hours, raises a smile and an heckle in equal measure and is probably Robbins’s best performance to date."

It's funny the way we picture things in our minds.

It's much sillier than expected, but in a positive way.

I do kinda end up wishing they went down a more dark/creative route, instead of relying on the novelty of having scissors as hands; though, to be fair, they do touch on the deeper side a bit. With that said, I did get a good amount of entertainment seeing this plot unfold. It's weird and wonderful.

Johnny Depp is a great actor and is very good here, mainly via his facial expressions and body language. It's cool to see Winona Ryder involved, someone I've thoroughly enjoyed in more recent times in <em>'Stranger Things'</em>. Alan Arkin and Anthony Michael Hall also appear.

The film looks neat, as I've come to expect from Tim Burton. It has the obvious touch of Bo Welch to it, with the neighbourhood looking not too dissimilar to what Welch would create for 2003's <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em> - which I, truly, enjoyed.

Undoubtedly worth a watch. || Love this movie. It's like a non evil Freddy Kruger. The ending could have been better though."

For the most part whilst watching, I felt quite nonplussed by everything about <em>'A Night at the Roxbury'</em> - it was neither pleasing or annoying me. By its conclusion, however, I actually felt like I enjoyed it. I feel like I should've disliked it, but the opposite is more true to be honest.

Some of the humour lands, some of it doesn't - those dancing head nods, for example, are amusing, but the film seriously overuses it. I assume that's a carryover from the <em>'Saturday Night Live'</em> sketch that this is based upon. Haddaway's 'What Is Love' is also overplayed throughout, though with that I actually felt the use was fitting - the music overall is good, to be fair.

Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan make for a positive pairing, with Ferrell narrowly being the standout of the two - as you'd expect, I guess. Molly Shannon does well, as do Dan Hedaya and Richard Grieco. There are also a few interesting minor cast members, from Michael Clarke Duncan to Eva Mendes to Jennifer Coolidge.

""My Cousin Vinny"" was a hit when it was released in 1992. Two youths from New York are wrongly accused of murder while traveling through Alabama and one of them (Ralph Macchio) calls on his inexperienced lawyer cousin, Vinny (Joe Pesci), to defend them. Vinny roles into town with his hot fiancé (Marisa Tomei) intent on winning his first big case.

I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but never got around to seeing it till the other night and was pleasantly surprised. It's part fish-out-of-water comedy and part courtroom drama. The hulking Fred Gwynne plays the staunch judge, an amusing performance. It was Gwynne's last film.

The movie is filled with laughs throughout, but it's more than just a goofball comedy. At some point early in the second act I strangely found myself liking Vinny and wanting him to succeed. I also found myself warming up to Vinny & his fiancé as a couple. They're an odd couple, but somehow click. I guess this is where Marisa got the reputation for liking short, stocky men.

Speaking of Marisa, she's just stunning here, although I prefer her more as she gets older, e.g. 2008's ""The Wrestler.”

The film was shot in Georgia and runs 120 minutes.

GRADE: B+ || This never stops being funny no matter how many times you watch it.

I think Marisa Tomei won or was nominated for an Oscar for this... and it was well deserved. In a lot of her movies she played the role of ""a pretty face"" but she not only stood her ground against Joe Pesci but she actually out shined him in a few scenes.

That is a hard thing to do, usually when Pesci is cast he's the best part of the film... and he was priceless in this... and Marisa Tomei out did him.

So what you have is a movie that is endlessly quotable, completely hysterical, and has two of the best performances you'll see in any movie, drama or comedy... with a script that backs it up.

Movies don't get better than this."

A mysterious saintly man named G (Eddie Murphy) befriends the director of a failing shopping network (Jeff Goldblum) & his colleague (Kelly Preston) in Miami. He becomes a curious sensation on the network.

“Holy Man” (1998) combines elements of “Michael” (1996) and “City of Angels” (1998) to forge its own hybrid and is the obvious precursor to “Bruce Almighty” (2003). It failed at the box office mainly because people thought it was going to be a typical Eddie Murphy vehicle, but it’s not. Sure, there’s some comedy, but it’s decidedly low-key with maybe 2-3 laugh-out-loud parts. It’s more of an amusing drama crossed with spiritual docudrama and the unique tone turned people off.

While it’s the least of those three other films, it possesses its own appeal once you catch a grip. The movie seems overlong though and needed tightened up with a rewrite. Still, it has its points of interest. Murphy, for instance, is thoroughly convincing in the title role and his character is certainly intriguing (I think it’s obvious who he really is), not to mention the flick conveys several valuable insights.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in Miami, Florida.

A teacher (William Hurt) moves to coastal Maine to work at a school for the deaf on an island where he becomes interested in a striking, but disturbed janitor (Marlee Matlin), who was once a student there.

""Children of a Lesser God"" (1986) is part celestial and mundane; beautiful and profane. Thankfully there’s more beauty. The Northeast coastal locations are wonderful and Hurt makes for a worthy protagonist while expertly pulling off a difficult role. Marlee Matlin is an exquisite revelation without which the movie would’ve failed.

Everything builds to a stunning dramatic scene in the second half, which is expertly executed. Unfortunately, the couple hooks-up a little prematurely. More time should’ve been spent with the journey to consummation. Nonetheless, there are great moments here.

The film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes and was shot in New Brunswick, Canada (Rothesay, Saint John & Beaver Harbour).

GRADE: B || Acclaimed teacher ""James"" (William Hurt) arrives at a school for the deaf where his very ""hands on"" techniques rather shake the established order of superintendent ""Franklin"" (Philip Bosco). His pupils make good progress, though, as his methods start to encourage them to speak more and act with much more confidence amidst each other and amongst the talking community at large. Soon they playing a bit of second fiddle to the enigmatic ""Sarah"" (Marlee Matlin). She's now the school caretaker and has a reputation as a bit stand-offish and temperamental, but it turns out that she, too, is deaf and that she has also been in this establishment for over twenty years. Most people around the place just put up with her, but he determines to try to get to the bottom of her obvious frustrations and see if he can't help her deal with them. Initially a job of work for the man, this soon becomes something more visceral and intimate for both - and that tests the mettle of just about everyone. It's probably a testament to Matlee's strong and characterful performance here that I just didn't take to ""Sarah"" at all. I found the character - whatever her background, an angry and somewhat obnoxious creature who offered little for me to feel sympathetic towards. Not in a woe-is-me type of sympathy, just in a general sense of there ever being a likeable person under all the baggage. Their frequent rows and tantrums come across as increasingly contrived and by the end I thought the writing was on the wall for the pair as far as the plot was concerned and I didn't really care whether she spoke or didn't. I do think that shows her skill as an actress, and to an extent William Hurt's as a foil, but somehow this film resonated far more for what it meant politically and sensually at the time as a pice of profound innovation than it did dramatically on screen.."

After the mysterious failure of the Discovery One mission to Jupiter in 2001, Dr. Heywood Floyd (Roy Scheider) resigned his position as head of the National Council for Astronautics. Several years later, the Soviets send the spacecraft Leonov & crew to Jupiter along with three Americans, including Floyd, to help investigate Discovery and the malfunction of the vessel's sentient computer, HAL 9000. Keir Dullea returns as the missing astronaut David Bowman while Helen Mirren plays the captain of the Leonov. Bob Balaban and John Lithgow also appear as the other two American astronauts.

""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" (1984) is realistic science-fiction that’s less artsy and more dramatically compelling compared to its predecessor, “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968). That doesn’t make it better, of course, just different. “2001” raised questions while this one provides answers, which some people inevitably won’t like. The questions include: Why did HAL malfunction? What was the real reason for Discovery's original mission, unknown to Floyd? What happened to Bowman? What is the purpose of the colossal monolith orbiting Jupiter? 

Both films compliment and counterbalance each other. This one’s more of a straightforward space adventure in the near future. Unlike Star Wars, which is space fantasy, “2010” is space-oriented adult science-fiction. Star Trek is too, but “2010” is far more realistic, which I appreciate. In other words, don’t expect any Klingons or spacecraft dogfights. This is more along the lines of “Mission to Mars” (2000) and “The Martian” (2015).

The film runs 1 hours, 56 minutes.

GRADE: B || A much more standard affair compared to its predecessor.

Given that's the case, I honestly enjoyed this more than <em>'2001: A Space Odyssey'</em> - if only because it's more closer to what I'd personally want from a film than what that 1968 flick offers, which is moreso an attempted art piece. Of course, the original does things visibly and audibly far, far greater than this 1984 release - just plot-wise, this is better in my opinion.

That's not to say that <em>'2010'</em> is something I'd consider great, because I wouldn't. It is, though, solid sci-fi fare, one I had a decent time watching. I'm not a fan of recasts, but Roy Scheider does a good job in place of William Sylvester as Heywood Floyd. Bob Balaban does well, while it's neat to see John Lithgow and Helen Mirren involved.

I'm somewhat surprised (but agreeable) that this has, seemingly, been fairly well received. I was expecting it to be poorly thought of by the majority, as is usually the case for sequels of iconic movies that aren't cut from the same cloth; different director etc."
1955.0,The Elephant Man,"A Victorian surgeon rescues a heavily disfigured man being mistreated by his ""owner"" as a side-show freak.

In 1884 London, a doctor (Anthony Hopkins) meets Joseph Merrick, aka The Elephant Man (wrongly called John Merrick in the film) who was being exploited as a freak show attraction. Treves (Hopkins) tries to help Merrick (John Hurt) for the last six years of the latter’s life wherein he becomes cultured, but he inevitably remains an object of curiosity, to high society as well as low society. Anne Bancroft plays a winsome entertainer who is warm toward Merrick.     

Directed by David Lynch and shot in B&W, “The Elephant Man” (1980) is a melancholic biographical movie, and understandably so, but Merrick’s story is worth checking out despite the fact that it inspires pity. It calls into question the concept of beauty: Natural beauty is something one is born with and did nothing to acquire, but so is physical unattractiveness. Then there’s inner beauty. The charismatic actress (Bancroft) displays both. Of course there’s also inner ugliness, like the carnival huckster.  
 
A myth developed about Merrick’s disfigurement that his mother was raped by an elephant, probably started by sideshow hawkers. The opening conveys this in an artistic manner, but it’s not to be taken literally, which is why it’s surreal. Meanwhile the factory scenes with the pipes and corresponding dangers exhibit the reality for workers in Victorian times. 

The score by John Morris is noteworthy with one piece being ripped-off for the moving parts of “Platoon” (1986), e.g. Elias’ melodramatic death scene.   

The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot entirely in London and nearby Shepperton Studios, just west of the city.

GRADE: B || Saw this, recently up-converted to 4K at the London Film Festival and, apart from the clear improvements to the quality and detail of the image, I was reminded of just how good it is. Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft play their roles with engaging sincerity - very ably supported by Sir John Gielgud and Dame Wendy Hiller. Prosthetics aside, John Hurt captures both the despair and optimism of Merrick with empathetic style; and Freddie Jones is just downright evil as ""Bytes"". His son Toby was at the screening and I couldn't help but wonder when he watched this portrayal by his father whether the pride in the performance must have been tempered by a disgust in the character, itself!!

James Woods stars as a Vatican backed vampire slayer, something he does with considerable relish. But now he is up against an uber vampire in Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), a leader with powers unbound. Daniel Baldwin and Sheryl Lee are along for the gore laden ride.

Woods is cool, with a quip on the tongue and a deadly weapon to hand, his by-play with Tim Guinee's priest provides much of the film's humour.

Ten years after that shocking performance, journalist ""Arthur Stuart"" (Christian Bale) decides to investigate just what did happen. Todd Haynes has created quite an hedonistic display for us, here. The three lead performances - especially Meyers - really embrace the ethos of the period. The sex, drugs, rock and roll mentality where anything and everything goes is really well reflected. It's not the characters that let this down, though - it's the shambolic narrative and the initial theme just seems to become subsumed in Haynes' desire to show us something that might have been shocking then, but kind of isn't now.

Ben Willis stands out as a compelling and underrated character, bringing a sense of realism to the story without delving into the supernatural realm. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. deliver captivating performances, drawing viewers in with their charisma and acting prowess.

The sequel, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" takes the characters on a harrowing adventure to an island, adding another layer of suspense and terror to the franchise. While some may overlook this installment as a credible sequel, the addition of Brandy Norwood as Carla contributes to the film's appeal and intensity.

However, the franchise takes a misstep with ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,"" introducing supernatural elements that detract from the grounded nature of the original films. This departure from reality diminishes the impact of the storyline and characters, leading to a disappointing third installment that lacks the involvement of the main cast.

The television series based on the franchise offers a different but enjoyable take on the story, adding credibility and entertainment value to the overall franchise. While the series was cut short, fans are eager for a reboot that promises to bring fresh energy to the familiar tale. It is hoped that the original cast will return, providing a seamless continuation of the beloved saga akin to the success of the ""Scream"" franchise. || <em>'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'</em> is a pointless sequel. It doesn't do anything interesting, the change of location is also meaningless given how the plot plays out; in terms of weather and a convenient late arrival.

Jennifer Love Hewitt continues to lead finely, though isn't as entertaining as last time out. Freddie Prinze Jr. barely features, while newcomers Brandy (albeit the best of the rest) and Mekhi Phifer are forgettable. I didn't expect to see that cameo from a certain someone, mind.

The Grim Reaper (i.e. the Angel of Death) comes to take billionaire industrialist Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) but instead decides to take a holiday in the corporeal universe by possessing the body of a young man (Brad Pitt). Death's deal with Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death materializes as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His ""holiday"" is complicated when he falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).

""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) is a re-imagining of the 1934 film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (which I've never seen). It has the confidence to take its time at almost 3 hours, but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good ""fish out of water"" stories like Spock in Star Trek, “Starman” (1984), etc. 

Yes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter touches. I would compare it to ""The Green Mile"" (1999), another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.

Despite its fantastical premise, ""Meet Joe Black"" consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience — love, life, death and numerous others, e.g. betrayal, rivalry, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond. One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law (Jeffrey Tambor) offers a definition of love to Joe Black: To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay, presuming they’re penitent. This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.

""Meet Joe Black"" cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office. Fortunately it has gone on to garner an enthusiastic following and rightly so 'cause this is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking and genuinely moving. I consider myself a masculine man, but tears flowed through approximately 1/3 of the runtime. This is a sign of a potent and affecting picture.

It's a travesty that dreck like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" makes gazillions of dollars and garbage like ""American Beauty"" are hailed as masterpieces while true gems like ""Joe Black"" are often overlooked. The good thing is that time was on Joe Black's side. The word got out.

The film runs 2 hours, 58 minutes, and was shot in Warwick, Rhode Island (Aldrich Mansion); Manhattan; and Teaneck, New Jersey. 

GRADE: A/A- || Joe Black ( Brad Pitt ) as the Grim Reaper arrives on the doorstep of wealthy businessman Bill Parrish ( Anthony Hopkins ) after borrowing a body of a man killed that morning. After experiencing chest pains and hearing voices Bill Parish is due to die and Joe has come to escort him to the other side. Bill, playing for more time, engages with Joe and manages to persuade him to spend a little more time on earth. Joe’s interest in humanity and experiencing life is particularly heightened when he and Bill’s daughter Susan start to form a relationship.

 “Meet Joe Black” centres more on the relationship of Joe and Susan rather than Deaths design for Bill. As a Romeo and Juliet style story of forbidden love, “Meet Joe Black” tries hard to play on audience emotions. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins give solid performances but the lengthy run time makes it hard to sustain interest in both the story and any of the characters. The premise is quite good and the Stella cast try to make the most of the concept of the spiritual firepower of love. However it’s over complication and unnecessary sub plot ( bid to take over Bill’s company) just makes “ Meet Joe Black” unnecessarily long. || Billionaire ""Parrish"" (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is feeling a bit under the weather as his birthday approaches, and a potential corporate merger looms too. His daughter ""Sarah"" (Claire Forlani) is, meantime, rather keen on one of his hotshot employees ""Drew"" (Jake Weber) who is a driving force behind the impending and lucrative business deal. ""Parrish"" is clearly unwell, and after a scare that looks like an heart attack, he finds a new character in his life. The blonde and piercing-eyed Brad Pitt whose purpose here is pretty clear to us, but not yet to his new friend. Hastily named ""Joe Black"" the older man starts to act as a sort of guide for the younger, who clearly his little knowledge of how the world works. ""Black"" starts to feature much more prominently in the life of the mogul and that causes consternation as he begins to display a behaviour that really contrasts with that which made him successful in the first place. That causes quite a bit of chagrin for the ambitious ""Drew"" but not as much as the attentions ""Black"" is now paying to ""Claire"" - and that are slowly becoming reciprocated, too. ""Parrish"" has, by now, begun to realise who his dashing and charismatic companion is - and has concerns about the impact this might have on his daughter should she find out. Can the pair find a way to reconcile what must be done with what they want to be done? It's quite a solid and promising story and there's quite an effective dynamic between the under-stated Pitt and Sir Anthony. It's just far too long, though. It could easily lose an hour and the plot wouldn't suffer. It's almost like a three act play that takes far too long to get going, and is really only redeemed by a delightfully conspiratorial last half hour. It's a good looking film but is too dialogue-heavy and I found myself wading through too much of it to really enjoy it. Sorry."

Heffner, John P. Ryan",Andrei Konchalovsky,"attempt to escape, train accident, prison warden, prison escape, alaska, train, freezing","_**Masterpiece**_

How ""Runaway Train"" bombed at the box office in December, 1985, I'll never know because it's the perfect blend of blockbuster thrills and weighty subtext.

The story involves Manny (Jon Voight), a notorious prison hero, who escapes a maximum security prison in the frozen wastelands of Alaska. He is joined by a naive follower (Eric Roberts) and they stow away on a train consisting of four locomotives, but the train runs away. Meanwhile, the arrogant warden (John P. Ryan) is on the warpath for Manny.

""Runaway Train"" is such a powerful experience because it's much more than just a mindless action flick, as the title would suggest. The thrilling events are actually a stage for a fascinating study of the human condition. Manny is a hardened convict who's ""at war with the world and everyone in it."" When called an animal he replies, ""No, worse -- human!""

This is a man who wants one thing, freedom, but he knows that he's too far gone to make it in conventional society. He shares a parable with his dumb partner, made up on the spot, about having a menial job and submitting to the boss even though you might want to rip his throat out. This is the key to making it in society -- submitting to authority and resisting the rage within; and then getting your check on payday and enjoying the fruits thereof. Manny wishes he could do this, but knows he can't. So what hope is there for him in modern society? If he can't do that then why's he escaping prison? In other words, Manny knows there's no hope for him, even if his escape is successful. To him, freedom can only come one way. I don't believe this, but I understand why he believes it.

There's another potent scene where Manny has a knife and mercilessly comes against his own ""partner"". You see the rage on his face, like a cornered animal. After intense emotions are vented Manny suddenly realizes... and then he just bows over, utterly spent. A character, who should be afraid of him, somehow understands and compassionately reaches out in a semi-embrace.

Powerful scenes like these are combined with surreal images of the misshapen locomotives barreling down the tracks in the freezing wilderness accompanied by the ominous score by Trevor Jones. Some parts of the score scream mid-80s, but other parts are timeless.

Rebecca De Mornay has an atypical role as a railroad worker who stumbles on to the convicts. She intuitively sees through their macho posturing. Although she knows they're desperate & dangerous, she also sees that they're not wholly evil. Roberts is basically a kid at heart and Manny is just blinded by the incredible rage within. He's only irredeemable because of his stupid pride, built up over years of hardened confinement.

Voight is near unrecognizable as Manny and Roberts is just superb as his dumb sidekick. These two along with De Mornay are examples of acting at its finest.

John P. Ryan is very effective as the machismo warden Ranken, but his Captain Ahab-like role comes off too comic booky to be plausible. Yet Ranken shows that you can be an ""animal"" on the outside of prison just as much as on the inside. Both Manny and Ranken are corrupted by pride, but Manny at least knows it. And he's not too far gone to recognize those who are worthy of life and to respond accordingly.

A couple (Katharine Ross & Peter Masterson) moves from the Big Apple to Stepford, Connecticut, where many of the wives of the village are oblivious to the current women's lib movement; they seem wholly dedicated to their husbands, home & garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. The husband joins the mysterious all-male organization of the town which seems to be up to something fishy. Paula Prentiss is on hand as Joanna’s quirky new friend while Tina Louise plays another newbie resident.

“The Stepford Wives” (1975) is a drama/mystery that morphs into sci-fi/horror. It’s iconic for good reason. The story’s captivating and the movie’s all-around entertaining. The story's not campy at all, like the confused 2004 version. This is serious and creepy sci-fi/drama with a bit o’ satire. It powerfully succeeds while the similar-themed ""Westworld"" (1973) is only passable.

Unfortunately, the film takes too much time with the building mystery where some of the drama is just plain dull. Nevertheless, it’s a notable film of the 70s tarnished only by the misguided remake in the 2000s.

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in Connecticut (Norwalk, Westport, Darien, Weston, Fairfield & Redding), except for the opening Manhattan scenes.

It didn’t do much for me and I barely stuck with it. I was so unimpressed that I decided not to watch another gangster movie featuring Hoskins and good ratings. || Bob Hoskins is entirely convincing as the increasingly conflicted and crotchety petty criminal “George” who has just been released after a seven year stretch as a guest of Her Majesty. He has been released into a world that doesn’t really want him any more, and so he is relegated to driving high class hooker “Simone” (Cathy Tyson) from one wealthy client to another, whilst his ex-wife ensures that he isn’t welcome at home or to see his daughter. Initially, he isn’t too impressed with his new charge but the more he works with her the more they gradually begin to understand each other and he falls, a bit one-sidedly it has to be said, in love. As that relationship becomes more trusting, “Simone” takes him into her confidence more and asks him to help track down another, less expensive, prostitute “Cathy” (Kate Hardie) who’s earning opportunities are more limited and her drug dependency makes her even more vulnerable on the unforgiving streets controlled by the sordid and scheming “Mortwell” (Michael Caine). Pretty swiftly, “George” finds himself embroiled in a scenario that is pitching him against his own, in defence of a woman who has an altogether different agenda and it’s a dangerous straddling position to escape from. There is something tragic about this story and both Hopkins and Tyson play their roles poignantly as the threads of their completely differing lives gradually entangle. He has to come to terms with an unfamiliar side of his erstwhile friends, of his city and of himself that shows us a grimy, seamy and brutal industry that saw some amass wealth at the expense of the vulnerable. Neil Jordan has written potently here, sure, but there is also some humour peppered throughout the drama and a solid supporting cast help add richness to a plot that’s full of twists, turns and even some Elton John specs.

Fellini uses the still largely war-torn streets of Rome as an effective backdrop to this most human of stories, and the writing allows Miss Masina to deliver her quick-fire, frequently comical (and always unerringly optimistic) dialogue expertly.

There is an air of cynicism to the whole thing, but somehow her character manages to punch through it - and that's what made this entertaining for me. It could have been just a procedural and predictable drama, but it isn't. There are no certainties with the plot. Indeed, the only certainty is that she is never going to give up!

The plot isn’t deep, though it touches upon the serious topic of suicide, but it is humorous and fun, and one of those flicks where we find ourselves repeating lines from it , such as, when we are grocery shopping and say maybe we shouldn’t get something fattening: “We have to think of the others,” and throw the item into the shopping cart. It is that kind of movie. Now that I have written this, we shall have to watch it yet again. || **_The growing ennui of college grads from the 60s in the early 80s_**

Seven former college friends from Michigan meet near the coast in small town South Carolina after the death of one of their old gang. They spend the weekend together reminiscing on their youthful ideals, where they are now, and where they’re going.

Written & directed by Lawrence Kasdan, “The Big Chill” (1983) has the same plot as “The Return of the Secaucus Seven” from three years earlier. The difference is that it has a blockbuster budget and bigger-name actors, but not necessarily the better story.

Speaking of the cast, the characters include the couple who own the big old house in South Carolina (Kevin Kline & Glenn Close), a TV star in the mold of Magnum P.I. (Tom Berenger), an attorney (Mary Kay Place), a journalist for People magazine (Jeff Goldblum), a discontented mother/housewife (JoBeth Williams) and a Vietnam vet who’s obsessed with drugs (William Hurt). Meg Tilly is also on hand as the girlfriend of the deceased.

While this was a hit when released, some amusingly refer to it as “The Big Dull.” Obviously, you have to be in the mood for a drama. I think Kasdan & the cast did a good job of making it seem like these are indeed old friends from college catching up after almost two decades. I also like the movie’s droll sense of humor and, of course, the 60’s soundtrack, not to mention the great Southern location.

Unfortunately, the awkward insemination subplot is eye-rolling and almost singlehandedly ruins the story. But this is made up for by Chloe's moving choice, which is unexpected. The former college 'radicals' are more or less intellectual whereas Chloe is visceral and mystical.

The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes, and was shot primarily in Beaufort, South Carolina, which happens to be the nearest town to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island.

With the erosion of our rights and privacy online, this movie should have served as a harbinger of a world we do not want to live in.

We are introduced to the same arguments politicians, the wealthy and the agencies brought forth after the terror attacks we endured. The exact same rhetoric is used in this film (""if you have nothing to hide...""). At times, it looks like the real world emulates fiction or worse, this film was a blue print.

From a protagonist unaware or unwilling to see the state of affairs, who's unwittingly caught in the path of bad guys, to what might then have been a tinfoil hat wearing, paranoid conspiracy theorist, but would now (post Snowden) be a a very concerned citizen, this film has what it needs to tell a good story.

What's great too is the ending, which is bittersweet. It reflects pretty well what goes on in the highest spheres where the working class has little to no influence.

All in all, a great film for everybody. || Fast-paced surveillance-oriented action/thriller with Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight

RELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Tony Scott, ""Enemy of the State” is an action/crime/thriller starring Will Smith as a DC lawyer who unknowingly apprehends evidence of a serious crime involving a formidable politician (Jon Voight) and is subsequently targeted by his NSA goons (Jack Black, Seth Green, etc.) and heavies (Scott Caan, Jake Busey, etc.). He ultimately partners with an ex-NSA surveillance curmudgeon (Gene Hackman).

The quick-editing is akin to other popular action flicks of the era, like “Armageddon” (1998), but it’s done expertly and there are enough lulls in the relentless action and character-developing moments to prevent it from being overkill. The surveillance element and Hackman bring to mind Coppola’s “The Conversation” (1974), but the story moves way faster, has more thrills and the characters are more interesting.

Lisa Bonet (Jason Momoa’s babe) is stunning as the protagonist’s secret connection and former woman-on-the-side while Regina King is capable as the wife. There are several teases of ravishing women on the periphery.

This is a gripping, action-packed thriller that has quality characters and is entertaining throughout. The creators took the time & effort to throw in inspired little gems, like “Baby” the friendly orange & white cat (I have a cat just like him). Smith and Hackman have great conflict-habituated but respectful camaraderie. 

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Baltimore & Phoenix, Maryland; Washington DC; and Southern Cal (L.A., West Hollywood and Pasadena). WRITER: David Marconi.

GRADE: A- || The government's been in bed with the entire telecommunications industry since the forties. They've infected everything.

Enemy of the State is directed by Tony Scott and written by David Marconi. It stars Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Regina King and	Lisa Bonet. Music is by Harry Gregson-Williams and Trevor Rabin, and cinematography by Dan Mindel.

A lawyer becomes targeted by a corrupt politician and his N.S.A. goons when he accidentally receives key evidence to a politically motivated murder.

Superb action thriller, we find Tony Scott on fine story telling form, backed up by Smith (how great to see the actor and not the star) and the always awesome Hackman adding his character driven gravitas to the stew. We are frighteningly drawn into a very real hi-tech world, which in turns becomes thought provoking and intriguing.

Scott knows how to work an action scene and edge of the seat sequences, and he doesn't disappoint here. The running time of 2 hours 10 minutes is arguably a touch too much, but there is never any moments of extraneous sequences or pointless filler, the screenplay ensures that all conversations and character activities mean something,  and therefore should be noted.

A hot buck roll call of rising actors are in on the fun, namely Barry Pepper, Scott Caan, Jake Busey, Jamie Kennedy and Jack Black, which leaves us with a smart and thrilling pic that's served at a breakneck pace. Enemy of the State delivers wholesome genre entertainment. 9/10"

As the origin story for Dill Pickles, it very clearly is going to deal with ""Where do babies come from?"", but I think this is the closest the Rugrats franchise has come to addressing death with its audience.

I don't think the nostalgia I had for Rugrats was strong enough.  I'm seeing all these characters I loved, and just feeling nothing.  I'm hearing these (fantastic, voice-acting) ladies doing baby voice, and I've seen other movies where ladies do baby voice and they're just not nearly as long as this one.

I might have been able to get into the movie as it actually has a decent story (thought it focuses on the parents more than I'm used to), but they decided to play with rules that involve how babies talk.  They clearly present new-born babies that not only talk, but talk eloquently about ""Missing their old womb"" (sounds like a baby saying ""room"").  Dill, barely talks.  in fact, he talks to the babies like the babies would talk to the adults, and they refer to him as a baby.

While they should be toddlers and speaking a lot more than they should, part of the premise is that they're babies that talk to each other, but not adults.  It almost paints the picture that Dill was born retarded, but refuses to address it, even if it applies it directly.

It really broke the movie for me, as it's the chief mechanic behind the babies' A story line that is the basis for the parents' B story line."

There's a load of other noteworthy members of the voice cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Atta), Hayden Panettiere (Dot), Bonnie Hunt (Rosie) and John Ratzenberger (P.T.) as well as many others - one of the studios' best casts.

It's an adequate drama this one that illustrates well the pulling power of Woody Allen in assembling a fairly stellar cast, but the episodic style of the storytelling is miss more than hit for me, and with the underpinning marital drama barely registering on the interesting scale, it really falls to one lively and authentic looking scene with Leonardo DiCaprio as the over-indulged film star having a mega-strop with his girlfriend and threatening to trash the hotel to bring the film to a brief form of life. It's too long, at times repetitive, and extremely verbose as the characters never seem capable of shutting up long enough to listen to what has already been said, let alone absorb or implement it's messages. Monochrome helps it's look, as does the classic sounding score, but as an opportunity to satirise the whole business of celebrity and the fickleness of fame, it rather disappoints."

This is a feel good movie from start to finish. Okay, a character dies at the beginning, but only right after he wins the lottery. They set up the action by introducing several characters and fill in background on them. Then the story itself is told simply and well.

Kirk Jones wrote and directed the film, which apparently stated out to be a ten-minute short. Fortunately for all of us, he was encouraged to expand it to a full-length feature. It won or was nominated for a lot of awards. So,e actors agreed to be made less than usual to ensure the film got made, and I believe some people who lived where it was filmed (Isle of Man) took part also. Oddly enough, Jones still only has a handful of film writing credits. Before movies he made some very successful advertising commercials.

In addition to being a funny, charming movie, the soundtrack is one of my favorites for a movie. The music sets the mood and even helps tell the story in places.

This reminded me a little of the original ""Whisky Galore"" (1949) in that it presents a community with a chance to engage in some community mischief which is, of course, entirely fraudulent - but leaves you hoping that they get away with their plan. The pacing is almost perfect, Bannen and Kelly gel well together and there are a few daft sub-plots to help keep the film moving along nicely.

After H bomb testing in the pacific, ships start to go missing and a remote island is apparently under attack from a prehistoric monster. Japanese scientists hasten to find out just what is going on, what they find is Gojira, and he is mightily hell bent on destruction...next stop Tokyo.

Gojira is such an influential film, it has spawned many sequels, remakes, copyists, and numerous homages, and of course there is two versions of this film for the viewer to choose from. The American version is a decent enough watch, it has integrated Raymond Burr into this original versions plot, and although it's unintentionally funny at times, it holds up pretty well as a no brainer piece of fluff. But it fails to compare to this original Ishirô Honda classic because this has a wonderful ambiance of fear at its heart, coming some 10 years after the Hiroshima bomb, the Japanese audiences of the time would surely have noted the heavy aura of destruction seaming through the picture. 

Watching it today, now that it's restored in all its original glory, is still a memorable and exhilarating experience, the build up is perfect, we are practically on the edge of our seats waiting to glimpse the giant atomic creature, and when he/it/she shows up for the first time, it gives us a truly memorable classic piece of cinema. Sadly the film is hampered a touch by a meandering romantic sub-plot, but the performances (notably Takeshi Shimura) are very engaging, while Akira Ifkube's score is poignantly perfect.

As man in a rubber suit movies go, Gojira has no peers, it's smart, fun, and above all else, memorable. 8/10"

Alright, well it may not be up to the high tech standards of film we're so use to today, King Kong vs. Godzilla is credited as being one of the first ""versus"" films to start the now very popular trend of bringing franchises together. What an interesting idea. You take a character from one film and another character from another film and bring them together, now to do what is beyond them. But now studios are taking interest in something that should have been done years ago and with the advent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is now catching on like wild fire. But to the credit, this is the one that started it all. With such a colossal idea, you would imagine that it'd look cleaner. Well to it's credit, it was made in 1962 and Toho was asked by RKO to fork over a giant amount of money for Kong's likeness that substantially hurt the budget. So the real question is, how does it hold up? It's cheesy when it needs to be and serious when it needs to be too. Some people think that the added Americanized footage with Michael Keith and the stock music from films like _The Wolf Man_ and _Creature From the Black Lagoon_ butcher the film. I like to think that it helps set it in the mood among the classic Universal Monster Movies. The fight is a little hokey now but back then, was probably mind boggling. And stop motion techniques spread throughout the film are amazing. On top of that, this has one of the least annoying Americanized dubbings to a Godzilla movie I have ever seen. So is it great? No. Is is bad? No. What is it then? Just good old cheesy fun that needs to be seen to be believed. || The original clash of the Titans you think the first crossover with these two would take a long time, but no it happened in 1962 and was both monsters third movie but their first in color the characters in this movie are actually pretty entertaining. Definitely better than the characters in raids again. Mr Tako definitely being the stand out in the movie 

Godzilla’s design looks pretty good although if you do look at him face on, he doesn’t look that great but him profile he does look pretty incredible. I like them more hunchback to look and this is the first Godzilla movie where we got to see the atomic breath in color and its blue, which would become iconic

King, Kong, design however, is not that great. The body looks like an app that looks fine. It’s really the face that’s a problem. It just looks bad. It looks like they got run over 50 cars and then a semi truck but yet again, the design does work in a way the scene that the movie itself is very goofy and silly so in a weird way it does work, but has a design on its own. Yeah it’s not that great.

You do you have to wait a while to see Godzilla fight King Kong but once you do, it is worth the wait I mean sure they have a brief encounter but it’s very very brief and it’s really just Godzilla shooting his atomic breath at Kong and then Kong running away but the final battle is so entertaining there’s so many great moments like when Godzilla does the drop kick and when he’s just constantly beating on Kong and obviously the tree in the mouth Just a fun fight

Overall, this movie is really entertaining and a lot of fun and definitely one of the better Godzilla movies out there"

Natives were being bitten, swallowed and purposely stepped upon by Kong. The sailors were chased, trampled and eaten by the dinosaurs and then we have all the New York City violence on top of it all where Kong tosses a woman to her death and bites on a bystander.

Also, for it being an 85+ year old movie, the special effects STILL stand up rather well and STILL look convincingly realistic. In fact, I believe these FX are of a better quality than the 1976 remake and even comes close to the 2005 CGI version.

If you've never seen this classic, mostly because ""who would want to watch that old-style claymation"" or you can't watch anything not ""in Living Color,"" you really need to give this one a try. For those of you that have seen it, let me urge you to rewatch it, possibly with some newly-opened eyes. || Shown recently by the BBC and wow, how fantastically this has stood the test of time. I can see why there have been so many remakes of this iconic tale of ambition, power and true love but none that shine a candle to this - even after over 80 years. Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray do their bit as the producer and the starlet, but the true stars are lighting, photography and special effects which are masterful as we visit this ancient island divided by a great wall (how on earth did the natives ever manage to build it?) that keeps the prehistoric monsters at bay. This is adventure cinema at it's absolute best; and even the writing is reasonable. If you don't feel sympathy for Kong at the end then where is your heart? || So this is the bar, and this is the reason that people don't like any of the remakes... except the 2005 remake, people don't like that because it stinks.

But this shot for the moon. It promised the audience a giant ape, it gave the audience a giant ape... and a sort of love story that was really cute and relatable that brought it all together.

It reached for the stars visually, it grabbed one, and it told an amazing story along with it.

It was a win on every front.

So, now, when people watch King Kong remakes, they look at them and they don't live up to the effort that this movie put into itself. They all look better, but they don't feel as well crafted as the original, because they aren't. They are all a little lazy in comparison because it's easier to do it now.

I had only heard horrible things about the 70's version, but I have come to admire Guillermin's films that I had watched, and look at that cast, so when I found the blu used, for a good price, I took a chance. It's definitely the runt of the litter, but is by no means a disaster. It's intriguing that they had originally wanted Joseph Sargent to direct with Peter Falk starring, and that Meryl Streep was considered for the role that eventually went to Jessica Lange. The changes they made to update Kong for the seventies were intriguing (as they wanted the script to be completely different from the Cooper/Schoedsack masterpiece), and I'm left curious, had Sir Peter Jackson chosen to make Kong a 21st-century schizoid apeman instead of doing a period piece, how that would have transpired. Even being Canadian, seeing the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center made me wistfully nostalgic. The only part of the film that was excruciating to watch was when Kong is made to perform for the American Bicentennial festivities, and at the ending, I was curious how Lange got down from the rooftop of one of the towers so fast. The answer probably lies on the cutting room floor, and the editing was probably rushed for release date, so no one must have noticed... || No, you're dead wrong. He was the terror, the mystery of their lives, and the magic.

1976 and I had already been spellbound and terrified by Jaws the year previously, I mean I was only 10 years old. Having been introduced by my film loving parents to the original King Kong from 1933, as soon as this update - in colour - was released, I stood in that queue for two hours to see it. I was spellbound, absolutely loved it, telling everyone in school or on the playing fields how great an experience it was. Those things never leave you, it's love of cinema with youthful eyes, and none of us should ever decry those moments as being ignorance.

Much later in life, watching this reworking of the Kong story becomes a battle to not extinguish those youthful fires. For now you can see just how poor the effects are, in fact just how much of a cheat (through research) that uber producer Dino De Laurentiis was as he put this onto the screen. Conversely, though, you can now see just how adult much of it was. The pic is full of sexual connotations and imagery. I mean look at Jessica Lange's first scene, she is introduced in a wet dress with erectus nippleus in full effect. I didn't remember that as a 10 year old boy...

There's some smart era concerns in the narrative, fuels, discrimination etc, and for sure the array of characters on show are 1970s intelligent. Hell! even the change to helicopter attacks instead of aeroplanes for the finale deserves respect - with the added sombre setting of the WTC twin towers now more attention grabbing - yet it's hard to get away from just how poor the production is. So as we may still shed a tear as the giant beast is felled by his love for a beauty, and we curse mankind for just not leaving him on his island, this is still poor film making that comes close to shattering fond memories of the young movie lovers back in 1976. 5/10 || A bit long but not terrible and had some adorably funny moments like seeing a man in an ape outfit tossing around a model train or hiding behind a building to avoid a helicopter. But seriously, the ape costume wasn't bad however his expressions were at times creepy, especially when looking at Dwan.

Roberta (Rosanna Arquette), a bored housewife in the New York City area, becomes obsessed with a wild child named Susan (Madonna) through the personal ads and inadvertently takes on her persona when she visits Manhattan. Unfortunately a hooligan is after Susan for priceless Egyptian earrings (Will Patton). Mark Blum plays Roberta’s jerk husband and Aidan Quinn a new friend in the city. 

“Desperately Seeking Susan” (1985) is a quirky drama revolving around mistaken identity in an unlikely story. It’s entertaining enough and also works as a window into mid-80’s New York City. How much a viewer will appreciate it depends on how smitten (or not smitten) they are with Arquette. She’s winsome, for sure, but I can take her or leave her. Madonna is more alluring in the lesser role, but I’m not big on her either; still, there are a couple scenes that nicely spotlight her attractiveness.

An American engineer (Powers Boothe) takes his family to the Amazon Basin to build a major dam, but his son suddenly disappears and there are rumors that he may have been taken by a tribe called The Invisible People. Ten years pass and he’s still looking. Will he find him? Will the son (Charley Boorman) recognize him? Meg Foster is on hand as the wife/mother.

“The Emerald Forest” (1985) is similar to “A Man Called Horse” (1970) story-wise, albeit involving a teen, plus featuring the Amazon setting of “Fitzcarraldo” (1982). It influenced later movies like “Dances With Wolves” (1990) and, as far as ‘look’ goes, “Apocalypto” (2006). Being helmed by John Boorman, it’s a quality production.

Unfortunately, this is the least of these movies and therefore justifiably obscure. It’s not just the unnecessary environmental message in the second half but, worse, the laughable implication concerning a rain dance. (Why Sure!)

Isn't it ironic how “Natives” in the Americas are now adorned with god-like powers and sage-like stature in cinema? (I put ‘Natives’ in quotations because they’re actually the progeny of settlers from Asia via Beringia). If these Amazonian Indians had that much power, then taking care of the technologically advanced encroachers or enemy tribes would be a piece of cake.

Another criticism is the unrealistic portrayal of The Invisible People. It’s way too paradisal with too little emphasis on the mundaneness and hardships inherent to such a life in the deep equatorial forest. For instance, the nubile females appear overly fresh and immaculate for living amidst gross jungle challenges. In other words, they seem like girls who’ve lived a relatively soft life with modern conveniences (I’ve seen the real-life articles/photos in National Geographic and they’re very different). Both “Apocalypto” and “At Play in the Fields of the Lord” (1991) offer a less fantastical portrayal.

The story was inspired by a supposedly true event, but the man who lost his son to a mysterious tribe was Peruvian, not American, not to mention he was a lumberjack rather than an engineer. It took sixteen years for him to find his son, who had been totally assimilated into the primitive culture. Responding to these deviations, it was said that the screenplay was based on several real-life stories, not just this one.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in Brazil with additional studio stuff done in England.

Smith, Ernie Reyes Jr.",Richard Fleischer,"epic, monster, swordplay, villainess, queen, talisman, based on comic, warrior, high fantasy, sword and sorcery","Not a good REH interpretation (it’s too campy), but entertaining in some ways  

""Red Sonja"" (1985) is essentially ""Conan 3,"" after ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982) and ""Conan the Destroyer"" (1984). Schwarzenegger plays the barbarian 'Kalidor' here because the filmmakers didn't have the rights to the 'Conan' name since 'Red Sonja' was owned by a company separate from the REH people, yet -- strangely -- they could use REH's Hyborian setting, albeit in a half-axxed way.

""Red Sonja"" is the least of the three films. In other words, if you couldn't stomach parts of ""Conan the Destroyer"" you'll loathe ""Red Sonja."" It starts out pretty good but by the 23-minute mark the goofiness kicks in with the introduction of Prince Tarn (the spoiled Asian child who deems himself a king) and his loyal rotund assistant, Falkon. The sword & sorcery silliness turns full throttle by the final act. Needless to say, Robert E. Howard (REH) was rolling over in the grave at such roll-your-eyes treatment of his S&S fantasy world.

It's strange because, for the most part, the film gets the LOOK of the Hyborian Age down pretty good, although there are some really fake-looking props/costumes/effects here and there. But, generally speaking, they did a decent job with the locations, costumes, cast and props. The problem is the overall cartoonish vibe. It's like Conan for kids or something and it's almost saddening to observe all this expense & effort wasted by the inexplicable decision to go the camp route. It mars what could have been a quality REH-influenced picture. John Milius' ""Conan the Barbarian"" may have deviated from REH but it made up for it by taking Conan and the Hyborian Age seriously, not that it was totally humorless. Laughter and lightness are an intrinsic part of life but they don't need to devolve into campy silliness. ""Red Sonja,"" by contrast, is so silly at points that it's impossible to take seriously.

This isn't to say it's all bad though. If you're in the right mode ""Red Sonja"" can fill the bill. It's not good, and you can't take it too seriously, but it's somewhat entertaining. What works? For one, as already noted, the film scores decently as far as visuals go. For instance, the Italian locations are gorgeous and, although Brigitte Nielsen in all her 6-foot glory doesn't match the comic's depiction of Red Sonja and looks more like Red Mullet, I have to admit that she's pleasant to the eye, and her swordplay is impressive. Also, the score by Ennio Morricone (famous for his great Spaghetti Western compositions back in the day, like ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly,"" “Death Rides a Horse” and “Navajo Joe”) is pretty good too, although nowhere near the exceptionality of Basil Poledouris' compositions for the first two Conan flicks.

Also, although Prince Tarn & Falkon are eye-rolling characters, you can't help but start to like them as the story progresses. As a matter of fact, the story in general pretty much maintains your attention, despite the occasional silliness.

Another plus is Sandahl Bergman as the mad villain queen, but the filmmakers dropped the ball here because she appears fully clothed from head to toe throughout. The thing is, although Sandahl's face isn't ultra-cute like Brigitte, Sandahl has a killer body that exceeds Brigitte's. But you won't see it here; you'll have to re-watch ""Conan the Barbarian"" for that. Not that I'm suggesting a need for nudity or sex; it's just that Sandahl's a jaw-dropping whoa-man and they should have taken advantage of this with some more form-fitting attire to show-off her beauty. But she still looks great here, particularly in black hair and a cool mask.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Red Sonja"" is a real mixed bag. It fails as a cinematic interpretation of REH's Hyborian world, but only because the filmmakers opted for kid-friendly goofiness at the expense of brutal S&S pseudo-reality. However, the film looks and sounds good, for the most part. Bergman and Nielsen are quality eye-candy and it is somewhat charming if you're in the right frame of mind.

But I’ll take “Kull the Conqueror” (1997) over this; it has a light side too, but it’s less kiddie-ish and was loosely based on REH’s “By this Axe I Rule,” which means it contains more REH. Not to mention Kevin Sorbo makes for a great Kull, although he’s too genial and not brooding enough.

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes.

GRADE: C/C- (but sometimes amuses to the level of B-/C+) || Hot off the back of his outing as ""Conan"", Arnold Schwarzenegger teams up with Brigitte Nielsen in the eponymous role as both have to avenge the killing of her family and the destruction of her homeland by the evil ""Gedren"" (Sandahl Bergman). Their task is not helped much by their alighting on the precociously irritating Prince ""Tarn"" (Ernie Reyes Jnr.) and his nice but dim bodyguard ""Falkon"" (Paul L. Smith). Various set-piece escapades follow as ""Sonja"" gradually realises that she cannot prevail without the help of Arnie against the evil queen and her sidekick ""Ikol"" (Ronald Lacey) and so battle lines are drawn and sword play and acrobatics ensue. It's mercifully short which is a double blessing because I really did want to throttle the young princeling after about five minutes and I could probably extend that sentiment to the writing in general. It's woeful. Schwarzenegger has a little of his tongue in his cheek here, but the rest of the film takes itself far too seriously and better visual effects could probably have been conjured by a third year chemistry student. Nielsen has precisely no charisma, no charm, no screen presence - she just happens to be someone who looks like she could give Mike Tyson a run for his money and that, sadly, doesn't make this weak effort remotely entertaining as we meander along towards the inevitable conclusion.

Despite this movie releasing in 1986, this movie actually dates really well.  With the focus being much more on the horror of real estate and property maintenance, things like smart phones aren't relevant to the story.  This could easily be rebooted beat for beat as all the points are still relevant today and the script is well written.

I'm not sure who the equivalent actors to Tom Hanks (""Forest Gump"") and Shelley Long (""Cheers"") are today, but they would have to be quality expressionists to make the movie work.  While some of the jokes are baked into the script with situational destruction around the house, it really is the actor performances that sell the emotion and charm of the movie.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || LIFEFORCE (1985) - By the mid '80s, Cannon Films was looking to move away from low-budget, disposable fare like HOSPITAL MASSACRE (1981) and BREAKIN' 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO (1984). Owners Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus had loftier ambitions: They wanted a blockbuster; a big-budget smash that they could call their own. To this end, they signed director Tobe Hooper to a three-picture deal and turned him loose with $25,000,000 and free reign to create the movie he wanted. Working with a stellar, mostly British cast (save token American star Steve Railsback, who apparently misplaced his charisma at Heathrow; and startlingly uninhibited French goddess Mathilda May); legendary composer Henry Mancini; and a screenplay co-written by the man who wrote ALIEN (1979), Hooper unleashed a wonderfully unwieldy miasma of genres. What starts out as a science fiction mystery gradually morphs into full blown, zombie apocalypse horror - played with square-jawed seriousness by all involved. Unfortunately, this film got lost among that years' heavy-hitters like BACK TO THE FUTURE and the second RAMBO film, and earned back less than half its budget. Cannon Films ceased operations in 1994, but their ambitious attempt to stand amongst the major studios keeps giving back to its growing cult audience via home video. Sometimes success takes a few decades."

Surprisingly serious Bond movie has Roger Moore step up to the plate for the last time as 007 - this time tackling none other than a psychotic Christopher Walken.

One of the better entries, this film has it all - action, humour, beautiful locales, sexy ladies, a scary villain, great stunt work, a classic theme song and of course, the legendary Roger Moore as James Bond.

It's a shame that Barbara Broccoli threw all of this classic Bond fun down the toilet in 2006. Bond has always been silly and, sadly, the 2006 reboot has thrown it all away and has no rewatchbility. || Not as good as the previous four, but still a solid Bond film with Christopher Walken, Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones

A mission in wintery Siberia leads Agent 007 (Roger Moore) to globetrot from England to Paris to San Francisco and Silicon Valley investigating a horse-racing scam and the psychopathic entrepreneur, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), who schemes to flood Silicon Valley for the purpose of creating a global microchip monopoly.

This was Moore’s last of 7 Bond films from 1973-1985 and it’s a solid Bond flick, just not up to the exceptionalness of the previous four films: “The Spy Who Loved Me” (1977), “Moonraker” (1979), “For Your Eyes Only” (1981) and “Octopussy” (1983). Just as “For Your Eyes Only” toned down the excesses of “Moonraker,” so “A View to a Kill” (1985) scales things down after the ultra-action-packed adventures of “Octopussy.”

As such, the movie focuses a little more on the psychological drama of intrigue and rivalry. For instance, there’s a long sequence at Zorin’s impressive chateau and a horse racing scene that’s reminiscent of the low-key golf game in “Goldfinger” (1964). Despite this direction, there’s still a lot of action, like a thrilling ski chase in Siberia, a murder/chase at the Eiffel Tower & Paris, a brouhaha at a mansion, a fiery elevator shaft episode, a wild vehicle chase through the streets of San Francisco with a fire engine, an extended clash in Zorin’s mine complex near the San Andreas fault and a thrilling climax at the Golden Gate Bridge.

On the female front, Tanya Roberts is just stunning and has a couple of quality scenes. A year earlier she did ""Sheena"" where she had to thin down to fit into a skimpy animal-skin bikini (although she still looked great). Meanwhile Grace Jones is a formidable villainous with an interesting story arc. Mary Ann Catrin Stavin also has a quality cameo in the opening teaser.

I shouldn’t close without mentioning critics’ denouncements of Zorin’s psychopathic actions in the mines. I don’t get these whiney criticisms, are Bond villains supposed to be nice guys or something? Zorin is mad and this is what megalomaniacal whack jobs do!

The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.

GRADE: B || Walken, right, you can sit back and watch A View to a Kill because of Walken.

But let's be honest, he is the ONLY reason that you can sit back and finish this. The 70s, by 1985, were long over and Moore was clearly the 70s era 007. The mood, the atmosphere, the silliness, the feel of 007 needed to change and we still had 70s Bond in 85.

And then, Moore himself looked kind of like Bond in his 70s. He was far too old for the role. Too old to be believable as a super spy. Too old fit the part, and needed to pass on the mantel a few films ago.

By 85 the Silly Bond Era needed to end. They needed a new 007, and this, and Moore, just didn't work any more."

Bailey, Bubba Smith, Donovan Scott",Hugh Wilson,"trainer, recruit, shenanigan, police academy","**A comedy landmark.**

I have no doubt that this film inaugurates what was one of the comic franchises that most marked the 80s and 90s. I remember that, until the dawn of the new century, films from this franchise were a regular presence on TV channels, and they still make routine appearances on movie or comedy channels. Unlike many other film works from this era, I feel they are aging well and haven't fallen by the wayside.

The script helped a lot, because it was very well written, considering that it is a light film and does not lack great depth: after a municipal decision to open police training courses to all those who wanted to, regardless of physical, mental and psychological requirements, the Police Academy was swamped by the most inept aspirants. Now, there will be a declared effort to get them to give up, and one of them is prevented from doing so, no matter how much he wants to.

If I'm told that the film's script is quite simple and that it's not exactly good, I would surely agree. However, it served perfectly for the intended effect and held up well to the film and the successive jokes that were happening. Many of them are predictable, many are overly sexual, but many of the jokes work reasonably well. There is some female nudity here, but it's nothing that current cinema hasn't shown in much more abusive ways in other films. Still, parents be warned!

There are several actors of great quality here who do an excellent job. Despite being many years old, it is the great film in the career of Steve Guttenberg, who shone in the franchise in the role of the irreverent Mahoney. The actor made the best use of the opportunity and reaped the rewards of that commitment. G.W. Bailey also deserves a round of applause for an inspired, funny and beautifully executed work. Despite speaking very little, Bubba Smith also stands out, using his physical grandeur and serious air. The actor was excellent. Even more impressively, David Graf is really funny and steals attention whenever he appears. As with Graf, Marion Ramsey also had the culmination of her career in these films, and made the best of it with an extraordinarily good performance. Michael Winslow and George Gaynes also did an excellent job. Kim Catrall is beautiful, but she is very little used in the movie, as are other actors because the cast is just huge!

The film was made in an old psychiatric sanatorium and the buildings have a beautiful, somewhat institutional appearance, which lends credibility to the atmosphere of the academy. The cinematography is regular and doesn't bring us anything new or original, but it works well, and the soundtrack has one of the most recognizable main themes in comedy films. The film has a very good pace and is not tiring. || <em>'Police Academy'</em> is proper lacklustre. I didn't find any of it amusing, even so I can usually see why a film may actually work for others - not here. Given I've heard of this franchise, I assume folk enjoy these so I am a tad surprised. To me, it's just all a rather limp effort.

The characters have one joke associated to them (e.g. tall man, quiet woman, wannabe war guy etc.) and it's just repeated numerous times throughout the movie; it doesn't get any funnier. How many times do they play the theme song, btw? It is catchy to be fair, but damn.

Michael Winslow is the only plus that I have for this. I wasn't aware of him until this very moment, those voice sounds are outrageously brilliant; even had me questioning if they were dubbed over sound effects. Awesome talent! Of the rest of the cast, Donovan Scott is the 'best' (?).

I found lead Steve Guttenberg to be more annoying than anything else, shame we never got Bruce Willis instead; he auditioned for the role, so I read. Elsewhere, Kim Cattrall is underused; interesting to see her <em>'Mannequin'</em> co-star G. W. Bailey in this though, he is OK.

Despite everything, in the end when the credits rolled around I didn't hold any annoyance or anything towards the flick. The feeling is more so how lame and low quality it comes across, I expected snappier comedy. Lastly, how are there 7 of these movies?! I'm in for a ride..."

This movie has so many great moments. All of the original gang return - except Harris and Callahan. Lt. Mauser ( Art Metrano) is the new slimy adversary here along with his braindead sidekick, Proctor. 

Highlights include the hilarious Kirkland family and their _bouts_ of affection, an overly sticky black sock, a gang of moronic street thugs led by the cretinous Zed (Bob Goldthwait) and a hilarious scene in a sushi bar.  

The last of the truly funny Academy movies. || **An honorable sequel.**

This film is a sequel that came out the year after the release of its predecessor, making the best use of the box office success achieved. Although many may not even agree with me, I believe it managed to reasonably match the initial film, and helped to consolidate the nascent franchise and give it popularity, which TV later took advantage of.

The script continues the story told in the first film, with the newly graduated police officers taking on their first and thorny mission: to reinforce the weakened and demoralized contingent of a police station in a troubled neighborhood, headed by the brother of the Academy Commander. Of course, one of the bosses is keen to take his place, and will do whatever he can to get in the way. The script continues not to be particularly inspired, and to demonstrate several weaknesses, but it does the essential and reasonably sustains the film. It is not, however, as effective in this task as the first film. On a positive note: the nudity we saw in the initial film has all been stripped away here, making this film reasonably more suited to the family context.

The cast is almost entirely inherited from the previous film and the more familiar and solid faces will be the ones that will sustain the bulk of the action here. Once again, Steve Guttenberg once again stands out and has an unmistakable role. Still, Art Metrano manages to steal our attention every time he appears on the scene, and he's really funny and good at what he does. David Graf, Bubba Smith, Lance Kinsey and especially Bob Goldthwait are actors who deserve praise for a job really well done. I really liked Goldthwait and the way he gave his character a touch of unpredictable madness. Marion Ramsey is in a more low-key position here, but she does what she can with what little she's been given. The film has good sets and costumes, and the cinematography is regular, but it works well. The soundtrack brings back the main theme we already know, but it doesn't present anything that is really interesting anymore. The film has a very good pace and is not tiring. || Inoffensive sequel provided a few laughs but isn't as good as the first.

This is the third film in the memorable “Police Academy” franchise, which was a remarkable success during the 80's and 90's. Of course, it's old stuff, but it's curious how, even today, many people remember these films, which are still quite easy to find on TV in Portugal. In this third release, the quality and freshness of the comic material is still remarkable, and the film manages to keep up with the two predecessors with relative ease.

The plot continues to be the Achilles heel of these films, but it gives us what is essential to sustain an hour and a half of different antics, with some mixed action: with expenses rising, the city decided to extinguish one of the two training academies for existing police, one being our well-known academy, led by Commander Lassard, and the other a rival academy, meanwhile formed by Commander Mauser. Seeing things get complicated, Lassard turns to Mahoney, Jones, Hightower and other law enforcement officers already well known to all of us for help, knowing they are the right people for the mission.

Continuing the efforts of the previous films, the crew and cast members are virtually the same as in the previous film. Jerry Paris, who had directed the previous film, remains in charge of the production and manages to give a great sense of cohesion to all the work developed. The bulk of the cast is present again, giving us more than we've ever seen, without surprises, but managing to live up to our expectations very well. We have Steve Guttenberg in the role of Mahoney, but giving the character more maturity and a sense of responsibility. Michael Winslow gets more attention in this film, and better material to work with and showcase his vocal gifts. Bob Goldthwait also gets more attention and more refined material, and along with the hilarious Tim Kazurinsky, he's going to be one of the funniest course cadets at the academy (in fact, the two actors complement each other amazingly). Also Art Metrano manages very well and gives his character a touch of elegant cynicism, being the ideal target for the mischief of others. Leslie Easterbrook also has more room to show value, achieving in this film one of the most interesting works of her career. David Graf, Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey keep the same record we're used to, no big surprises.

The film retains the production values ​​of its predecessors. In addition to good filming locations and good costumes, the special effects are of good quality and the action scenes here received a more attentive treatment, and they work very well, especially in the final part. The editing was well executed and the fast pace of the film doesn't tire us, although at times we feel that it is nothing more than a collection of situational and verbal jokes, one after the other, and not a comic feature film. || <em>'Police Academy 3: Back in Training'</em> continues where the previous films left off, in that I don't hold any major pluses but, to be honest, they do make for easy viewing; to the point that I don't dislike watching them. I may feel differently after watching all seven, granted.

I do enjoy seeing the cast remain, I'm a fan of characters remaining across franchises without any recasts etc. So far, we've had basically all the people involved return. It's cool to see, at least for me; I like seeing a character's trajectory, even if the films aren't the best (like here).

It is neat to see the likes of Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow and Marion Ramsey again. Bobcat Goldthwait is even minorly watchable, his character should be irritating but somehow it almost works. Overall, there's a noticeable camaraderie between the main cast."

In the fifth film in the “Police Academy” franchise, we follow the characters that everyone already knows on a trip to Miami for a national police convention where veteran Commander Lassard, about to retire and leave the command of the academy, will be rewarded. The script is decent enough, but we can't ignore that, after four films, the comic material is worn out and doesn't make us laugh like it used to. The production's solution was to change location, which was not as effective as one might think: in other films we had already had lots of beach jokes.

The film retains many familiar faces from everyone who has seen the previous films. However, it was unable to bring together the entire cast, not counting Steve Guttenberg, Tim Kazurinsky and Bob Goldthwait, actors who chose not to be part of this project and who had their relevance (especially Guttenberg) in the previous films. As a direct consequence, the film pays more attention to actors who had remained in the shadows, such as Bubba Smith, who performs well here. Michael Winslow, Leslie Easterbrook, George Graf and Marion Ramsey are also present in this film, but they limit themselves to doing more than they had before, and their collaboration is nothing new. George Gaynes also has more protagonism here, and the actor exploited it very well, but it is the duo formed by Lance Kinsey and G. W. Bailey that makes us laugh and steals all the attention thanks to their mischief. Matt McCoy was particularly weak and doesn't deserve to continue in the franchise.

Technically, the film retains many aspects of the previous films in the franchise, such as the costumes, cinematography and effects. It takes advantage of the aerial scenes and landscapes of Miami, with its hotels and wetlands, but I got the feeling that the location was chosen to allow as many girls in bikinis as possible. The settings are decent, although sometimes there are problems (that plane door that is easily ripped off and proves to be light is, of course, fake). The film is not long, wastes no time and was well edited, but the final scene in the swamp is disappointing: I think it was the third time that a “Police Academy” film ended with a random chase, and what was done here it is virtually a copy of a similar scene in another film in the franchise. || I don't know. As an adult, yeah, this is a HORRIBLE installment.

But as a kid, I actually thought it was still pretty good, still pretty funny, still slap stick and stupid, and everything I wanted from a Police Academy film.

But... as an adult, it's not as funny as I thought it was as a kid.

So I am kind of torn, there are certainly FAR better Police Academy films (and I'm going to give them 10 of 10 because fun movies deserve it) but this one... this one a lot of the humor that still holds true in the others fell flat."

This is the fourth film in the prolific “Police Academy” franchise, which visibly marked the 80s and 90s, and which still brings good memories to many people today. I can say that it was one of the comic franchises that I enjoyed during my childhood and adolescence, and that I still see it from time to time.

In this fourth film, I felt that the production learned from the flaws of the previous films, especially when it comes to script writing. If the older films had in their weak scripts the biggest problem to overcome, this film responds with a more careful writing and the creation of a more logical story, capable of sustaining all sorts of jokes and comic situations created later. As a result, the film feels more like a cohesive work of cinema. However, it is undeniable that the comic material presented begins to show wear and tear and is not enough to make us laugh, even if it manages to do it several times.

For the last time, the film brings together all the main names of the cast and crew from the previous films, and the replacement of Jerry Parris by Jim Drake in the director's chair is barely perceptible: the new director has really managed to capture the spirit of the franchise and give it an honorable following. Steve Guttenberg says goodbye to his character, Mahoney, who will live for the last time, walking out the big door with a job well done. Michael Winslow and Bob Goldthwait were also in excellent shape and seem to have a lot of fun with their characters, along with the excellent Tim Kazurinsky. Sharon Stone was a surprising addition, but it works well thanks to the actress' physical beauty.

Technically, the film is very much on par with its predecessors, and the final aerial sequence really deserves a round of applause for the execution and the way it was done. Good sets, the costumes we already know, the soundtrack without major demerits or surprises and a decent cinematography make up the scenario of a film that, if it is not capable of enchanting, manages to convince most fans of the franchise. || <em>'Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol'</em> is a lousy fourth entry to this franchise. I've not truly liked any of these flicks admittedly, but the last two did do some things well enough that I could see the potential. This one is more akin to the original, it feels aimless.

I guess that is to be expected this deep into the series, hopefully it's not a sign of things to come for me across the next three releases. Any 'pluses' that I do have for this is anything I've 'praised' across the prior flicks, which is pretty much just the pleasantly returning cast. Sharon Stone and (a debuting) David Spade make for interesting newcomers.

The plot isn't anything close to being fresh, it's basically the last three movies rolled into one; those ones are hardly anything memorable themselves, so that's an obvious problem. I will say that the ending here is at least visually interesting, if still not the real McCoy.

Lastly, I know I keep saying it but I seriously don't know how I'm not finding Bobcat Goldthwait's Zed overtly annoying yet. Sure he is a little so, especially as he gets a needless extension of screen time on this occasion, though the character continues to bring a mini smirk or two. Beats me!"

The “Police Academy” franchise is increasingly showing signs of wear and tear. After a film far weaker than any of its predecessors, I had hoped that attempts had been made to improve things a little. However, this film is at least as weak as its immediate predecessor. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, quite the opposite. There are much worse and much better rated films out there, and the comedy of this film is quite friendly and familiar, unlike what happens in many other comic films, where the humor is pure and simply dirty. This is an enjoyable movie and sometimes even has some fun… it's just not as good as its predecessors.

The script is based on a series of attempts to stop a group of bandits from carrying out a series of crimes and robberies in a certain area of ​​the city. Obviously, Lassard and Harris will be together to do it, and Harris is only concerned with his own career progression and continues to be the preferred target of the cop trolls we already know. The script is not brilliant, but it manages to support the film in the way it was conceived and executed. It turns out that the quality level is now very low, and this can also be seen in the poverty of the dialogues, in the amount of clichés and situations that, instead of making us laugh, make us wonder to what extent the screenwriter was a competent person.

The cast does what they can with what they've been given, but they don't have the space or material to stand out anyway. Bubba Smith assumes an unquestionable protagonism, but he doesn't have a character or even material that makes him stand out more. Michael Winslow does what he can, but he doesn't stand out much either. Easterbrook and Ramsey are a shadow of what they were in other films. Matt McCoy is no joke and shouldn't be here. Villains can be more idiotic and childish than the Looney Tunes and George Gaynes, as respectable as he is, turned his character into an old man with no memory or sense of the ridiculous. Who is still standing out in some way is G.W. Bailey, but this happens mainly because of the ridiculous situations in which he ends up involved.

Technically, there isn't much to say about this film. It seeks to maintain the characteristics and visual aspect of its predecessors, with standard cinematography, conventional editing and few notable effects, in addition to the shots and some interesting situations, such as the one in which Tackleberry writes with his machine gun. Everything else is simply more of the same and doesn't deserve a specific mention. || <em>'Police Academy 6: City Under Siege'</em> - the penultimate flick of this franchise (for now?) - is as forgettable as those that precede it, it probably is objectively the weakest entry of the lot though. There isn't much to mention about it, it's mostly all been seen already in the series.

Any sparkle that I saw in the cast continues to dwindle, though that's admittedly due to newer members getting more air than the originals; at least that's how it felt. I wanted more of Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow, Marion Ramsey and Leslie Easterbrook rather than Matt McCoy & Co.

The plotline with the local mayor is alright but largely dull, especially with how obvious the supposed mystery is. That would be OK if the humour was witty, alas it is not. Winslow might not get enough screen time, but I would say his voices are more fun here than in any of the other sequels.

I confess that I was impressed when I realized that this film had not only been a resounding failure at the box office, but also highly criticized and vilified, both by specialized and amateur critics. I may be a little biased due to the fact that the film was part of my late childhood, but in truth I believe it was not worthy of such a beating. There are plenty of frankly worse movies out there, like the “Ted” movies or even “Minions”, that haven't met with as much outrage. However, I think everyone who has seen the film agrees on one point: it is weaker than the original film.

The script picks up the story where the previous film left off: the little pig won the grand prize at the fair, became very famous and made his owner famous and happy. Despite all this, he inadvertently causes an accident that leaves his owner badly injured, and all the necessary medical care leaves him almost bankrupt. In order to prevent the farm from going to auction, Esme, his wife, decides to take the pig to a contest where she can receive a fat financial prize. For that, they have to travel by plane, but things don't go as expected, and they end lost and alone in the big city, a place where many people really don't like animals at all.

Alright, the originality of the first film is gone, and the rural charm is not here. I handled it well, my concern was whether the sequel would contradict the original film or be unable to match it in quality. And the film proved to be quite solid, capable of matching its predecessor and giving us a story that follows up on previous events in a minimally credible and well-structured way. Yes, it is also a much darker film than its predecessor: the portrayal of the city is quite loaded, with the aversion to animals and the way in which they are persecuted and even killed. However, I dare to say that it corresponds to the reality, and that this film does nothing more than show that, and teach young people (the target audience of the film) to have more compassion for animals. And that, without a doubt, is a valuable message to convey.

Where I think the film really failed was in the way certain details were thought through and carried out. Ferdinand, the duck, is a very nice character, but he is misused throughout the entire film, so it would have been better to do without him if it wasn't really possible to use him better. The Pitbull character, which has great relevance at one point, is discarded very early, and it could have been better to keep it a little longer, create a subplot around it, perhaps. There are, moreover, a lot of animals and a lot of attention scattered by them without much benefit for the film. The party scene, with poor Esme dressed as a clown and hanging from a chandelier, is very funny (perhaps one of the funniest) but seems to be out of line with the rest of the film. And I also cannot help but boo the way the monkeys were used: it is quite obvious that they are a representation of black people, and this is more evident by the choice of the name Thelonious (alluding to the black jazz musician Thelonious Monk) for one of them. This is just plain racism. This may not have been the intention of the producers, they may not have thought about it, but it is quite common, in racist circles, to compare black people to monkeys, and I saw this comparison in these characters. Yes, it deserves to be booed.

Technically, the film matches its predecessor: the visuals are incredible, the design used for the sets and costumes is magnificent, the cinematography is superb and the work of the voice actors is simply impeccable. There are a lot of animatronic puppets here, and they're used in a believable way (if not as much as in the original movie). The human characters are frankly secondary: Cromwell is dropped, Mickey Rooney is one-dimensional and not particularly interesting. Even Magda Szubanski is underused. Faithful to the original film, the soundtrack continues to be based on themes of classical and opera music, to which, curiously, the song “Non Je ne Regrette Rien” by Edith Piaf has been added, the only song in both films that does not belong to the original film. to the conventional classical repertoire."

A Simple Plan is directed by Sam Raimi and adapted to screenplay by Scott Smith from his own novel of the same name. It stars Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe, Chelcie Ross and Jack Walsh. Music is by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Alar Kivilo.

The snowy wilds of Midwest America, and two brothers and one friend unearth a crashed plane in the snow that hosts one dead pilot and a duffel bag with over $4 million dollars stashed inside. It's moral quandary time. Keep the money as it's probably drug money anyway, tell the police, or sit on it and wait to see what happens? A decision is made, and it literally turns everyone's life upside down...

Scott B. Smith's novel was perfect for a filmic adaptation, in essence it's classic noir with its small town Americanna setting that houses a moral twist of fate that ultimately sees the town implode from within. How refreshing to find the author adapting his own source material, and not only that, to find that it has also gotten a grade ""A"" production from Raimi and his team.

The story is in all truth simple, it asks the characters, and us, what to do when finding so much cash? Fate meant they found it and fate then dealt its moral card, from the point the decision is made, nothing will ever be the same. The tale spins the three male characters, and one pregnant wife, into a vortex of bad decision making and misery. Enter paranoia, greed, murder, panic and a whole host of other bad things to upset the equilibrium that once dominated their mundane, but safe, lives. 

Director Raimi, who apparently received coaching from his pals Joel and Ethan Coen about how best to work in the snow (the Fargo likeness is well noted by critics), ensures the coldness of the landscape dovetails perfectly with the untangling world of the protagonists. With the frost bitten locale acting as the extra character, and as an accomplice as it happens, Raimi slots in memorable imagery to tickle away at the senses. Animals figure most darkly, with crows and a fox in the hen house beautifully endorsing the themes of decay and the need to kill to survive. While the pacing is sublime, Raimi using a slow dripping tap method that tightens the screws until violence jolts the story, and us, to the precipice.

As a character piece it's superbly mounted, where Raimi is indebted to a four pronged delivery of acting performances of some substance. Thornton was rightly lauded for his turn as the slower brother to Paxton's (excellent) all American nice guy, but Briscoe as the ""town drunk"" best friend and Fonda as the inverted femme fatale wife, also deserve great praise for realisation of characters that bring this Shakespearean neo-noir to vivid life. 

Elswhere the tech credits are thematically notable. Kivilo's photography is in sync with Raimi's ideals about the snowy backdrop playing a key part, and Elfman's score, while not something to interest potential newcomers to his work, works very well as blunderbuss percussion is replaced by appropriate woodwind that flits about the wooded surrounds with foreboding glee.

At the end of the day it comes down to quality of story telling, in that regard A Simple Plan is a first class production. If you haven't seen the film or read the novel, then I certainly would recommend the novel to read first as there are inevitable tone downs in the movie. But that is not detrimental to the film's worth, for the visual version of Smith's novel is engrossing, chilling and poignantly bleak. And away from his Indies, it's still Raimi's most accomplished film so far, and he really should consider doing more neo-noir in the future. 9/10 || ***Bleak crime drama in the wintery Minnesota woods***

Two brothers & a friend from a small town in Minnesota (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Brent Briscoe) happen upon a crashed plane in the woods, which contains over $4 million in cash. They assume it’s drug money and hatch a simple plan to sit on the money until spring when the plane is discovered; if no one legitimately claims it they’ll divvy it up. But things don’t go according to plan due to idiocy, mistrust and greed. Bridget Fonda is on hand as the main protagonist’s wife.

Directed by Sam Raimi before his ultra-success with the Spider-Man trilogy, ""A Simple Plan” (1998) was written by Scott B. Smith based on his page-turning book of the same name (there are enough changes to make both worthwhile). The wintery Minnesota setting is fitting for the bleak psychological drama. Speaking of which, the best thing about this movie is its exploration of human nature and how “the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil,” as the Bible puts it.

The movie effectively shows how basically good and normal people can be corrupted by the temptation of easy wealth; so corrupted that he or she is suddenly willing to murder, lie and connive. The story works so well because of the three well-defined characters. We’ve all met these types in real life: The wholesome, educated man who’s not quite living up to his potential and yet is generally satisfied; the loser, screw-up who’s never been with a girl even though he’s in his 40s; and the annoying redneck hick.

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Minnesota (Delano, St. Paul & Golden Valley) and Wisconsin (Ashland).

GRADE: A- || Yikes, talk about money being the root of all evil! ""Hank"" (Bill Paxton), brother ""Jacob"" (Billy Bob Thornton) and their friend ""Lou"" (Brent Briscoe) are out hunting in the snowy wilderness when they discover the wreck of a plane. The pilot's corpse is still at the controls but they are more interested in the contents of a sports bag. It's got over $4m in it! What to do? Hand it in? Put it back? Keep it? Well the whole story is set against a backdrop of a less attractive American dream with a paucity of opportunity for any of these men. ""Hank"" will soon be a father and ""Jacob"" is determined to reclaim a family farm that was foreclosed upon years earlier. Decision made! Initially they are organised and disciplined. No splashing the cash, taking things responsibly and keeping under the radar - but gradually that disciple starts to crack. Not least because the expecting ""Sarah"" (Bridget Fonda) is conceivably even more determined to use the cash than the men who found it. Pressures begin to build, trusts begin to fray and some newspaper clippings inform them a little more of the likely source of their windfall. With the arrival of the FBI - well things turn sour on just about every level. It's Thornton who takes the plaudits here with an understated effort as probably the most principled of the men but all three work well together, with the increasingly Fonda stoking the fire, and though maybe just a little drastically far-fetched towards the end, this is quite a telling story of just what people might be prepared to do to better their lot. It's setting amidst the cold and darkness coupled with a rather benign small-town mentality (especially amongst local law enforcement) serves the scenario effectively as a sleepy town where nothing much ever happens starts to resemble something from an horror film. It's carefully written with little excess dialogue cluttering up a story of bad choices eliciting even worse ones, and is well worth a couple of hour."

He receives an urgent call from Admiral Dougherty about Data, that was sent on an observation mission of the Ba'Ku race. The Federation has installed there a hidden outpost and the So'Na race is there too. Data has gone out of control and reveals the federation outpost to the natives. Picard and his senior officers get on the planet to discuss with them to surrender the Federation personnel.

He is welcomed by the (extremely) peaceful Ba'Ku that are represented by Anji and Sojef, that explain the history and philosophy of their people. They have settled on this planet generations ago and have benefited from a local radiation extending their life greatly.
Picard is pushed by Dougherty to leave the planet to let the ""observation"" mission without interference. Picard smells deception and will have to disobey orders to defend one of the Federation's basic principles.
I know most people don't like this movie and rank it low among the Star trek movies. Of course there's not much action and fights. The new characters are either very boring or too obviously ""evil"". 

But the main point here is to defend the ""prime directive"" (= not to interfere in the development of a civilization that is inferior in technology. There is not much else here than a deep analysis of what the Federation is and when it must or not intervene. So there's a light love story wit Picard and Anij, Data befriends a kid in his discovery of humanity's young age behavior.

After many movies about the Klingons, Romulans ... I found it fresh to have two (?) new races with different histories and ways of life. And having the movie centered on the ""prime directive"", and how a cunning race can twist it (after all, the Ba'Ku are not really ""natives"" of the planet and shouldn't be protected by the prime directive), and how one superior officer, if misleaded, can lead to eradication of hundreds of people. || The least of the four Next Generation films, but has its highlights  

Released in 1998 and directed by Jonathan Frakes, ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" is the third Star Trek film featuring the Next Generation cast and ninth overall. The plot revolves around a serene alien race, the Ba'ku, whose planet offers regenerative radiation and therefore extremely long lifespans; moreover, they live in harmony with their environment and reject advanced technology. With the aid of an alien race called the Son'a, the Federation secretly (deceptively) researches the Ba'ku culture, but the Son'a intend to take the planet for themselves and others who secretly want to regenerate their bodies (i.e. drink of the 'Fountain of Youth'). The problem is that Captain Picard and the Enterprise-E crew are loyal to the Prime Directive.

The plot is good with some interesting ideas, like the paradisal planet where immortality is nigh reality and the innate desire for regeneration and eternal life. I like the new black Federation uniforms and the cast is as likable as ever. Unfortunately, something prevents the movie from soaring. It's decent and sometimes thought-provoking; it's just underwhelming with some bits falling flat. I like it but, for me, it’s the least of the four TNG films.

The film runs 103 minutes and was shot in California at Convict Lake, Mammoth Lakes Park; San Gabriel Dam, Angeles National Forest; Lake Sherwood; Bishop; and Paramount Studios, Los Angeles.

GRADE: B- || I just never warmed to the ""Next Generation"" crew and here they did little to improve that feeling. It all begins with the most annoying of them all - the android ""Data"" (Brent Spiner) going a bit rogue in an ostensibly peaceful, and tech-free, settlement. What's afoot? Well after a space-chase and some Gilbert and Sullivan we discover that the Federation and the smooth-skinned ""Son'a"" have joined forces to capitalise on some curative radiation that emanates from the planet. Thing is, by harnessing this phenomena they will render the place uninhabitable - so what to do with the locals (all 600 of them)? It seems our singing ""Data"" has cottoned on to this and it isn't long before ""Picard"" (Patrick Stewart) and the rest of his charm-free crew are en route to save the day. It picks up slightly for the last twenty minutes which at least gives us some phaser action, but otherwise it's all pretty turgid and dialogue heavy. The Captain manages a little bit of frankly rather cloying love interest with Donna Murphy's ""Anij"" and there is the obligatory child with his small creature too. F. Murray Abraham and Anthony Zerbe tried their best as the conspiring powers-that-be, but there is simply no jeopardy here at all. Messrs. Shatner et al had charisma - even if their stories were often just as weak, but this shower lack that on-screen presence and the (not so) subliminal pontificating just got on my nerves. At just under 1¾ hours it looks like a two-part episode from the series and no amount of Viagra is going to get this insurrection going, sorry."

And then it beat Bulworth for best screen play.

That was sort of enough to turn my head. Both of them? Bulworth was far from best picture worthy, but best original screenplay seemed as much as a shoe in as Ryan for Best Picture.

And then it went on to win Best score over Mulan, A Bug's Life, and Prince of Egypt which is curious because it didn't really fit the criteria for Musical or Comedy Score as much as it's competition.

And then now, looking back, who remembers it? If it's remembered at all, it's remembered for beating Saving Private Ryan, which has become a classic.

Shakespeare in Love is just remembered for it's sweep of the awards, both at the Oscars and beyond, but not for its quality. || Set during the later reign of Engand's Queen Elizabeth, this joyful drama sees poor old William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) having a bit of a creative drought. Lacking ideas and cash, and being pursued by both Richard Burbage (Martin Clunes) and the wonderfully dead pan Geoffrey Rush as Philip Henslowe for work he's supposed to have already penned, things are looking a bit bleak. When Gwyneth Paltrow, an ardent theatre fan prohibited from taking to the stage by virtue of her sex, dresses as ""Thomas Kent"" and auditions for a part, he sees through the disguise quickly and his creative juices once again begin to flow... Snag is, she ""Viola de Lesseps"" is engaged to the poverty stricken ""Lord Wessex"" (Colin Firth) and Virginia bound - as soon as he can raise the dowry from her father... What ensues is a rapid-fire, lightly comical, romantic drama that sees quite a collection of acting talents contributing well to the ensemble effect of this story. Fiennes shines as the playwright in trouble - frequently - as do Paltrow, Rush, a surprisingly effective Ben Affleck, Imelda Staunton as her worldly-wise nurse with Jim Carter as the onstage version of that persona and Barnaby Kay as the mischievous little ""Nol"". The costumes and sets are magnificent; the writing from Marc Norman and the newly knighted Sir Tom Stoppard is witty and stimulating - cleverly incorporating quite a bit of the original bard's efforts into their screenplay as they go. It would have been easily possible for this embarrassment of acting riches to have overwhelmed this story, but John Madden keeps all pulling well in the same direction. The film will doubtless be remembered more as Dame Judi Dench's consolation Oscar (for not winning for ""Mrs. Brown"" the year earlier), and as far as they go her performances are fine - but there is much more to this story of the trials and tribulations of a bard in love. A wee bit long, it seems to end more than once, but it is still a story the eponymous writer himself might well have enjoyed."

Anyway, that weather overwhelms them and things look distinctly hypothermic until a great star arrives in the heavens and next thing they are being fêted by ""Dooley"" (John Barrard) in the most beautiful toy factory in the world. He is now to be called ""Santa"" and his job will be to deliver these presents to children all over the planet. Luckily they have a sprinkling of magic dust to doctor the food of not just his own reindeers, but of a few others too and decades now pass uneventfully. As more and more people learn to write, though, the demands on him become increasingly onerous, indeed the poor soul is frankly a bit knackered. An assistant! That's the answer. Two of his elves vie for the position but it's ""Patch"" (Dudley Moore) who develops and automated production line and emerges victorious. Thing is, his products are cheap and cheerful - they break and soon he is out on his pointy ear and working with disgraced toy manufacturer ""BZ"" (a well over-the-top John Lithgow). The naive ""Patch"" is only trying to regain the affection of ""Santa"". His new business partner is looking to make a mint. Has ""Patch"" got his priorities right? Perhaps ""Santa"" has some growing up to do, too? This is a gently entertaining Christmas tale that allows Moore to showcase a little of his comedy acting skills, but generally the rest of it is all a rather thinly-veiled swipe at the rise of commercialism and the throw-away culture. Christian Fitzpatrick is quite engaging as the urchin ""Joe"" and those with eagle eyes might spot Melvyn Hayes and Don Estelle (famed for the BBC sitcom ""Ain't Half Hot Mum"") but I found the narrative to be just a little too repetitive and it certainly made me glad I never liked candy cane. It's still fun, but like the gifts he made themselves, I wonder how many kids nowadays would get anything from the charming simplicity of this film?"

The opening to Pale Rider is just excellent, at first all is calm and serene, but then the peace is shattered by the thundering of hooves. A group of men employed by Coy LaHood, tear thru a small mining community, shooting guns and trampling over all in their way. During this callous act of bullying, one of the men shoots and kills young Megan's dog. When Megan buries her beloved pet, she calls to god to send someone to help them against the greedy LaHood, because LaHood is intent on stripping the locals of their claims, and he literally will stop at nothing to get them. Later on Megan is reading from the bible, she reads aloud to her mother about ""beholding a pale horse and that the man who sat on it was death"", we then see a lone horseman riding towards this under fire place...

Behold the pale horse because the man that sat on him was Clint Eastwood! And that's all you really want to know as regards what drives the film on. It had been quite some time since the movie watching world had witnessed a damn good Western, so it is obvious that Eastwood, knowing the genre inside out, felt it time to remind all and sundry about this engrossing genre and all its little peccadilloes. Riffing on his own High Plains Drifter from 1973 and homaging Shane in the process, Eastwood again uses supernatural leanings to play out this intriguing tale. Pale Rider works well because Eastwood cares for the genre so much, no frame is wasted and the acting on show delivers the necessary amount of quality to enhance the picture's impact. From the thundering opening to the gorgeous final shot, Pale Rider is an expertly crafted Western that still holds up today as a great entry on Eastwoods CV. Pale Rider. 8/10 || This is a good'un.

<em>'Pale Rider'</em> features an enjoyable story featuring the gold rush, while the characters are all solid - Clint Eastwood gives a strong performance in the lead role, though I would've liked to have seen more of John Russell and his character.

1368.0,First Blood,"When former Green Beret John Rambo is harassed by local law enforcement and arrested for vagrancy, he is forced to flee into the mountains and wage an escalating one-man war against his pursuers.",This time he's fighting for his life.,"Action, Adventure, Thriller, War",93,1982-10-22,en,7.5,6506,7.4128,"Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Brian Dennehy, Bill McKinney, Jack Starrett",Ted Kotcheff,"prison, guerrilla warfare, dying and death, vietnam war, vietnam veteran, hero, vietnam, police brutality, sheriff, escape, police, gun, submachine gun, falsely accused, anti hero, destroy, self-defense, firearm, prosecution, attempt to escape, police operation, matter of life and death, tramp, national guard, woods, rural area, survivalist, special forces","It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo. It's all in the past now.  

First Blood is directed by Ted Kotcheff and adapted by Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone, from the novel written by David Morrell. It stars Stallone, Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna, Bill McKinney and Jack Starrett. Cinematography is by Andrew Laszlo and the music scored by Jerry Goldsmith. Locations for the shoot were in British Columbia.

John Rambo (Stallone), ex Vietnam war veteran, wanders into small town Oregon and is met with hostility by Sheriff Will Teasle (Dennehy). Arrested for a trumped up charge of vagrancy, Rambo is subjected to rough house treatment by Teasle and his staff. Fuelled by the haunted images of his time in Vietnam, Rambo breaks out of custody and makes for the hills, with Teasle and the force in hot pursuit. But this is terrain made for Rambo, an expert soldier trained to survive and kill, it's a war, Rambo versus the rest.

The character of John Rambo would slip into pop culture and forever be associated with cartoon excess. By his own admission, Stallone himself felt they dropped the ball after the original film, and he's right. However, First Blood is often wrongly lumped in as part of that excessive package, because it's a film well worthy of revisits to see just how well it holds up as a taut and tense thriller. A film led by the bold theme of showing just how badly some of America's soldiers were received upon returning from Vietnam. First Blood delves deeper into the psyche of one such soldier whilst casting a caustic eye over small town Americana. The makers rarely let up on the troubling thematics at work, developing Rambo with clinical strokes as the plot unfolds, the trick in the tail being that the audience are firmly on his side as he goes about bringing his Vietnam to the picturesque place the locals call home. By 1982, it seems, America was on the side of the soldier.

Stallone is a perfect fit for the role, his physicality unquestionable, he brings the brood and pain to Rambo like few actors of his ilk ever could. The sarcastic may point to his lack of dialogue hardly constituting a great acting performance, that's rot, because this is a fine character portrayal by Stallone. Dennehy is on fine form as the brutish bully Sheriff who just couldn't leave Rambo alone, while in the support ranks McKinney and Starrett leave good impressions. The interesting casting comes with Crenna as Rambo's ""maker"", Col. Samuel Trautman. The role was Kirk Douglas' hook line and sinker, but he wanted a different script and insisted that the film end the same way as the novel. In the end the makers just couldn't give in to his requests and he walked at the last minute. In stepped Crenna to put a bit of father figure pathos into Trautman, and subsequently earning himself a three picture deal and a place in pop culture in the process.

It's also a film that's photographed with great skill by Lazlo. He captures the British Columbia mountains and forests with beautiful scope, but in keeping with the tone of the film his colour palette is suitably grey and green. Goldsmith provides an effective score, particularly when the narrative is focusing on Rambo's alienation, while the stunt work is very impressive. Even if we drift away from the theme of the piece, it still works extremely well as an action movie drama, be it motorcycle/helicopter pursuits, or jungle warfare, First Blood pumps the blood frequently. All neatly constructed by the director of Weekend at Bernie's! On release it grabbed the attention and became a monster box office hit Worldwide, today it still stands as a damn great movie, and you know what? Stallone and co were right and Kirk Douglas was wrong. 9/10 || **_Action/adventure masterpiece about a one-man-army_**

Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into a Rocky Mountain town looking for a war buddy, only to learn that he died due to exposure to Agent Orange the prior summer. The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and winds up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army, who takes on both the police and the National Guard using jungle warfare tactics.

""First Blood"" (1982) is an action/adventure of the first order. It's easy to lose sight of this in light of the two comic book sequels that made a caricature of John Rambo: ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985) and ""Rambo III"" (1988). Thankfully, the series made up for it with the outstanding ""Rambo"" in 2008, which is grim, gritty and deep.

The Great Northwest locations are picturesque, albeit drizzly and dreary, while Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western ""Silverado"" (1985) albeit his character in that film is even worse.

Stallone is in his physically prime here, although he's not quite as bulked-up as in the two sequels. His waist is only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing ""First Blood"" is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape or get in better shape.

Stallone is outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally lets out all his pent-up rage by screaming out: ""Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!""

I'm not normally into DVD commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition DVD by writer David Morrell is very worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the movie set many precedents in the action/adventure genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of motion pictures, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.

It doesn't matter how many times you've seen ""First Blood."" The film has such a captivating anointing you'll be spellbound from start to finish every time. If you’re a sucker for lost-in-the-woods/survival pictures ""First Blood"" is a must.

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in beautiful Hope and Golden Ears Provincial Park, British Columbia.

GRADE: A || Sylvester Stallone Is ""John Rambo"", a Vietnam War veteran who is shocked to learn that the only other survivor from his crack team of Green Berets has died of a pretty pernicious cancer. He wanders aimlessly looking for a cheeseburger when he is escorted out of town by the sheriff ""Will Teasle"" (Brian Dennehy), who takes him for a vagrant. When he tries to come back into town, he is arrested and that sets off a chain of events that ends up pitting him against not just a rather brutal collection of local law enforcement, but ultimately the pretty useless national guard and his old CO ""Trautman"" (Richard Crenna). There is certainly a serious message here. This man has served his country at no small risk to himself, he even has a Congressional Medal of Honour, but has been pretty much abandoned by his government. We learn fairly early on that he has clearly been traumatised by his wartime experiences and the hostile behaviour of the local cops serves to rekindle his serious ninja skills in self-defence that quickly - though reluctantly - became self-offence. The action scenes set amongst the cold, wet and dense forest are tautly directed and quite compelling to watch, but I am afraid the acting is pretty poor. Crenna is about as wooden as one of the stakes ""Rambo"" uses to impale his pursuers, and the ""Teasle"" character just doesn't add up. We start the film with him behaving in a friendly and neighbourly way as might befit a local policeman, but after the most minimal exposure to his visitor, he turns into a violently obsessed man. Why? There is no backstory to this - and as the manhunt proceeds, and concludes, the story itself makes less and less sense. It's quite short and the first half is good, but afterwards it just slips into the ridiculous with an ending full of impressive pyrotechnics but little more substantial than a warning that we ought to expect a sequel."

Rambo: First Blood Part II is directed by George Pan Cosmatos and collectively written by David Morrell, Kevin Jarre (characters), Sylvester Stallone and James Cameron. It stars Stallone, Richard Crenna, Charles Napier, Steven Berkoff, Julia Nickson and Martin Kove. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Jack Cardiff. 

The sequel to 1982's First Blood, this finds Vietnam Veteran John Rambo released from prison on proviso he undertakes a special mission back into Vietnam to find proof of American POWs still being illegally held captive there...

OK! It's all very implausible and cartoon like, and of course now it's very un-PC, pulsing with stereotypes and indicative of the Reagan era 1980s. It also lacks the character depth of the first film, reducing Rambo, the scarred and bitter war veteran at the iconic core of the franchise, to merely being a robotic killing machine. However, it's an action fan's dream, where even as the flag waving patriotic fervour hangs heavy, it's an explosive pic that thrills and excites from first frame till last. 7.5/10 || _**Comic book action flick about Rambo going back to Vietnam**_

The imprisoned Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is offered a mission by Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) to go back to his old stomping grounds in ’Nam to see if there are any living American POWs. Charles Napier, Martin Kove, Julia Nickson and Steven Berkoff are included in the peripheral cast. 

“Rambo: First Blood Part II” (1985) contains what you would want from a Rambo flick: A muscular protagonist, a one-man-army scenario, a noble cause and loads of action, particular of the jungle warfare variety. It also has a quality cast, fabulous locations and a moving score. 

Unfortunately it’s marred by a glaring comic book vibe that spurs chuckles throughout, which is disappointing for fans of the outstanding first film. However, if you can acclimate, “Rambo II” can be enjoyed as a serious adventure, albeit thoroughly comic booky. It’s entertaining for what it is, but it’s my least favorite of the franchise. The next movie (1988) is more-of-the-same, albeit set in Afghanistan.

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Mexico (Guerrero, Sierra Madre del Sur de Chiapas & Sierra Madre del Sur de Oaxaca).

“Rambo III” (1988) contains what you would want from a Rambo flick: A muscular protagonist, a one-man-army scenario, a noble cause and loads of action. It also has a quality cast, fabulous locations and a good score. 

Playing like a Conan the Barbarian adventure set in the modern day, it has a comic book vibe like the previous film, but not as bad. Everything works for an action/adventure flick until the last 15 minutes when it’s burdened by one too many action scenes. The strange thing about movie action is that too much of it becomes boring. That’s the case here with the final act.  

Just so there’s no misunderstanding, Rambo was NOT fighting for what became the Taliban. Rambo Meets a man named Masoud, the wise leader of the Mujahadeen who are fighting the Soviets. This character was named after a notable Mujahadeen commander of the Northern Alliance, Ahmad Shah Massoud, who fought against both the Taliban & Al Qaeda. Massoud warned the Euro leaders about Bin Laden and was assassinated by Al Qaeda on September 9, 2001, two days before the September 11th Attack.

My ranking of the Rambo movies is as follows: First Blood, Rambo IV, Last Blood, Rambo III and Rambo II. Only the first two are great, but the other three have their points of interest for action/adventure fans.

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in Chiang Mai, Thailand; Arizona; and Israel.

GRADE: B-/C+ || The expression ""flogging a dead horse"" comes to mind with this unnecessary and unremarkable trequel. This time our reclusive, eponymous, hero (Sylvester Stallone) has to relocate from idyllic Thailand to war-torn Afghanistan - amidst the Soviet invasion! Why? Well his erstwhile CO ""Trautman"" (Richard Crenna) has managed to get himself captured whilst leading a covert operation to supply some tribal rebels. ""Rambo"" has to get his skates on, though, because Uncle Sam is denying all knowledge of this clandestine operation and chances are that the prisoner won't last very long under the tender mercies of ""Zaysen"" (Marc de Jonge - presumably, Steven Berkoff was busy?). There is plenty of traditional action, loads of pyrotechnics and firefights but the plot is predictable - almost propagandist; the dialogue really rather banal and the whole thing seems to be little more than a stop-gap enterprise to keep the franchise momentum going while Stallone and the team concoct something more substantial for the next outing.

This adventure takes for ever to get going, but once it does it offers us a colourful and entertaining enough series of set-piece escapades with a beat-heavy synthesised score that works hard to compensate for some really inane dialogue from both. Kidnapper DeVito (""Ralph"") amiably steals the scenes he features in, as the story builds to a suitably perilous - and predictable - denouement with big creepy insects, a waterfall, car chases - and everyone gets wet a lot. You get the drift. It's fine to pass an afternoon and there is some chemistry between the two, but it's all a bit of a pale imitation now and the comedic elements have not aged very well either. || I guess I was a bit more impressed with the leads in this movie than the other reviewer here, for I think they held up their end of a story that is, if anything, even more of a take-off on action movies that the Raider franchise.

It is fluff, of course, with odd violence offsetting what is a rather gentle adventure. Good luck finding it on one of the streaming services out there. It is for sale or rent only at this time. I had a chance to watch it free, however, as I wasn’t about to buy or rent it.

A writer of romantic adventure in Manhattan (Turner) goes to Columbia to save her sister, who’s been kidnapped by shady cousins (Danny DeVito and Zack Norman). She meets an exotic bird smuggler (Douglas) who helps her evade a corrupt colonel (Alfonso Arau) and his military police. 

“Romancing the Stone” (1984) came in the wake of the success of “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” It’s an entertaining flick that effectively walks the balance beam between serious adventure and fun storytelling. Unfortunately, it jumps the shark at the midway point with the drug lord’s carefree, happy attitude as he helps Joan & Jack escape Col. Zolo & his military goons while barely evading deadly machine gun fire. Why so gleeful when they could all die at any moment? Why so merry when he's now targeted as an enemy of the state and they will seize his nice hacienda? Let's just say, he'll never be able to go home again.

It's bad writing, which is a shame because the flick was amusingly thrilling up to that point. Then it became eye-rolling and boring.

Nevertheless, the locations are great, the interplay between Turner and Douglas is entertaining, and there are a lot of (shallow) thrills. Too bad practically the entire second half makes it forgettable fluff. A sequel followed the next year, “The Jewel of the Nile.”

It runs 1 hour, 45 minutes, and was shot in Snow Canyon, Utah (the opening); New York City; and everything else in areas near Mexico City or east of there, specifically Veracruz (the old stone fort), Huasca de Ocampo, Xalapa, El Arenal, Tonaya, Xico, Barraca Grande, and the Valle de Silencio; interiors were done in the studio in Mexico City.

On the surface ""Cocoon"" (1985) is about elderly folks at a retirement home in Florida unknowingly finding the ""fountain of youth"" via a pool on an adjacent property. A peculiar group of people rent the property to store boulder-like objects they take from the bottom of the ocean. As such, the pool acquires healing powers and restore's the old folk's youthful vigor.

Steve Guttenberg stars as the likable protagonist, the boat owner/operator who helps the people get to the objects in the ocean, but he has no idea what's really going on. The stunning Tahnee Welch, Raquel's daughter, plays one of the members of the peculiar group to whom Guttenberg's character takes a liking. Unlike Raquel, who's known for being a bit biyatchy, Tahnee shines with a winsome disposition. Brian Dennehy is also on hand as the leader of the odd group, and he does very well.

Most great movies have a deeper subtext, and so it is with ""Cocoon."" The story is a commentary on aging, death, grieving and the yearning for eternal life. The people of the peculiar group are types of angels or, better yet, the redeemed in glorified bodies. What they offer is the gospel, the key to eternal life in the ""new heavens and new earth, the home of righteousness"" (2 Peter 3:13). By ""the redeemed in glorified bodies"" I'm referring to the glorious bodies that are promised to believers at the time of their bodily resurrection (1 Cor. 15:42-44); these bodies will be imperishable, powerful and spiritual (not carnal) in nature. Believers will be able to defy gravity with these new bodies, walk through doors and teleport from one place to another, all of which can be observed in Jesus Christ after his resurrection.

Needless to say, ""Cocoon"" has an incredible subtext. But it's not necessary to get so deep. This is just an entertaining movie with a good heart. More than that, it's inspiring. On the downside, the final act is overextended and should've been trimmed down.

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in the Clearwater/St. Petersburg area of Florida with the underwater scenes done in the Bahamas.

GRADE: A- || **It deserves to be remembered nowadays.**

I think the 80's were, maybe, the golden age of alien movies. Between comedies or horror films, the quality is quite satisfactory and there is plenty to choose from. This film is, however, one of the least known, perhaps due to the light way in which everything was approached, and it has even fallen into unfair oblivion today. For me, it was a movie that worked better precisely because of that, not least because I'm not a particularly big fan of alien movies.

The film, in fact, is a very light and familiar comedy, pleasant and not made to think too much, nor to be an award-winning film. I really got the feeling that it was an unpretentious project that, at the time, gave very good results, having even won two Oscars, for Best Visual Effects and Best Supporting Actor (for veteran Don Ameche).

The script is quite simple: a group of friendly old timers from a nursing home, who have the habit of visiting the pool of a neighboring abandoned mansion, have just discovered that their new owners have mysteriously changed the water with gigantic stones from the bottom of the sea: now, in addition to being warm, the water seems to have the ability to restore their youthful vitality and health. What they don't know is that the stones are, in fact, emergency pods left by an alien civilization that had an exploration base in the sea, nearby, which we learned to call Atlantis... and that the new owners of the abandoned house they are really aliens from a rescue team that came to collect the pods left behind thousands of years ago.

The film has a great cast that includes venerable names such as Don Ameche, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy, Wilford Brimley and Jack Gilford. In fact, and despite the merits of younger actors like Steve Guttenberg and Brian Dennehy, it is a film made to allow veteran actors a good opportunity to shine and show that age is numbers. I think I won't be exaggerating if I say that everyone enjoyed the film well and showed that they are doing very well, and that talent doesn't fade with age. I especially liked Brimley and Stapleton. Guttenberg has done better in other films, and Tahnee Welch doesn't do very well here either.

On a technical level, it's a very well-made film: the cinematography extracts the best of the sunny and seemingly paradisiacal environments of the places where the film was made, and the visual and special effects used fulfill their role in the film very well. We might even think that there are some cheap clichés, like the light on the boat, or the flying saucer, but as I said above, it's a light film, and we're only being unfair or overly demanding if we think about things like that. The soundtrack was in charge of James Horner, with whom Howard will make a series of films, and fulfills his role very well, without much fuss."

Daniel Petrie decided to take a film that was successful and acquired a certain affection and make a poor sequel. I think almost everyone knows that a sequel to a good movie is almost never as good as the original movie... it could be a cliché, but the truth is that it is something so common that it has become something to watch. Besides, for studios, it's a good way to make money without considerable effort or a big capital draw.

What this film offers us is, in short, more of the same, but without any charm. The film leans against the shadow of the predecessor's success and peacefully slumbers in the belief that we will like it because we liked the first film. It didn't work for me. The only thing that makes this movie really worthwhile is the fact that it reunites most of its predecessor's cast. It's worth seeing some of the shenanigans of Don Ameche, Wilford Brimey, Maureen Stapleton and Jack Gilford. You can tell they're having a lot of fun with the project, and that the film, even if it's not brilliant, allowed them to revisit characters they enjoyed playing. The movie works reasonably well thanks to this, and the older cast almost have their own separate sub-plot, but the movie loses out by not going beyond that, thanks to a rather weak script. Steve Guttenberg, for example, is even more uninteresting here than he was in the original film, which is really something relevant. Technically, the film doesn't make any major mistakes or flaws, but it isn't particularly brilliant."

I mean, what happened? How did everything that was so good get so bad?

*** This review contains spoilers ***

Rocky is reigning World Champion and is dispatching all comers to his crown with ease. But looming in the distance is Clubber Lang, a young and hungry boxer intent on becoming the new champ.

Pretty safe enjoyment for anyone into the fantastical world of Sly Stallone's Rocky Balboa franchise. Into the narrative this time comes a new boxer, portrayed with relish by Mr. T, a revelation that cuts Rocky to the quick, and personal grief when his mentor and friend Mickey (Burgess Meredith) dies (Stallone doing brilliant believable grief). Back comes Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, only this time he wants to train Rocky to beat the mighty Clubber Lang. Rocky's heart isn't in it though! Can he get that Eye of the Tiger back? Well of course he can and thus we get the obligatory training montages and a ferocious fight to crown the story.

It's comfortable film making with comfortable acting performances and it's often very exciting as well. 7/10 || OK, fair play would have to say that Rocky I and II were better films... but this had Mr. T in it and given that he was one of my childhood favorites I feel horrible not giving it 10 of 10.

It was a decent film and Mr. T does a great bad guy (even though the kid in me hates to see him in a villainous role). And we get Action Jackson back, which always makes it feel like a Rocky film.

Where this differs from I and II is in the characters... they don't take much time to develop them further. The plot is centered almost entirely around the fight and that kind of makes me miss the depth of the first two... however, it is just as inspiring, it is just as motivating, and in a way that only Rocky films can really pull off.

And again we get to see Rocky as the perpetual underdog that has to fight and struggle and only rises to the top through will power and hard work... and that, the concept of a hero that has to struggle, is missed in modern movies. || While Rocky III may have the weakest story of the series thus far, it is still able to create unique and believable obstacles for Rocky Balboa as he nears the end of his boxing career.

To start off, the acting is very inconsistent in this film. Our leads, Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, and Carl Weathers, do an excellent job and improve with each entry. But our antagonist (Mr. T) is bad. He does not get very much screen time, and when he does, he is spouting generic lines in his weird-tempo talk. He was physically intimidating but lacked the emotional ferocity that Rocky and Apollo possessed.

The story is the weakest, but it still manages to deliver great moments of depth and character progression for our protagonist. It takes similar themes from the last film (lack of confidence and external pressures) and spins them on their head to create unique challenges for Rocky. The film starts off with a pretty rocking montage of Rocky’s boxing career as he racks up knockout after knockout. But with his discovery that the opponents were hand-picked by his management, Rocky finds himself in a downward spiral. He becomes that bum from Philly that he always was, and no matter how much success, money, and fame he gets, that past will always creep itself into his thoughts. After Mickey's somewhat rushed and cringe-worthy death, this conflict brings Apollo Creed back into his life. It is here that the two's dynamic blossoms, and we see Rocky earn Creed's respect. It was a great full circle moment and a fantastic way to lead us into the film's climax.

The score is still great, as the iconic Rocky theme echoes through various versions depending on the scenario. Eye of the Tiger was an excellent addition, and I had no idea Stallone requested this song be made for this movie. It seems as if every song that rings through Rocky’s halls turns to gold.

The cinematography is great once again, and Stallone proves that he has an excellent eye behind the camera by being able to film the boxing scenes very well. The pacing is superb, with the film being twenty minutes shorter than the previous two entries, which I quite enjoyed.

Overall, Rocky III is my least favorite film in the franchise but is still a great addition to the franchise. I envy those who were able to experience the fandom in the theaters during the 1970s and 1980s.

1367.0,Rocky II,"After Rocky goes the distance with champ Apollo Creed, both try to put the fight behind them and move on. Rocky settles down with Adrian but can't put his life together outside the ring, while Creed seeks a rematch to restore his reputation. Soon enough, the ""Master of Disaster"" and the ""Italian Stallion"" are set on a collision course for a climactic battle that is brutal and unforgettable.",Once he fought for a dream. Now he's fighting for love!,Drama,120,1979-06-15,en,7.278,4532,4.3104,"Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith",Sylvester Stallone,"hero, husband wife relationship, coma, transporter, love of one's life, intensive care, sports, publicity, boxer, training, world champion, victory, hospital, boxing, cheerful, powerful","There's one thing I want you to do for me.

After pushing champ Apollo Creed all the way in their title fight, Rocky Balboa retires from the ring and basks in gallant loser glory. However, he soon finds he is down on his luck and accepts a challenge to a rematch with the ever irate Apollo Creed, something that is much to the chagrin of Adrian.

Judging by the rating and some of the comments on the net, it would seem that I like this sequel more than most, but I honestly feel this is a worthy sequel to the first (and rightly much beloved) film. It still has credibility at its heart (something that would vanish as each further cash in sequel was trundled out), and crucially, it still has enough rags to riches nuance to keep the audience in its palm.

For sure it's guilty of over sentiment at times, Adrian is now the ever loving wife, here pregnant and an authoritative voice in Rocky's life. Yet this continues the emotional heartbeat from the first film, there is, when all is said and done, a quite beautiful romance at the core of the early Rocky movies. Rocky 2 extends that and utilises it to its benefit. When Adrian, after rousing from a coma, tells the big Italian tank to go win, it's akin to some President or Prime Minister declaring ""we shall not be defeated"", it's inspiring stuff, and of course it sets the wheels in motion for ultimate training and the mother of all punch ups with Apollo Creed. And of course Stallone, again writing and directing, gets to deliver the alternate ending from the first film.

Fanciful and safe it be, but Stallone closed down the 70s with a biff bang ball of strained sinews and heroic testosterone. This is unadulterated entertainment to enjoy with a good pint of blood and a roast ox burning on the spit. 8/10 || I haven't seen Creed yet, either of them, and that has me concerned mainly because I hadn't even heard of them until after they were released. So I can't weigh in on all the Rocky movies just yet...

... But Rocky II is what I consider to be the last real Rocky movie. That doesn't mean I don't like the others, but it means that there was a dynamic shift for the series after II.

I and II were heavy on the characters and relationships in the universe (although Creed was under-developed in I). In Rocky II they make up for that and you get to know Creed as someone who is a pompous and arrogant poser on the surface and a much deeper and respectable character underneath. And that other side to him comes out in the final bout. He's deeper than just flash, and Action Jackson did a stellar job at portraying that in a way that was essentially nonverbal at the end. It's actually a very enjoyable performance

It's also a performance that rounds his character off to the point where you can believe he did what he did in Rocky III. It adds nicely to Adrian (who after II became a regrettable side character), Paulie, and Mickey.

In the end what you have is the last great Rocky character film before the franchise drifts away to highlight boxing, only to come back to it's roots in Balboa. || Rocky II is an incredibly worthy sequel to the 1976 hit.

The story picks up immediately after the conclusion of the first fight and follows Rocky as he tries to cope with his new-found fame and return to normalcy. I found this aspect to be incredibly impactful. He has very little to offer the white-collar world, forcing him to return to a life of menial labor with only one true dream: to fight again. The true conflict of the film is between the internal desire to fight and provide versus the external pressures to retire. It is in this fight that we dive deeper into the psyche of Rocky. He is a broken and unconfident man, wanting to be more and do more. But the only talent he has is fighting. The journey to this realization may be slow at times, but the payoff is totally worth it. Once the fight is set and Rocky is committed, the movie takes off and never lands. The final fight sequence was intense and invigorating—one of the best sports cinema experiences I have ever had.

The acting is much better in this film, which is bolstered by an improved script. Sylvester Stallone is excellent here, and his chemistry with Talia Shire is superb. The two really come into their own with these characters and step out as the true leads to the franchise. Even though the script is better with more digestible dialogue, the overall screenplay is slightly weaker. The story of the first film is perfect and nearly impossible to replicate.

Overall, this movie is excellent. It does everything a sequel needs to do and nearly surpasses its predecessor.

1374.0,Rocky IV,"After Apollo Creed is killed by Ivan Drago in a match, Rocky Balboa becomes depressed and becomes determined to get revenge.",He's facing the ultimate challenge. And fighting for his life.,Drama,91,1985-11-21,en,7.083,4564,5.583,"Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Carl Weathers, Talia Shire, Burt Young","Sylvester Stallone, Sylvester Stallone","dying and death, friendship, transporter, sports, loss of loved one, cold war, soviet union, boxer, kgb, training, victory, matter of life and death, loss of powers, revenge, siberia, christmas, boxing, powerful","**The greatest Rocky movie? I think it could be.**

It's hard to pick a favorite Rocky movie, but Rocky IV definitely makes its case for first place. The epic showdown with Ivan Drago drips with emotion, heart, and motivation in ways the other movies can't match. Add the restless conflict between USA and Russia at the time, and it just doesn't get better. Getting the final fight perfect was so crucial that Sylvester Stallone recommended actually boxing and ended up in the hospital after getting knocked out by Dolph Lundgren. Ivan Drago is, without a doubt, the franchise's best villain. The development of Rocky and Apollo's relationship in Rocky IV is a beautiful credit to excellent writing and four movies worth of growth. The added Christmas spirit gives the film more character. If you had to watch only one Rocky, I would say pick this one, but it's only as great as it is because it stands on the shoulders of the movies that came before. || I liked it and then I didn't like it and now I like it again. I have a serious love/hate relationship with this one.

The hate comes from Rocky and Rocky II and a little bit, just a little from Rocky III. This was a film focused more on the fight than the Rocky story and, just like Rocky III, and, honestly, I miss the heartfelt Rocky family part of the franchise.

Mickey, Creed, Adrian, Paulie, they were the real heart behind what made the Rocky movies great and.... this focused more on the fight.

However, it was inspirational and that is what you ultimately sit down to watch a Rocky movie for. You want to see the little guy, the under dog struggle and work hard and give it his best win or lose... and the best part about the Rocky franchise is that he doesn't always win, you see him hurt, you see him lose, and you see him get back up and fight.

And that is what Rocky IV delivers. || Unfortunately, Rocky IV is the first film in the series that has disappointed me.

This film had major tonal conflicts. For starters, the film is trying to have a very tragic story that motivates Rocky with the death of Apollo Creed, but at the same time has goofy scenes of a robot housewife. I did not like the ungroundedness that began to take shape here. This film also drew the least amount of emotion from me. I felt that Apollo Creed’s character regressed in this film, with him underestimating Ivan Drago the same way he underestimated Rocky in the original film. He no longer had the humble wisdom that he portrayed in Rocky III and was all about the spectacle and show. Additionally, I thought this opponent was the weakest of the series. This is probably due to the main connection between the two boxers being the death of Apollo, and that aspect fell flat for me. The final fight was the least exciting of the series, mainly due to the lack of buildup.

The acting is pretty similar to the third film, with Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, and Carl Weathers all doing an excellent job. But the same complaint I had in Rocky III remains in this film, with the main antagonist being extremely corny and poorly acted. The silent, stoic figure of Drago was intimidating but lacked any emotional connection that the previous antagonists had.

I would like to note that this film had a little too much 80s music for my liking. I really enjoyed the track ""Eye of the Tiger,"" like in the third film, but I felt that there were not enough of the classic Rocky themes that really boosted the training segments.

Overall, I still enjoyed this film, even with all of its flaws.

RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Jonathan Lynn, ""Clue"" is a comedic murder mystery based on the board game featuring an “all-star” cast (Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Eileen Brennan, Lesley Ann Warren, etc.).

This is a good movie if you’re in the mood for an amusing mystery that takes place during the McCarthy era (1954) almost entirely within a vast gothic mansion on a stormy night. It combines movies like “Ten Little Indians” (1965) and “The Beast Must Die” (1974) with the goofiness of “The Private Eyes” (1980).

I was skeptical at how Lynn & the cast could pull off the challenge of making such a confined story entertaining, but I have to admit that I busted out laughing several times (e.g. the scenes of making out with corpses). And the cast is a pleasure to behold with Colleen Camp a highlight as the stereotypical (hot) French maid. The climax with its several murder scenarios is kinda tedious, however.                                         

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot in Paramount Studios, Hollywood, and Max Busch House, Pasadena, California. WRITERS: Jonathan Lynn and John Landis. 

GRADE: B-/C+ || Cluedo Chaos.

Clue is directed by Jonathan Lynn and he co-writes with John Landis and Anthony E. Pratt. It stars Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Madeline Kahn, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren, Colleen Camp and Lee Ving. Music is by John Morris and cinematography by Victor J. Kemper.

Based on the board game Cluedo, plot finds six guests anonymously invited to a large mansion for dinner. All of them have something in common and when their host is killed, they must work with the household staff to identify the murderer because the bodies are starting to pile up. 

A sort of madcap ""And Then There Were None"", Clue has ebullience in spades and a cast revelling in the nutty play. The mystery element is actually secondary to the interactions of this splendid array of characters, where physical and vocal humour is the twin driving force. The shifts between pure mania and deadpannery ensure the pace, even during close quarter chattings in the group, never sags. 

It's on the surface silly but taking a closer look it's rejoicing in its own humility, the class distinctions shredded for comedic worth. It's definitely a mood piece, I mean you have to be in a good move to go with its flow. For to be down and blue it's more likely to irritate than to cheer one up. The makers are on form, in front of and behind the camera, while Morris' musical score is proper perky. 

A flop on release, and mauled in serious critic circles, Clue has garnered a cult fanbase over the decades. So much so it sits with a healthy rating on the main movie data base. It's hard to recommend with great confidence, for it is an acquired taste. But it's a one of a kind from the 1980s, a pic that you should try just in case you do become a fan for life. 7/10 || Those three alternate endings were still very confusing.
But it was still humorous nonetheless."

Here I don't know what they did. It was like they changed the focus back on the characters but somehow butchered it in the process. The result was just horrible.

It wasn't the lack of Rocky fighting or the fact that Tommy Gun was kind of an evil traitorous friend that used him and then walked away... it was how they handled it.

It could have been the start of a good story of Rocky as a trainer, but it ended up just being awful. The dramatic family dynamic was shot and it turned into a mess with a convoluted story that hinted at being decent, but always missed the boat.

It should have been the more personal story, but it stopped being personal the moment Tommy Gun walked on screen and it turned into a mess that didn't seem to know which way it should go.

However... the same basic concept was used with Creed, and this time (despite it's FORGIVABLE faults in the script, it was done right). Partially due to the fact that Jordan is a far better actor than Morrison, but mostly due to the fact that it kept what it promised to deliver and the story was more coherent from start to finish. || At the heart of Rocky V, there is a really intimate story about living in the past and being blinded to your present, but unfortunately that gets muddled with its somewhat convoluted screenplay.

The decision to take away Rocky’s wealth with a cheap plot device is one that was not needed. Rocky has already hit rock bottom in his life, and ripping away all of his accomplishments makes his story feel like it’s going backwards. The entire plot could have been just as effective if he was still at the top of the world.

I think the decision to focus on Rocky’s age and sudden loss of relevance is what really intrigued me with this installment. Rocky is no longer in fighting shape, and the one thing that made him Rocky was this fighting background. He gradually loses control of himself, not only as a professional but also as a man. This causes him to lose sight of everything in his life by focusing on gaining that fighting relevance back. This creates some really emotional conflicts with his son that feel impactful.

This film was on its way to getting 3.5 stars from me until the final twenty minutes of the film. It takes a somewhat grounded story, very reminiscent of the original, and turns it into a cheap gang action flick with a bar brawl. This felt incredibly out of place, and I think a more satisfying ending would have been Rocky leaving the fighting all behind without this physical conflict.

John Avildsen’s direction is back, with this film being the most reminiscent of the original. The acting is good all around, with standouts being Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, and, surprisingly, Sage Stallone, who was excellently cast across from his real-life father. Tommy Morrison was decent, but Richard Gant was just awful. He had such a campy presence in the film that was really out of place. I hated every time he was on the screen.

Overall, I enjoyed this installment more than most due to its more serious tone and interesting look at a post-boxing Rocky Balboa, but it definitely could have been much better with a tighter script.

I gained nothing from <em>'The Karate Kid Part II'</em>, it adds very little to the original. Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) is the only plus point for me, he especially has one great and emotional scene with his co-star. Otherwise, no-one else stands out - not even (the still solid) Ralph Macchio (Daniel).

Up until the ending I was actually nonplussed about it, neither liking or disliking it, but the conclusion is so uninteresting and lame that I just couldn't wait for 'The End' to appear. I will say it isn't an excruciating watch or anything, but I just expected a great deal more from this sequel. It doesn't feel attached to the first film, which is obviously a negative.

Other things that didn't help were the shoehorning out of Elisabeth Shue (Ali) & Randee Heller (Lucille) and the repetitive nature of the story; e.g. another love story that features a jock-like character, Daniel still getting battered and bruised for the majority.

Hopefully the next two follow-ups are much better. || **A worthy continuation.**

After the great success of the first film, it was quite predictable that another film would be made that would continue the story. This film picks up right where the first left off, and follows in the footsteps of Daniel and his master, Miyagi, on a journey to southern Japan, the latter's homeland, to see his dying father and settle a score with a man he swore to kill. Him if he ever set foot on Japanese soil again.

As in the first film, we again have Ralph Macchio in the role of Daniel and Pat Morita as Master Miyagi. Both were very good and they give us again everything that we appreciated in the first film. The main difference in the work of both actors turns out to be the greater formal protagonism of the character of Morita, who is the great protagonist of this film: all the action, and the whole story, is centered on the figure of Miyagi, in the past and in the its peaceful stance in the face of a situation in which it is forced to fight. Of course, the film tries to give Macchio equal relevance by forcing an enmity between his character and another, created to be one of the film's antagonists, but the situation feels far too forced and contrived to really be an advantage to the story. Incidentally, even the romantic sub-plot between Daniel and Kumiko, a young Japanese woman played by Tamlyn Tomita, doesn't seem credible enough, despite the actress' good work. Danny Kamekona doesn't do a bad job, but he seems a little stereotypical, whereas Yuji Okumoto does nothing but be hateful.

Technically, the film is quite correct and seeks to create a convincing Japanese environment, in which the houses, gardens, buildings and other elements really look like a rural area of Japan. Filmed in Hawaii for production convenience, the film really managed to recreate that environment well and give us a flavor of Japanese traditions through clothes, houses, sets and other details such as the tea ceremony and dance. The cinematography is quite pleasant and the soundtrack has some very good songs, one of which even deserved an Oscar nomination that year."

The Karate Kid is directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita (Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor) and Elisabeth Shue. 

Daniel LaRusso (Macchio) moves with his mother (Randee Heller) from Newark, New Jersey to Reseda, a neighbourhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. Pretty much from the off Daniel finds he doesn't belong and quickly incurs the wrath of Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) who is the ex-boyfriend of the only person Daniel has connected with; Ali Mills (Shue). Not good since Johnny is an ace karate student from the Cobra Kai dojo, a place where the students are taught winning is everything by tough ex-forces sensei, John Kreese (Martin Kove). But salvation and a stop to the beatings at the hands of Lawrence and his bully loving friends may come in the form of the quirky but kind handyman at the apartment complex; Mr. Miyagi (Morita). 

In 1976 John G. Avildsen had directed one of the most loved of all the underdog comes good movies, Rocky. Fast forward to 1984 and we find Avildsen treading on the same turf, only for a younger audience. What was to follow would be a monster hit movie (it made over $90 million domestically alone), that spawned three sequels, a remake, pop culture bonanza and more telling; got karate back in the headlines some 11 years after the tragic death of Bruce Lee. Its appeal is not hard to fathom, geeky young guy gets beat up on by some suspiciously Aryan bully types, forms a wonderful and warm friendship with sage old Chinaman, becomes a karate hero after being tutored in an unorthodox manner by kindly Chinaman, then kicks Aryan dudes butt. What's not to like there? Hell us young men even had the all American cutie pie looks of Shue (she was 21 at the time and Macchio 23) to admire as we joined Daniel in chopping, kicking and falling on our asses as we tried the famous ""Crane Kick"". Sure some of it looks creaky now, but it's creakiness with an 80s charm that still engages today. So lets get waxing on and waxing off and relieve the moment when we all cheered at the climax of this simple, yet utterly beguiling movie. 8/10 || ***Reverent and emotionally potent coming-of-age/sports flick***  

A boy (Ralph Macchio) moves with his mother from New Jersey to Los Angeles, but isn’t welcomed by the Cobra Kai gang at school, led by bully Johnny (William Zabka). But Daniel (Macchio) finds a potential girlfriend (Elisabeth Shue) and a ‘golden connection’ with a Japanese American who’s willing to teach him the art of karate (Pat Morita). Everything leads to Daniel facing off with Johnny at a tournament.  Martin Kove is on hand as the sensei dripping with villainy.

“The Karate Kid” (1984) is a product of its time, the early/mid 80s, and is unrepentant about it. A long sequence featuring Bananarama’s ""Cruel Summer” tells all. Speaking of which, that’s a great school scene.

There’s something about this flick that always moves me; it has heart. It’s about the love of a teenager and his mother; the love of a boy and a girl; and the fatherly love of a harassed new kid on the block and a wise old Asian man. It’s also about facing hefty challenges and learning to overcome them. There’s a reverent quality and the proceedings ring true, except maybe for the campiness of the uber-machismo sensei, although that’s entertaining.

Winsome Shue shines on the female front wherein the movie scores well with several peripheral notables and even Daniel’s warmly spirited mother (Randee Heller). 

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

GRADE: A- || The start of <em>'The Karate Kid'</em>. Good viewing, this.

I'd be lying if I didn't say I expected more from it, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it - because I did. Coming into this I had only seen the 2010 remake, therefore I did know what was coming in certain points. Still, the plot is interesting and holds a positive message.

I would say the run time is longer than I would've chosen, I feel they could've shaved a bit off and not have taken so long to get to the karate event itself. It builds up fairly slowly, meaning the opening 40 minutes are less interesting - to me, anyway. The rest is good fun though.

I definitely sensed the <em>'Rocky'</em> influence, particularly in Ralph Macchio's acting. He reminded me of Sylvester Stallone from the aforementioned film, in terms of the acting perhaps not being anything incredible but there being the required amount of likability and glimpses of hidden talent. Macchio (Daniel) is very good here, as is Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) of course.

Onto the sequels!"

After an excellent initial film and a sufficiently honorable sequel, this film comes to us… and there is no way to hide that the quality of the material presented is substantially lower and that the film works badly.

The biggest problem with this film is the script, quite weak, poorly written and full of holes in which the lack of logic and credibility are closely associated with a dose of predictability that makes the film tiresome. The characters were also frankly poorly developed, the villains are stereotyped and loaded (the movie does everything it can to not like them) and the material given to the actors wasn't enough to guarantee a good job.

Even so, it is necessary to recognize that Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio did everything possible to rise to the challenge, and to live up to what the audience expected from their respective characters. Morita remains a sympathetic presence and Macchio is not as immature and stubborn as in previous films, which shows some maturity in the character (although I don't know if this was intentional). The disappearance of Macchio's character's mother from the scene is justified in the most stupid way possible, and the place that was supposedly leased for the bonsai shop looks more like a warehouse than a commercial space.

In the midst of these problems, the film compensates us with regular cinematography, good editing, a pleasant pace and no room for dead moments. Filming locations are satisfying enough. This being an action movie, a fight movie, karate, I expected to have seen some more fights, it has a lot less fights than the previous movies, and the tension is not as palpable, but what was done is quite well done, and the fight choreographies were well rehearsed and carried out. || I totally forgot about this one until someone at work made an obscure reference about it... and suddenly I was faced with memories I'd rather forget. Honestly, when you remember The Next Karate kid and not Part III, it should tell you something.

Anyway, he was right, it did have Robyn Lively in it and I think this is one of her early roles... and this and Teen Witch are kind of a shame because she can do a good job, a Twin Peaks quality job here and there but otherwise lingers in obscurity and really only surfaces for people like me who see her here and there in television roles and have fond memories of some of her better roles.

Anyway, it also has Ralph Macchio doing a job that kind of makes sure to tell the audience that he does not want to be there, he does not think III is a good idea, and otherwise convinces the audience not to like it.

And he was right, the script wasn't there. It was nice that he had a platonic interest and not a love interest, it was unique, it fit his character, it worked with the story... but the story otherwise wasn't there.

It's kind of a revenge tale that you have seen a thousand times over and this one doesn't say anything more than low budget Canon Pictures quality film. || Was I the only one who simply wasn’t engaged with this series? Building on the success of their very own equivalent of the 1970s “Grasshopper” (David Carradine) doing karate rather than kung fu, the now slightly loved-up “Daniel” (Ralph Macchio) finds himself embroiled in quite a nasty plot by his erstwhile nemesis “Kreese” (Martin Kove) to avenge himself on the lad and his mentor “Miyagi” (Pat Morita) by goading him into a final conflict with his new Cobra Kai star “Mike” (Sean Kanan) which he hopes will repay the injustices he feels were visited upon him in the last film in 1986. The sagely “Miyagi” also has to worry about his charge when their apartment block is demolished and the kindly youngster uses his college fund to buy the old gentleman a venue for his bonsai tree business. This latter enterprise only serves to give “Kreese” and his young enforcer even more leverage over “Daniel” as he starts to look just a little bit out of his depth. With his guru disapprovingly abandoning him to his fate and him unsure as to who is really on his side, the whole underpinning principles of the honour of karate start to become blurred - but not as blurred as his vision, physically and metaphorically, as things come to an head. What is odd about this is the comparative tameness and timidity of the action scenes. I know this isn’t rated for the age group of something like “Enter the Dragon” but there the martial arts look so much more real and so much less choreographed than this rather placid, furniture-trashing, affair. “Miyagi” seems to have modelled his character as a sort of khaki-clad “Yoda”; Macchio could hardly be more of a drip and Kove ought to have stuck to “Cagney and Lacey” - at least there he didn’t have to try to pretend he was menacing. This just doesn’t ever take hold and the lacklustre efforts from just about everyone - except, perhaps, the unjustifiably wounded tiny little sculptured tree - are as flat as the mat. Same old, same old - sorry."

The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War&nbsp;II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version.

<i>The Thin Red Line</i> tells of the American battle against Japanese forces on the island from the landing on its beach to the time the initial troops are relieved and sail off for some new, unknown deployment. But it actually begins shortly before this when Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), who has been AWOL and living with the local Melanesian people on a nearby island, is discovered by a patrol and brought in before his sargeant. The battle itself involves the men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division: besides Caviezel as Witt, major roles are played by Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody and Ben Chaplin. Elias Koteas is Capt. Staros, who tries to look out for his men, while a hyperbolic Nick Nolte plays their commander who sees the infantry as nothing but cannon fodder to wrecklessly throw at the Japanese.

For most of its 3-hour length, the men are torn apart by Japanese machine gun fire as they try to take a hill, but the enemy is never directly seen. Between scenes of great violence, there are portentous voiceovers by various characters as they meditate on what war says about the larger human drama. Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.

While the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers -- and its hard to knock any World War&nbsp;II film since they spur one to read more about this crucial event in history, this is not a great film. It has obviously been cut heavily from its original length. John C. Reilly appears several times at the centre of shots, clearly meant to be a major character, but most of his scenes and all of his back story were cut. The philosophic voiceovers come across as pretentious instead of insightful. Furthermore, I find this a very ""Hollywood"" film, with the acting often exaggerated. Woody Harrelson doesn't play a WWII grunt, he plays Woody Harrelson. George Clooney appears at the end and all realism goes out the window: there's no way this suave, handsome leading man has been fighting a war for some time now. Hans Zimmer's musical score too obviously pulls the audience towards prescribed emotions. || As war movies go, this one sucks. I'm pretty sure (although I didn't read it, that the novel (and maybe original screenplay) must have been fantastic, but Terrence Malick really bungled this: no clear vision, no character investment, a ridiculous amount of stupid jump cuts. I was willing to quit 40% into the film but my wife wanted to see the rest (as almost kind of a challenge to see if she could spot another of the many famous that wanted to work with him (and probably regretted it later). || Yeah, this is pretentious. And what makes it worse is that in all of it's art house pomp, it doesn't come across so much as anti-war as it does anti- stopping the Japanese and Germans from their genocidal bid for world domination.

It was like they were saying that they are devoutly on the left... so much so that they support the axis powers if only because the alternative is the United States and Democracy and that is somehow more... fascist(?).

I don't know, the film suffers from schizophrenia and the message gets lost when you realize that it's a World War II story and not a Vietnam story and that it is kind of taking the wrong side of WWII in it's effort to call America a fascist nation.

But, you get pointless meandering diatribes and A-list actors in a horrible movie.

The good news is that it looks pretty... but I don't think the final product is what the writer of this and From Here to Eternity had in mind."

A young woman (Charlize Theron) who has raised a giant gorilla named Joe from infancy brings him to an animal sanctuary in Southern California with the aid of a zoologist (Bill Paxton). Meanwhile, a poacher from the past seeks vengeance on the creature (Rade Serbedzija), which breaks free to cause havoc.

“Mighty Joe Young” (1998) was loosely based on the 1949 movie of the same name. I can watch it and enjoy it for what it is, a more kid-friendly version of King Kong with essentially Kong Jr. But, despite a good cast, great F/X and lots of action & adventure, the movie's somehow shallow with cardboard thin characters. When little Johnny gets stuck on the Ferris wheel, compelling Joe to rescue him, I just rolled my eyes. Yet the movie's still well done for what it is: a movie for kids (and the kid IN adults) about a lovable but menacing-when-necessary giant gorilla.

The movie runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in Kaua'i, Hawaii (the Africa scenes) and Los Angeles, Hollywood & Long Beach, California.

GRADE: C+/B- || It's basically <em>'King Kong'</em>, let's be honest.

In fairness, though, <em>'Mighty Joe Young'</em> does do its own thing and it's a film I did feel entertained by. Bill Paxton (Gregg) and Charlize Theron (Jill) are two of the big reasons, they are both enjoyable in this. The effects/animatronics for the gorilla are also impressive, even when Joe is shown via people in costume (incl. Verne Troyer!) he looks decent. They did a fine job in that regard.

The premise isn't anything revolutionary, but there is certainly a fair amount of heart in there. I would've liked it more without the typical happy ending, admittedly. The music and cinematography is solid. The villains, meanwhile, are probably this production's weakest area, I never really became interested in them or their story.

Good film, all in all."

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || Body Snatchers was just a made up story...

Herrington High School, just your everyday place of learning. That is until the teachers start behaving strangely. It seems there is an alien plot to take over the world and only a rag-tag group of students can save us!

When you pair Robert Rodriguez (director) and Kevin Williamson (writer) what sort of movie do you really think you are going to get? Well the answer is The Faculty, which in all honesty holds absolutely no surprises for anyone familiar with the guys who gave us From Dusk Till Dawn & Scream respectively. That's not to say that The Faculty isn't a fun horror/sci-fi film, because it absolutely is, it's just should be noted that The Faculty is all that it can be as regards the makers and the nature of the genre beast.

The film has rightly been tagged as a cross between Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and any teen led Highschool movie (you can add Invaders From Mars in the mix too), this is intentional, something that's apparent since our intrepid students discuss ""Snatchers"" amongst other movie references, and one of them, Stokely (Clea Duval), is a sci-fi aficionado . As things progress it's also evident that the makers here are movie fans making a movie for movie fans, all be it one aimed solely at the teenage demographic. There's much satire around and cliché's are widely embraced, but again it works because there is no hidden agenda. There's gore and hugely effective scenes involving blood, slugs, heads and an eyeball, whilst slasher fans are catered for in a couple of - if seemingly pointless as regards the alien's intentions - memorable scenes.

The youngsters in the cast, all purposely playing total stereotypes, all do what is required, with Josh Hartnett, Duval & Elijah Wood particularly shining. Yet it's with the adult actors that The Faculty really gains its tongue in cheek momentum. Robert Patrick, Famke Jansen, Salma Hayek, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth and even Jon Stewart all file in for a bit of alien parasitical fun. Come the end of the mania, with the staple alien queen reveal and showdown, there's the overriding feeling that the film could have been so much more. Certainly it's guilty of being a touch too derivative, where a little focus has been lost in the self referential and knowing in-jokery genre winks. But ultimately it's a groovy ride is this one, not in the least bit serious, but one to clip open a tin of beer with and embrace it for what it certainly is. Entertaining sci-fi alien invasion hokum. 7/10 || _**Wannabe edgy high school horror satire with a notable cast**_

Several students at a high school in Ohio suspect that the faculty has been taken over by some… thing(s). 

""The Faculty"" (1998) was directed by Robert Rodriguez, who knows how to make slick, ‘cool’ horror flicks, as witnessed in “From Dusk Till Dawn” (1996) and “Planet Terror” (2007). “The Faculty” is cut from the same cloth except it goes too far over-the-top in its wannabe edgy depiction of high school life in Middle America, to the point that it can only be viewed as a satire or black comedy. This turned me off the first time I watched it but, if you roll with it, you can enjoy the movie to some degree.

The story doesn’t become compelling until the second half when a group of students team-up to tackle the unbelievable situation. It’s basically “The Hidden” (1987) set in a high school environment.

Laura Harris is the top female, although the overrated Jordana Brewster is also on hand, as well as Clea DuVall. Bebe Neuwirth looks great as the principal while Salma Hayek plays a nurse, but not enough is done with her (don’t expect the dance sequence of “From Dusk Till Dawn”). Meanwhile Famke Janssen appears as an intimidated teacher that has an entertaining metamorphosis.

On the other side of the gender spectrum, Shawn Hatosy is notable as the main protagonist; Josh Hartnett too as a chemical-obsessed older student. Robert Patrick from “Terminator 2” plays the vein-popping coach while Jon Stewart has a small role.	

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in East Texas as follows: Austin (Herrington High School), Lockhart (high school parking lot, football field & town exteriors) and San Marcos.

Unfairly chastised in some quarters for being a kiddie friendly King Kong, Mighty Joe Young is as charming as an Autumnal day. Many of the team from King Kong reteam to make this film, and undoubtedly it's pretty much the same plotting only with a different resolution.

However, the effects work is still magical, harking back to a time when geniuses like Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen sweated buckets to make the magic move on the screen. Mighty Joe, the huge Gorilla of the title, is beautifully realised, full of expressions and emotions, he even has time for some sense of humour traits.

Action is never far away, with models and sets destroyed with brute force, while plenty of beings get flung about to emphasise the madness of it all. Narratively like Kong there's still themes of greed and ignorance, the tampering with Mother Nature a big mistake, which all leads to a thrilling finale that in turn leads to something to savour.

Well that's not so important as the really potent effort from Nolte as a man dealing with a backstory from hell, a family who are at best indifferent to his plight, and an increasingly toxic professional reality that gradually sees him reduced to nothing - an angry and despairing nothing. It's all about obsession, and about the dangers to the mind and body when that is unfettered. Coburn features menacingly, if sparingly, and Sissy Spacek also works well as the concerned but wary ""Margie"". It has something of the sins of the father about it, and sees this actor give what is, for me anyway, his career best performance. It's at times quite a depressing and bleak film, but no worse for that."

In this contrived thriller, Bening is a grief stricken housewife who finds her thoughts in sync with a serial killer (a ridiculously miscast Downey Jr.). Neil Jordan is a great director, but he's also a very frustrating one, case in point In Dreams. The visuals are outstanding here as Jordan and Khondji paint a nightmarish world, but the flashbacks are unfocused and any sense of suspense or plot progression is lost in a whirl of stylised indulgence.

Virus is directed by John Bruno and written by Chuck Pfarrer and  Dennis Feldman. It stars Jamie Lee Curtis, William Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, Joanna Pacula, Marshall Bell, Sherman Augustus, Cliff Curtis and Julio Oscar Mechoso. Music is by Joel McNeely and cinematography by David Eggby.

The crew of an American tugboat boards an abandoned Russian research vessel and quickly sets about claiming salvage rights. However, there is something on board, just not human, and it potentially spells doom for all.

Virus is a derivative big-budget genre film that is not only a hack job, but almost certainly the lowest point of Donald Sutherland's otherwise superb career. The premise here has been mined many a time before, including the previous year to ""Virus"" with ""Deep Rising"". However, unlike ""Deep Rising's"" glorious sense of fun amongst the creature feature carnage, ""Virus"" is unintentionally funny since it's all played very straight.

The humans are up against alien robot thingies, one of which looks suspiciously like a robotic ""Brundlefly"" mixed with ""Short Circuit's Number 5"". There's a modicum of interest in the virus narrative thread, with the need for human body parts a tantalising proposition, but it looks and comes off as feeble steals from better genre pictures. The high energy finale, with whizz bangs and fire crackers, is at least played with good action intent, but by then it's too late to save a rip-off stinker that wastes a very good cast list. 3/10"

An English-speaking duck from another planet is somehow transported to Cleveland, Ohio, where he befriends a rock group leader (Lea Thompson). She introduces him to her friend, a quirky lab assistant (Tim Robbins), to figure out what happened, but the situation is complicated when a doctor at the lab is possessed by a “dark overlord of the universe” (Jeffrey Jones).

""Howard the Duck"" (1986) is the film version of Marvel Comics’ anthropomorphic waterfowl created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik with the Duck’s first appearance being in Adventures into Fear #19 featuring the Man-Thing, which debuted in March, 1974 (cover date Dec. 1973). While the cartoonish character was atypical for Marvel, he was a surprise hit, which led to this movie a dozen years later.

It’s made in the mold of “Ghostbusters” (1984) and obviously influenced “Men in Black” (1997), but it’s the least of these and notoriously bombed at the box office. It begins well enough, both intriguing and amusing, but starts to lose its mojo in the second act before spiraling into a loud, frantic last act with loads of colorful special effects. 

The problem is that, after the first act, the flick abandons the characters for action-oriented zaniness and it loses the attention of the viewer. Creator Steve Gerber plainly said the movie “sucked” and was dissatisfied with the duck’s bland voice and costume. Howard’s face just isn’t animated enough and his eyes are too cute & innocent for Gerber’s ill-tempered, wise-cracking waterfowl. That said, there are enough entertaining elements in the “Ghostbusters” / “Men in black” vein to enjoy the movie to some degree as you revisit 1985 America when it was shot. But you have to be able to accept it as a cinematic alternative to Gerber’s original concept.

I’m not big on Lea Thompson, but she’s winsome enough as Beverly on the female front, although she didn’t exactly fit Gerber’s version of the Duck’s babelicious pal. Liz Sagal is also notable as Ronette in a minor role.   

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was obviously shot in the Bay area of Northern California, NOT Cleveland, Ohio. 

GRADE: C || It is so cool to hate on this isn't it? So I am giving it a 10, mainly because of all the folks that gave it a 1 to be in the in crowd...and partially because Lucas was right, it stood the test of time.

The cult following isn't because it's a bad movie, it's because it's a funny movie. Just because a midget is wearing a duck suit doesn't make it bad. Just because there is duck nudity doesn't make it bad.

I mean...we loved it with Team America. It was hysterical then. It's not funny in Howard because you are told not to laugh at it.

It's a bit on the slow side but it's got some cool ideas and if I saw it as a kid I'm sure I'd appreciate it even more, might even been scary to me back then cause even though the cast are mostly kids it is rather dark in tone and manages to not feel too cheesy.

The Fly is directed by Kurt Neumann and adapted to screenplay by James Clavell from the short story written by George Langelaan. It stars David Hedison, Patricia Owens, Vincent Price, Herbert Marshall, Kathleen Freeman and Betty Lou Gerson. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Karl Struss.  

When science goes berserk, The Fly finds Hedison as scientist Andre Delambre, who after successfully inventing the ability to transmit matter from one place to another - falls prey to a cruel slice of horrific fate...

Kurt Neumann would sadly pass away shortly after The Fly was released. Itself a terrible shame, it's doubly sad that he didn't get to see his film become a cult favourite with longevity assured. It's a film that smartly blends sci-fi with horror, and even managing to be fun into the bargain. 

It's sometimes by modern observers accused of being too slow, but really it's a lesson in fine story telling. For at the heart of the tragic tale is a bountiful love story, the loyalty of a great wife in full effect. Throw in Andre's stoic pursuit of a science to benefit mankind, and this is a film that needs time to lay the story foundations.

Once we get to the horrors, and the surviving characters of the flashback structure play out this fateful tale, it simultaneously grips and fascinates. The effects work of course now looks a bit creaky, but those who first sampled them many decades ago have never ever forgotten the impact of the critical sequences.

Two pretty poor sequels would follow, which in turn would see a brilliant remake by David Cronenberg some 28 years later. Neumann's film is still a great piece of 1950s sci-fi, clinically adapted from a genius piece of short story writing. Loop holes exist, of course, but who cares, dive in and be haunted by what transpires on the screen. 8/10 || **_“Help me, help me”_**

An inventor (David Hedison) creates an amazing teleportation device that leads to horrific problems. Patricia Owens plays his loving wife, Vincent Price his brother and Herbert Marshall an inspector.

""The Fly"" (1958) is classic 50’s sci-fi/horror that led to two B&W sequels (1959, 1965) and two remakes in the 80s (1986, 1989). Just so there’s no mistake, this is in full color and was never B&W, as some misremember.  

There are naturally dated aspects, but I find it more effective than the gory 1986 remake. Everything builds to the horrifying climax, which is iconic. There’s even some welcome human interest for those who watch closely.  

The film runs 1 hour, 34 minutes, and was shot at Fox Studios, Century City, Los Angeles. One source also includes Montréal, Québec, although I can’t figure out what scene(s) that would be.

An eccentric scientist living in a warehouse laboratory in a big city in the Northeast (Jeff Goldblum) discovers how to teleport objects, which draws the attention of a journalist (Geena Davis). Everything is going fine until he foolishly uses his invention on himself and a pesky fly inadvertently teleports with him. John Getz is on hand as the woman’s editor while Joy Boushel has a notable small role as Tawny. 

""The Fly"" (1986) has a lot of devotees presumably because of director/writer David Cronenberg, but I found it less effective compared to the 1958 version with Vincent Price. Despite the gory state-of-the-art effects, it’s just not as compelling or horrifying (especially that final scene in the original). The one-dimensional locations are also a turn-off: Excluding the great bar scene the whole movie takes place in a grungy lab or a swank office building.

The cast trilogy is exceptionally tall. While Goldblum (6’4½”) is serviceable and gives it his all, he’s not leading man material, although he’s fine in secondary roles. And I was never big on Davis, but she’s a’right I guess. At least the two absolutely look & act like they were meant for each other.   

In its favor, the movie is a metaphor for how aging & disease slowly destroys the body. Despite the sickening visuals, it’s heartbreaking and tragic, which you might not expect in a sci-fi flick about a guy who morphs into a fly. It thankfully avoids the rut of camp and melodrama.

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Toronto with studio work done in nearby Kleinburg.

GRADE: B-/C+ || Nobody could ever call Jeff Goldbum a versatile actor, but here he is very much in his element as ""Brundle"". A madcap scientist, he dreams of being able to teleport things just like Willy Wonka does in 1971. He is almost as keen on journalist ""Veronica"" (Geena Davis) and so offers her exclusive access to follow and film his research. That all goes remarkably well - first a scarf, then more animated objects before, finally, himself. Snag is - well a fly just happened to sneak into the pod before the transferal and next thing he and his new dipteral cousin start a journey to the symbiotic relationship from Hell. He can crawl on the ceiling; fly and most impressively - dissolve his victims in his own vomit! David Cronenberg is having great fun with this as is Goldblum. The dialogue is entertaining and there is the most bizarre degree of chemistry between him and Davis who turns in one of her career defining performances. The visual and make-up effects - especially towards the end - offer a fitting denouement to this gory and frequently amusing sci-fi horror film that is nearly, but not quite, as good as the version from 1958. Certainly worth watching on a big screen if you can - somehow it just looks so much better there. || What was his electric bill and how did he not blow out every fuse in his building?  Telepods must suck up a lot of juice.

Anyway, it's fun.  It is the typical 80s flick, with a plot that takes all of 5 minutes to get rolling and a cast that was talented and still cheap enough to throw in a sci-fi horror flick.

But, you know, it's also mindless fun, it's not exactly deep, it's about science, and about the dangers of it, that never really manages to actually examine the dangers of science in any significant way... it's more along the lines of Kafka's Metamorphosis, which has already been examined.

But it doesn't matter, because you are watching it for mindless entertainment."

The buddy buddy action/comedy cop formula has proved to be a most viable filmic commodity over the years. It gathered apace in the 1980s and right at the forefront is this often forgotten fun little treasure.

Plot has Hines and Crystal as Chicago cops, tough and full of wise cracks, they are tasked with trying to bring down high profile drug dealer Julio Gonzales (Smits). The timing is unfortunate because after a holiday in Key West the boys decide they have had enough of police work and want to retire there. Can they bring down Julio Gonzales? Can they stay alive in the process? Questions to be answered in an entertaining hour and forty five minutes.

The chemistry between Hines and Crystal is set in stone, they are a great pairing and very quickly you warm to them. As per genre requirements some of their character's methods are unconventional. the gags are thick and fast, and crucially very funny - while the support slots are nicely filled (Pantoliano a joy).

In the mix as the two cops ponder retirement is the looming presence of two younger cops ready to step into their shoes, which of course makes for sparky rivalry. There's the emotional beat of ""the ex-wife"" as a critical plot development, though amazingly Fluegel is under written and hardly in the piece! And Smits never fully convinces as the chief villain, but he also is weirdly under written. 

Basically if you have a kink for this type of genre piece, especially ones produced in the 80s - and to have an understanding of that decades style of film making - then there's a good time to be had here. 7/10"

After a van of young people picks up a psycho hitchhiker in east Texas they stumble upon a farm house of crazies, including a burly mute man with a mask made of human-skin.   

Tobe Hooper’s ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) is a seminal, iconic slasher that’s genuinely disturbing and horrific because it plays out in a gritty, realistic manner. While some viewers might find a couple of scenes amusing, like Franklin in his wheelchair accidently rolling down the hill and, later, having a hammy fit in the dilapidated building, it doesn’t change the fact that this is a serious, unsettling horror flick. 

By contrast, Rob Zombie’s homage (or rip-off), “House of 1000 Corpses” (2003), wasn’t disturbing or horrific at all because he opted for an over-the-top, cartoony approach. It was colorful and amusing, yes, but not unsettling or horrifying.

Other positives include the rural locations, cool nighttime sequences, e.g. the thorn bush, and the effectively photographed women with no raunch: Teri McMinn (Pam) and Marilyn Burns (Sally). They’re girl-next-door types, but alluring enough.

So this is a standout film as far as serious slasher horror goes and I can understand those who give it a high rating, but horror movies are about more than just scaring & troubling the viewer. For me, the last act is overly one-dimensional, focusing too much on the eye-rolling demonic dirtbag family and a girl fleeing & screaming. It’s thoroughly manic, indeed, but also vacuous and uninspiring.       

The film runs 1 hour, 23 minutes; there’s also an 88 minute unrated version. It was shot in east Texas as follows: Round Rock (house), Bastrop (gas station/BBQ shack), Leander (cemetery) and Watterson (slaughterhouse). The house has since been moved to Kingsland and refurbished as a restaurant.  

GRADE: B-/C+ || It's maybe not fair to appraise a film 50 years after it was made too harshly, but I found this really quite over-rated and annoying. Five travellers pick up an hitch-hiker in their van but quickly discover that he has a penchant for knives and, well he isn't quite the full shilling. Anyway they manage to get shot of him and arrive at a garage that has no petrol near the grave of the grandfather of the wheelchair-bound ""Franklin"" (Paul A. Partain) and his sister ""Sally"" (Marilyn Burns) who are travelling with her boyfriend ""Jerry"" (Allan Danziger) and friends ""Kirk"" (William Vail) and his girlfriend ""Pam"" (Teri McMinn). It's the latter two who set of for a swim and never come back. Concerned, ""Jerry"" goes off in search before, yep - the other two head off into the desert in the dark to see what's what. Pretty early on, we know just what has happened to the first pair and so fully expect the expected... Except, it doesn't quite pan out quite how we might anticipate - else how we could we ever have known about this story? It's all about the last twenty minutes and even then I found it all rather flat and noisy. Way too much of the sense of peril here comes from endless screaming, running about in the bushes in the dark and the behaviour of visitors who just haven't a clue about basic self-preservation. Who would set off into unknown terrain in pitch dark pushing a bloke in a wheelchair after three of their friends had gone missing? Once we meet the perpetrators, again it all just comes across as something that wouldn't look out of place in a Carry On film made in the Hammer House of Horrors - there isn't an hint of menace at any point amongst the faux gore and crescendo hysterics. It's clearly been made on a tiny budget and the production standards reflect that - the continuity is a bit of a joke with wounds that are there then not or windows that self-repair... Nope, perhaps I just wasn't in the mood but I found this really quite disappointing and funny - but not really in a good way. || **One of the best and most fascinating horror movies ever made.**

Just as the title says it, it is wihout any doubt one of the best and most influential horror films ever made. Its production history is also quite fascinating.

The Name of the Rose is directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and based on the novel of the same name written by Umberto Eco. It stars Sean Connery, Christian Slater, F. Murray Abraham, Helmut Qualtinger, Elya Baskin & Michael Lonsdale. Music is scored by James Horner and cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli.

Sean does Sherlock the Monk.

It's one of those film's that I just can't get into, three times I have tried but it's now consigned to the recycle bin, never to be unearthed again. I see there is great artistry there, it's very literate and the mystery element is strong, but it saps my strength to the very last. Connery is miscast because he plays it as nudge nudge wink wink detective fare, and film strains too hard to be some intellectual medieval musing on inquisitional power, berserker religion and the search for truth. Now I like gloomy moods, especially when part of some Gothic architecture, but even with the delightful weirdness of this monastery and the even weirder haircuts, I find it hard to sit still, such is the haphazard directing of the plot. In all honesty, the makers really would have been better off just making another Sherlock Holmes movie and setting it in a monastery. Now that would be fun...

This wants to be a paean to Arthur Conan Doyle, a brain teaser and an observation on some tricky subjects, but the mix doesn't work, sadly, for me anyway. Because I don't like it doesn't mean it's a bad film, clearly it is loved by many and has things of value to a discerning viewer. But to me, no, leaves me cold and frustrated. 5/10 || **_Murder mystery at a gloomy abbey during the Dark Ages with Sean Connery_** 

In 1327, a Franciscan monk and his pupil (Connery and Christian Slater) arrive at a monastery in northern Italy to attend an important theological Roman Church conference. When monks are found dead in mysterious ways, William (Connery) winds up being the Medieval version of Sherlock Holmes. While he seems to figure the mystery out due to the evidence, a mirthless inquisitor is called in and sees things differently (F. Murray Abraham). Ron Perlman plays a hunchback and Michael Lonsdale the Abbot.

Based on Umberto Eco’s 1980 book, “The Name of the Rose” (1986) is outstanding as far as locations, sets, costumes and make-up go. Anyone interested in a shadowy drama with the dreary Gothic ambiance of the Middle Ages, this is the film to see. It’s helped by Connery’s towering performance, marked by his nonchalant confidence. Slater is also excellent as the inquisitive novice. Meanwhile Valentina Vargas as the feral peasant girl is yet another highlight (there’s some nudity, just a heads up).

The murder mystery is decent enough and there are interesting theological debates, but this is mostly a commentary on the good, the bad and the ugly of Medieval Catholicism. Remember, there was good reason for the Protestant Reformation that started less than 200 years later. I advise using the subtitles, as this is a dialogue-driven piece filled with mumbled Latin words and unusual names; it will help you understand the convoluted goings-on.

Speaking of which, the film seems weighed down and needed a rewrite to make the story more compelling. Yet it’s still well worth checking out for those interested and it influenced many movies, like “Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves” (1991). Fans of ""Black Death"" (2010) should appreciate it, although it’s not on that level of greatness; the contemporaneous “Season of the Witch” too. Those films, however, are more conventionally entertaining. This one’s more along the weighty lines of “The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" (2004), which most people hated, but I appreciated.       

The flick runs 2 hours, 11 minutes, and was shot at a replica of the monastery on a hilltop outside Rome (exteriors and some interiors) while most interiors were done at Eberbach Abbey, Germany, over 700 miles to the north; the mountain scenes were shot nearby in Taunus Mountains, Hessen, Germany.

A boy genius specializing in brain research and robotics (Matthew Laborteaux) moves to the town of Welling with his mother (Anne Twomey) where he starts an apprenticeship at the university. He befriends a paper boy and romances an abused neighbor girl (Michael Sharrett and Kristy Swanson respectively). When tragedy strikes, he uses his talents to rectify the situation with horrifying results.  

""Deadly Friend"" (1986) was Wes Craven’s next theatrical project after the success of “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984). It was meant to be a sci-fi thriller focusing on a dark teenage love story, but the trailer omitted BB the robot and advertised the movie as another Wes Craven horror flick. The film bombed at the box office. 

You might remember Laborteaux as Albert, the adopted Ingalls boy on Little House on the Prairie. Meanwhile Winsome Kristy was only 16 during shooting. These two and BB the cute robot give the film a likable innocent quality.  In tone, it’s a cross between “Short Circuit” (1986) and “Silver Bullet” (1985) just with elements of the Frankenstein story thrown in. 

Speaking of which, this is a modern-day coming-of-age take on Frankenstein and zombie tales exploring the idea of a dead person being resurrected by unnatural means with unpleasant results. It raises questions concerning when physical death actually occurs. Interesting ideas, of course, but the execution is so-so and yet kind of agreeable, a puzzling mix.

Craven is a hit-or-miss director IMHO. For instance, “Summer of Fear” (1978) is effective, but “The Serpent and the Rainbow” (1988) is mind-bogglingly bad. This one falls somewhere in between, but closer to the good. 

The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area as follows: Burbank Studios (Paul Conway's house), USC (university exteriors & lecture hall interiors) and Monrovia, which is just northeast of L.A. (Samantha on the loose).

It was a production beset with problems, a change of director (Penny Marshall replacing the jettisoned Howard Zieff) and enough script writers used to fill out a hockey team. So it's unsurprising to find that Jumpin' Jack Flash is a bit muddled, not fully formed as it were.

Plot finds Whoopi Goldberg as a computer programmer thrust into a world of espionage when a plea for help appears on her monitor.

It will all be answered in rank and file 1980s action comedy time, which as it happens is OK here because Goldberg is a good enough comedy actress to hold the attention.

New York reporter Sue Charlton hears of a guy in the outback of Australia who survived an attack by a crocodile. For research she meets up with ""Crocodile Mick Dundee"" and spends time with him out in dangerous Bush Country. Finding a rapport during their time together, Sue convinces Mick to go back with her to New York, which brings interesting results as Mick becomes a big hit by treating the Big Apple, and all that comes his way, the same as he would the Outback.

Crocodile Dundee has a standard fish out of water comedy premise, yet with a number of truly funny sequences and an appealing turn from Paul Hogan as Dundee, it became a monster smash hit that the cinema watching public lapped up with glee. In a decade that is often considered or debated to be the worst for film, it may just be that cinema goers were desperate for a pick me up movie? Possibly, but undoubtedly Crocodile Dundee most assuredly is that type of escapist piece. However, to give that credence would, I feel, be doing it a disservice, for in spite of the rickety concept and the obviousness of where we will ultimately end up, it has bundles of earthy charm, a charm that many can identify with.

As Dundee goes about his way, meeting pimps, transsexuals and muggers et al, they are not only very funny scenes, they are also points of reference to the ever changing way of the Continents. Not that the film doesn't come dangerously close to falling into a sugary rom-com mire, but with a strong performance from Linda Kozlowski as Sue, and Hogan introducing an icon to 80s cinema, Crocodile Dundee safely hits the target that it was surely aiming for. Besides, the love story here is very easy to get on side with, to support it and hanker for this opposites attract coupling to work out.

Two sequels would follow, the first one was a retread reversal and just about passable, the second one, after a gap of 13 years, was bad and evidence that the joke had long since passed. Crocodile Dundee 86 holds up well as the escapist piece of cinema that it is. A nice film to revisit every other year, for it be simple, warm, and yes, I'll say it again, damn funny. 8/10 || Loose plot but Paul Hogan shines as Dundee and it's just an all around feel-good film that one can't help but put a smile on your face.

Dutton",John Cornell,"australia, new york city, crocodile, knife, adventurer, aftercreditsstinger, kangaroo","The Crocodile Who Walks Like a Man.

After the coinage and all round good will generated by the first Crocodile Dundee movie, the sequel was inevitable. This time the formula is reversed as Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) is forced to take his lady, Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), back to the wilds of Australia in order to protect her from gangsters. There, Mick, with all his Outback skills, starts to pick the gangsters off one by one.

Nah. I don't need a gun. I got a Donk!

Within the plot structure there are numerous occasions for Dundee inspired jokes and scenarios, where although they are not as strong as in the first movie, they are amusing and not straining for the laugh factor. The genuine chemistry between real life couple Hogan and Kozlowski is evident and keeps the film grounded in warmth. Hogan is such a likable guy, he's a natural at playing the rugged adventurer type, and it's his charisma that rightly drives the picture forward. He throws a great punch as well, very believable.

Returning characters like Wally and Donk are reassuring presences, while Charles Dutton as Leroy Brown provides solid comedy foil for Dundee during the New York part of the plot. The Northern Territory of Australia is once again the visual bonus (cinematography again by Russell Boyd), though we never really get the sweeping shots the setting deserves, and Peter Best once again provides an appropriate musical score for the two continent setting without pushing anything new on us. Problems elsewhere? There's a raft of stereotypes, particularly with the Ernie Dingo led villains, while the unoriginality of the story (a rehash of the first film) is a touch frustrating.

Not exactly great and not deserving of the ill advised second sequel that followed 13 years later, part 2 of Mick and Sue's adventures is none the less still a fun way to spend an afternoon. 6.5/10 || I remember enjoying the film's star Paul Hogan's commercials for 'Foster's Lager', on television back in the day, when I was growing up. His identification with Australia, and the outback, made him original and gave him worldwide fame. Though I never bothered with the much-more esteemed original, which came from nowhere and captured the imagination of filmgoers worldwide, this was charming and likeable despite its unimportance and relative inanity. The small barrel of jokes wear thin after a while, and the magic ran out as it did for the 'Romancing the Stone' sequel, 'The Jewel of the Nile', not much earlier, or more recently, the insipid retread of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'. Their decent attempt to capture lightning in a bottle unfortunately fell short. One could envision that if this couple existed in real life, their entrenched philosophical differences would mount, and they would end up breaking up after a few years, at most. This is the sort of thing that only works 'in the movies'. || ***Mick & Sue vie with Columbian drug lords in New York City and, then, the Outback***

Sue (Linda Kozlowski) inadvertently obtains evidence against two Central American brothers who are drug moguls with offices in New York City. To protect Sue, Mick (Paul Hogan) takes her to his vast property in the Outback, but the gangsters follow them with murder on their minds.

This sequel does precisely what a good sequel should do: Carry on the story, go deeper with the characters and keep the spirit of the original. “Crocodile Dundee II” (1988) cost $6 million more than the original 1986 movie and runs 11 minutes longer. It was a hit at the box office, albeit nowhere near as successful as the first film. Both movies effectively combine three genres or themes: romantic comedy, fun adventure and fish-out-of-water.

What makes these films work so well beyond the Tarzan-like spirit of adventure is the simple charisma of Paul Hogan. You'll likely never experience a more likable protagonist. On top of this, Linda Kozlowski is lovely and celestial, possessing an attractive intelligence. Paul & Linda’s chemistry is real seeing as how they would marry two years later in 1990. Unfortunately they divorced in 2014, but they gave us a third ‘Crocodile’ Dundee flick in 2001, which is the least of the three.

The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in New York City and the Australian Outback (Northern Territory & Main Arm, NSW).

You have to know the actors on show to fully get the glint they have in their eyes, Douglas, Lancaster and Wallach are having a grand time of things.

Had heard a bit about this movie before I saw it, many times refered to as being racist. In fact COMPLEX MAGAZINE listed it as number 4 on a 'most racist movies' list they made.

Watching it, I must say it's a whole lot less racist than I expected it to be. In fact I wouldn't call it racist at all.

It's about a white guy who gets into Harvard but can't afford to go there so he looks for scholarships that he can take but the only one applicable to him is one designed for African Americans. So  he fakes being black (with full blackface makeover and a 80's jerrycurl to match) and gets it.

There is of course a stigma around blackfaces stemming from early 20th century films where white people would dress up as black people and make fun of them and make them look stupid etc.

But to say that this movie is racist for that reason alone is very simpleminded. Cause even though the guy does put on a blackface, there is not a malicious intent behind it. And he does learn a thing or two about racism himself as the movie progresses.

I would probably argue that if anything it's more racist towards whites and perhaps a general white perception of blackness (at least of the time) than it is of blacks. But even that would be a bit of a stretch.

Anyways slightly overthinking it here perhaps, as it is in fact not a too serious movie but a comedy. And as a comedy, albeit it has a bit of a rough start it works pretty good. It's no masterpiece or anything and it could have done with some editing cutting it down by 15-20 minutes or so. But overall a decent and fairly harmless watch that does manage to convey a pretty good message while also gathering up some big laughs ocassionally."

52 Pick-Up is directed by John Frankenheimer and written by Elmore Leonard (adapting from his own novel) and John Steppling. It stars Roy Scheider, Ann-Margret, John Glover, Vanity, Clarence Williams III, Robert Trebor and Kelly Preston. Music is by Gary Chang and cinematography by Jost Vacano and Stephen Ramsey. 

Successful business entrepreneur Harry Mitchell (Scheider) finds himself the victim of blackmail by three pornographers who have video evidence of his extramarital affair. With his wife about to embark on a new stage of her political career, the last thing Harry needs is a scandal, but when things take a turn for the worse Harry decides to use unorthodox methods to deal with the blackmailers. 

A nifty neo-noir this, certainly deserving of being better known in neo-noir circles. The presence of Leonard at the writing table ensures that the story doesn’t drift too far away from his own source material, though location is moved to L.A. as opposed to the Detroit of the novel. Thematic thrust centres around Mitchell being caught for his indiscretions and what the consequences of his actions means for all around him, quite often with devastating results. 

Mitchell has to move about a seedy world of pornography, of cheap peekaboo bars, strip joints and snuff movies, he has to get to the level of his blackmailers so as to enact his plans with conviction. The three weasels played by Glover, Williams and Trebor are in turn slimy, menacing and a twitchy neurotic, an off-beat trio suitably framed by Frankenheimer’s sleazy and cold world. 

It may not be prime Frankenheimer but the director knows his noir onions, both in performances garnered from his strong cast and via his visual ticks. Characters are more often than not smoking or drinking liquor, sweating or looking pained as the camera gets up close and personal, the director even finds place for a bit of slatted shadow play in one sequence and menacing angled shards for another. 

Some contrivances are more annoying than hindrances, it’s a bit bloodless for a picture not lacking in action scenes, and although the finale is signposted without due care and attention, it is still sufficiently rewarding. Decadence, sleaze, greed, paranoia and moral decay come crashing together to create a sadly neglected piece of 1980s neo-noir.

The platoon is eventually deployed to Grenada in late October, 1983, in order to prevent a communist takeover and rescue some med students.

Thirteen years after “The Dirty Dozen,” Eastwood recycles the plot and adds a lot of hip comedy. Although it’s not a great military flick like “Dozen” it has its points of entertainment, but you have to roll with the odd mixture of believable military training drama with heavy doses of amusement, mainly revolving around the cartoonish character of Cpl. Stitch Jones, played with fervor by Mario Van Peebles. If you can acclimate to this odd mixture, there’s a lot to enjoy here.

It helps that the movie hooks you in with the opening jail fight involving the hard-living Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood). His reunion with his ex-wife and their potentially developing relationship is another hook. Some parts are kinda meh, but there’s enough good here if you’re in the mood for a military training flick in the form of “The Dirty Dozen” meeting “Top Gun” (1987) mixed with an edgier version of Gomer Pyle.

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot at Camp Pendleton, Southern Cal, as well as Santa Clarita (café), San Clemente (bar), El Toro (airfield homecoming) and Vieques, Puerto Rico (Grenada).

GRADE: B- || Crusty Clint is still not to be messed with.

One of Clint Eastwood's most accessible 80s movies, Heartbreak Ridge sees the gruff actor on very fine form, this even though the ""war is hell"" core that fills out the last quarter via a rather silly gun toting rescue mission in Grenada does lack conviction. The film wins its stripes courtesy of James Carabatsos' razor witty script and the sub plot involving ex wife Aggie (Marsha Mason). For all its macho posturing and training routine shenanigans (you will wish we could have stayed at boot camp once Grenada arrives), at its heart is a very tender movie about a man who can't let the career go, and simultaneously the wife (ex) who simply lived hell each day as her man was off at war (Korea/Vietnam et al).

That said, it's the comedy that has made the film one of the most quoted film's of big Clint's career. Be it Eastwood himself tossing off witty put downs to his rag tag band of men, or the likes of Mario Van Peebles hilariously looking like some punk version of Michael Jackson, there's a lot of fun to be had in every other frame. There's even a guy here whose thighs are bigger than Sly Stallone! So yes there's many stereotypes here, none more so than Everett McGill's fresh out of school prig Major Powers, and for sure the ending is never in any doubt what so ever. But get in line and enjoy the fun whilst noticing that it does have under the surface themes well worth time investment as well. 7/10 || <em>'Heartbreak Ridge'</em> is a rather good war film, one I enjoyed a fair bit.

Clint Eastwood, to no-one's surprise, is the best performer from the onscreen talent, though I did like the support cast - namely Mario Van Peebles, Boyd Gaines and Arlen Dean Snyder.

The plot is, although obvious in where it is heading, fun and holds one's attention. The score doesn't particularly stand out but there is one part around the middle which is neat. Some of the dialogue is a little cringe, but there are some good lines in there for Mr. Eastwood to quip."

One of the many treasure seeking action adventure films that surfaced after Raiders of the Lost Ark reignited the flames in 81, Firewalker has a somewhat iffy reputation. Yet it's a glorious cheese sandwich of a movie, a ball of laughs and high energy jinks, a pic where Chuck Norris, Louis Gosset Jr. and Melody Anderson are having fun and not taking it as seriously as some film punters have.

Standard rules apply here, two adventure seeking guys, very buddy buddy and playing off of each other with sarcasm and respect in equal measure, hook up with a sexy gal who has a treasure map - oh and she has a gift involving visions type of thing. Cue lots of scrapes, arguing, bit of romance, more peril, over the top bad guy (Sonny Landham) and a friend in need (an over the top John Rhys- Davies).

In this one we get to see some of Norris' martial arts skills, especially during an action packed bar-room brawl, while the intentional comedy hits the required part of the funny bone (a swimming sequence and the use of religious disguises are particularly fun packed). If you be so inclined then you can easily find problems and weaknesses in the production and technical aspects, but roll with it in the name of mindless entertainment and you can have a blast.

Three silent movie stars in 1916 (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short) are mistaken for real heroes by a beautiful Hispanic woman (Patrice Martinez) and hired to rid an oppressed Mexican village of El Guapo (Alfonso Arau) and his banditos.

“Three Amigos” (1986) is a comedy Western with elements of “The Magnificent Seven” (1960) and “The Wild Bunch” (1969). The first half is quietly amusing, but kind of dull as you try to catch a grip with the curious happenings. I wasn’t laughing and was starting to wonder what the whole hubbub was about (a respected friend of mine cited it as one of his favorite movies). 

Thankfully, the inventive second half ventures into laugh-out-loud territory starting with the iconic thirst-in-the-desert sequence. In addition, the Southwestern locations are spectacular and there are a few gorgeous Latino women. What more could you ask for in a flick like this?

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Arizona and Universal City, California.

GRADE: B+ || Just an all around fun and light-hearted comedy, one that I haven't seen in a long time (probably some time in the early 90s). Not a comedy classic but one that generates plenty of smiles and laughs. **3.75/5** || <em>'¡Three Amigos!'</em> didn't quite hit for me.

I was expecting to enjoy this 1986 film, if only because of the three leads - Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short. I like them from other things, admittedly I've only seen Chase once or twice but Short and, particularly, Martin are actors I appreciate. This flick, though, just didn't click into gear.

I didn't find it funny at all really, some gags are way too exaggerated - almost cringey. There are a couple of minor chuckles, the standout being with the invisible swordsman. Going back to the main trio, Short is probably the one who I think did the best work here. Chase felt a bit out of place in certain scenes.

Of the other cast members, Alfonso Arau and Patrice Martinez do alright. Joe Mantegna is also involved, as soon as he speaks I immediately sensed that iconic voice of Fat Tony from <em>'The Simpsons'</em>. Elsewhere, I didn't even recognise Tony Plana as Jefe - even comparing images post-watch, I'm still not even convinced it's the same guy."

Peeping Tom is directed by Michael Powell and written by Leo Marks. It stars Carl Boehm, Moira Shearer, Anna Massey, Maxine Audley and Brenda Bruce. Music is by Brian Easdale and cinematography by Otto Heller.

A famous (infamous) film for a number of reasons, not least that the fall out from its release effectively finished the career of the great Michael Powell. Interestingly now, still some 50 plus years later, there are still people discovering the film for the first time and not being sure what they have just watched; much like many critics back in 1960 as it happens! While horror seekers quite often come away disappointed that they haven’t seen a Jack the Ripper bloodshed movie. Apparently they see the words serial killer and expect gore and terror on tap.

As fans of the film will attest, Peeping Tom isn’t that sort of serial killer film, it’s a fascinating piece of work. A cunningly crafted observation of a darkened mind, of voyeurism, loneliness and child abuse. From the opening strains of Easdale’s skin itching piano the mood is set, then the brilliantly lurid colour scheme comes into play as troubled Mark Lewis (Boehm) hones in on a victim, a lady of the night about to be filmed in the throes of death. It’s the start of Powell and Marks’ ploy to make us complicit in Lewis’ actions, and then the makers challenge us to sympathise with him as his back story is revealed and also as he struggles with his affections for Helen Stephens (Massey) in the present day.

There is also a sly aside to the movie industry running through the picture, something which no doubt irked critics and film distributors back in 1960. There could maybe be an argument that the trauma and psychological thematics at work that underpin the plot are a little dated now? But what is still relevant is the film making – voyeurism angle as we today are constantly fed reality TV for entertainment purpose. The production is across the board grade “A”, the performances highly effective, with the unfairly maligned Boehm perfect as Lewis, the actor even providing shadings of Peter Lorre at times. Heller’s bold colour photography is disgustingly atmospheric, Easdale’s music a stalking menace and the sound department really come up trumps. Perfect.

Then of course there is Powell himself, deeply hurt by the savaging he received when Tom was released, it’s nice to note that before he passed away in 1990 he would see the film become a highly regarded piece of film making. It and he deserves praise, his direction is conceptually daring, his framing of Lewis methodical, and of course his camera is our eyes and ears, uncomfortably so. A remarkable and genius film. 10/10 || I can recall being genuinely scared when I first saw this film in the early 1970s. Young women are being found murdered. What makes their crimes especially heinous is the look of sheer terror found on their faces - and that is what is further perplexing the pursing Scotland Yard detective ""Gregg"" (Jack Watson). Meantime, actress ""Vivian"" (Moira Shearer) is filming her new movie and on the set is the camera-obsessed ""Mark"" (Karlheinz Böhm) who rents out the bottom part of his sprawling house to a group of youngsters. Usually keeping himself to himself, he is befriended by ""Helen"" (Anna Massey) and soon a relationship, of sorts, develops as she takes an interest in both him and his films. When tragedy occurs at the studio, the police investigation initially includes the sound stage crew, and gradually the plot unfolds in a dark and menacing fashion. Böhm and Massey are great here and under Michael Powell and Otto Heller's creative direction and photography, deliver us an intimate and well paced story that takes it's time, but does so in a cumulatively effective fashion. The dialogue is disarmingly potent too - there is something almost childlike about ""Mark"" and almost maternal about ""Massey"", illustrative of the underlying psychology of the story. On a dark night with the rain battering against the window, this is about as good as cinema gets."
2112.0,Payback,"With friends like these, who needs enemies?

This is not an out and out remake of John Boorman's 1967 offering Point Blank, the structure is different from the 67 film, and where Point Blank is a dark psychological thriller that is rightly regarded as being towards the top of the neo-noir tree, this Brian Helgeland directed film really should be seen as a different interpretation of Donald E. Westlake's novel The Hunter.

Mel Gibson plays tough as nails thief Porter, who is double crossed, shot, and then left for dead by his wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) and his partner in crime Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). We are then taken on a dark journey as Porter sets out to reclaim the $70.000 that he was shot and almost killed for. He wants no more, no less than what he is owed, and he literally will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. Including taking on the Chicago mob organisation known as The Outfit.

Payback is a mean and violent movie, it is unrelenting in its willingness to keep nastiness at the top of the story. The film is full of flawed and vile people, even Porter himself, the closest we have to a (anti) hero has badness coursing through his veins, he is a dislikable killer, the film is about exactly what the tag-line suggests, Get Ready To Root For The Bad Guy! As Porter trawls through this part of Chicago, he will come across bent coppers, drug pushers/addicts/runners, Asian gangsters, prostitutes, violence fetishists and the slimy chain of command of the Chicago mob. Nobody here is about to cheer you up.

The style of the film owes its being to classic film noir and the 1970s hard crime movies led by Dirty Harry and Death Wish. The makers had originally wanted to film it in black and white, but instead went for a de-saturation technique, a bleach by-pass process that really puts a grim grey and blue sheen on the visuals. The thumping score is tonally correct, while a good sound track also helps (always nice to see hear Voodoo Chile), and the use of voice over narration by Porter evokes the classic noir period and works a treat because it's not over done.

The film strongly relies on Mel Gibson to bring menace and a measure of sympathy to the vengeful Porter, and it is with much credit that he manages to achieve both these things skilfully. He is backed by a strong support cast, Maria Bello admirable in her big shift from TV to film - Lucy Liu hilarious and stunningly sexy as a dominatrix and Gregg Henry is just wild. The Outfit chain of command features William Devane, James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson, all slick and welcome additions, even if they are all under used; though this is more by narrative necessity than film making decisions. Bill Duke, David Paymer and Jack Conley fill out the impressive roll call of scum-bags.

Violent, laconic and darkly comic as well, Payback is one of the best remakes around, a neo-noir essential in fact. 8.5/10

Footnote: Director Helgeland released his own Directors Cut in 2006. Unhappy with the original version, he changed some of the structure and visual style and made it shorter by ten minutes. It's inferior to the 100 minute original cut in my opinion, losing much of the noir stylisations, but the last quarter is different and will (does) certainly appeal to others. || An underrated crime noir that somehow snuck it's way into the overcrowded 90s. With phrases like, ""expected horizontal refreshment"", you know this is going to be good. || _**Amusing neo-noir in Chicago with Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry and Maria Bello**_

After a heist with an Asian gang, a no-nonsense man (Mel Gibson) is left for dead by his accomplices (Gregg Henry & Deborah Kara Unger) in the underbelly of the Big City, but he unexpectedly recovers and wants vengeance, not to mention his $70,000. Maria Bello, Lucy Liu, William Devane, Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn and other notables are on hand.

""Payback"" (1999) is modern film noir with colors so muted it’s almost B&W (although I hear the Director’s Cut heightens them). It’s a remake of Coburn’s “Point Blank” (1967) and is ‘hip’ & entertaining in an amusing Tarantino kind of way, although it’s nowhere close to the greatness of “Pulp Fiction” (1994) or even “Jackie Brown” (1997). However, my wife liked it more than me and gave it 7/10, but then she’s a fan of Gibson.

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot mainly in Chicago, along with Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles with studio stuff done in Burbank. There’s also an establishing shot of Manhattan.

""Message in a Bottle"" (1999) is an entertaining drama/romance with quality actors and East Coast locations. Unfortunately, parts of the contrived plot are too much of a stretch and some seriously perplexing questions are raised that I can’t detail without spoiling the movie for first-time viewers. Write me and I’ll share them with you.

Thankfully, there’s too much good to write the movie off as worthless. For instance, there’s a well-done subplot that has to do with manly antagonism and reconciliation. The average male has too much machismo to voice sappy apologies, but they clearly apologize & reconcile in less direct ways. Just read between the lines.

When Theresa asks Garrett, ""Will you come and visit me,'' Roger Ebert complained about the (supposed) lousy writing of the latter’s response: ""You mean, inland?'' I guess he failed to notice that Garrett had a smirk on his face and was playing with Theresa wherein she giggled.

Some people complain that the film was shot in Maine while the story takes place in The Outer Banks, North Carolina, which looks nothing like Maine and insults the intelligence of the viewer. In the producers’ defense, they tried to shoot in a couple places further south, but couldn’t get permits and so had to settle for Maine (Bath, New Harbor, Phippsburg & Portland). Yet the coastal scenery isn’t much of a focus, so it’s not that big of a deal. If it really bugs you, just imagine that Garrett throws the bottles into the ocean in Maine and Theresa finds the initial message while vacationing in Nova Scotia; problem solved.   

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes, and was shot in Maine and Chicago, plus some stuff done at Falls Lake, Backlot, Universal Studios, Southern Cal.

It’s unique enough to stand on its own and is arguably on par with “Heathers” and the overrated “Mean Girls,” but it’s not as good as “Carrie” or its excellent sequel, “The Rage: Carrie 2,” which was released the same year.

McGowan is great as the alluring biyatch while Gayheart looks too old for the part at 27 during shooting, not to mention nigh anorexic. Two years after the film’s release, Rebecca hit a Hispanic kid with her car in Los Angeles and killed him, which tripped up her career.

It’s decent, has a great soundtrack and is worthwhile if you favor the cast, but don’t expect the greatness of teen flicks like ""Clueless"" (1995) and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982). The movie’s stylish enough and has its highlights, yet the story’s just not that compelling and I found myself relatively bored.

The film runs 1 hour, 27 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, Downey & Culver City, California.

<em>'My Favorite Martian'</em> is an unfunny, wide of the mark 1999 release from Disney. None of the humour got laughs, or mild amusement, out from me - except one scene involving a toilet, which is marginally amusing. It also tries to join the comedy up with heart, especially between Martin and Tim, but it simply doesn't hit. There are moments where I could tell the film wanted me to care for the character(s) but I never did.

It's also a surprisingly horny film, with iffy innuendo and even some inappropriate touching in there. If this was an <em>'American Pie'</em> type of film then it might fit, but it feels very out of place here. Zoot (Wayne Knight) confirms those words, his dumb character is obnoxious.

Knight, who is oddly uncredited, is joined by Christopher Lloyd (Martin) and Jeff Daniels (Tim). That should be a great match, but they never really click together in my opinion - a missed opportunity, for sure. Elizabeth Hurley (Brace) and Daryl Hannah (Lizzie) are also involved, though the female characters are pretty pointless - Hurley has a small part in the main plot at one point, at least.

It's a no from me. Straight into the bottom ten of Disney live-action, of the ones I've seen up until '99. Perhaps fans of the original television series will enjoy this, but I didn't."

I felt my heartstrings tug a fair number of times throughout, culminating with those lovely final few scenes; I was actually welling up, would you believe? Any longer and tears may have been shed <i>*shudder*</i>. I've basically only seen one movie this last month - what has the break done to me?!

Humour aside, I did love this though. I've said it before, but to be honest if you give me what I consider to be great cast performances then I'm practically sold on the film upon that coming to fruition. Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific (this still doesn't surpass <em>'Source Code'</em>, mind) as lead.

Chris Cooper is ace, as are Laura Dern and Natalie Canerday. Chris Owen (Sherminator!), Chad Lindberg (Jesse!) and William Lee Scott (eh... well, Roy Lee as of now!) are good supports to Gyllenhaal as well. Even the likes of Elya Baskin and Randy Stripling add needed small bits.

The music is good too, especially towards the end; early on it kinda goes with what I said about the flick being a tad cheesy and/or cliché. I would describe the movie as that to be frank, but that is more endearing than anything else. I'm fine with those things if it works, which it pleasantly does here.

RELEASED IN 1999 and directed by Joel Schumacher, ""8MM"" chronicles events when a private investigator (Nicolas Cage) is hired by an aged wealthy woman whose husband recently passed away. A snuff film was found in his safe and she wants to see if the girl in the movie (Jenny Powell) really died or not. Amy Morton appears as the girl’s mother while Joaquin Phoenix plays a wannabe rock musician in Los Angeles who works in the porn trade. Catherine Keener is on hand as the P.I.’s wife. 
 
The movie combines the basic plot of “Hardcore” (1979) with the style of late 90’s crime thrillers, like “Kiss the Girls” (1997). The first half involves the P.I.’s tracking down the makers of the snuff film. While it’s tedious work (which I wouldn’t want to do) this part of the movie is gritty and compelling. The second half of the movie goes into material that’s difficult to pull off with a straight face, like the smut-obsessed underbelly of Los Angeles & New York. The main villains come off cartoonish somehow rather than gritty realistic, but it’s a fine line.  

Still, I like the message of the movie. My wife & I knew a wealthy man who passed away a few years ago. He often didn’t pay the people he did business with, not to mention his employees who were living paycheck to paycheck. Someone asked him how he could own two Cadillacs and regularly go on globetrotting vacations while treating people like this and he arrogantly responded: “Because I caaAAAN.” The low-lifes in “8MM” have a similar attitude.      

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 3 minutes and was shot in Miami, Pennsylvania (Wormleysburg/Harrisburg), New York (Hastings-on-Hudson, Elmsford, Yonkers, Queens & Long Island) and S. Cal. (Los Angeles & Long Beach). WRITER: Andrew Kevin Walker. ADDITIONAL CAST: Anthony Heald plays the rich woman’s lawyer while James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare and Chris Bauer appear as smut pervs.   

GRADE: B || 8MM probably only got greenlit due to the success of Se7en. Like Se7en, 8MM explores the existence of people who are simply pure evil while the main character wants to know why they are like this. 8MM doesn't provide many answers but it also isn't thematically complex. It follows a standard whodunit plot. While Nicolas Cage gives a solid performance, there are times where he takes us out of the story with his signature freak outs. Joel Schumacher manages to create a gritty tone but he has a rather bland style.

Regardless of its flaws, 8MM is still a decent movie. It prefers plot over exploitation and story over violence. For those reasons, I recommend it. || Another one of Nicholas Cage's crazy movies. Like all the rest of his movies, this one was good too."

A detached chain-smoking private detective in Los Angeles (Elliott Gould) finds himself hounded by the police after driving a friend to Mexico late one night (Jim Bouton). Upon taking a gig by the wife of a writer to find her missing alcoholic husband (Nina van Pallandt & Sterling Hayden) he finds himself staving off gangsters in search of $350,000 (Mark Rydell, David Arkin, etc.) while trying to connect the dots. Henry Gibson is on hand as a Southern Cal quack.     

“The Long Goodbye” (1973) is a crime drama/mystery with Altman’s art-film style that takes Raymond Chandler’s 1953 novel and transports it to twenty years in the future with muttering Philip Marlowe (Gould) being anachronistic in modern sun-drenched L.A. with its nude sunbathers, all-night supermarkets, swank beach houses, eccentric artists, hedonists, medical quacks, avaricious gangsters and fitness nuts. (Speaking of the latter, watch out for a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in his second film role, although it’s just a glorified cameo).  

Screenwriter Leigh Brackett naturally changed a few things in the story with the most radical being a slightly different ending, which offends purists, but totally works for me (for reasons I can’t explain because I don't want to spoil anything). These changes plus Altman’s quirky flair turned off critics upon the film’s initial release, although both Siskel & Ebert gave it a ‘Thumbs Up’ with Gene liking it even more than Roger. The movie was rereleased with a more accurate ad campaign, utilizing Mad magazine’s Jack Davis to do the poster (Google it), wherein it was received better, gaining back some money. It has gone on to become a deserved cult movie in the decades since. Nevertheless, this was pretty much the end of Gould’s career as a leading man (although he continued to be a successful working actor).

It took me a while to acclimate to the muttering private eye trapped in the Bizarro world of Southern Cal approach, not to mention the improvisational feel, but the flick won me over. Being a cat lover, the opening sequence caught my interest, but there’s a LOT to like here, including the idea of an old-fashioned honest man pushed around and underestimated by everyone, yet ultimately revealing his expertise and strength (which brings to mind Columbo). To appreciate it, you have to be braced for something different, which of course Altman is known for.    

The film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Malibu, Los Angeles, Pasadena and Morelos, Mexico.

GRADE: B || Pretty good 1970s-era neo-noir drama almost entirely relies on the performance from Elliot Gould and the mystery element was well done, though the ending was somewhat predictable but satisfying. **3.75/5** || Proof if ever it were needed that no good deed goes unpunished! ""Marlowe"" (Elliott Gould) is woken up in the middle of the night by his mate (""Lennox"") who urgently needs driving to Tijuana. He obliges, only to find that on his return the police are waiting for him. Seems that his pal's wife has been found slain. Initially considered an accomplice, he's release when information arrives suggesting the prime suspect has committed suicide. Things take a turn for the more complex when hood ""Augustine"" (Mark Rydell) shows up trying to track down his missing cash that ""Lennox"" was supposed to be couriering and then finally, ""Eileen"" (Nina van Pallandt) hires him to find her dipso husband (Sterling Hayden) who has gone awol. When ""Marlowe"" finds the latter man, he soon begins to suspect that all three incidents are connected - and that he is being played! He now has to use all of his Poirot-esque skills to try to piece together just what is going on - whilst staying alive! Gould is on his best form in this quickly paced and well adapted version of the Raymond Chandler novel. The dialogue is often entertainingly quick-witted and he easily assumes the role of this smart-ass and hard-nosed PI. The story has plenty of twists and turns, the supporting characters are interesting rather than just fodder and the manner in which the investigation is carried out leaves us ferreting around for clues just like him! I wasn't ever really a fan of Gould, but he's good here and this is well worth a watch."

There is no evidence of it ever being a common practice, though it's a persistent myth in Japan.

The Stephen King novel from which the screenplay was adapted very nearly didn’t see the light of day. It was actually written by King based on a real place and instances during a stay at a rented house. He was never quite happy with the tone of the book and only submitted it as a contractual obligation. Glad he did because it provides a very solid grounding for horror and deals with the very real horrors of overwhelming grief.

The film gets the tonal flows right, the family dynamic is neatly pitched in readiness for what is to come later, the house and the titular Pet Sematary of the title are eerie personified, and Fred Gwynne is on hand for a sage old characterisation. The potential for shattering horror is not fully realised, yet the makers deliver a good quota of scares and unease to make this a better than average King adaptation to screen. The use of the Ramones in the soundtrack is a good one, King loved them, they loved him, so much so they wrote the title track and named an album after it. 6.5/10 || Even if it wasn't any good, Pet Sematary's sort of a must watch given how heavily it's been referenced in the film and television industries since. But it is good, so there's that too.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || The ""Creed"" family relocate to a rural town in Maine where the father - ""Louis"" (Dale Midkiff) is to be a local doctor. They don't get off to a great start after the beloved cat of daughter ""Ellie"" (Blaze Berdahl) gets squashed by a passing vehicle and so it is ceremoniously buried in an ancient graveyard populated by centuries-worth of other pre-loved animals. Their neighbours are very reticent to discuss this facility - it is rumoured to have oddly recuperative powers which to his shock and horror prove true when the moggy comes back - and with attitude too! The troubles for the young doctor only get worse when a real human tragedy occurs and he is faced with the ultimate dilemma... It's more of a cumulative story this - like many of Stephen KIng's stories. The plot builds by degree and is told here in a way that almost asks us what we might do differently from ""Louis"" even though we see, and can readily anticipate, the consequences of his actions. The horror here is not so much garish and scary, but human and almost voluntary - and that makes it a little more effective. There's no getting away from it, though. The acting is mediocre and the visual effects at times reminded me of an old episode of ""Bagpuss"". I am not now, nor ever have been a pet lover - so the underlying premiss of hysteria when the cat gets splatted also never really resonated with me either. Still, it is an eerie and solid story that challenges a lot of assumptions about love and rational behaviour and is still worth a watch."

Christine is directed by John Carpenter and adapted to screenplay by Bill Phillips from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Carpenter and Alan Howarth and cinematography is by Donald M. Morgan.

How Do You Kill Something That Can’t Possibly Be Alive?

1983 was a busy year for Stephen King adaptations to the screen, along with Christine there was also Cujo and The Dead Zone, so for fans of the legendary author there was plenty to chew on. Christine tells the story of a possessed car that takes over the life of the school nerd, with devastating consequences. As a story that’s pretty much all there is to it, the beauty of the pic is how Carpenter ensures the car really does have a malevolent life of its own. The theme at work such as automobile obsession and the bonkers love story at the narrative heart, are not sacrificed for cheap shocks and gimmickry, but Carpenter rightly made the car the star and she doesn’t disappoint.

Christine’s move from being a knackered old banger to super shiny speedster runs concurrent with Arnie Cunningham’s (Gordon) transformation. Where once was the misfit being bullied, is now a supremely confident dude, he even dates one of the school babes. But with Christine’s love and protection comes great danger, and this lets Carpenter craft some super scenes. From self healing to fiery vengeance, the director brings his lensing skills to the party. Music, unsurprisingly for Carpenter, plays a key part as well. A ream of 50s Rock “n” Roll tunes play out of Christine’s radio to align with what is unfolding on screen, while the score is distinctly Carpenteresque.

Cast are very good in their efforts, though more of the wonderful H. D. Stanton should have been a requisite. Unfortunately the screenplay doesn’t afford many character instances to run smoothly, it sometimes feels like the studio demanded that Carpenter hurry up to the next Christine is evil scene instead of building the character bridges! However, it’s a film that may be undeniably 80s in tone of film making, but it has aged surprisingly well. Suspenseful, exciting and devilishly playful, this is another Carpenter movie worthy of re-evaluation. 8/10 || One of the most intriguing coming-of-age stories in cinema, and this tends to be overlooked, both as a Stephen King story and horror film, in place of the more sensationalized frolic and mayhem of works such as 'The Shining', 'Carrie', 'Misery' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', which is a crying shame, because: a) John Carpenter is probably the finest director (at least Top 3) ever involved with King adaptations; and b) it perfectly conceptualizes, like earlier short experimental films by the likes of Kenneth Anger, the downright uncomfortable sleaziness and fetishism that has existed, mainly in America, between men and their cars.

Keith Gordon does some really fine acting here (as he did previously for Brian De Palma in 'Dressed to Kill') as all possible dynamics along the range from nerd to psycho. It's impressive that, while growing up in film, he obviously learned some of the tricks of the trade from such cinematic greats (at least of American film of the past 50 years) and ended up becoming a decent film helmer himself.

9/10 for me; Grade A Carpenter. It simply isn't top-tier for me, of his oeuvre, because I know he, like Sir Alfred Hitchcock, De Palma and other greats, is capable of cinematic perfection (Halloween, The Thing, etc.). || “She’s a killer!” Said one of the promotional posters for John Carpenter’s feature film, based on the homonymous best-selling novel by famous writer Stephen King. Since its 1983 release, the movie has become a cult-classic, especially for gearheads and horror fans, thanks to its premise.

But is the movie a killer thriller or just a clunker 1980s film? For this reviewer, it is an absolutely enjoyable, fun to watch deep character study. Carpenter turns his wrenches on King’s over the top supernatural material, and polishes it into a clearer, more relatable version of the horror romance. 

The plot is intriguing to say the least. In the 1980s, a young, bullied nerd, Arnold “Arnie” Cunningham, buys a trashed red 1957 Plymouth Fury (named Christine by its previous owner) purely by impulse, as if he had fallen in love at first sight. He becomes obsessed with restoring the automobile to its former glory. His personality begins to change after that, as noticed by his best friend, Dennis, and his brand new girlfriend, Leigh. The car does share Arnie’s feelings, and will do anything to protect him… Even from his loved ones. An interesting take on an unhealthy romance, in which the parties are jealous and obsessed with one another, differing from King’s book, that used tropes such as possession to dictate the supernatural elements of the story.

If there was one person to be able to make a film of this sort, it had to be John Carpenter. Coming out of what would be (years later) considered one of his most important works, The Thing, one year prior, he took the director’s chair for the Christine project. Despite also being known for adventure thrillers (like Escape From New York and Assault on Precinct 13) and satirical takes on other genres (Dark Star being an example), he is considered one of the masters of the horror cinema, and it is not for no reason, as he had vast experience in the genre, with all time classics such as Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980) and the aforementioned The Thing (1982) already under his belt. After Christine, his horror resumé would only expand, with the additions of They Live (1988) and Blood River (1991). 
Even though Carpenter is greatly responsible for the success of Christine, he says it was one of his easiest works, which leads us to the reason he affirms such a thing: the phenomenal acting by rising star Keith Gordon. 

Gordon was an eager-to-learn filmmaker aspirant by that time, but also a rising name on the acting scene. Despite being more concentrated on plays at the moment, he took the part and made a good team with the director. Bringing creative elements such as changing his hairstyle when his personality would change, he took the challenge of a (as he described) Jekyll-and-Hyde, rangy type of character surprisingly well, having a noticeable division between the Arnie of the beginning and the Arnie of the ending. Alexandra Paul did a great job bringing the element of the worried lady in Leigh. John Stockwell played Dennis, the jock, the successful best friend of the loser. Despite being fun to watch,Stockwell was playing a stereotype, so his acting was what needed to be expected from the 80s hero. It wasn’t bland, in no way, but not outstanding. Stockwell would go on to retire from acting and become a filmmaker. But what is interesting about the casting choices in Christine is that the producer, Richard Kobritz, and the director agreed on having less human star power to its cast, to give the spotlight to the real star of the film: The 1957 Plymouth Fury, Christine herself.

The soundtrack is something to behold. The incredible 1980s electro-style original compositions blend so well into their scenes, because they were made by no other than John Carpenter himself, in his long time collaboration with Alan Howarth. The two composers also worked together in They Live, The Thing, Halloween and many others. When the one who is guiding the scenes makes the pieces who will accompany them, the two things become intrinsically related, assuring a good completion between the two. But something not to be overlooked is the amazing selection of 1950s songs, through which Christine “communicates”. They are a key element coming from the book itself (every chapter starts with a 50s Rock ‘n’ Roll quote), and represent Stephen King’s love for that time period. The rockabilly selection includes Buddy Holly’s Not Fade Away, Dion and the Belmonts’ I Wonder Why, and Danny and the Juniors’ Rock and Roll is Here to Stay. This blends not only with Christine’s communication, but also with Arnie becoming more “1950s” as the movie progresses, influenced by his obsession with his beloved car. And, of course, there needs to be an honorable mention to George Thorogood and the Destroyers’ Bad to the Bone, that features in a chilling opening.

Visually, the film is quite smart, especially for a time in which virtually no special effects were available. Using practical effects, such as recording a car being smashed in reverse, to create the effect of it rebuilding itself, the creativity is what pays off for a film that won’t look visually dated, even well over three and a half decades since its first release.

At the end of the road, Christine is a V8 powered monster movie thrill ride, with some old fashioned scares, a banger soundtrack, an acting with little turbo lag, visual effects that corner like they were on rails, and a pace that doesn’t run out of steam. Despite the premise being considered “silly”, the result can appeal to regular horror fans and gearheads alike… And she is ready to show you why."

During a snowstorm at Lincoln International Airport in Chicago, the manager of the airport (Burt Lancaster) works overtime to clear the main runway of a Boeing 707 that’s stuck in the snow while dealing with his failing marriage. Meanwhile the next flight to Rome piloted by his brother-in-law (Dean Martin) has a suspicious person with an attaché case on board (Van Heflin). George Kennedy plays the head mechanic, Jean Seberg a customer relations agent, Jacqueline Bisset a flight attendant and Helen Hayes a stowaway.    

""Airport"" (1970) was the movie that kicked-off the disaster craze of the 70s. It’s not great like “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972), but it’s more compelling and less bloated than “The Towering Inferno” (1974). The soap operatic first half paves the way for the disaster-oriented second. It’s intentionally old-fashioned and was a huge hit at the box office. I wasn’t sure about it for the first 20 minutes, but I then found myself involved in the characters and their story, keeping my interest till the end.

After disaster films developed a bad rap years later, Lancaster panned “Airport” as the “worst piece of junk ever made,” which is ironic considering it was his most successful movie at the box office BY FAR.  

The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes, and was shot at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Minneapolis, and Universal Studios, Universal City, California.

With the disaster genre of film now in full effect by the mid 70s, it was inevitable that we would see a follow up to the forerunner that was Airport (1970). One again we get a star cast list, this time thrust into mid-air peril where standard genre conventions apply. Unfortunately this is one of the weakest genre entries of the decade, where suspense is hard to find, and in fact it often comes off like unintentional comedy. Draw card actor Charlton Heston is wasted, as is George Kennedy, while the predictability factor of how it will pan out sort of kills hope of a thrilling finale.

Not a total stinker, there's some nice aerial sequences, some rich characterisations, and Karen Black as the under duress cabin crew member trying to fly the plane, is at least convincing enough to sell the terror of the situation. But really it's a tough sell, especially when you consider that genre highlight ""The Towering Inferno"" was released this same year. 5/10 || Really solid action-thriller disaster flick that in some ways is better than the first, especially being leaner and going away from the overly long soap opera storyline that took up half the running time.

The last half hour sees the likes of Christopher Lee; Olivia de Havilland and Joseph Cotton caught up in a series of mini-melodramas as their lives and foibles are aired for us all to see - and none too interestingly, either. The special effects were clearly filmed in a fish tank (albeit one for big fish); the dialogue is fairly bland and the John Cacavas score tries hard to pick up much of the heavy lifting from a cast that neither gelled nor shone here. Happily, we were coming to the end of this often successful genre now - and certainly the idea had been well flogged to death by the time this appeared.

I'm not in this for kicks.

Rollercoaster is directed by James Goldstone and co-adapted to screenplay by Sanford Sheldon, Richard Levinson and William Link from a suggested Tommy Cook story. It stars George Segal, Timothy Bottoms, Richard Widmark, Harry Guardino, Susan Strasberg and Helen Hunt. A Panavision/Technicolor production in Sensurround, it features music by Lalo Schifrin and photography by David M. Walsh.

A psychopathic bomber known only as ""Young Man"" (Bottoms) is causing terror at American theme parks. When safety inspector Harry Calder (Segal) is brought in to investigate, it sets off a cat and mouse game as the ""Young Man"" ups the ante...

Even now Rollercoaster is still wrongly being lumped in with the disaster movie genre that surfaced in the 1970s. Released at a time when that particular genre of film was fading out, Rollercoaster is anything but a disaster movie. What it is, in fact, is a psychopath character based thriller that adheres to procedural values and character involvement. As it runs at nearly two hours in length should notify viewers that it isn't a film chocked full of Rollercoaster sequences and explosive pyrotechnics. Yes, there's some exciting ""Coaster"" sequences, neatly shown to us in POV, and in spite of the (obvious 1970s) use of dummies for the plot set up carnage, this thrives on human interest and race against the clock suspense.

The marker is set early on as Bottoms' smirking killer sets up his first murderous act whilst listening to some deathly string arrangement on his cassette player. We then segue into funfair music as the joys of the amusement park brings a warmth and calm to the viewer, this however is soon vanquished as the terror that a terrorist can bring comes right to the fore. From here on in the Bottoms character remains mysterious, but we now know just what he is capable of. Likewise does Segal's character, as do the likes of Widmark's Agent Hoyt and the rest of the ""suits"" frantically scratching around trying to avert further tragedy as the fresh faced bomber demands money with menaces. This ensures the bulk of the film is made up of Calder and Young Man interactions and police procedural movements. It has much talk, very much so, but it's well scripted dialogue and heightens the tension as we enter the final third.

One of the few films to feature the Sensurround gimmick, the film perhaps logically loses much impact on the small screen. Prints of the film are only adequate, and the sound mix doesn't shake your lounges in the way it certainly did back in 1970s theatres. Yet this is still a damn fine suspense picture, a pic that also carries with it some stoic performances from Segal and Widmark - and a chillingly effective villainous turn from the undervalued Bottoms. Henry Fonda is on the credits, but really it's just an early cameo appearance, while there's much interest value in watching future Academy Award winner Helen Hunt as the young daughter of Harry Calder.

Expect a taut thriller like ""Two-Minute Warning"", which was released the previous year, and you hopefully will not feel at all let down. Expecting a two hour disaster movie full of Coaster Carnage, however, will only lead to a crushing disappointment. 8/10"

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || **_An oversized alligator from the sewers of Chicago breaks loose_**

A baby alligator is flushed down the toilet in Chicago and mutates to great size from eating chemically contaminated dog carcasses in the sewers. A policeman (Robert Forster) and a beautiful reptile expert (Robin Riker) team-up to track down the beast when it escapes the sewers and preys on citizens.

“Alligator” (1980) is kind of boring for the first half hour or so, but the last hour perks up and generally keeps your attention. Unlike ""Jaws"" (1975), which is completely serious and scary, most adults won't take ""Alligator"" too seriously or find it remotely scary. 

In fact, I busted out laughing numerous times when the creature would attack people. Speaking of which, you'll sometimes hear Jaws-imitation suspense music as the creature approaches its prey. Some viewers understandably compare ""Alligator"" to another “Jaws” rip-off flick, ""Piranha"" (1978), but that movie’s all-around more entertaining.

What makes ""Alligator"" mandatory is the awe-inspiring Robin Riker, who doesn't appear until half an hour into the story. From thereon she's featured prominently. Robin was 28 during shooting but possesses such a mature and classy air that she seems at least 35. While I’m on the subject, watch out for the blonde reporter in a red jacket and jeans at about the halfway point (43 minutes). Like Robin, she has an exquisite figure sculptured by God Himself.

There are also some highlights that you won’t likely see in pictures nowadays. For instance, a kid gets chewed up in a suburban pool. And a “great white hunter” (Henry Silva) amusingly corrals three black dudes in the urban jungle to assist him in his hunt. Of course this wouldn’t be “politically correct” today.

The movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles and the Los Angeles River.

GRADE: B- || It's snappy.

After an irate father flushes down the toilet his daughter's baby alligator, the creature feeds on dumped animals that have been tested with a growth hormone. Thus the gator grows into a 36 foot long monster that promptly terrorises Chicago.

With a rather witty John Sayles script, tidy effects work and Lewis Teague's knowingly ""B"" movie direction, Alligator turns out to be one of the better post Jaws copy-cats. Very much using a satirical slant, Alligator's gigantic horror is born out of dubious suit types involved in conspiracies. While the cheery pay back that comes the way of various gits responsible for the growth of super gator is rewarding to say the least. Peperred with in jokes as well, Alligator also benefits from having the considerable talents of Robert Forster and Dean Jagger in the cast. They may look a touch bewildered at times, more out of a sense of fun one feels, but they give it gusto supreme and carry the picture to the bloody and entertaining finale.

A million miles away from Jaws of course, but this is a funny, enjoyable and different type of animal. 6.5/10"

RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by John Guillermin, ""The Towering Inferno"" details events in San Francisco when the world's tallest building, The Glass Tower (138 stories), catches aflame due to an electrical short and threatens hundreds of lives during the grand dedication ceremony. Paul Newman plays the architect, Steve McQueen the fire chief, William Holden the wealthy contractor and Richard Chamberlain his arrogant cost-cutting son-in-law.

This overblown disaster flick has a great all-star cast and was a huge success at the box office, but it pales in comparison to “The Poseidon Adventure,” released two years earlier. It lacks the compelling story, the great human interest and iconic score (even though John Williams composed both), plus it’s 48 minutes longer than “Poseidon,” which gives it a tedious vibe; that is, until the engrossing last half hour.

On the female front there’s the striking Faye Dunaway, the architect’s babe; Susan Blakely, who looks great in tight slacks; and Susan Flannery, who’s smokin’ in a shirt & panties. Unfortunately, whereas “Poseidon” knocked it out of the ballpark with its women, “Towering” fails to capitalize on its resources.

The film’s has its attractions and is still worth seeing if you favor the cast and 70’s disaster flicks. It’s just a letdown considering its streamlined predecessor and potential.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 45 minutes and was shot in San Francisco and Los Angeles. WRITERS: Stirling Silliphant wrote the script based on the books “The Tower” by Richard Martin Stern and “The Glass Inferno” by Thomas N. Scortia & Frank M. Robinson. ADDITIONAL CAST NOTABLES: Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, O.J. Simpson, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner and Mike Lookinland (aka Bobby Brady).

GRADE: B-/C+ || The crowning glory of a much maligned genre. 

A newly built state of the art high-rise is hosting a big society gathering when a fire starts up on the 81st floor...

Warner Brothers & 20th Century Fox were both keen to cash in on the success of 1972s The Poseidon Adventure, Warner's buying the rights to The Tower, and Fox buying the rights to The Glass Inferno, both novels about burning skyscrapers and seemingly ripe for a big screen adaptation. Enter producer Irwin Allen who smartly suggested that both studios should come together and produce one blockbusting genre defining film. Splitting the cost down the middle, The Towering Inferno was born and went on to make over $100 million across the globe, a very impressive take for its time, and certainly a shot in the arm for disaster genre enthusiasts.

The Towering Inferno is far from flawless, it contains some cheese sodden dialogue, and the film's running time doesn't quite do the film any favours. However, the film's strengths far outweigh the handful of negatives that are often used to beat it up with. The sets are fabulous (Academy Award Nominated) and all to perish in the fire, the cinematography from Fred J Koenekamp (Academy Award Winner) is lush and puts the fire in the eyes, while the score from John Williams (Academy Award Nominated) is suitably poignant and edgy. What about the action sequences? The set pieces? With many of the illustrious cast doing their own stunts! All impacting sharp on the ears thanks to the brilliant sound from Soderberg & Lewis (Academy Award Nominated), with the cast itself a reminder of a wonderful time when only the big names were considered for the big projects, McQueen, Newman, Holden, Astaire (Academy Award Nominated) & Dunaway rolling off the tongue like a who's who of entertainment heavyweights.

Some say that The Towering Inferno finally killed off the ailing disaster genre, no it didn't, it crowned it, and all the others that followed were merely trailing in its wake. The Towering Inferno is a spectacular production that positively booms with high entertainment values, no expense is spared in the pursuit of entertaining the masses, it's thoughtful in texture and it teaches as it plays and it remains to me a wonderful archaic gem. 9/10"

I wanted to see it before I get into the new television series of the same name based on this. This is totally amazing film, especially coming from the early 70s. Obviously everyone understands the cowboy culture, because it was from the past. But mixing it with the future was the real beauty here. The robots and all, I don't think all the people from that era understood it clearly, but surely they have got entertained. So now, people do have knowledge about the things what in this film was talked, but still this film is effective despite the technology differs.

No doubt this film was the source of inspiration for many films that came after it. That's what I was remembering while watching that so many titles popped in my mind. So hats off to the creator of this. But looking at its rating and reviews, seems an under-rated and under-recognised film. The story was kept simple, not making any complication, either technical terms or characters and the story developments.

The two friends head for an amusement part where they can have the real wild wild west holiday by drawing the arms against the robots. But one day when something goes wrong, one of them who got stranded there, looks for a way out and how he makes it told in the remaining narration. It does not give any reason why malfunction happened. Because that's how things happen right, like when a plane crash, we investigate what caused it later. So in this, it was just focused on a disaster, but the first half of was different which was more an introduction to what kind of world the story sets in.

If 'Star Wars' is the father of all the space films and 'The Lord of the Rings' for all the fantasy films, then this must be the father of all the dystopian films that we see in the present cinema. Certainly it is not a masterpiece, but the idea of the film plot stands alone. It opened the door for the similarly themed films like 'Night of the Living Dead' did for the zombie films. A must, must see film, particularly by the film fanatics.

I frst saw this film on its first run on CBS. I was in junior high and a hard core sci-fi fan. I was hooked from the first scene. Written by the late great Rod Serling based on the novel by Pierre Boulle, the story is very engaging. After we are introduced to an ANSA Mission Commander named Colonel Taylor, we are treated to a roller-coaster type sequence as we see the re-entry and crash of Taylor's ship subjectively; as if we were aboard her. The abandon ship scenes are still impressive even by today's standards. It's very easy to believe we are seeing a real spacecraft crashed in the water. The next sequence basically establishes Taylor's personality. To be blunt, he is an arrogant jerk. He mentions hoping to find something better than Man. In a literal casr of ""Be careful what you wish for"", he spends the rest of the film trying to prove the opposite. After he and his two crew members encounter a tribe of wild, mute humans, the sci-fi element takes on a horror flavor as a terrifying horn sounds. We are then introduced to the higher lifeforms of the planet which happen to be apes. The hunting sequences are both exciting and disturbing. As we are familiarized with the film's antagonists, we get a bit of comedy relief as we hear Julius, the zoo-keeper say ""Human see, human do"" The simian characters are all wonderfully written and acted. 
I had heard many times about the ending, but actually seeing Miss Liberty half buried and weathered like that was still a shock. CBS edited Heston's agonized reaction to merely ""DAMN YOU!!"". I didn't hear the uncut version until I rented it on VHS about 2 decades later when I got my first VCR. The new Apes films are well made but I will always prefer this one. I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it. || I'm a seeker, too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. Has to be.

Planet of the Apes is directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and adapted to screenplay by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling from the 1963 Pierre Boulle novel La planete des singes. It stars Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and Leon Shamroy is the cinematographer.

3978 A.D. and a spaceship and its crew crash down on a distant planet. Three astronauts survive the crash, they appear to be on a planet not unlike their own, Earth. But soon they come to learn that this planet is ruled by intelligent apes, the human being is the lesser species, mute and of basic intelligence..

It was a tough sell to studios back in the 1960s, not only was the premise that formed Pierre Boulle's novel a tricky one, but the technical aspects, cost and quality of, also had the men in suits backing away from producer Arthur P. Jacobs and beefcake actor Charlton Heston. Eventually Dick Zanuck over at Fox nervously agreed to make it as long as significant tests ensured that farce would not follow. Stumping up $50,000 for John Chambers to develop the ape make up and masks, and a successful test run acted out by Edward G. Robinson as Dr Zaius opposite Heston, Planet of the Apes was given the green light. The script went through a number of changes as Serling and Wilson tossed around ideas to improve on Boulle's page turner, while Heston himself felt that the novel as written was unfilmable. Elsewhere, when director Schaffner came on board, he himself went for a more primitive ape world as opposed to the one under consideration that featured futuristic high rises and super advanced technology. What came out at the end of it all thankfully is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.

What would follow the success of the film is well known, a number of inferior sequels, a TV series, a remake and even a prequel in 2011. Then of course there was the toys, models, comics, cartoons and T shirts - it at times felt in the 70s that there really was a Planet of the Apes, only this one was driven by commerce. The aftermath of the original film has not done it any favours, the lines have become blurred, with so much muck and tack about, it often gets forgotten just how clinically great Schaffner's movie is. If ever there was a film that deserves to be a standalone, this is the one. Follow Heston's brawny Taylor from the pitiful planting of the stars and stripes at the beginning, to that monumental ending, and then leave it at that, do not pass go, do not venture further into any sort of monkey business. No sequel necessary, for Planet of the Apes to truly hit you with maximum impact, it all needs to end right there on that shoreline. As the great Rod Serling intended in fact.

Thematically the picture is acknowledged as being caustically strong, a sociological allegory, with pinches of racial animus just for flavouring. It might be under the guise of a sci-fi movie, but the makers aren't trying to hide it. Whilst the narrative twitches with comment, whoosh was that an aside to the Scopes trial? Film is also full of visceral thrills, pop-culture references and unnerving (alienation like) photographic beauty. The former comes with the hunt sequence, where we first meet gorilla's on horses, with guns and attitude, the latter with Shamroy's Panavision/De Luxe colour lensing of the California and Arizona locations. All enhanced by Goldsmith's aural pinging percussive led score. And while we continue to remember some of those famous bits of dialogue, we also pick up on each revisit to the film those little slices of humour slotted into the story - human see, human do indeed and the visual cheek of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil...

Film of course hinges on Heston's central human performance, of which he delivers athletic guts and subtle nuances in equal measure. Taylor's character arc demands repeat viewings to fully appreciate what Heston brings to the role. Take in the cynical Taylor who wanders through the Forbidden Zone in the first quarter, then marry it up to the Taylor fighting for his life in the middle, and finally to the Taylor at the denouement, it's a three pronged acting turn of some undervalued distinction. Not all muscular ""presence"" actors are/were able to be credible, Heston was. Around him in the monkey suits are true professionals, Hunter, McDowall, Evans (coming in for Robinson who feared for is health in the suit) and Whitmore, while Harrison in the non speaking human role of Nova does her job of looking gorgeous! All that's left to say is that Schaffner, who would win the Academy Award for Best Director two years later for Patton, pulls it all together neatly. 10/10 || A sci-fi film so groundbreaking (in too many ways to list here) let's suffice it to say that everything that came after it owes the film a debt as large as Kubrick's 2001, also made in '68. Anyone who enjoyed the recent reboot trilogy needs to seek this one out."

A great, dark sequel to the original classic that goes beyond the downbeat ending of the original and gives us an even more depressing one! No mean feat considering how bleak the ending to the first movie was.

I love this movie. The legendary James Franciscus _(The Valley Of Gwangi_)  is astronaut Brent - sent to find the missing Taylor. He finds him, of course, deep _beneath_ the ruins of a post apocalyptic city - imprisoned by _psychotic mutants_ with the power of telepathy.

Meanwhile, those _pesky apes_ are marching on the city to find out just what the hell is going on and what all the kerfuffle is about regarding reports of _crucified apes and bleeding statues._

This all leads to a shocking climax _you wont forget in a long time._

It's all rather disturbing and that is precisely why it succeeds.


- Potential Kermode || _**Classic Sci-Fi Adventure with a KILLER Ending**_  

Of the five original ""Planet of the Apes"" films only the first one (1968) and this sequel, ""Beneath"" (1970), are truly great and worthwhile. The three prequels devolve in quality: ""Escape from"" (1971) has its points of interest and amusement, ""Conquest of"" (1972) is okay, but too one-dimensional, and ""Battle for"" (1973) is weak. ""Beneath"" is the only actual sequel, hence, both the original and ""Beneath"" should be digested as one long story.

The plot revolves around astronaut, James Franciscus, landing on the ape planet in search of Taylor & his crew. He makes contact with a primitive babe who knew Taylor (Nova, played by jaw-dropping Linda Harrison) and then embarks upon a quest to find him, leading first to the ape city and then to the ""forbidden zone,"" a holocaust-ruined wasteland with a cryptic underground refuge.

Growing up, I always favored ""Beneath"" above the original film. Why? Possibly because ""Beneath"" has a lot more action, especially toward the end, and the concept of the psychic mutants was both eerie and captivating. As an adult, however, I've come to appreciate the original in increasing measure; it's deeper than ""Beneath,"" more intellectual. Each film has its strengths and weaknesses and they compliment each other well.

Many criticize James Franciscus as a Heston clone. Although this is a valid complaint (Linda Harrison described Franciscus as a smaller version of Charleton Heston) and Heston as Taylor is indeed inimitable (so don't even try), I never had a problem with Franciscus in this film. He does a fine job in the role of the stranded astronaut on a planet of madness. His character, Brent, isn't disillusioned with humanity like Taylor, so he has less of an 'edge,' but Brent is a fine generic 'everyman.’

All the main characters from the first film are present. Aside from Nova and Taylor, the story features Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius. Unfortunately Roddy McDowall wasn't available to play Cornelius so they brought in David Watson for the part, which isn't much of a problem because you can't tell beneath all the ape make-up and Watson does a splendid job mimicking McDowall. A new character is introduced and that is Ursus, the gorilla general, played by James Gregory (remember him from the original Star Trek episode ""Dagger of the Mind""?). Who could ever forget Ursus' motivational speech: ""The only good human is a DEAD human!!""? 

There are numerous great scenes and images; for example, the gorillas marching in the forbidden zone and the gigantic appearance of their revered Lawgiver with a bleeding face, then collapsing.

Some criticize that the first half of the story is merely an inferior repeat of the original film (astronaut crashlands, discovers that apes rule the planet and ends up in ape city), but it was great the first time around, why not experience it again with some nuances? (Especially since ""Beneath"" was released two years after the original). I admit that this section of ""Beneath"" isn't as great as the original, it's even kind of boring (that is, after seeing the first film), but WAIT till Brent and Nova escape ape city and discover a mysterious and intriguing underground lair.

One beef I've always had with ""Beneath"" is that Leonard Rosenman's blaring score is a little mediocre compared to Jerry Goldsmith's original. It properly mimics the original and is serviceable, but doesn’t quite cut it. Why didn't they just re-use Goldsmith's score?

On a technical level, ""Beneath"" isn't nearly as good as the original due to obvious budget limitations. The subpar score is one example; another would be the all-too-obvious pull-over ape masks in certain scenes. But these are minor cavils and never prevented me from wholly enjoying the flick. Still, I could see why some would give the film a lower rating for this reason.

The climax is KILLER, and I mean that literally, as Brent ultimately finds Taylor and the gorillas invade the underground turf. Some great action entails and then... well, I’m not going to give-away the nihilistic climax. Regardless, I always loved the ending; in its own way it's just as great as the iconic close of the original.

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal at Malibu Creek State Park, Calabasas; Century Fox Studios, Century City; and Red Rock Canyon State Park.

GRADE: A-

***SPOILER ALERT CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE MUTANTS***

It is revealed that the psychic mutants are human caricatures who literally worship the ""doomsday bomb,"" a bomb capable of destroying the entire planet. It would appear that human beings need something to worship even in a devolved state, which suggests that humankind is incurably religious. This may be a negative reflection on religion, which is the human attempt to connect with God ('religion' means ""to bind back""), but it isn't a negative reflection on biblical Christianity, which concerns the Creator connecting with humanity through the death & resurrection of the Messiah and the subsequent life-birthing power of the Spirit. In any case, the perverted religious nature of the psychic mutants is nothing less than fascinating, albeit a bit laughable at times, e.g. ""the fellowship of the holy fallout."" Nevertheless, the portrayal of their psychic powers is the best depiction in cinema IMHO. || Enjoyable mostly due to returning cast members, this first sequel could have been so much more. Sadly, this has ""money grab"" written all over it. Heston was reluctant to return, and only agreed once promised his character Taylor would die. One can only wonder what might have been had he been more enthusiastic, perhaps a decent plot and script? Sigh..."

It shares similarities to <em>'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'</em> from the rebooted 2010s series, though it isn't quite as entertaining or convincing. Serviceable it is, however. Roddy McDowall stays in the franchise, but as a different character in Caesar. McDowall is the clear standout from the cast, the rest of whom are solid if forgettable.

I found the real world parallels a bit too forced in this one, while the long speeches near the end feel over the top. For the early 1970s, though, the look of the film remains pleasant - I do like watching these films, after all this is - in my opinion - still a passable flick; if indeed the weakest so far. || Last year, ""Cornelius"" and ""Zira"" were back in the 1970s.

The animals have had just about enough of being the substitutes for our erstwhile four legged friends and are beginning to smell freedom. The governor ""Brock"" (Don Murray) is determined to beat down any rebellion, but hasn't factored in the appearance of ""Caesar"" (Roddy McDowall playing his own son!) who is the one who could make all the difference - he can talk, after all. Pursued, tortured and enslaved he must escape and rally his kind in their pursuit of freedom. This is quite a decent story because we have plenty of action and we have a baddie to focus on. For that, Murray is quite efficient at garnering our loathing as a typically megalomaniac politician. Ricardo Montalban carries through his role as circus owner ""Armando"" but frankly adds little to the theme that bubbles along nicely towards a denouement that shows that these former slaves are quite adept with a blow torch - who knew?

_Battle for the Planet of the Apes_ is the best of the Planet of the Apes sequels - a film packed with emotion and incident. Caesar (Roddy McDowall) seeks his parents in the ruins of a destroyrd city and irks a gang of crazed freaks who all wear silly hats and _skiing goggles_.

Leonard Rosenman gives us a nice score and the photography is beautiful. The classiest looking of the Apes sequels and definitely the most emotional. Just stick with the first movie and this one.

- Ian Beale || In the beginning God created beast and man so that both might live in friendship and share dominion over a world of peace.

The original Planet of the Apes film franchise closed down with a whimper as budget restrictions, general screenplay lethargy and contempt of familiarity swamps the production. Plot finds the apes and humans trying to live in harmony, but find their efforts stymied by a tribe of mutant humans living in the nuked underworld, and that of a power-hungry gorilla general.

What follows is a film that sees various simian and human species throw exposition at each other in the vain belief it's literately smart. When the action comes it's half hearted and perpetrated by the least amount of actors possible. The make-up is shoddy, the fun element gone, while the acting is very uneven across the board. 

There's enough value in the various characterisations to at least keep fans of the series interested, and the photography belies the cheapness evident elsewhere, but really it's a sad closure to what had once been a smartly entertaining franchise. 4/10 || A limp way for the original franchise to finish.

Its predecessor, <em>'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'</em>, was a weak entry too but remained watchable, though <em>'Battle for the Planet of the Apes'</em> kinda straddles the other side as it's uninteresting. I didn't dislike it and it is very short at around 82 minutes, which helps. Roddy McDowall is the pick of the cast, though even his performance feels weary at this point.

A 'strong' 6/10 rating from me, if such a thing exists. It was the right time for them to end this (very good, all in all) series."

Indeed.

Talk, talk and some more talk. Then they all decide to talk some more - taking a break for a little more talking - before finally deciding on talking just a little while longer. These actors must have had sore tongues after the film was completed. Some of them hospitalised with repetitive strain on the jawbone.

A very talky film which could indeed lose the interest of younger viewers. Younger viewers don't want to see  old men blabbering for 90 minutes - they want gorillas with machine guns.

Lots of scenes of people with tobacco stained grey hair talking around 1970's tables and not much action here. 

Not enough psycho gorilla action. The three chimps should have brought at least one maniac gorilla with them for security reasons. If there weren't enough seats in the ship then I am certain he wouldn't mind standing.
Perhaps they feared that once they arrived and they opened the ships hatch on the beach - everything from turtles, whelks and Brian Wilson's surf board would have been riddled with bullets.

""It's not a negative to have heart in the disaster genre of film""

Take yourself to 1974, are you there? Good, now maybe you can appreciate this film a little more? Maybe? Earthquake does suffer from old age, it's a statement we see and hear a lot, but it's a fact that some film's stand the test of time whilst others do not. In this desensitised computer age, it is easy to forget that not all the tools available in film making today were available back when film's like this were being made. So as is my want, I firmly judge this as a 1974 offering, to which it delivers enough entertainment to fully satisfy my genre leanings and entertainment persuasions.

The main complaint of many is the long build up of the characters, cries of boring can be read across internet forums and critics blogs. I just don't see it that way, yes we want the quake and the mayhem destruction that will follow it, because really this is a disaster film after all, but is it so bad that the film has heart to go with the crash bang wallop? After the build up of characters, where relationships and character traits are formed, the disaster strikes and it doesn't disappoint, utter destruction as effects and noise fill the eyes and ears, where those with a good home cinema system finding it literally does rock the house. We are then treated to a series of sequences that hold and engage our attention, upsetting passages of human sadness, punctured by heroic surges as Heston and the fabulous Kennedy set about saving life, hell! saving the town even. Then it's the film's fitting finale, where there are no cop outs, the makers choosing to go out with a darker edge than the detractors give it credit for.

Some can scoff at a blood splat effect, or rant about some of the acting on show, but Earthquake achieves two important things. One is that it entertains as a visual experience (quality model work), the other is that it doesn't soft soap the devastating effects of an earthquake. As the camera pulls away from a ravaged L.A. the impact is sombre, where reflection is needed and most assuredly surely gotten. 7/10"

Inspired by the real life story of gynaecologist twins Cyril and Steve Marcus (who were both found dead from suicide brought about by drug addiction), Dead Ringers is an amalgamation of unsettling horror and icy cold playfulness; in other words a perfect canvas for auteur Cronenberg to paint some of his peccadilloes.

Cronenberg doesn't need to be gory, gimmicky or schlocky, he instead utilises the characters on the page to spin a clinical character study. Themes pulsing throughout involve individuality, identity, misogyny, narcissism, eroticism and addiction, all played out in the mystical world of surgery and in-human metaphysics. The tempo never rises above a steady heart beat, rumbling along ominously, until we enter the home straight and the director delivers a devastating yet deeply moving conclusion.

Backed by a stunning dual performance from Irons, and a ballsy one from Bujold, Dead Ringers is a film of genuine greatness and a piece of work that's alive with smart ideas. 8.5/10 || Sheer brilliance. Deep down, EVERYONE has a love/hate thing about identical twins. On the one side, they wish they had that kind of communion with someone, that sort of magical intimacy they share, having someone basically the exact same as themselves...yet that same one-of-a-kind companionship is scary as hell.

I haven't seen, from my fellow Canadian, either 'Scanners' (1981) or 'Naked Lunch' (1991), so I can't honestly say whether or not my assertion can be thus extended, but I dare ANYONE to find in horror a finer run than Cronenberg had, in 'Videodrome', 'The Dead Zone', 'The Fly'...and this, 'Dead Ringers'. || David Cronenberg reveals himself to be a total pseud.

Robert Wise had one of the most varied and distinguished directorial careers in Hollywood history,
and he understood very well that psychologically speaking, what you can't see can hurt you. An
imaginative viewer will almost always fill in a blank with something far more horrible than what
the director could show on screen. This is a formula that has been largely abandoned, and is a
highly contributing reason why most of today's horror movies absolutely suck. Give this one a go.

The Haunting is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Nelson Gidding from the Shirley Jackson novel The Haunting of Hill House. It stars Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn and Lois Maxwell. Music is by Humphrey Searle and cinematography by David Boulton.

Hill House has a troubled history, death, either by accident or by suicide, has occurred there over the years. Today, Dr. Markway, an anthropologist and investigator of paranormal activity, leads a team of four for a stay at Hill House, where they will stay for a period of time in the hope that Markway can prove something paranormal resides there

The haunted house premise has been a staple for horror film makers since forever. To place the viewer in a murky house, alongside some character unfortunates, and then scare the tar out of them has always been the aim. It hasn't often worked to great effect, in fact the number of genuine scary haunted house movies barely trouble the fingers of both hands. How strange, then, that the best of the bunch chose a simple formula that has never been replicated since with the same great effect.

The Haunting thrives not on what it throws at you by way of jumps and peek-a-boo visceral shocks, it deals firmly in the realm of what you can't see scares you the most. Where we have to use our own fretful imaginations to fill in the blanks for us, which is never a good thing in psychological horror parlance. Robert Wise, a most gifted and versatile director, uses oblique camera angles, thundering sound effects and angled close ups of his actors to get the maximum amount of atmosphere from the premise.

Distortion is very much a key component here. We are told the history of the house and some of its structural quirks, the camera angles heighten this for ethereal impact whilst simultaneously marrying up to the distortion of a key character's mental health. The story in essence sounds simple, yet there is much bubbling away in Hill House, both on the page and up there on the screen. This is not simply a case of a group of people being haunted by a spectre or otherwise, the mind is a key player here, very much so.

Along the way are some truly breath holding scenes; a bending door, pounding in the corridor, a face on the wall (the lighting here genius), Nell's hand holding incident, a rickety spiral staircase that we fear from the off, and the ghostly finale as Hill House reveals its hand and what we thought was a simple and true narrative is actually more clever, more chilling than we first imagined. Suggestion is a very big thing in The Haunting, it's what drives it to greatness, but it also has scenes that really bring the gooseflesh jumping up on your arms.

The acting is mostly great, with Tamblyn and Johnson correctly underplaying their roles to let the two girls take centre stage. Both Harris and Bloom are excellent. As Nell, Harris is nervous, introverted and caught up in the atmosphere of the house, it's the pivotal role and Harris instills a heart aching fragility into the character. Bloom as Theodora has mystical qualities, a sexiness and a devilishly playful disposition, things that play off of Harris' egg shell walking quite brilliantly. While the house itself (exterior is Ettington Park Hotel in Stratford-Upon-Avon) is an ominous character all of its own. As Nell first spies the monolithic frontage she muses that it's a monster waiting to swallow her, a small creature, whole; we know exactly how she feels.

Still the template haunted house movie, accept no substitutes and ignore stupid claims of homophobia, this is intelligent, scary and crafted with great skill. 10/10 || **A simple film with a basic script, but which scares us in such a way that it still has an influence on horror productions today.**

Movies about haunted houses? Whoever saw one of them, saw them all… right? I like to think not. And this film is probably the grandfather of a good number of them! Currently forgotten due to the passage of time, the film had a much weaker remake in 1999, and I believe that it is itself a rewrite of “House on Haunted Hill”, released three years earlier, in 1959, and which also has already deserved a new production in recent years. The impact of this film on the industry and horror genre was notable and continues to have some echoes.

The story begins by introducing us to Hill House, a fateful mansion shrouded in a cloak of mystery and a past of death. Unlike the modern remake, this film never explores the origins of that evil, it simply accepts it and places the characters inside the house, under the pretext of a paranormal investigation clumsily led by a parapsychologist obsessed with proving the veracity of haunting phenomena and the afterlife.

As a story told, the film is frankly poor and leaves us with more questions than answers. We are presented with a psychological experiment conducted without criteria and which, if it had been true, would have shocked the scientific community and led to a variety of legal consequences. Do I need to say that the study would have to stop at the first sign of danger to the mental health of one of the participants? Issues that seem logical, such as the fact that the subjects volunteer in writing, after fully knowing what will be done and the risks, are put aside, as are the hostile attitudes of the caretakers, who are not satisfied with the additional work, or the passivity of Eleanor's family, which only appears to show how uprooted the character would feel.

The cast is not very well known but makes a commendable effort. Lois Maxwell is perhaps the most easily known name, but she appears for a very short time and doesn't add much with her participation. She gives life, moreover, to the most apparently sane person in the midst of that madness. And I'm not saying that I don't believe in the supernatural: in fact I do, but I'm more afraid of the living than the dead and I don't accept any nonsense. It's Julie Harris who dominates the screen with an inspired and crazy interpretation of someone living on the brink of a mental breakdown. She is friendly, and we agonize with her scares and fear. Claire Bloom also does an interesting, more restrained and sarcastic job.

If the audience is expecting fluttering sheets or skeletons animated by nylon strings, it's best to forget: the film does not use carnival tricks, preferring to intelligently use sound, image, shadows and camera angles to create an atmosphere of tension and threat. The result is frankly positive: when we don't see what scares us, we don't know what to expect, and that intimidates us. Knocks on wood, heavy footsteps, punches against doors, muffled laughter, the range of sound effects is rich and was used in a creative and very credible way. The filming location, a huge English neo-Gothic mansion, is wonderful and was put to great use. All interior settings are exquisitely crafted and look authentic. The house itself is a dense, rich and mysterious character, a villain worthy of an anthology."

Children Of The Damned is directed by Anton M. Leader and written by John Briley. It's a thematic sequel to Village Of The Damned from 1960 which was based on the novel written by John Wyndham. Plot finds 6 children identified by UNESCO to have special powers that if used in unison could have devastating consequences for mankind.

Interesting and atmospheric if ultimately lukewarm as a whole. Retreading the plot from the superior first film, it's amazing that this take actually has very little to do with the 1960 darling. Confused? Well you wont be watching this since it's very talky and the makers are intent on making us listen. Listen to some moral quandaries, Cold War politics and even a touch of existentialism. All nicely wrapped around 6 not very creepy kids who actually aren't very evil at all. The acting is fine, notably the taut turns from Ian Hendry and Alan Badel, while David Boulton's black & white photography carries a suitable bleakness to it.

Well made but all too often dull; where Briley's script isn't as clever as it wants to be, the film is mostly saved by some technical smarts and a boldly gloomy ending. 5/10"

Will this new relationship and their misadventures change his plans over the course of the next two days? 

I’m a sucker for road movies and Affleck is great as the principled protagonist, but Bullock’s character, Sarah, is so erratic she becomes seriously irritating by the midpoint that it’s hard to see how anyone would find her appealing, at least as a possible lifelong companion. Thankfully, the sights are interesting and the pair’s mishaps are amusing enough (although I feel the script needed a rewrite to flush out better prospects). In addition, the last act is actually ballsy and totally changed any negative feelings I had. The movie’s not really anti-marriage; it just shows the awful truth and potential glory. In other words, it’s realistic and balanced.

What’s funny is that Roger Ebert expressed outrage over the climax and called it smarmy. All I can say is he didn’t ‘get’ it because it’s not disingenuous at all. In fact, it’s revelatory; and wholly fits. I don’t want to say anything more because I don’t want to spoil it. Reflect on the key points and everything makes sense.

The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes and was shot in New York City, Washington DC, Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Steve Zahn is on hand as the best man.

Reality itself is a ravaged dystopia run by technocrat Artificial Intelligence where humankind vegetates in billions of gloop-filled tanks - mere battery packs for the machineworld - being fed this late '90s VR (known as The Matrix - you with us here?) through an ugly great cable stuck in the back of our heads. And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah?

What sounds like some web freak's wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson's cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of ""flo-mo"", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean ""talents"" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain't.

Immediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can't get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous.

Sure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion's share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There's a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely no-shit intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders.

And sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest gobbledygook. That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it's been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery.

From head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality.

Not that the aforementioned is a surprise, of course. Still, this is a great watch, no doubt about it for me. I particularly appreciated the score, which is very good. Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw give strong performances, especially the latter; who kept reminding me of a young Kevin Durand.

As you'd expect, this has many early hallmarks of Nolan's work - the obvious being the non-linear storytelling. I really like how the story is told here, the premise is intriguing and it ends up wrapping up nicely. The 70 minute run time, although not unwelcome, is shorter than I wanted, only because I happily would've watched this flick develop further.

Never Been Kissed sees Drew Barrymore's copy editor, Josie Geller, yearn to be a reporter. Something that comes her way when by way of a fluke, she's selected for an undercover mission at High School. Trouble is, is that she's got to be 17 again, and that's something that brings back all of those horrible moments from her high school days. The time of having no friends, the butt of the jokes and ignored by the boys (all told in cringe inducing flashbacks).

Cue much fun as the 25 year old Josie not only tries to bluff everyone that she's 17, but tries to fit in with the youth who have considerably changed from back in her days. Enter cool as ice brother Rob (David Arquette) who decides to lend a helping hand, with some funny and excellently scripted results. Not only this but we of course have the obligatory love interest, only this is a kicker as it concerns Josie's teacher Sam (a sickeningly handsome Michael Vartan). Cue Sam on mind overload as his feelings lead him onto what he thinks is morally dubious ground...

It's as frothy as can be is this one, perhaps in the running for the 90s most chickiest ckick flick? But, and I say this as a middle aged guy, the jokes are spot on, it's endearing as heck and it boasts a quite marvellous turn from Barrymore. It's the sort of performance that could light up the most turgid of comedy movies. It's a threefold character portrayal of some depth and no little charm. She's well supported by the always likable Arquette, while notable turns also come from John C Reilly, the ever reliable Molly Shannon and Leelee Sobieski. While the sharp eyed will spot future Green Goblin James Franco and Susan Storm herself, Jessica Alba, nestling in amongst the teen performers.

Nothing remotely new here, but for some genuine laugh out loud comedy moments, a feel good factor soaring through the roof, a kick-ass soundtrack and Barrymore herself, this is more than recommended as a pick me up movie. 7.5/10 || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Look, I have some fairly negative memories of this movie over the years, and I'm not saying it is the best, but for all its flaws, it holds up surprisingly well.

The idea of Drew Barrymore (even in 1999) being able to pass for a high school student is nonsense.  I'm not that big a fan of hers, but she nails this role even if she's clearly an adult at high school, but what the movie is about, and what she expresses wonderfully is the emotion of being in the traumatic experience of high school when you're not part of the ruling class.

I feel like they casted well enough: David Arquette, Molly Shannon, J.C. Reilly, Leelee Sobieski, and Cress Williams (Black Lightning) all do great support roles, and Jessica Alba, Mary Shelton, Jordan Ladd, and  all do great antagonist roles.

The writing of writing about a story, in a story of one character hiding herself in another story is oddly meta on a few levels, but it remains complex without being overly complicated, is still funny, and has plenty of substance.

While I don't imagine I'm going to watch this very often, I'll have to credit my mother: this is worth the watch, even after 20 years."

In this film, we follow the ordeal of César, a young Spaniard who has everything a young man could want: a comfortable life, money, friends and all the women he wants (although he avoids serious commitments as much as possible). During a birthday party, in which he tries to escape his most recent case, he meets Sofia, a seductive and intelligent young woman who knows how to captivate him. However, his whole life is ruined when he has a car accident, intentionally provoked, and his face is completely disfigured.

If the psychological, mental and physical difficulties caused by such an injury could be enough for a movie script, Amenábar goes even further by mixing this with various considerations about dreams, illusion and memory. Brutally intense, the film goes round and round, and from a certain point, it's hard for us to understand what is true and what is a dream or illusion of the protagonist. The ending is truly disconcerting.

Although the film does not seem very expensive, it has a good cast. Eduardo Noriega does a good dramatic job and is an excellent protagonist. Penélope Cruz, undoubtedly better known as she “made the leap” into American cinema, is still a very young and beautiful actress at this stage, and she is genuine in the work she develops. Chete Lera and Fele Martínez give good support and effort in their roles, and even Najwa Nimri, the supposed villain of the film, is very good at the task given to her.

A good part of the story told comes to us through the flashbacks that accompany César's report to his psychiatrist, and this resource was very well used and very effective. The film mixes well the themes it addresses, balancing very well in all of them and the dialogues are really good, they breathe naturalness and authenticity. Good sets, good costumes and the good choice of shooting locations helped a lot to make the film more visually beautiful, while the cinematography knew how to make the best use of the intense sunlight of the Spanish capital and the beautiful shades of blue in the sky, which contrast sharply with the dense penumbra that the main character seems to prefer."

A rivalry develops between two air traffic controllers in New York City: Nick (John Cusack) is young, swaggering and high strung while Russell (Billy Bob Thornton) is seasoned, self-controlled and laidback.

“Pushing Tin” is a quirky drama with a healthy sense of humor and potent adult-oriented themes revolving around love, sex and loyalty. The high stress nature of the occupation is emphasized while amusing the viewer in an offbeat way and driving home some insights on the broken human condition and glorious potential.

A youthful Cate Blanchett plays Nick’s stay-at-home wife, Connie. She was 29 years-old during shooting. Meanwhile Angelina Jolie plays Russell’s much-younger wife, Mary, who has alcohol issues; she was 23 playing a 21 year-old. Whist Jolie is made out to be the ultra-beauty, and she is alluring, it’s Blanchett who steals the show on that front IMHO. Petite Vicki Lewis is also on hand as the lone female air traffic controller; she was 38 during filming.

When a high achiever student (Reese Witherspoon) runs for president of the student body at her Omaha high school one of her teachers (Matthew Broderick) encourages an amiable jock to run against her (Chris Klein) because he finds her irritating.

“Election” (1999) is a quirky high school dramedy in the mold of “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” (1982), but with a unique plot revolving around a school election. It’s not raunchy like the contemporaneous “American Pie” (except for one line by a teacher early on), but it is adult-oriented as there are several simulated sex scenes between various characters with no nudity. While they’re overt, they’re sorta amusing and fairly essential to the story.

This is a must for anyone who’s a high school teacher as it understatedly satirizes the setting. The flick shows how easy it is for a good teacher with years of quality work to make a thoughtless mistake and suddenly fall out of grace. Yet it also shows redemption. Of course the film pokes fun at the election process and the rivalry of candidates, etc. There are a 2-3 laugh-out-loud scenes with Spaghetti Western music blaring (specifically, Ennio Morricone’s score from 1966’ ""Navajo Joe"").          

Witherspoon is perfect as the female protagonist (although her face looks like Drew Barrymore on the poster), but I never found her alluring. I suppose Frankie Ingrassia (Lisa) and Jessica Campbell (Tammy) make up for it despite the eye-rolling lesbian component, which isn’t very substantive.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot in the Omaha, Nebraska, area (Papillion, Bellevue, LaVista, etc.) and, at the end, Washington DC.

GRADE: B- || <em>'Election'</em> builds relatively slowly though really does become a fun movie by its conclusion. It's most definitely worth a watch.

Matthew Broderick is excellent throughout, as are the likes of Reese Witherspoon and Chris Klein. The films goes to some unexpected places and manages to make it work. And there's a great callback in there too. I will say that I didn't love the internal monologue bits, but they didn't derail the film for me in any major way. || This early outing for Reese Witherspoon (""Tracy Flick"") sees her desperate to become class President in her high school. Clever, ruthless and determined - she takes on all comers in her quest for success, and woe betide anyone who gets in her way. Happily hapless teacher Matthew Broderick is charged with overseeing the election campaign, and conscious that his front-runner is a bit of a nightmare manages to convince recently injured school hottie ""Paul"" (Chris Klein) to stand against her. Though he be thick as two short planks, he is a formidable challenge for ""Flick"" as most of the school don't appear to be too bright, either... and the fight is on. Her scheming machinations and his attempts to foil her ambitions make for quite a fun 100 minutes. The dialogue can be a bit earthy at times, but don't, whatever you do, look for plot complexities nor a thought-provoking script - except, perhaps, in addressing the odiousness of blind ambition and perhaps, 30 years later - it sends us a gentle reminder that if we all just sleep through our respective democratic processes then we will get people like this really running the place.... Klein is quite good as the nice-but-dim ""Paul"" too!"

Hee, yet another David Cronenberg picture that divides opinions, not just among the casual film watchers, but also his most ardent fans.

Plot is a little nutty in actuality, as it finds Jennifer Jason Leigh as the world's most high profile games designer. While testing her new virtual reality game out with a focus group, an assassination attempt puts her on the run with an ally of sorts, marketing man Ted Pikul (Jude Law). With the prototype of the new game in their possession, the pair must enter the game's realm to unlock the various puzzles and threats that now confounds and stalks them.

With Cronenberg back to writing something solely from his own head, eXistenZ finds the Canadian auteur happy to be back making a truer piece of work for his kinked visions. Unfortunately the advent of such virtual reality fare and various realist themes was well in filmic swing come the time eXistenZ was released, rendering it in some eyes as a band wagon jumper. That's unfair, because it's still a unique film, as Cronenberg blends body horror with visual invention to create a mind warp of gaming possibilities, a thrum thrum of futuristic verve. He gets top performances out of Leigh (great hair as well) and Law, while the narrative is constantly tricky enough to demand the viewer pays attention whilst being prepared to, perhaps, be surprised.

Not prime Cronenberg, but still smart and funky, twisty and nutty, scary and oblique. So very much a Cronenberg original, then. 8/10 || I'm sorry but this low budget disaster got zero interest from me.  The props were horrid. The story was ridiculous; really, it was just so ""stupid"".  Maybe I should be using bigger words, but this movie was just awful in every way.

Gin, an insurance agent with the curious skills of a cat burglar (Catherine Zeta-Jones), is sent by her employer (Will Patton) to wiggle into the company of aging British master-thief “Mac” MacDougal (Sean Connery). He tentatively accepts her but insists on arduous training before stealing a priceless Chinese mask from the well-guarded Bedford Palace. Their developing attraction and suspicion threaten to ruin their partnership but the lure of $8 billion from a heist at the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, maintains their alliance.

I usually don’t like heist flicks (because I’m not interested in the glorification of criminals), but the charisma of Connery and the beauty of Zeta-Jones keeps “Entrapment” (1999) interesting, not to mention the all-around stylish and kinetic filmmaking. Mac's hideout, an isolated castle in Scotland, is an unexpected attraction. The movie’s similar in tone to the contemporaneous “Eye of the Beholder” (1999), but without the pall of moody gloom and sleaze. The first 70 minutes are surprisingly entertaining before slumping for 20 minutes, but the film thankfully recovers for the thrilling and twisty last act.

“Entrapment” is famous for iconic stills of Catherine acrobatically maneuvering her way through a laser security system, which showcase her heightened derrière. She’s a beautiful woman and these sequences are certainly highlights. Yet you could hardly call them pornographic since she’s fully clothed and, while her outfit might be tight, it’s not exactly skintight.

Concerning the mild controversy over the dubious attraction of Mac (Connery) and Gin (Zeta-Jones), Connery was 68 when ""Entrapment"" was shot, but Mac is 60 in the story. Catherine was almost 30 during shooting, but looks & acts 35. So their age-difference is roughly 25 years, which isn’t anything unheard of.

Moreover, men are naturally attracted to younger women and Gin is a full-fledged whoa-man, not a teenager or even 20-something. Mac may have been 60, but he was charismatic, intelligent, virile and very much young at heart; so it’s no wonder Gin was attracted to him.

Lastly, being attracted to someone isn't the same as wanting to marry the person or even have sex. You can be naturally attracted to someone, but dismiss any further entanglement for numerous reasons, such as you're married, s/he is married, s/he is too young, s/he is too old, you prefer being single, etc.

The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England, Scotland (Duart Castle & Eilean Donan Castle), Malaysia and New York City. Ving Rhames costars as Mac’s covert ally.

GRADE: B || **Entrapment is a quality heist film with high stakes and great twists that overcomes its strange romantic moments.**

Entrapment showcases clever heists, stunning leads, and beautiful locations resulting in a well-crafted and entertaining heist film. The question of “Who is playing who?” constantly has the viewer guessing what twists could come and wondering what each character is really up to. The first half of the movie is stronger than the second. The planning of the first heist and its execution have great pacing and intrigue. After all that, the second half of the movie, which is supposed to be the bigger and more difficult heist, feels rushed and less satisfying. And let’s just say it, the awkward romance between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones when he is nearly 40 years older and 69 at the time of Entrapment’s release is CRINGE. They could have taken the father/daughter or mentor/student relationship and kept it from being weird. All in all, Entrapment is a solid entry in the heist genre because of the effort, planning, and prep behind each robbery and great performances from the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones and the classic Sean Connery. || I quite enjoyed this cyber-crime caper - the two stars have a chemistry that largely gets past the slightly fluffy dialogue and far-fetched plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones is, ostensibly, an insurance operative sent to help catch arch thief ""Mac"" (Sean Connery) once a valuable Rembrandt is taken from an seemingly impregnable high-rise office. It transpires that she has other fish to fry, however, and before long the poacher and the gamekeeper have a grand design to commit the creme de la creme of computer hacks without getting caught. It's at it's best during the heist planning stages, though sadly falls away a bit during a rather poorly constructed last twenty minutes that also introduces a romance that I found a bit cheesy. A pretty wooden Ving Rhames features - luckily, quite sparingly - as a duplicitous FBI agent but Maury Chaykin is really quite good as the odious, sexually ambiguous fixer ""Conrad Greene"". Worth a watch."

Mildred Pierce is directed by Michael Curtiz and adapted from the James M. Cain novel by Ranald MacDougall, William Faulkner and Catherine Turney. It stars Joan Crawford, Ann Blyth, Jack Carson, Zachary Scott, Bruce Bennett and Eve Arden. Music is by Max Steiner and the cinematographer is Ernest Haller. It was nominated for 6 Academy Awards and won just the one for Crawford in the Best Actress category.

Plot finds Crawford as Mildred Pierce, a devoted Mother of two girls who struggles to not only make her marriage work, but to also keep her eldest daughter, Veda (Blyth), in the luxurious life she demands. Murder, treachery and heartache is about to dog the Pierce family.

This is of course the film that is often remembered for being the film that saved Joan Crawford's career. After being dumped by MGM, and tagged with being box office poison, Crawford, it seemed, was destined to be the latest visitor to the acting scrap heap. But Jerry Wald over at Warner Brothers had other ideas. The part of Mildred had been offered to some of the big hitting ladies on the Warner studio lot, Stanwyck, Davies and Sheridan are just three of the names known to have shied away from the role. The feeling was that playing a woman with a mid-teen daughter was a no go for the age proud ladies. But Crawford, just entering her forties, took the role on, and in spite of initial protestations from director Curtiz, gave a terrific performance that landed her the coveted golden statuette and prolonged her film career for another 25 years.

Blending the psychological aspects of the woman's picture with the physical edges of film noir, ""Mildred Pierce"" is something of a unique picture. Very popular on release (it was a box office smash), it was thought that Cain's source novel wouldn't transfer well to the screen. Credit then to the writers for managing to create such an intriguing and watchable piece. True, they have had to tone down aspects from the book, and even added incidents and changed characters, but the essence is right and the timing couldn't have been more perfect for such a story. As film noir was becoming a telling style of film making, the pic also coincided with the later stages of WWII - a time when the role of the Woman, either in the service or at home, was under scrutiny. One of the great things about the film, and the performance of Crawford, is that it cobbles together many character strands of the 40s woman - in life and in film noir. She's a Suzy homemaker type, asked to be mother and wife, yet driven to be a business woman because she feels she's lacking in the necessary family home department. Where the film gets its noir flecks from is that Mildred may also be a murderer, a femme fatale, a woman whose every decision spells trouble. It's as if the makers (not just here but many others at the time) are saying that a woman's place is in the home, doing homely family stuff. Intriguing for sure, not necessarily in good taste, but an added spice into the melodramatic cooking pot that already contains greed and obsession.

Told with a flashback structure, the film is smoothly directed by the versatile Curtiz. But both he and Crawford are aided considerably across the board, not least by a truly great ""Bitch"" performance from Blyth. Veda is at one detestable, spoilt and mean, the daughter from hell, a status-seeking brat whose love comes at enormous cost to those who dare to get close to her. Blyth revels in it and her play off with Crawford is one of the film's major strengths. The support cast of Scott, Carson, Arden and Bennett are excellent value, while Steiner's music is unobtrusive and able to shift freely with the narrative twists. Finally it's left to Hallers photography to capture the feel and mood of the unfolding story. Shifting from sunny suburbia one moment to shadowy expressionistic bleakness the next, the photographer of such notable film's like ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"", is integral to the moody excellence of ""Mildred Pierce"".

A murder mystery flanked by asides of class distinction, bad parenting, dubious sexual leanings and pure greed. Yep, ""Mildred Pierce"" is no ordinary movie - and hooray for that. 8.5/10 || Saw this recently on the big screen at the BFI in London. Joan Crawford is simply stunning as a drab housewife, deserted by her useless husband, who starts off working in a restaurant kitchen as she strives for success and to be able to give her spoilt daughter the best that money can buy. Ann Blyth is wonderfully horrid as the daughter and Zachary Scott completes the trio of principals as the parasitical second husband. Mike Curtiz directs this superbly - particularly as the film heads to it's climax; the screenplay and the score also lend copiously to the overall effect of this deservedly Oscar-winning story. It's just great!"

Security robots at a Los Angeles mall malfunction after a lightning strike and become a deadly threat to a group of youths partying at a furniture store after hours. 

“Chopping Mall” (1986) takes the malevolent robot idea of “Westworld” (1973) and places it in the mall setting of “Dawn of the Dead” (1978) with robots that look like malicious versions of “Short Circuit” (1986) and R2D2. “RoboCop” didn’t debut until the next year.

 Winsome girl-next-door Kelli Maroney is a highlight as protagonist Alison while Russell Todd from “Friday the 13th Part 2” (1981) is stalwart as Rick. Suzee Slater as Leslie is a’right. This is a spirited Grade B flick but at the end of the day it’s a throwaway; it’s fun and well-executed, but somehow hollow and forgettable.

The movie runs 1 hour, 17 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles at the Sherman Oaks Galleria, which was also used in “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” (1982) and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991).

Dick Tracy is directed by Warren Beatty and written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. Based on Chester Gould’s comic strip creation of the same name, it stars Beatty, Al Pacino, Madonna, Glenne Headly, Dustin Hoffman, Charlie Korsmo, Charles Durning and William Forsythe. Music is by Danny Elfman, with songs by Stephen Sondheim, and cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro.

Punk Rock band X-Ray Spex once sang about The Day The World Turned Day-Glo, Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy was exactly that. The live action cartoon is a feast for the eyes, as the city backdrop for this cops and gangsters tale is a fountain of bright, lurid primary colours. The characters are drawn brilliantly, where the good guys are very much human, but the bad guys are a bunch of grotesques, like a mutant gathering under one coalition banner. All star casting, striking costuming, amazing effects work, quality songs and a brisk musical score (Elfman reworks his score for Batman from the previous year), Dick Tracy as a production is grade “A” stuff. It also did very well at the box office, where although it didn’t reach Disney’s expectation levels financially, it coined to the tune of over $100 million in profit Worldwide. Not bad for a film some still think was a flop!

It’s a film that feels a lot better watching it now than it did back on release, to be able to view it as a smart technical accomplishment for the time it was made. The cast factor also makes it something of a fascinating experience, watching legends like Pacino and Hoffman absolutely buy into the cartoon excess on show. However, the old problem with it just will never go away. Yes the plot is very simple, but that’s easy to accept these days, it was after all a gangster movie made for all the family, it’s that Beatty’s portrayal of Tracy is too under played. He’s a good guy, we know that, we are on his side, but it’s a flat characterisation, he’s never pushed to be anything other than a cool dude. This of course lets the monstrous villains take the film by the scruff of the neck, as most villains tend to anyway, but for a film carrying his name, you expect a bit more from Dick Tracy the man.

Still, Dick Tracy is a fun movie experience, not all it can be, but enjoyable regardless. 7/10 || I'm heartily disappointed that this didn't produce sequels. If any fine actor/director of the period was perfect for the role of Dick Tracy, it was Beatty. He does very good work here. It's as if he took Tim Burton's template for 'Batman' and simply adjusted it for his comic-book picture. Madonna isn't bad here either, simply because she's pretending to be Marilyn Monroe, something she'd been wanting to do all of her career to that point. And the rogues gallery here is perhaps second in quality only to the aforementioned DC Caped Crusader. In retrospect, that perhaps was the picture's weakest link--no true criminal really dominated proceedings and stuck in one's mind. Had they tried the time-tested hookup of two baddies to get in Dick's hair just enough to rile him, it may have worked better. Still one of the most enjoyable, and underrated, comic-book pictures of the past three decades. || Debonair and brightly clad detective “Dick Tracy” (Warren Beatty) is out to stop an all out war breaking out in the city after mobster “Big Boy” (Al Pacino) slays “Lips” (Paul Sorvino) with a view to running the whole show. Part of that cunning plan is to unite all the criminal fraternities and get rid of this pesky cop. Meantime, “Tracy” alights on the permanently hungry “Kid” (Charlie Korsmo) whom he has to look after as well as his girlfriend “Tess” (Glenne Headly) as the bullets fly and things become seriously perilous for all three of them. He’s also got to figure out just what angle nightclub chanteuse “Breathless Mahoney” (Madonna) has in all of this - and is she at all to be trusted? Oh, and there’s also the malevolent “Blank” to deal with too. In many ways this brightly coloured series of escapades reminded me of “Bugsy Malone” (1976) only without the custard pies. It’s decently enough paced and there is the odd action sequence, for I found it to be just a bit too stylistic with not enough emphasis on the characters or on the story. Indeed, that last element is really pretty weak as none of the acting talent seem to quite know whether to play the menacing or the pantomime. There are a few moments from Pacino that raise it’s game now and again, but for the most part this is all a pale imitation of Edward G. Robinson or Robert Mitchum on a bad day. It’s all disappointingly tame and Madonna’s contributions - musically or otherwise, show her limitations as an actor all too clearly, too."

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || It's not horror you know - it's just real good family fun.

The Mummy is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also co-writes the screenplay with John L. Balderston. It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).

It's true to say that ""Indiana Jones"" raised the bar for action/adventure films in the modern era, the kind involving treasure, artifacts and mystical perils. It's arguably true enough to say that with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the standard has been set so high it's unlikely to be bettered. There's been a number of similar films to have come along post ""Indiana Jones"", films that have one thing in common, that the critics are scornful towards them whilst the box office has kerchinged with the sound of cash being spent by the cinema going public. ""The Mummy"" is one such movie. Universal rework their own 1930's creeper to deliver a high energy, effects laden adventure full of wit, stunts and eye candy fun. Yes it's ""Indiana Jones"" lite, but so what? We may be lacking an intellectual script, but for sheer guts, construction of set-pieces and interesting story, this delivers wholesome family entertainment. Cast are fine, Fraser comfortably files in for square jawed heroics and Weisz is suitably posh, spunky and sexy. Hannah revels in playing a wastrel type, while Arnold Vosloo is enjoying himself greatly. However it's  ultimately the effects that win out, explosive and eye poppingly enjoyable, Sommers and his team have not pulled any punches in their willingness to entertain all the adventure film loving family. 7.5/10 || ***Indiana Jones Horror Story***

If you think ""The Mummy"" (1999) is a remake of the glacial, ultra-serious classic of the same name, think again. This version is just as much an action/adventure (and comedy) as it is horror; and not 'horror' in the sense that it's scary, but rather horrific. Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.

Everything magically works, granting the viewer a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the Magi guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah offers some comedic amusing moments as Eve’s brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasel.

""The Mummy"" is not great ponderous art as in, say, ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but it is great adventure and horrific fun. On that level, it's filmmaking of the highest order.

The movie runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot in England, Morocco and Glen Canyon, Arizona.

But this is the fourth movie of the famous series, and we think we know the territory; many of the early reviews have been blase, paying lip service to the visuals and wondering why the characters aren't better developed. How quickly do we grow accustomed to wonders. I am reminded of the Isaac Asimov story ""Nightfall,"" about the planet where the stars were visible only once in a thousand years. So awesome was the sight that it drove men mad. We who can see the stars every night glance up casually at the cosmos and then quickly down again, searching for a Dairy Queen.

""Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,"" to cite its full title, is an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking. If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable: This is the first story in the chronology and has to set up characters who (we already know) will become more interesting with the passage of time. Here we first see Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and R2-D2 and C-3PO. Anakin is only a fresh-faced kid in Episode I; in IV, V and VI, he has become Darth Vader.

At the risk of offending devotees of the Force, I will say that the stories of the ""Star Wars"" movies have always been space operas, and that the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects. I do not attend with the hope of gaining insights into human behavior. Unlike many movies, these are made to be looked at more than listened to, and George Lucas and his collaborators have filled ""The Phantom Menace"" with wonderful visuals.

There are new places here--new kinds of places. Consider the underwater cities, floating in their transparent membranes. The Senate chamber, a vast sphere with senators arrayed along the inside walls, and speakers floating on pods in the center. And other places: the cityscape with the waterfall that has a dizzying descent through space. And the other cities: one city Venetian, with canals, another looking like a hothouse version of imperial Rome, and a third that seems to have grown out of desert sands.

Set against awesome backdrops, the characters in ""The Phantom Menace"" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained ""Julius Caesar."" I wish the ""Star Wars"" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at.

The plot details (of embargoes and blockades) tend to diminish the size of the movie's universe--to shrink it to the scale of a 19th century trade dispute. The stars themselves are little more than pinpoints on a black curtain, and ""Star Wars"" has not drawn inspiration from the color photographs being captured by the Hubble Telescope. The series is essentially human mythology, set in space, but not occupying it. If Stanley Kubrick gave us man humbled by the universe, Lucas gives us the universe domesticated by man. His aliens are really just humans in odd skins. For ""The Phantom Menace,"" he introduces Jar Jar Binks, a fully realized computer-animated alien character whose physical movements seem based on afterthoughts. And Jabba the Hutt (who presides over the Podrace) has always seemed positively Dickensian to me.

Yet within the rules he has established, Lucas tells a good story. The key development in ""Phantom"" is the first meeting between the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd)--who is, the Jedi immediately senses, fated for great things. Qui-Gon meets Anakin in a store where he's seeking replacement parts for his crippled ship. Qui-Gon soon finds himself backing the young slave in a high-speed Podrace--betting his ship itself against the cost of the replacement parts. The race is one of the film's high points, as the entrants zoom between high cliff walls in a refinement of a similar race through metal canyons on a spaceship in ""Star Wars."" Why is Qui-Gon so confident that Anakin can win? Because he senses an unusual concentration of the Force--and perhaps because, like John the Baptist, he instinctively recognizes the one whose way he is destined to prepare. The film's shakiness on the psychological level is evident, however, in the scene where young Anakin is told he must leave his mother (Pernilla August) and follow this tall Jedi stranger. Their mutual resignation to the parting seems awfully restrained. I expected a tearful scene of parting between mother and child, but the best we get is when Anakin asks if his mother can come along, and she replies, ""Son, my place is here."" As a slave? The discovery and testing of Anakin supplies the film's most important action, but in a sense all the action is equally important, because it provides platforms for special-effects sequences. Sometimes our common sense undermines a sequence (for instance, when Jar Jar's people and the good guys fight a 'droid army, it becomes obvious that the droids are such bad fighters, they should be returned for a refund). But mostly I was happy to drink in the sights on the screen, in the same spirit that I might enjoy ""Metropolis,"" ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Dark City"" or ""The Matrix."" The difference is that Lucas' visuals are more fanciful and his film's energy level is more cheerful; he doesn't share the prevailing view that the future is a dark and lonely place.

What he does have, in abundance, is exhilaration. There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of ""The Phantom Menace,"" as he tries out new effects and ideas, and seamlessly integrates real characters and digital ones, real landscapes and imaginary places. We are standing at the threshold of a new age of epic cinema, I think, in which digital techniques mean that budgets will no longer limit the scope of scenes; filmmakers will be able to show us just about anything they can imagine.

As surely as Anakin Skywalker points the way into the future of ""Star Wars,"" so does ""The Phantom Menace"" raise the curtain on this new freedom for filmmakers. And it's a lot of fun. The film has correctly been given the PG rating; it's suitable for younger viewers and doesn't depend on violence for its effects. As for the bad rap about the characters--hey, I've seen space operas that put their emphasis on human personalities and relationships. They're called ""Star Trek"" movies. Give me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day.

3.5/4

-Rodger Ebert || Frankly, this film is terrible, and the producers were obviously banking on the original Star Wars coming back all excited, and didn't bother come up with a good story.

What's wrong?   Well --

(1)  The virtuous Obiwan Kenobi talks an admiring young boy to participate in a dangerous race so that he can bet on the boy and win the money he needs for his mission.   Sounds like the later movie HUNGER GAMES, except that in HUNGER GAMES we're expected to despise people who bet on children's lives.

(2)  The young boy befriends a teenage girl who is presumably 6 or 7 years older.  Come the next movie, they're suddenly the same age so that they can have a love affair.  Are they of different species that age at different rates, or did the writers simply not plan ahead?

(3)  The boy's mother tells Obiwan that she gave birth to the boy without having sex.  Having introduced this bizarre Christological symbolism, the writers promptly forget it.

(4)  And there's a character named JarJar, who apparently has no function in the movie except to irritate a lot of the critics. || ***Solid return of the franchise after 16 years, highlighted by Liam Neeson***

A Jedi Knight & his apprentice (Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor) escape a blockade with their new Gungan friend, Jar Jar Binks, and the handmaiden of Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). Upon damaging their vessel, they find sanctuary on a planet where they meet a slave boy, a gifted pilot and engineer, who may be the prophesied “Chosen One.” Meanwhile, the supposedly extinct Sith resurface, including Darth Maul (Ray Park). 

""Star Wars: Episode 1 – The Phantom Menace"" (1999) is the fourth Star Wars film and the first of the prequel trilogy, followed by “Attack of the Clones” (2002) and “Return of the Sith” (2005). It marked writer/director George Lucas’ return to the popular franchise after 16 years, the previous film being “Return of the Jedi” (1983).

Star Wars is fantasy packaged as science-fiction or “space fantasy” whereas Star Trek is dramatic science-fiction in a space-travel context. I’ve always preferred the latter because it’s more adult-oriented, but I don’t mind a Star Wars flick now and then and “The Phantom Menace” is entertaining enough. 

There’s a new cast of characters along with a young version of Obi-Wan Kenobi and R2D2, C-3PO, Yoda and Jabba. Liam Neeson stands tall as the no-nonsense Qui-Gon Jinn, McGregor is solid and Portman is attractive at the young age of 17. Also notable is Hugh Quarshie as Captain Panaka.  

I didn’t mind the loathed Jar Jar Binks and I enjoyed the wondrous underwater sequence and the thrilling podrace in the first half (even though the mother allowing her son to enter the life-and-death contest is unlikely, not to mention the Jedi knights condoning it). Unfortunately the climax comes down to the clichéd “big battle sequence” and it’s predictable who’s gonna die in the corresponding duel. Yawn. Still, “The Phantom Menace” is all-around entertaining if you have a taste for Star Wars.          
    
The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes.

It might be a while but would watch again. Would also mention it to others, but let them judge how good it was. It's not for everyone. || Put it back. Bury it where you found it. You have read the curse. You dare defy it?

The Mummy is directed by Karl Freund and written by Nina Wilcox Putnam, Richard Schayer and John L. Balderston. It stars Boris Karloff, Zita Johann, David Manners, Arthur Byron, Edward Van Sloan, and Bramwell Fletcher. Music is by James Dietrich and cinematography by Charles J. Stumar.

The first of Universal's Mummy films follows the story of Imhotep (Karloff), who after being awaken from his tomb by expedition workers, believes his lover has been reincarnated in the body of a modern woman.

It's undeniably slow moving, it's stagy, and away from Karloff the acting and dialogue is just about reaching average qualities. Yet there's a haunting quality to the pic, with a number of genuinely eerie sequences. The shadowed photography helps greatly for funereal atmospherics, while it's somewhat refreshing to find a film of this type not resorting to shock tactics to get your attention.

An important film in a lot of ways and well worth a look for those interested in the history of Horror Film. 7/10 || When a team of British Museum explorers discover the tomb of an Egyptian princess, they also discover the mummy of her forbidden lover ""Imhotep"" (Boris Karloff) and a secret scroll that has the power, when read aloud, to restore the dead to life. It's on reading that document in the crypt that the mummy is restored to life and escaping for the moment, he determines to return and rescue his princess at all costs so he can restore her too. As it happens, ten years later, a young woman ""Helen"" (Zita Johann) whose father is a British administrator, is in Cairo - and she is the spitting image of the dead princess. Might she even be a reincarnation? Well ""Imhotep"" certainly reckons so and she is to be the body selected for the soul of his reincarnated love. It's quite interesting in that this mummy lives in plain sight. There are no bandage wrappings to trail behind him, there is no lurching statically - Karloff's depiction is far more human; and I felt far more menacing. His personification here has a calculating menace to it that I thought worked quite effectively as the story heads to it's actually rather sad denouement. The supporting cast - including the rather sterile Johann - are competent enough at providing a template for our mummy to plunder and though maybe there is just a little too much dialogue - perhaps an overcompensation from silent films - it's still one of my favourite iterations of this compelling and mysterious story."

Hammer Film Productions rework some of the classic Universal Studios mummy material to great effect. Directed by Terence Fisher, this is not a remake of the seminal 1932 movie of the same name. Starring Peter Cushing (John Banning), Christopher Lee (Kharis/The Mummy), Raymond Huntley (Joseph Whemple) and Yvonne Furneaux (Isobel Banning/Princess Ananka), the film is written by Jimmy Sangster and was filmed at Bray & Shepperton Studios in England and is photographed in Eastman Color. I mention the latter because Eastman Color has a different hue to it, something that makes this movie all the more affecting as a horror piece.

The plot sees three archaeologists (Stephen & John Banning & Joseph Whemple) desecrate the tomb of Egyptian Princess Ananka. This awakens Kharis, Ananka's blasphemous lover who was buried alive for his unlawful deeds. Taken from the tomb to London by Egyptian priest Mehemet Bey (George Pastell), the three archaeologists find they are being hunted down by the vengeful Kharis. The only salvation may come in the form of Isobel Banning who bears a striking resemblance to Princess Ananka.

This Mummy is adroitly directed by Fisher, his choreography for the action scenes is stunning. Lee's incarnation as the mouldy bandaged one is swifter than most, thus Fisher has him stalking around Victorian England one minute, then the next he's crashing thru doors or windows with brute strength - with murder his (its) only goal. It's a top performance from Lee as he really throws himself into the role, with his dead eyes ominously peering out from gauze swathed sockets sending those little shivers running down the spine. Technically the film belies the budget restrictions that was a staple of Hammer productions. The sets are very impressive with the Egyptian tomb set original and authentic looking, and the swamp based set-up nicely constructed. The latter of which provides two genuine horror classic moments, as first we see the Mummy for the first time as he rises from a foul bubbling bog, and then for the dramatic swampy finale. It's also atmospherically filmed by Fisher, with Jack Asher's photography utilising the Eastman Color to give off a weird elegiac beauty.

This is not about gore, Fisher and the makers wanted to thrive on atmospherics and implication, something they achieve with great rewards. The Mummy would prove to be very successful in Britain and abroad, thus ensuring Hammer would dig up more Mummy's for further screen outings, none of which came close to capturing the look and feel of this first makeover. Crisply put together and with another in the line of great Christopher Lee monster characterisations, this Mummy is essential viewing for the creature feature horror fan. 8/10 || While falling a bit short of the earlier Frankenstein and Dracula ""reboots"" from Hammer, this one is still quite good, again due to the talents of Fisher, Cushing, and Lee. It's story, while borrowing many elements from the 1940s Universal sequels, is quite good and this is probably the best version of the Kharis character ever filmed. Christopher Lee's interpretation brings an aggressive, monstrous, and emoting mummy, not the slow, lumbering version of the 1940s (apologies to Lon Chaney). A first rate offering from Hammer."

I would think most people have either seen Superman:The Movie, or at the least heard everything about it. It's one of those films that sticks out in cinema history as a defining point, and some like me would say a high point as well. I recently revisited the film for the first time in about 5 years and had such a wonderful time with it, the moment John Williams exhilarating score kicks in a get goosebumps and start to believe a man can really can fly. 

The expectation level on release of the film in 1978 was enormous, one can not understate the hugely iconic love that the DC Comic character of Superman had. A worldwide search for the right actor to don the red and blue cape was underway, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Ryan O'Neal, Nick Nolte and Charles Bronson were all at times linked with the hot role, whilst James Caan and Robert Redford are confirmed to have passed after being offered the job. All of those great names now seem remarkably stupid choices, and that is purely down to the man that did take on the gargantuan role that was bursting at the seams with expectation. That Superman:The Movie worked (and still does with each passing decade) is down to the wonderful efforts of Christopher Reeve.

Reeve positively nailed both sides of the character, making it his own, he is all muscles and square jaw in the cape and then showing wonderful comic ability as the bumblingly frustrating Clark Kent. Sure the supporting cast all contribute grandly, but Reeve carries the picture and lifts it to triumphant heights. Gene Hackman has the time of his life camping it up as super villain Lex Luthor, Ned Beatty & Valerie Perrine flesh out Luthor's cohorts with comedy and sexiness respectively, whilst Margot Kidder is a pure joy as core character of the piece, Lois Lane. Asked to play a love interest but a fiercely strong woman at the same time, Kidder breezes through it and radiates a beauty that couples nicely with Reeve's broadness. Marlon Brando was paid $4 Million for what is little more than a prologue walk on part, but the big name he brought to the party ensured the paying customer went through the doors in droves, but on leaving the cinema it was Reeve's name that most were talking about.

Full of outlandish sequences and cheeky comic book ideals, Superman is lasting the test of time as an endearing classic of the genre, it may have been surpassed by quite a few of the more modern exploits by Spiders and Bats, but it was once the Daddy of them all. From x-ray eyes to catching bullets, to pushing nuclear missiles into space and wooing Lois in the sky, Superman:The Movie is a special treat, and oh how I love you so. 9/10

Christopher Reeve RIP. || _**""Miss Teschmacher!""**_

I didn't catch ""Superman"" (1978) until over 25 years after its release. It's a great superhero flick with a lot of wit, well worthy of its reputation. Although a couple of things are understandably dated, like the flying sequences and Clark Kent's glasses (which are so BAD they're laughable), the movie definitely stands the test of time despite being shot in 1977.

""Superman"" may be a comic-booky superhero flick, but it's also a powerful piece of SCI-FI cinema. The outstanding Krypton sequences of the first half hour confirm this. These scenes are highlighted by the magnificence of Marlon Brando playing Superman's father Jor-El. So, if you're a serious Sci-Fi fan, don't skip ""Superman"" just because you assume it's some mere superhero flick. No, it's more, much more. The screenplay seems to have been written with little concern of cost so many are the great F/X sequences.

Speaking of Brando, you can't beat the cast, starting with newbie Christopher Reeve knocking it out of the ballpark in the starring role.

I'd like to point something out that is hardly ever mentioned: Lex Luthor's girlfriend, Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine, is jaw-droppingly voluptuous! Watch out for the pool scene where Ms. Perrine is wearing a green one-piece bathing suit.

The film is a little long at 2 hours, 23 minutes, but it doesn't overstay its welcome.

GRADE: A || This movie will stand to the End of Time. This film is an absolute Masterpiece. The Writers & Director knew what they were doing. Christopher Reeve is a Powerhouse. He portrayed this Character So Well! He played Clark Kent & Superman as 2 Different Characters while being the Same Person. Margot Kidder was Fantastic as Lois Lane. Gene Hackman and Valerie Perrine were Great as Lex Luthor & Eve Teschmacher. The Entire Cast was Phenomenal. This Film will always get a 10/10."

A star...a legend...and a mother...the illusion of perfection.,Drama,128,1981-09-16,en,6.379,219,1.6165,"Faye Dunaway, Diana Scarwid, Steve Forrest, Howard Da Silva, Mara Hobel",Frank Perry,"child abuse, adoption, biography, sociopath, lawyer, hollywood, mansion, docudrama, perfection, mother daughter estrangement, adopted child, mother daughter relationship, ax, controlling parent","_**Surprisingly good, sometimes great, and more balanced than its reputation**_

The life of Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is detailed from 1939, when her career was on a downswing, to her death in 1977, focusing on her rivalrous relationship with her adopted daughter Christina (Mara Hobel & Diana Scarwid).  

“Mommie Dearest” (1981) is a ‘controversial’ drama because it dares to reveal the hidden truth about a member of Hollywood royalty, at least according to her first two adopted kids, Christina and Christopher, who have stuck to their guns in the decades since. Sure, the younger twin sisters, Cindy & Cathy, dispute the claims of gross abuse (while admitting Joan was strict), but they were only 3 years-old when Christina was 11 and so weren’t present or were simply too young to know what went down with Christina & Christopher. Another thing to consider is that Joan learned a few lessons on parenting in raising the two older kids and therefore was wiser with her treatment of Cindy & Cathy.  

The movie is neither campy nor an “unintentional comedy.” This is a dramatic biopic of the final 38 years of Joan’s life with concentration on the 40s-50s. It’s a great behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood of that period. The viewer becomes privy to Joan’s struggles with romance, maintaining success in a challenging career, aging, finances, male chauvinism and… childrearing. 

While Gene Siskel gave the movie a fair 2.5/4 rating, both he and Ebert complained that the picture was too depressing, but that is a one-dimensional perspective. Yes, the abusive episodes aren’t fun, but there are only two really bad ones, the wire hanger and the choking sequences. In other words, there’s WAY more to this movie than Joan being an abusive monster.

Speaking of which, the flick is surprisingly evenhanded with the ""Queen of the Movies.” It shows the good, the bad and the ugly, NOT just the ugly. Near the end of the story it’s clear that there was some genuine warmth and care in Christina’s relationship with Joan. The ending, however, put the final nail in the coffin (which I’m not going to reveal, even though it’s historically documented). Yet the film makes it clear that Joan believed in self-made success because she felt it created character as opposed to everything being handed to the individual. So perhaps in her mind she believed she was doing both Christina & Christopher a favor because she believed they had the talent & aptitude to make it in life just fine without any further help from her.

Some critics, including Siskel & Ebert, claimed that the movie didn’t explain Joan’s abusive tendencies with Christina (and Christopher), but it does for anyone who opens their eyes. She was a control-freak and perfectionist, not to mention she clearly developed a spirit of competition with Christina, as observed in the pool scene and, later, the soap opera episode.

Faye blamed the director for not reining her in during the two extreme scenes of mistreatment but, while these may or may not be slightly overdone, ALL biopics exaggerate things for dramatic purposes. For instance, do you think for a second that, in “Braveheart” (1995), William Wallace really trotted into a Baron’s bedchambers on a freakin’ horse for a confrontation and was easily able to escape on the horse? That said, I found those two maniacal scenes thoroughly believable. In fact, from my experience these kinds of hysterical incidents happen in practically EVERY family on occasion, hopefully very infrequently (just like in the film). For instance, I’ve had a few shameful meltdowns over the years that I wouldn’t care to elaborate on, how much more so a passionate actress juggling the demands of a Hollywood career and everything that goes with it?

Speaking of Dunaway’s performance, she was perfect for the role and shouldn’t be embarrassed by this movie in the least. Critic Pauline Kael rightly emphasized that she gave ""a startling, ferocious performance."" Furthermore, the movie was a deserved financial hit at the box office and continues to make money decades later as a cult phenomenon. Unfortunately for Faye, it was considered blasphemous to honestly criticize such an icon as Joan Crawford. Evidently people can’t handle the truth.  

The film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot entirely in the Greater Los Angeles area.

Great sequel that expands on the introductory scenes in Superman (1978) where we met General Zod, Ursa and the massive moron, Non - although I wouldn't call him a moron to his face. (Perhaps if I had a ladder)

But anyway, these three criminals are inadvertently released from the Phantom Zone by Superman and they naturally head toward Earth seeking revenge on the son of their jailer.

Hackman receives top billing this time now that Brando collected his pay cheque and was at the bank cashing it.
A very entertaining and funny sequel thanks to Richard Lester's expert hand at comedy.



- Potential Kermode || Fun packed and humanistic sequel is worthy alright.

Superman II stars Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Terence Stamp, Ned Beatty, Sarah Douglas, Margot Kidder, and Jack O'Halloran. It was to be a troubled shoot that saw two directors involved with the project. Richard Donner had completed about three quarters of the film before being taken off the project, so Richard Lester then came in to finish the film. Because of the back stage problems there are a host of writers credited on the film and both Robert Paynter & Geoffrey Unsworth were involved with the cinematography. Filmed using the Megasound system the score is a reworking of John Williams original score by Ken Thorne.

Something of a miracle in itself that Superman II, in spite of all the behind the scenes shenanigans, is a very fine sequel to the massively successful Superman from 78. Sure there's some odd tonal shifts, a couple of things don't quite add up (to be corrected later on down the line with the release of the Richard Donner cut), while the villains are badly under written, but this has enough comic book adaptation savvy to please most comic book lovers.

This time around sees Superman pitted against three villains who have been released from their prison due to Superman himself detonating a hydrogen bomb in space. The big kicker here being that the three convicts, General Zod, Ursa and  Non, are from his home planet of Krypton and had been imprisoned by his father Jor-El. Now they are free they are hell bent on revenge against the son of Jor-El and the planet that worships him. If that was not enough for Superman to contend with, he also has affairs of the heart to deal with as his love for Lois Lane grows ever stronger by the day. While a certain Lex Luthor is plotting his escape from prison...

Pic nicely fuses a humanistic heart with exciting set pieces, to make Superman II a worthy sequel to the wonderful template that is the first film. Ultimately we should embrace both cuts of Superman II or it would go downhill from here...  7/10 || _**Continues the super-story of the groundbreaking first film**_

Three Kryptonian criminals escape imprisonment in the Phantom Zone (Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran) to harass citizens of the United States, including the president (E.G. Marshall), while Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) schmoozes them. Meanwhile Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) suspects that Clark Kent is Superman (Christopher Reeve) during an assignment to Niagara Falls before flying off to fight the Kryptonians. Susannah York plays Kal-El’s mother while Jackie Cooper is on hand as Perry White.

""Superman II"" (1980) was mostly shot simultaneously with the first film in 1977 wherein director Richard Donner had shot 75% of the film before focusing on finishing the first movie. When the flick went back into production in 1978 Donner was controversially fired and replaced with Richard Lester, who was already working on the project with Donner as second unit director. Marlon Brando’s scenes as Jor-El were cut (obviously because he wanted too much money, i.e. 11.75% of gross US box office earnings) and redone with Lara (York). 

Despite the behind-the-scenes drama, this is a thoroughly entertaining sequel with some people even claiming it’s better. What makes the film work so well is that (1) the three Kryptonian villains are interesting and their superhuman exploits are engaging, (2) Luthor is likewise amusing, (3) the sci-fi ambiance and special effects are state-of-the-art for the late 70s and (4) the drama involving Clark/Supes and Lois (and Perry White) is consistently entertaining. On the downside, I could do without Otis’ goofy antics (Ned Beatty) and the movie is slightly overlong. 

The film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes and was shot in Paris; Norway; Niagara Falls & Calgary, Canada; Pinewood Studios (the Metropolis scenes, etc.), Chobham Common, Surrey (the East Houston, Idaho, scenes), & London Underground, England; and St Lucia.

Using a strand of Superman's hair, Luthor synthesizes a powerful ally known as Nuclear Man and ignites an epic battle spanning Earth and space.","Nuclear Power. In the best hands, it is dangerous.

Bad effects aside, this one is definitely more fun than the _tedious and dull_ Superman Returns and Man Of Steel stuff - an overload of special effects does not make an engaging film.


The performances here are all top notch as usual and the plot moved swiftly without taking itself too seriously. The franchise has always been silly - stupid even - especially when we remember that _Richard Donner's Superman had Ned Beatty as the moronic Otis._

The silliness has always been integral to the Superman series. || Filled with cheap gags, really horrible visual effects, a lazy story, a very bad musical score by Alexander Courage, a terrible villain (Nuclear Man), and some tiresome performances by the cast (except for Christopher Reeve), Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is one of the worst films ever made, the one of the worst movie sequels of all time, and the worst Superman film of all time. It is the kryptonite nail in the coffin for the Superman films, and none of the films after this even tried to save the Man Of Steel from his own detriment. || _**The least of the tetralogy due to a slashed budget and the corresponding cheesy F/X**_

Superman (Christopher Reeve) destroys all nuclear warheads on Earth for the sake of world peace, but Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has discovered a way to make a nuclear-powered thrall from Supes’ DNA and the energy of the Sun. Meanwhile a tycoon & his daughter take over The Daily Planet (Sam Wanamaker & and Mariel Hemingway).

“Superman IV: The Quest for Peace” (1987) is the weakest of the quadrilogy because the Salkind family sold the franchise to a Grade B production company, Cannon, and so instead of the healthy $39 million budget of “Superman III” (1983) it was slashed to $17 million (although it was originally supposed to be $36 million), which is apparent in the low-rent opening credits and the non-special effects throughout. 

Other than that glaring flaw, the main cast returns and the story is decent, augmented by the kick-axx Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) and the continuation of Clark’s relationship with Lois (Margot Kidder).

The first two movies are standout sci-fi motion pictures, despite hailing from the late ’70s, and the third one has worthy themes if you can adjust to the parody tone and cartoonish presence of Richard Pryor (at least his character has a worthy story arc). This one, by contrast, is disappointing due to the second rate vibe. While there are some entertaining elements, the drop in quality is just too noticeable.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot entirely in England with establishing shots of New York City, The Golden Gate Bridge, The Great Wall of China, etc.

A funny, exciting Superman movie that includes the greatest scene in the franchise - the junkyard fight between Evil Supes and his nerdy counterpart, Clark Kent.

Richard Pryor is hilarious as the hapless Gus Gorman - the computer programming genius with a heart. Robert Vaughn makes for a great villain and the special effects are top notch.

So much more entertaining than the tedious bile that would come in later years - Superman Returns and the Henry Cavill rubbish.

I remember sitting in the packed theater in 1983 and the whole audience thoroughly enjoying this - laughing and cheering in all the right places.

And for those who claim the film is too silly - do they not remember Ned Beatty as the cretin Otis in Superman and Superman II - surely the stupidest character to grace the series.

- Charles Dance || Never underestimate the power of computers.

After being caught for a money making computer scam, Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor - wonderful) is recruited by unscrupulous multimillionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). With Gorman's computer expertise, Webster plans to take complete economic control. But first there is the considerable issue of eradicating Superman first...

Richard Lester, as everyone now knows, inherited Superman 2 from the jettisoned Richard Donner. Here we have a complete Richard Lester Superman film, and from the extended slapstick opening we are aware that this is far lighter in tone than the previous two films. Lester's credits are steeped in comedy traditions, so it's no real surprise that Superman 3 is more airy comic book than troubled caped crusader. This is something that many franchise fans are completely unforgiving about. Which is a shame, because viewed as a comic book bit of nonsense it's a rather enjoyable film, certainly it's the one with the most fun approach. 

The action is very well put together, with a franchise highlight as Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) gets to fight a clearly off kilter Superman (erm, Reeve again), and the comedy, if accepted on its own terms, is very rewarding. Annette O'Toole (adorable) takes the lead love interest role for this one, with Margo Kidder only along for cameo duties. Pamela Stephenson is on hand for some sex bomb side-kick to Vaughn work, and Annie Ross gest the bitch sibling role and gets her teeth and ""wires"" into it.

All told, it's not a ground shaking superhero film, but it does work as entertainment if one can cast off the mythology of Superman and his fantastical complexities. To do so is not a crime against ones superhero beliefs, it's just an acceptance that this is a different approach, and that Superman 3's only real crime is not being as good as the two film's that preceded it. Hey, just think, ""Quest For Peace"" was around the corner... 6/10 || _**More than it first appears**_

""Superman III"" (1983) gets a lot of flack because of the inclusion of slapstick, a parody tone and Richard Pryor, but it is entertaining once you get used to the tone and the presence of Pryor.

Christopher Reeve as Superman is good, of course, but you also have Robert Vaughn as the Luthor-like villain and Pamela Stephenson as his attractive female assistant a la Miss Teschmacher. The cast really excels with the inclusion of the beautiful Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang, a sort of replacement for Lois Lane, who barely appears. Annette is a pleasure to behold throughout.

Once you get used to the too-goofy approach the film really takes off in the second half with Superman fighting his dark side, an obvious type of the inner conflict of flesh & spirit within us all. Even more, there's the satisfying redemption of a certain character that illustrates how a person can make a huge mistake and still be applicable for redemption, as long as he or she is willing. The film just leaves you with a good feeling.

BOTTOM LINE: It's not great like the first two, but ""Superman III"" delivers if you overlook all the bashing and give it a chance. Richard Pryor is goofy, but likable while Annette O'Toole shines. Most of all, the movie is deeper than what meets the eye and effectively conveys powerful truths about the human condition and potential.

The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes.

Lugosi not only growls and snarls but also delivers the succulent seductive power of both evil itself and immortality--no matter what devastating consequences that immortal life may truly mean.

Essential for both horror fanatics and fans of early (up to and including the 30's) cinema to own on the highest-possible quality, and regular re-watches. It's simply THAT GOOD.

The fact that its American release date was Valentine's Day (its New York City premiere was two days earlier) only further hits home the fact that its immortality is due to the fact that it isn't simply a cornerstone of Gothic horror but with a vibrant love story at its very heart. || Probably my third or fourth time seeing this and while the story is simple, still really entertaining and Bela Lugosi, who even as a favorite of mine acknowledge was never the strongest actor, is in his element. Also has some decent effects and nice set design for the era. **4.0/5** || ""The blood is the life, Mr. REINFIELD""



At three years old this was my first horror movie. My great-grandmother is the one who sat me down and showed me great Bela Lugosi as Dracula. This entire movie is timeless and classic. The very best of all the Universal horrors.

No one could be a more perfect Dracula than Bela Lugosi. To accomplish so much with just a stare. No special effects. No fangs... yet he chilled you to the bone and enthralled all.

Starting with the monster itself, we find a fantastic character. Without any lines of dialogue, the filmmakers and Boris Karloff had to use actions and emotions to display the motivations of the monster, and they did a fantastic job of it. The fear, confusion, and longing that the novel describes are evident in the monster's actions, to the point of pushing the audience to root for him.

The rest of the characters are also a bit of fun. Baron Frankenstein, played by Fred Kerr, was also a hoot. He played a no-nonsense character that functioned well in the comic-relief role needed with Edward Van Sloan's Dr. Wladman and Mae Clarke's Elizabeth being quite serious, even dramatic. Colin Clive, the man who played Doctor Henry, did a decent job in his role as well, pulling off the role of being consumed by his work, even when he desired to be free from it. 

The acting, overall, was a touch more theatrical than I would prefer in a horror movie, but it wasn't so distracting that it pulled me out of the film. The film is a ton of fun to watch, but I do have to say it isn't exactly terrifying. The atmospheric creepiness is somewhat lacking compared to modern-era horror, even going back fifty years. That being said, the movie, if thought about and rewatched, does a good job of displaying how the fear of the unknown, and letting that fear take over, can be the real monster. || Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God! 

We will always see debates about which of the original wave of Universal Monster movies is the most important. With Dracula being released just under a year before Frankenstein, that tends to give the vampire crowd a sense of justifiable cause for a trumpet fanfare. Perhaps the more pertinent question is which is the better movie? Surely the most hardened of Dracula fans have to bow their heads in acknowledgement that Frankenstein quite simply is superior on every level - even if it itself is not as good as its sequel...

Narrative doesn't quite follow Mary Shelley's original source material (what a brain that lady had!), but the core essence of a tragic tale holds tight. Directing was one James Whale, who here was in his directorial infancy, he himself up for debate about greatest horror genre directors, but his masterful sense of theatrical staging, and that of the terror incarnate for the era, is sublime to the point that come 100 years after its release this will still be held up as a timeless horror classic.

The thematics of the story pulse with brilliance, the advent of berserker science, the alienation and confusion flow of the creature grips and stings the heart equally. The later camp of Whale's horror ventures is mostly absent here, instead we have a dark almost miserably bleak tone, which exists right up to the end title card which brings closure after the brilliant and iconic finale has made its mark. Jack Pierce's marvelous make-up and the birth of Karloff as a genre legend seals the deal on what is without doubt one of the genre's most important films. 9/10 || Not a totally faithful adaptation of the Mary Shelley book, still extremely important for not just horror movies, but movies as a whole. I thought about coming at this review from the perspective of what 1931's _Frankenstein_ meant for the future of cinema, and how it was still essentially in its infancy and doing anything even close to what _Frankenstein_ did, changing the culture forever and remaining in the zeitgeist even now, almost a hundred years later, is a monumental achievement and should be viewed as such. But that's never really been my jam. _Frankenstein_ might have been great for the time, I don't know, I wasn't there, but I personally only ever found it to be okay. Re-watching it this Halloween was, I think the fourth time I've given it a go, and it's really not as enthralling as people seem to give it credit for. My roommate fell asleep. It's not that it's black and white either, it just doesn't have as clear a philosophical intention as the book, nor as gripping an output as more modern offerings.

That's why I'm here. If I ever find peace I'll find it here.

In an effort to revitalise their monster franchise at the box offices, Universal hit on the idea of of featuring more than one monster in a movie. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man was to be the first of many such ventures.

Lon Chaney Jr is back as Larry Talbot/The Wolf Man, who after being awoken by unsuspecting grave robbers, is once again tortured by his curse and desperately wants an end to his misery. Seeking out the Gypsy woman Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), the pair of them head off to find Dr. Frankenstein in the hope of finding a solution. He's dead, though, but there's another scientist on hand for help and as the villagers once again take unkindly to someone rekindling old nightmares, all while the Frankenstein Monster (Bela Lugosi) is found preserved in ice...

It's in effect a sequel to both The Wolf Man and The Ghost of Frankenstein, though as would become the norm, Monster Frank is a bit part player in a film bearing his name. The film is delightfully brisk and with Chaney doing good work as the tortured Talbot - with the relationship between Maleva and himself quite touching - the story carries emotional weight. However, Lugosi doesn't look right for the role of the monster, Patrick Knowles' switcharoo to a mad scientist is ill thought out, while the big smack down finale is sadly all too brief.

Nobody in the film, except maybe Chaney, was done any favours in the editing and writing rooms, but it's still a whole bunch of fun for fans of the Universal Monsters series. 6/10 || A couple of grave-robbers get much more than they bargained for when they desecrate the tomb of Wolf-Man ""Larry Talbot"" (Lon Chaney Jr.) who is ultimately seeking the peace of death.

It still works cinematically, three generations later, as my 13-year-old son really enjoyed it as well. Though the filmmakers were forced to use other makeup rather than that copyrighted by Universal Studios in James Whale's masterpiece, that isn't problematic in the slightest for your enjoyment of the picture. Worth a purchase and rewatches either for fans of the genre in the slightest, of period pieces in general, or of the Mary Shelley novel. A fine work which is one of the best of director Fisher's career. || Even if we dared to omit its landmark importance; it's still a terrific movie. 

The Curse Of Frankenstein is out of Hammer Film Productions and based on the novel Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley. It's directed by Terence Fisher, written by Jimmy Sangster and stars Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Hazel Court & Robert Urquhart. Jack Asher is the cinematographer and James Bernard scores the music.

The first Hammer film in colour, The Curse Of Frankenstein began the second wave of cinematic horror some 25 odd years after the Universal heyday of the 30s. Where Hammer's version differs from the Universal offerings, who were carefully watching what Hammer were doing, is by focusing on the Baron himself rather than the actual iconic creature. This approach threw many critics and observers at the time, with some either calling it too talky, or worse still, depressing and degrading. But the box office tills rang, both in Britain and America, and now the film is revered by film makers and horror historians alike. Rightly so.

Plot basically sees Baron Victor Frankenstein in prison for murder, where faced with the guillotine, he tells to a priest an amazing story of how he and his mentor successfully resurrected a dead body. The resulting creation being the one who committed the murder for which the Baron is now charged. The first masterstroke from Hammer was appointing Fisher and Sangster, the former shoots in lurid Eastmancolor; thus setting the marker for the Gothic style of Hammer to come, the latter produced a crackling script that make the scientist of the piece the actual monster. The second masterstroke was in the casting of Cushing as the driven Frankenstein. Then just a classy actor on TV, Cushing plays it in turns as cold blooded and elegantly charming. Lee, only getting the gig after Bernard Bresslaw's agent demanded too much money, actually doesn't have to do much, but his marionette movements coupled with the fleshy patchwork make up of his face make it totally memorable. Both men of course went on to become horror legends from here.

It's far from the best Hammer Horror film, in fact it's not the best of the Universal Creature reinventions. But it adds grit and intelligence to the Gothic atmospherics, its visuals striking as the character based narrative propels eerily forward. 8/10 || Entertaining if not also flawed monster horror film that excels in large part for Peter Cushing and Robert Urquhart, with the gothic atmosphere. Dialogue is a bit lackluster but liked the change up with the classic story and fun to see Christopher Lee as the ""Creature"". **3.5/5**"

Tarantula is a big personal fave of mine from this particular genre, so I make no apologies for my uncontrolled bias! The film opens with a facially malformed man running through the desert until he collapses, and from then on in we are treated to a story involving acromegaly (a disease that causes gigantism), and a gigantic tarantula eating everything that gets in its path, its pure sci-fi/horror hokum for sure. 

However, Tarantula has that knack of spinning the story with only minor glimpses of the spider until we are positively sensing the dread that is about to be unleashed. Using a real spider inserted onto the screened landscape, and then having it crawling over smartly moulded miniature sets, really adds to the creepy fun unfolding. Directed by genre hero Jack Arnold, and starring stoic actors like John Agar & Leo G Carroll, Tarantula is 80 minutes of pure genre entertainment. 8/10 || Boy, does this show its age!* But, you know what, I really enjoyed it.

<em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/eight-legged-freaks/"">Eight Legged Freaks</a>'</em>, eat your heart out! I seem to have found a new go-to Spider Rampage Flick™. To be serious, <em>'Tarantula'</em> achieves what it intends to - it is relatively creepy in parts.

The special effects, as alluded to, have aged averagely, but there are still some excellent shots in there. When the spider is in a wide shot it looks very neat, the issues tend to arise when the creature is at the forefront of the shot - which turns into a sharp black-and-white shadow clash. Speaking of the b/w, it is a very dark film visually; especially for the night scenes. The make-up effects look great, either way though.

Leo G. Carroll, John Agar and Mara Corday are all good fun in their respective roles, they work well together which is obviously important. Corday oddly reminds me a lot of modern day actress <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/actor/madelyn-cline/"">Madelyn Cline</a> - I'm not entirely sure why, I think it's Corday's facial expressions/mannerisms.

Clint Eastwood has another small - though, quite the opposite in plot terms - role, this time towards the conclusion. He has a few lines of dialogue, but it's not a role of his that'll live long in the memory.

To think, Universal made 7 <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/francis-the-talking-mule-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"">Francis</a>'</em> films but produced just one of these. Unfortunate. I'd be up for a remake.

<em>'* = I'm sure, and I am led to believe, it looked great for the time. || Allowing for the fact that the special effects are getting on for 65 years old, this is a cracking little sci-fi/horror feature. John Agar is the scientist on the trail of an industrial-sized spider that is wreaking havoc on a local Arizona community. Leo G.

Herman Stein's music is a little derivative but it also helps to create some tension as they all race to stop the arachnid terror from desiccating everything it meets."

Trash, yes, but classy trash, and most enjoyable. || A time(warp)less classic! || **As a film, it could be better, but it's funny and bizarre enough for us to see it at least once in our lives.**

This is one of those films that everyone should see at least once in their life. It's a pretty good comedy musical where satire meets nonsense intensely, in a film adaptation of an English play that had been successful at the time. I don't know much about the stage version, I don't even know if there are any concrete differences, but I can say that the film gives us exactly what it promises.

The story told is probably the film's biggest weakness: anyone who likes logic and a story with some consistent structure will be disappointed with this purposefully disjointed, sloppy and surrealistic script, where an innocent and foolish engaged couple ends up lost in a storm and ends up in a gothic mansion. There lives the bizarre Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a kind of mad scientist who is proudly gay, transvestite and from “Transsexual Transylvania”, presumably another planet or dimension. He has just created a man for his sexual pleasure and is celebrating this effusively with other strange characters, such as his enslaved servants.

From the moment the couple enters the mansion and meets its owner and his guests, the film stops and starts to hiccup a lot: the director had no good ideas to present from then on and limited himself to recreating the play in a cinematic environment. Obviously, the film has an intense sexual energy that challenges us to awaken our sexuality, to explore our bodies, pleasure and sexual identity. Sexual maturity, sexual identity and homosexuality are strong themes that underlie the script and fit well into the era in which the film appeared (remember, the Sexual Revolution was still leaving its marks at this time). Furthermore, the Counterculture was experiencing an intense moment at the time and made its aesthetic and visual contribution, which was very noticeable in the sets and costumes.

The film has some anthology-worthy scenes, such as Frank-N-Furter's personal introduction at the beginning of the film, and a very strong cast dominated by actors with unquestionable talent. Tim Curry, in his film debut, is gigantic in the lead role and absolutely dominates every scene. He's sexy, he's provocative, he's malevolent, intense and sometimes cruel. The actor gives himself completely to his work, without fear, and offers us work of absolute value. Susan Sarandon, still exuding youth, is perfect as a modest, sexually repressed and docile young woman, and Barry Bostwick seems an excellent choice for her romantic partner. Richard O’Brien and Charles Gray also do a good job, while Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell work very well on the songs, but have little to add when the music stops. On the negative side... Jonathan Addams added very little to the film, Meat Loaf makes only one unnecessary appearance and Peter Hinwood, whose character could have been more central, is quickly discarded.

On a technical level, the film has several quality aspects that deserve our analysis and a positive comment, starting with the colorful, clear and impactful cinematography, and the elaborate and bizarre sets. The makeup and costumes are impressive, with a strong “punk” inspiration, but they look cheap. The castle where much of the film was made is beautiful and fits well into the story. Being a musical, the soundtrack is crucial and works very well. Even the less interesting songs work well from a narrative point of view, moving the film forward, with sung dialogue and the action advancing to the rhythm of the music. The opening credits song is iconic, as is “Sweet Trasvestite” which introduces us to the main character, but I confess that I especially liked “There’s a Light”. It's a very beautiful song and full of hope."

The Thing from Another World is set at The North Pole and finds a bunch of U.S. airmen, scientists and a journalist getting more than they bargained for when they investigate a space craft frozen in the ice. 

What is most striking about the film is the basic human story of team work, the pulling together of mankind during a crisis, this theme is a big shift from the short story by John W Campbell Jr. (Who Goes There?). Where that story and later John Carpenter's wonderful remake focused on paranoia and mistrust, this film is something of the ""polar"" opposite (literally) as regards the group in peril. It bears all the hallmarks of producer Howard Hawks, who clearly influenced Nyby's direction. The script, with its pros and cons of a military and scientific society, is very much of its time, blending po-faced observations with straight backed joviality. But this all works in the film's favour and helps define it as one of the most important science fiction pictures ever made. 

Along with the other major sci-fi movie of 1951, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""TTFAW"" firmly brought the visitor from outer space idea into the public conscious. But where the former film intellectualised the alien visitor, resplendent with a message of worth, the latter is about terror, pushing forward the notion that the visitor here is a monster that wants to drink our blood and attempt World domination. No major effects work is needed here because one of the pic's highlights is only glimpsing the creature (James Arness) in little snippets, and this after we are made to wait for some time before things really kick off. This begs us to think for ourselves as regards this stalking menace, putting us firmly with this intrepid group of people, and we want to see them survive and we do care if they can or do succeed. 

The low end budget doesn't hamper the atmosphere or flow, in fact Nyby, Hawks, cinematographer Russell Harlan and music maestro Dimitri Tiomkin, work wonders to ensure there's a level of authenticity to the Arctic base and that peril is never far away. Not hindered by many of the clichés that would dominate similar themed genre pieces that followed it, film neatly taps into fears that were to become prevalent as the 1950s wore on. It may not be perfect, but a genre star it still be - so watch the sky tonight indeed. 9/10 || **_Stuck at an isolated arctic station with some… Thing_**

Scientists at a base in the frozen North discern the crash-landing of an unknown vessel 50 miles away, which they naturally investigate with the corresponding militarists. They bring a mysterious frozen specimen back to the station. Big mistake.

“The Thing From Another World” (1951) was the first attempt to film John W. Campbell’s novella Who Goes There? Being shot in 1950, there’s a quaintness to the proceedings compared to the 1982 version with Kurt Russell or the 2011 prequel.

This version lacks the grimness of those two future renditions and the extraterrestrial (played by towering James Arness) is lame by comparison. We know from “War of the Worlds” and “The Blob” that flicks from the 50s can feature effective alien creatures and be genuinely scary, but I can’t really say that about this B&W classic, although there’s of course SOME creepiness at the remote station.

On the positive side, the elaboration on a mysterious plant-based lifeform from another planet is well-done and interesting. So is the contention between Capt. Hendry (Kenneth Tobey), who is intent on saving lives, and Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), who believes scientific discovery is above all, even above all lives on Earth. Speaking of which, the idea about the possible global threat of the lifeform is later explored in the great “Species.”

I suggest watching the 2011 and 1982 movies (in that order) and, if you want more, check out this classic for an alternative take on Campbell’s novella, assuming you don’t mind old-fashioned filmmaking and B&W photography.

The movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles (including at the Ice & Cold Storage Company in order to show condensed breath in the interiors); second unit work was done at Glacier National Park, Montana.

An alien ship crashes into the desert, at first it's thought to only be a meteorite, but small time scientist Richard Carlson gets to view the stricken ship before it is totally buried beneath the collapsing crater it created upon its crash landing. Nobody believes Carlson, but soon the aliens start taking on human form and it's then that everyone else must sit up and take notice before it's deemed too late.

It Came From Outer Space stands as one of the better sci-fi pictures to come out of the Cold War 1950s. Based on the Ray Bradbury story ""The Meteor"", the story leans heavily on anti-conformist themes and confidently trumpets something different to ourselves actually having the damn right to be different, and that is something I can personally truck with. As with most of the other films from the sci-fi/alien genre, ""it"" perfectly captures the paranoia of the people, the sense of mistrust befitting the atomic age, the fear of the desert never more evident than it is here.

Directed with some style from genre guru ""Jack Arnold"" (""This Island Earth""/""The Incredible Shrinking Man""), the film was originally shot in 3D, and though sadly I have never been able to see the picture in that format, I can certainly imagine greatly the impact that certain scenes would have had. The picture is also notable for the use of POV shooting from the alien perspective, all fuzzy focus from a spherical single eye, it works real well and would be something that many other film makers would use from here on in. 

This is not a film that relies on creatures to see it home safely, in fact we barely glimpse the creatures here, but we don't need that to be the case, for they make their mark regardless, all of which leaves It Came From Outer Space as a very knowing and quite often intelligent piece of work. 8/10"

Martians invade Earth with total destructive powers, seemingly unstoppable, mankind must find a way to beat them before all is Lost.

In spite of the uproar and considerable success of Orson Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of the H.G Wells novel, War Of The Worlds was a topic that directors were staying well away from. Such high esteemed men like as Cecil B. DeMille & Alfred Hitchcock were mooted to be interested but it always came down to a worry that the special effects needed for the story were too much of a headache. Enter producer George Pal, noted for puppetoon shorts, he managed to sway the big wigs at Paramount that it could indeed be done, and thus the chain of big colour spaceships blasting, sci-fi creatures lurking and blockbuster bums on seats movies began.

Directed by Byron Haskin, this version of the source moves the location from Edwardian England to 20th Century America, and this works a treat because the watching American public were genuinely unnerved at the sight of contemporary America being reduced to rubble by an invading force. The makers further our sense of dread by only letting us glimpse the aliens once in a wonderful scene (respectfully homaged in Stephen Spielberg's 2005 version of the source), other than that scene we are subjected to attack after attack from shiny flying saucers, slick and ground breaking effects working their magic on an impressionable audience.

Outside of those known to hardcore sci-fi fans, the cast doesn't contain any stars of note, probably due to all the money being used on the effects? And for sure many of them come across as wooden beyond compare (though the lovely Ann Robinson lights up every scene she is in), while if I'm to be over critical: then the romantic thread in the film is tiresome and the religious overtone is tardily done. But War Of The Worlds 1953 still stands proud as a brave and hugely enjoyable picture thats importance has never been (nor should it be) understated, and even allowing for nostalgic fervour from this particular viewer, I heartily recommend this film to anyone interested in template movies for the sci-fi genre. 7/10 || _**Clark Kent & Lois Lane face an invasion of Martians!**_

A flaming meteor lands near a small town in rural California, yet it turns out it’s not really a meteor, but rather the beginning of an extraterrestrial invasion!   

“The War of the Worlds” (1953) loosely interprets H.G. Wells' classic 1898 novel and moves the events up to the mid-20th century wherein Earthlings have modern weapons at their disposal, including the atomic bomb. 

Gene Barry and Ann Robinson play the protagonists, who are seriously reminicent of Clark Kent & Lois Lane. The movie wisely focuses on the alien invasion as seen through their eyes, which naturally gives the story human interest. The Martian vessels are superbly depicted and very threatening. Even better, the flick doesn’t skimp on showing the aliens up-close-and-personal and they’re even better than those in the 2005 reimagining (the one with Tom Cruise).

While the first two acts are compelling sci-fi cinema of the highest order (in its quaint early 50’s way), the story somewhat loses it’s captivating power in the last act when the story switches to Earth vs. the Martians and Clark, I mean Dr. Forrester, stumbling around post-apocalyptic Los Angeles desperately searching for Lois, I mean Sylvia.        

The film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal & Arizona.

GRADE: A-/B+ || Not great in terms of the script, acting or the abrupt ending, the practical effects were impressive and a lot of fun with the Martian ships flying and causing mayhem and destruction. I can imagine this wowed audiences back in '53. **3.0/5**"
