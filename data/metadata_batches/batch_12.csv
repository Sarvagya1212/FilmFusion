15487.0,The Greatest Game Ever Played,"A biopic of 20-year-old Francis Ouimet who defeated his golfing idol and 1900 US Open Champion, Harry Vardon.",,Drama,120.0,2005-09-30,en,7.29,502.0,1.9271,"Shia LaBeouf, Stephen Dillane, Josh Flitter, Peter Firth, Elias Koteas","Mark Frost, Bill Paxton","friendship, sports, golf, champion, biography, based on true story, 1910s, 1900s, inspirational, idol, golfers, golf tournament, golf course, caddie","Superb! One of Disney's best live-action offerings up until 2005.

It's yet another sports drama from the studio, one of many still to come too, but it's a cut above their previous live-actions releases in this subgenre; even beating 2002's <em>'The Rookie'</em>, which I like tremendously.

I love every detail of <em>'The Greatest Game Ever Played'</em>, which is about a true story. The score is splendid, the cinematography is excellent and the premise is riveting - even to someone like me who isn't a follower of golf. There are a few scenes that use effects, namely with Vardon, which look neat.

Vardon is portrayed by Stephen Dillane, who is terrific in the role. Stephen Marcus plays Ted Ray, he's another top performer as is Josh Flitter (Eddie) - the latter brings some amusing humour to events.

The film's star, however, is Shia LaBeouf. He does a grand job as Ouimet, he produces the goods in all of his scenes. I'm already a fan of LaBeouf's, so I'm glad I can add another one of his characters to my memory.

This did not feel like a 120 minute production. Great pacing, great film. Highly recommended!"

59.0,A History of Violence,An average family is thrust into the spotlight after the father commits a seemingly self-defense murder at his diner.,Tom Stall had the perfect life...until he became a hero.,"Drama, Thriller, Crime",96.0,2005-09-23,en,7.165,3430.0,3.3873,"Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, William Hurt, Ashton Holmes",David Cronenberg,"small town, hero, robbery, indiana, usa, distrust, philadelphia, pennsylvania, dual identity, double life, fight, identity, self-defense, marriage, diner, mistaken identity, family relationships, irish mob, revenge, mobster, lawyer, attempted robbery, based on graphic novel","Probably Cronenberg's most mundane work, but that's not even remotely a knock against _A History of Violence_. I hear tell that fans of the comic don't much like this big screen re-telling, but I've never read it, so I'm gonna go ahead and really enjoy it anyway.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || We start with images of two rather brutal hoodlums who have robbed and massacred the staff at a roadside motel and then sort of follow them into a town where ""Tom"" (Viggo Mortensen) runs the diner. They stop by one afternoon, intent on causing a bit of mayhem, only to discover that their host is a bit more capable of defending himself than they'd anticipated. Quickly ""Tom"" is lauded as an hero, and wife ""Edie"" (Maria Bello) and kids ""Jack"" (Ashton Holmes) and ""Sarah"" (Heidi Hayes) are proud to have their dad at home. What he hadn't anticipated, though, is that the publicity would attract the attention of one-eyed gangster ""Fogarty"" (Ed Harris) who arrives and starts calling him ""Joey"". Who's ""Joey""? Well we quickly find out that nothing is as it seems and we gradually begin to realise that the past always has an habit of catching up with you. This is a violent film, but oddly enough I felt it rather visually tame as the pieces start to fall into place and the arrival of William Hurt signals an escalation that cleverly marries the comically menacing with the somewhat predictable conclusion. There's not a great deal of dialogue here, though not quite on the Clint Eastwood scale, and Mortensen holds it together increasingly well as we move along. It's one of the few films that I feel could have added half an hour or so, just so we get to grips a bit better with the characterisations and concomitant baggage, but as it is - it's well worth a look."
398.0,Capote,"A biopic of writer Truman Capote and his assignment for The New Yorker to write the non-fiction book ""In Cold Blood"".","In New York City, he was the ultimate insider.

Philip Seymour Hoffman certainly delivers a plausible and captivating portrayal of the eponymous acclaimed novelist in the late 1950s. He is researching his latest novel when he alights on news of the brutal murder of a Kansas family. Pretty unscrupulously, this rather unfulfilled writer decides this is a rich vein for him to exploit, and so using just about every (legal) means at his disposal manages to ingratiate himself with friends of the victims and then once the police apprehend two suspects, he does the same with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jnr.). He intends to use the template of this case and the true nature of the personalities to construct a novel - but one based in fact not fiction. What ensues here is quite a cleverly crafted look at just how the shrewd and intelligent man uses his intellect to manipulate the scenario so as to provide him what what he wants, when he wants it - but it also exposes his slightly controlling character to some fault lines. He begins to form a relationship, of sorts, with his quarry - he has a fondness that compromises his objectivity to his story; the accused serves to begin to humanise this rather aloof and frankly quite arrogant figure. There is a distinct power shift here. It's a tightly cast effort this, with most of the emphasis on the efforts of Hoffman, a strong performance from Collins and a useful supporting contribution from Catherine Keener as the foil/conduit for much of her friend Capote's thoughts and behaviour. The style of the production, the attention to detail and the Mychael Danna score all add to the richness of this, admittedly quite speculative, drama that shines a bit of a light not just into what made this man tick, but also just what made the USA tick too."

Into the Blue is best known for capitalizing on the popularity of its attractive stars to promote this low-budget movie. Still, if you actually take the time to watch the film, you will find a solid thriller complete with treasure hunting, shark attacks, plot twists, drug lords, and more. Paul Walker and Jessica Alba excel as a young couple in love living off of small jobs in the Bahamas with dreams of running their own salvage rig one day. But their hunt for treasure intertwines with a drug runner's efforts to recover a lost shipment. The stakes keep rising higher and higher as sharks attack and trusted colleagues turn out to be not so trustworthy. Into the Blue's exciting and suspenseful treasure hunt might just be a hidden treasure of its own with the right expectations. || Well I think the poster says it all, and if it's eye candy you are looking for then for the first hour or so neither Paul Walker nor Jessica Alba are going to disappoint. That comes later when they have to put their clothes on and do some acting with this far-fetched hybrid of drug smuggling and wreck-diving. It's the latter activity that convinces these two along with ""Bryce"" (Scott Caan) and ""Amanda"" (Ashley Scott) that their fortunes could be made. Snag is, you can't just raise tons of ancient booty from the sea bed and sail into harbour with it. What's this to do with drugs? Well we know from the preamble that a plane has crashed, and that it contains a great deal of cocaine. Guess what? Yep, they find it. Initially wanting nothing to do with it, they later conclude that they ought to try and sell it - and that brings them into conflict with ""Bates"" (Josh Brolin) who wants to have his cake and eat it! As the pace quickens, there now ensues loads of action-packed shenanigans in and out of the water. It's not the worst, indeed the last twenty minutes (allowing for some fairly obvious CGI) is actually quite an exciting sequence that allows everyone to get wet and bothered - and you'd better be able to tell the difference between a Tiger shark and a tuna fish. Brolin makes for quite a decent baddy, Caan - well he probably ought to be called Caan't, and the two on the poster show us that beautiful people still have a place on the small screen."

I didn’t think there would be enough to sustain ninety minutes, but this is really quite a good fun adventure. Our intrepid inventors “Wallace” and “Gromit” have a successful business protecting people’s crops from pesky rabbits. When they are summoned by “Lady Tottingham” to deal with these rodents wrecking her pristine lawn, “Wallace” is delighted. Not only have they gone up on the world, but he also gets to try out his new suction machine that soon eradicates her problem. Their problem? Well what do they do with all these left-over bunnies? He decides to try his new mind-altering gadget on them to brainwash them into never touching garden vegetables again. Of course that was never going to go to plan, and before they know it their community is being terrorised. None of their state-of-the-art security measures, nor, windows or walls can keep out this new menace - and they are getting the blame. With the pompous adventurer and would-be suitor “Quartermaine” pointing his shotgun at just about everything, our inventive duo are going to have track down this monstrous critter before it eats everyone out of house an home. It’s an homage to all things Hammer, with a little bit of “King Kong” in their too and the attention to detail is really entertaining - not just with the characterisations and expressive faces, but with the more incidental signposts, the shop names, the newspaper headlines: they are a turnip for the books with puns and double-entendres galore peppered throughout this humorous script. It’s got gizmos that would make “007” jealous and the comedy action hits the ground running and rarely stops for breath. Aardman at their best, this, and well worth a watch on a big screen where the creatively crafted stop-motion and Julian Nott’s whimsical score all make for an enjoyable watch."

Plus it was a trip down memory lane from 35 years ago.

Charlie Sheen was 21, but looked a lot younger!!

For the time, the movie had a good look and feel to it.
And the Wraith car stands the test of time really well. || **_Hammy 80’s motorhead thriller with Charlie Sheen and Sherilyn Fenn_**

A ruthless (but comical) gang terrorizes a town in southern Arizona, forcing guys to drag race in order to ‘win’ their vehicles; that is, until a young man comes to town (Sheen), along with a mysterious black sportscar and driver. Randy Quaid is on hand as the Sheriff.

""The Wraith"" (1986) is like a meshing of the contemporaneous “Top Gun” with the campiness of “Lost Boys” (which came out the next year), just trade the pilot ace flying with drag racing and the vampires with a thug gang. The hammy approach mainly applies to Skank (David Sherrill), Gutterboy (Jamie Bozian) and tech-geek Rughead (Clint Howard) whereas Nick Cassavetes is more subdued about it as the lead bully, but still cartoonishly exaggerated. Nick, by the way, is the son of John Cassavetes & Gina Rowlands, which is odd since John was only 5’7” while Nick is 6’6”, but I guess it happens.

I’m not a fan of the hammy tone and think it would’ve worked better if done more seriously, like “Top Gun.” However, if you can roll with the goofiness, it’s entertaining on several fronts. For instance, the Arizona locations are spectacular, Sherilyn Fenn’s beauty is well captured and there’s a lot of thrilling vehicle mayhem.

It runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in the Greater Tucson area, including the Sonoran Desert National Monument in Gila Bend, which is 92 miles northwest of Tucson (and just southwest of Phoenix).

“The Squid and the Whale” (2005) is a frank, quirky and amusing drama about a family from Brooklyn in 1986 that encounters divorce and the ramifications thereof. The father (Jeff Daniels) is a literary professor and fading author while the wife (Laura Linney) is an emerging writer, a sweet liberal who for some reason can’t stop having affairs. The two boys are played by Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline. William Baldwin is on hand as a tennis instructor while Anna Paquin plays a college student.   

The story is unsurprisingly based on director/writer Noah Baumbach’s own family’s experience. I say “unsurprisingly” because the movie smacks of real life with its candid and sometimes comical approach.

A few viewers didn’t ‘get’ the father, Bernard Berkman (Daniels), and have interpreted him in an uber-negative way. Yes, he’s a grotesquely competitive, pompous cheapskate, but his comical flaws are rounded out by an inherent decency. He’s clearly not the unfaithful partner and wants to keep the family together. He takes the time to spend quality time with his boys and mentor them, especially Walt (Eisenberg), who idolizes him.  

Speaking of the father and Walt, Eisenberg and Daniel’s characters and their performances are the highlight of this picture. Both characters are fascinating psychological studies. Eisenberg possesses the intense, intelligent charisma of James McAvoy and Brando. Is it any wonder that he went on to play The Joker in the DCEU? Winsome Halley Feiffer is on hand as his girlfriend.

Speaking of females, Anna Paquin is another highlight even while her lack of modesty isn’t very becoming. Nevertheless she looks great in jeans.   

The movie runs 1 hour, 21 minutes and was shot in Brooklyn, New York.

My biggest Takeaway from this movie is, the acting was crap. I could go on for days about how everyone mailed in this role, the performances were flat and full of bluster, but I only have so many characters in this review.

 The very beginning of this film, the intro, was just hot garbage that had no business being in it. Both a young Brendan Lang and the college football version. We’re just hilarious and not needed. The best part was the early stages when he hooks up with Pacino’s character to get their little business going.

Halfway through the movie become almost unwatchable.  A combination of bad story, bad acting, they had poor decisions at every part of the filmmaking process.

There’s unresolved storylines, storylines that don’t make sense, and just a general disregard for flow, performance, and the audience

David Strathairn delivers one of his best performances here as the man whose stance earns him plaudits from some quarters, but enmity from others who accuse him of being an appeaser - or worse. Determined, he nevertheless becomes dependant on the good will of his network chief executive (Frank Langella) and stalwart producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) as he issues a challenge to the politician and risks his career. In many ways these men had similarities of character. The use of archive footage of McCarthy and the pieces-to-camera from Strathairn offers us two contrasting styles, attitudes and sets of beliefs and though clearly the editorial is pro-Murrow, it still allows us to experience and evaluate some of the frenzy that prevailed at the time when the cold war was very much at it's height. Director Clooney uses a documentary style of intense monochrome photography to quite chillingly expose us to the perils of free reporting at a time when swimming agains a tide that would stop at nothing to rubbish it's opponents was no small gamble. It packs lots to think about into ninety minutes and emphasises the still quite dangerous scenarios that dogma coupled with a strong cult of personality can deliver to an unwitting population."

That is something that you probably can say about any rating for any movie. I feel it is especially true as far as this movie goes though. As you can see from my rating I was not exactly thrilled by the movie. That does not mean that it is a bad movie. Again, this you can say about a lot of ratings, especially my ratings.

Okay, I guess I have confused everyone enough now so let me try to explain. As a piece of cinematic art this movie is excellent. The acting is quite good. I especially liked John Hurt as the literate bounty hunter but most of the main characters where performing admirably. The scenery is wonderful. The Australian outback makes for a excellent backdrop and it is indeed a nice change from the classical North American western sceneries.

As a movie it falls flat though. In my opinion a movie should at least try to tell a story. Even if it aspires to be a piece of art it should try and tell a story that the audience can, in one way or another, follow. This movie have a basic idea of a story but it does not really tell a story. We never get to know who the bad guys really are, what they really did, except for a bunch of hints about killing and rape, or why. Heck, we never actually get to know of the guy the flogged to death where really taking part in the deed or not.

Throughout the movie the bad guys are supposedly hiding in some place where it is impossible to get them so the main character tries to get the bad guys brother to kill him. Not very plausible at all. The governor, Eden Fletcher played by David Wenham, or whatever he as supposed to be was pretty much an asshole. Okay every movie has to have one but his role was never really developed. Once he managed to get the young kid, innocent or not, flogged we really do not see much of him for the rest of the movie.

The end of the movie is much the same as the rest of the movie. Cinematically excellent but not much of a story. There is no real conclusion. It just ends in a sequence of well done scenes but without any real story behind it.

Maybe I’m a too simple mind when it comes to these kind of movies but I, even though I appreciated the graphics that was shown on my TV-screen, I did not really enjoy it as a movie. || Australia. A man looking to catch a criminal by the name of Arthur Burns (the head of the Burns Gang). He catches his brothers instead, and offers the elder brother (Guy Pearce) a deal. A proposition. Bring him Arthur Burns, the man who raped and killed Eliza Hopkins. And to make sure that Charlie will honor the deal, he keeps the youngest brother, Mikey.

The stage is set early on in the movie, and yet, this is more than just a simple story about a gang of criminals and the law enforcers who are chasing them down, this is a story about a country being created, about the fight for survival in a strange land. About justice and peace of mind.

Nick Cave wrote the screenplay, and also most of the music. This gives us a hint that it is not going to be your average movie, but something... more, something different. We can also expect the sound to be spectacular and forceful, and indeed, it is. The music here very much reminded me of the music in There Will Be Blood by Paul Thomas Anderson, extraordinary and... haunting really. But it doesn't stop at the music, the visual side of the movie is rather stunning in a haunting way as well, dirty and dusty all the way through. I love when a movie has a distinct visual style and rhythm, and this one does.

The movie starts out with a bang, as the law enforcers hunt down the two younger brothers, Charlie and Mikey, but as soon as Charlie is given the proposition, it slows down considerably and branches out to tell two stories, that of Charlie hunting down his brother, but also that of Captain Stanley and his wife, two opposing forces. This guy clearly has demons of his own, and is looking for justice to be served. I love the pace in this movie, it wants to tell its story just right.

The cast is a great one, as mentioned Guy Pearce plays one of the Burns brothers, together with Danny Huston. These guys are dirty and bend on doing whatever it takes to survive. Captain Stanley is played by the amazing Ray Winstone. He plays the role with a quietness and a subtlety that surprised me. He is the hero of the story, at least for me, and wants only justice to be served. In other parts we see David Wenham and John Hurt, both delivering quirky and interesting characters. A great movie needs a great cast, and this one most certainly have that.

_Last words... this movie does not compromise. It is honest, it is dark and it forces you to think about right and wrong. How does one identify a criminal and what forces people to do evil deeds? Nothing is simple really, and it shouldn't be. Most people have both light and darkness within them, and that is the case in this movie._ || **_Heart of Darkness in Australia_**

Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) is the new lawman of the territory and he's determined to civilize the brutal wasteland. A band of outlaws comprised of three brothers and a few others stand in his way. Yet two of the brothers want out after their sibling leader commits a crime in one of his raids. The two are apprehended by Capt. Stanley, who offers a proposition to the older of the two (Guy Pearce): Find and assassinate the leader and both will go free.

""The Proposition"" (2005) is a Western that takes place in Australia, yet it's far from a typical Western. The filmmaking, cinematography, actors, locations, soundtrack and editing are top-of-the-line with a surreal, haunting edge. As my title blurb suggests, there are similarities to ""Heart of Darkness"" and the original ""Apocalypse Now,"" although it fails to achieve the greatness of the latter.

The story plays out in a realistic manner with long stretches of drama and bleak landscapes interspersed with flashes of extreme violence. Ray Winstone and Guy Pearce are great as the two main protagonists. Capt. Stanley understandably wants to rid the land of the brute outlaws, whereas Charlie seeks redemption for himself and his little brother.

Danny Huston is captivating as the focal point and villain, Arthur Burns. Yet he's not a villain in the cliched sense and he's not one-dimensional. He loves the beauty of God's creation, he loves the art of language and he's a mystic of sorts, but he clearly crossed the line at some point in his outlaw endeavors and now must be wiped off the face of the planet. Will Charlie do it?

My only criticism is that the film seems too short at 1 hour, 44 minutes. It needed more time for details and character development. As it is, we sort of have to guess the details, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just wish the film would have gone the route of ""Apocalypse Now"" and given us more definition and development.

At the end of the day, this is one of those films that gets better with repeat viewings, as long as you like the approach of films like ""Apocalypse Now,"" just way shorter (too short). I would love to see a Director's Cut that adds about 20-45 minutes.

It was shot in Winton, Queensland, which is in the northeast Outback of Australia.

Is it possible for fans of the John Carpenter original to be objective with this remake? Is it possible for a modern audience fed on Gorno and Slice Dice horror genres to be objective also?

Well I like to think that as a man in middle age I can be very objective and rate the film accordingly, so with that in mind I happily admit to being a member of both the above groups I have mentioned. This smacked of a bad idea when it was first mooted but it came as no surprise to anyone who can see that mainstream cinema had at this time in film history simply run out of great ideas for movies. This is real bad and I avoided it for so long, but the fact that his royal highness John Carpenter was lending his name to the project always kept me interested, it was the itch I was destined to scratch at some point.

It's poorly directed, badly acted, in fact there is a scene with four people on a boat (two of each sex) that is so badly acted you would be surprised if these actors ever work again! The pic is devoid of suspense, jump shocks and worst of all, an ending that is as dreary as it is insulting. I give it 2/10 for the sound mix only. An awful abomination. || Oh man this was so bad. Like this was **so** bad. Part of me is afraid to go back and check out the original now, but the rest of me feels safe in the knowledge that it couldn't possibly be worse... I mean it couldn't, right? ...Right?

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._ || Poor overall, I do like the idea though.

<em>'The Fog'</em> has been absolutely obliterated on Letterboxd, 1.6 average rating is major yikes. I, honestly, don't think it's quite that awful but I fully understand the dislike this has. For me, it wastes a good concept.

I actually don't mind the special effects, sure they aren't anything amazing but I never really felt let down by them; the only times it bothered me, in truth, was when there's a huge bundle of fog. For the ""natives"", though, I thought they looked fairly neat.

The film definitely goes on for too long, while the ending is terrible. Acting wise I think it's OK. Tom Welling (Nick) and Maggie Grace (Elizabeth) are passable, the rest of the cast give pretty lame performances granted.

Bad, but not *that* bad in my opinion. Remakes always tend to make people more annoyed, especially when they've seen the original. I haven't, so I guess that plays a part."

I'm sorry to say that this movie is a laughable sequel to the first one also starring Bandaras and Jones. It would be hard to convince me that the same director was involved with both projects if I hadn't read it in the credits for myself. 

Zorro 'never kills anyone' with his sword. He smacks them on the backside, slaps them on the face, or flips them on their butts. This doesn't stop the villains from killing folks; they have a field day while Bandaras is more concerned about waving to the cheering crowds than saving his friends.

The hired henchman is within Zorro's killing field from the very first scenes right through the movie. However, for some mystical reason not (revealed by the film makers), Zorro lets him and his friends escape each time, until Jones finally puts him down near the end.

Constant bickering between Bandaras and Jones throughout the flick, and Zorro's playful heroic non lethal fighting style, ruin this potentially good film. 

1&1/2 stars out of 4, for the great performance by 'Tornado' (the horse), or it would be a complete flop. || **A clever and dextrous sequel, and a good adventure movie to spend some family time.**

I really liked the first film, one of the best modern swashbuckling films, and I didn't expect anything too inferior from this one, which has the ability to create a good continuity with its predecessor. The action takes place a few years later, during the ephemeral Republic of California, which had achieved independence to join the USA. In the film, Diego and Elena's marriage is falling apart, and they end up separated. She is then coerced into working for the Pinkerton's, who seek to keep tabs on a European aristocrat who has just moved to the region, and whom Elena already knew from her youth. Meanwhile, Diego tries to stay active as Zorro and reconcile that with his obligations as the father of the young and willful Joaquin, a deep admirer of the masked hero who is not yet aware of his father's double life.

Despite being undoubtedly a good film, it is slightly weaker than its predecessor because it has a more complicated script and tries to do more things at the same time. Diego, Elena and Joaquin act by themselves against different opponents. That's not a bad thing, just different: the film is full of action and adventure, it's aesthetically beautiful and fun. What I really didn't like is the predictability of the story, roughly from the middle onwards, and that story of the Knights of Aragon which, besides being a very stupid cliché, is something absolutely far-fetched.

António Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones return to their characters, and they are very good at bringing them to life, which is an excellent point in favor of the whole film. The best scenes here, in addition to the fights and action, are the various scenes where both act together, with excellent chemistry and wonderfully developed joint work. The young actor who gave life to the son of both characters, Adrian Alonso, is not particularly brilliant, but he does what he needs to and is effective. Rufus Sewell is not unpleasant, he exudes an almost aristocratic presence, and that made his character more believable, but it doesn't make him a really fearsome villain.

Technically, it's a pretty standard film with nothing special, and the most common ingredients of Hollywood adventure blockbusters: extremely choreographed fights with no chance of happening in a real situation, but cinematic and fun, a light, polite style, a lot of political correctness very common in family films, absence of dead moments thanks to an edition that gave rhythm and some velocity to the story, good sets and costumes that look beautiful, even if they are not exactly rigorous from the historical point of view, and a lively soundtrack, which pulls the atmosphere up and makes the film livelier and more dynamic, harmoniously blending with the cinematography, where warm colors dominate the look."

There's also a decent enough - if maybe a little too sincere - rapport between Thurman and her eye candy and it does occasionally make you wonder what age (or religion) ought to have to do with people falling in love (or even lust for that matter). The conclusion is pretty weak, I thought, and sort of falls between two stools despite the best efforts of the concierge ""Damien"" (Ato Essandoh).

Starring Paddy Considine, it tells the story of an ex-soldier who returns home to a small town in the Midlands seeking revenge on a group of thugs who have terrorised his younger brother. The film, at first, embraces the ultimate act of revenge with dark humour and disturbing violence, but soon turns out to criticise what effect vengeance has on the protagonist.

The film questions the role of masculinity in British working-class society by having very different male stereotypes thrown together in a very isolated environment. Not only does the film make a statement about gender roles, but more importantly, it tackles the issue of honour and justice. The audience’s allegiances sway dramatically throughout the film as Richard (Considine) becomes more brutal in his execution styles. A similar British film that challenges the audience’s perception of who is right is Stanley Kubrick’s ‘A Clockwork Orange’.

On simple viewing of this film, you could say that it is a revenge slasher-flick with plenty of gore; however, I feel that this film is a powerful piece of cinema that is a statement for the immorality of British society and the ideologies it imposes but it also uses Uttoxeter to show the corruption of human nature.

★★★★★ || When a former British Paratroop Regiment soldier (Paddy Considine) returns to his home town in rural Derbyshire after his tour of duty, he is determined to avenge his young brother (Toby Kebbell) whose learning difficulties made him the frequent butt of the bullying from local hoodlum “Sonny” (Gary Stretch) and his pals. It was one afternoon when things got completely out of hand that has fuelled this quest for revenge, and so “Richard” sets about meticulously planning to use their own tools to bring about their downfall. What ensues is effectively devoid of dialogue, it really just focuses on this man’s psychological warfare with his quarry. It’s a game of cat and mouse with him in plain sight - they know he is there, they know what he wants and as his plans start to take effect their terror and panic becomes more manifest and desperate. What’s a bit different about this thriller is the palpable sense of guilt “Richard” displays towards his brother whom we know was wholly dependent on him from their childhood - things we learn from flashbacks. It’s brutal and violent, but it’s also clever and menacingly calculating, too, as it challenges some established perceptions of masculinity and at times the photography puts us unnervingly close to the unfolding scenario - a scenario that doesn’t quite run as you might have expected and that showcases just how bullies work and at how their sheer force of personality can lead others to just go with the flow, regardless of their own reservations. It’s not an easy watch, but Considine brings a considerable screen presence here and it’s a fairly savage indictment of how cruel people can be."

I'm reviewing a decade old film. This kind of themes is very much done for the current era, particularly in Hollywood. You can't believe this guy did a film like this back then. I'm obviously talking about Ryan Reynolds. It was just for fun, other than that there's nothing to expect from it. Clearly we know how the story begins and ends, but we're only going to see the middle parts, how they developed it, especially the comedies.

All the actors were decent, particularly Amy Smart was much preferred actress than what she's now. Ryan Reynolds with those dual getups was not bad either and Anna Faris was excellent in the comedy parts. Maybe it is a chick film, or close to that category, but the perspective of the story was from a man.

Being a geek in the high school, how he transformed into a handsome man is the film. When he visits his hometown, all the old memories comes back to the life, particularly after seeing his old close friend who he had a crush on her, but never revealed it. So it is like his second and probably final chance to express his feeling. How it all develops and ends was the remaining story.

Being a comedy, it has not delivered anything big. It might have effected good way, if I had watched when it came out. So not everyone who watches it would end up happily. It is not easy to suggest this film for everybody, but if you're looking for a comedy, some comedy, it will work okay. And again, don't take it seriously, even some of the jokes are too ordinary, but tried its best. An average comedy, but a good time pass film.

_5/10_ || Just came across this one (2023] and although I am a big fan of the lead actors, I consider this movie to be as cheesy as they come. I didn't see it in the theater, but at this point, I didn't miss anything. Wasted time on this, needless to say, it was disappointing. 3/10"

The trouble begins when they get back only to find that their car won't start. The trio think they have a way out when they run into a local bushman named Mick Taylor. Wait until you get a load of what Mick has in store for them. Their troubles have just begun. || I could tell you - but then I'd have to kill you!

Three young travellers are making their way across the Australian outback in search of Wolf Creek, a mystical site where a meteorite struck and created a crater. After achieving their mission they endure car trouble and fearing that they are stuck in the middle of nowhere, they are relieved when help comes in the form of big Mick. At first he's a likable sort of man, but then Mick starts to show signs of strangeness as the evening progresses, and then the travellers fall asleep...

Directed and written by Greg McLean, this Australian film opens with the ominous warning that it is based on real events. Clearly intent on grabbing the viewer by the throat with its raw and real feel, it should be noted however that the film is actually an amalgamation of ideas drawn from real Oz killers like ""Bradley John Murdoch"" and ""John Bunting"". Casting aside the film's boast of real life credentials, the question hangs on if it's actually any good?. 

McLean has crafted a genuinely unsettling picture, one that upon theatrical release didn't in truth live up to the hyperbole that was so boisterously marketed back in 2005. Now that the furore has long since passed and the tag-lines running about ""A new dawn in terror"" and that the ""Reality is here"" have since faded away from memory, what is actually left to sample?.

McLean's film builds up nicely by letting us get to know our three soon to be troubled protagonists. Then it's enter Mick Taylor from outback stage right, and here is a larger than life bogeyman and one of the modern eras better, and yes, scarier creations. Taylor, excellently portrayed by John Jarratt, debunks the myth of the chirpy Aussie bushman, becoming the polar opposite to ""Crocodile Dundee"" (given a mention in one particular uneasy exchange). Then the terror starts, grim violence and unnerving dialogue seamlessly blends together, all shot in a docu-style on Hi-Def DV. 

However, with this narrative trajectory, where the usual formula escape attempts begin to arise, comes the exasperation that so often blights the horror genre. One particular opportunity that lands at Liz Hunter's feet, an opportunity that any sane person in the world would have taken, beggars belief, but then I guess if common sense ruled there would be no post script at the end - which is a post script that blatantly wants us to believe that what we have just watched really happened...

The last quarter is a touch rushed, and that's a shame since we have spent so much time in the company of the three actually likable and believable youths. It rather feels like a quick horror fix than the intended protracted line in terror that Mclean and co were going for. Nevertheless, it does actually work, and crucially it does frighten and hold the utmost attention. 

The performances are strong, dodgy British accents aside, with the girls (Cassandra Magrath & Kestie Morassi) in particular convincing as being truly terrified. While the piece is, surprisingly in context of the material, beautiful at times. Red sunsets and the crisp dusky desert come vividly out the screen thanks to Will Gibson's excellent photography. Wolf Creek will not and can't hold up on repeat viewings, but it is still an effective entry in the horror genre, and with Jarratt's Mick Taylor there is a character that's unlikely to be forgotten in a hurry. 7/10"

This is a great survival horror story that really rachets up the tension as the situation progresses.

The idea of being hunted in the subway with homeless and rats around is very intriguing for me.  Sadly, like most good horror movies, I can't talk about most of it without spoilers.

I will say this has some great concepts in it and the over all story structure is very well done with some good twists / surprises in it.

It may not be a feel-good love story, but it would be a pretty bad survival horror story if it was. || Ok, I confess that the background story and the movie cover attracted my attention. And when I saw Christopher Smith name here I expected something (Severance, Triangle, I thought I had something good to expect)

 I will be brief and make a full spoiler here: the premise is good, the execution not so much.

It is very inconsistent, like a person will be ""forgotten"" in a subway station? People don't clean the trains into the night hours? A psycho child from the anti-Blitz tunnels of WWII? No one misses the presence of people (especially workers) in the subway?

Come on, that's too much.

Plus Franka Potente (Run Lola, Run) is really bad here. At least the dog is ok. :)

Now, however, pending my watching the other version again, this might indeed be my new favorite. Not due to any major differences in acting ability or in the writing, but rather for the way it nails down the little things, the stuff I may not have noticed the first time or two I watched it.

One simple example is of the portrayal of Mary, one of the servants in the Bennet household. She says hardly anything during the course of the movie, but a couple of times we follow her while she is singing as she works, and I found it utterly charming. And I think it illustrates, whether or not it was intended, that this is a pleasant house that servants did not dread to start their work days in. 

There is also at one of the balls a long scene of dancing that shows several of the characters who are involved in subplots going on, all within this continuous shot. It is clever, and on one website it is said the camera was left running by accident; a happy accident if you ask me. Also, a few of the scenic moments, such as one time when Elizabeth merely stares lost in thought in the middle of great beauty, are amiable natural breaks in the action.

The acting is very good, of course, with this cast, but also their attitude is perfect. Brenda Blethyn excels in the thankless role of the silly mother, managing not to cross the line into looking outright ridiculous. Sutherland is — well, I will give any movie a try with him in it. Keira Knightly is, for me, astonishingly good. If you had described to me before I watched it the way, when she or her family is insulted, she looks jolted for a moment, but then with a short laugh or smile shakes it off, I would have said “Nope, that won’t work.” But it works. Her wit is sensational. I write fiction myself and always try to to feature witty female characters, and Elizabeth would fit right into my modern novels.

Dame Penelope Wilton is excellent as always, and Claudia Blakey shone as Charlotte. If pressed to find at least one small fault, I could only say that I think the writers and director (and possibly Jane Austen herself) may have underestimated Mary Bennet as a character. I have always thought that more could be done with her, in every version.

I am only sorry now I have to pack the DVD away for the movie, even if only for a few weeks. || **Overall, it's a good adaptation, even if it's not free of mistakes and problems.**

I believe that “Pride and Prejudice” is one of the most transported English novels to film and television. I've seen more than one adaptation, and each one has its merits and problems (however, it's generally agreed that the 1995 miniseries is the most perfect and canonical). This film is not as good as I would like it to be, it has several problems, but it is quite acceptable and also has positive notes to retain.

Here, the story we already know so well takes place in the final years of the 18th century. From what I saw, the director wanted to do this to avoid the fashion of the Regency period, which he doesn't like, and taking advantage of the fact that Austen wrote the early version of the book around this time. Well, I can say that I share the thoughts of the director, Joe Wright, when it comes to dresses from the Regency/First French Empire period. Aesthetically, they are much less interesting than the “bridal cakes” of the pre-French Revolution period, or the wide dresses that began to be worn in the Romantic period. The idea of these dresses, which greatly emphasize the woman's chest and then fall straight down like a nightgown, is in a way imitating what the Romans and Greeks were thought to wear. Even so, there are several errors in the way the characters were dressed, arranged, combed and characterized: basically, the director ignored everything that didn't suit him. That was a mistake.

The film is reasonably short for the literary work it brings, but I think it couldn't be otherwise. For the rest, the narrative is decently done, and the adaptation made to the source material is quite conscientious and tries not to cut important things. What I didn't like was the way certain characters were developed: Elizabeth became a wild girl and much less contained than would be supposed in the novel, for example. The rest, however, is quite satisfactory.

The film is full of great British actors: in addition to Keira Knightley, who manages well in the role of protagonist, we also have Rosamund Pike, Brenda Blethyn, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone and Judy Dench. Each did a fairly good job in the role assigned to them. We should also appreciate the work of Matthew MacFadyen, Donald Sutherland, Simon Woods and Tom Hollander. On a technical level, the film invests a lot in good sets, convincing and well-selected shooting locations and good props. The cinematography is also good and does an excellent job throughout the film, with enviable camera work and good colors and lighting. The film also has a good soundtrack."

If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!

Year four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! 

The Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. 

As is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.

A film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10 || _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ is an absolute spectacle. I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.

Our main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.

There is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.

But the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.

While the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.

**Score:** _89%_ | 
**Verdict:** _Excellent_ || Possibly the weakest of the series, this one, for me. Our trio start by visiting the Quidditch World Cup which is invaded by the evil ""Death Eaters"" who reduce everything to ashes in their search for ""Harry"". Shortly afterwards, the ""Tri-Wizard Cup"" comes to Hogwarts - a good excuse to introduce some new characters amongst them Frances de la Tour as the enormous ""Madame Maxime"" and Roger Lloyd-Pack as ""Barty Crouch"" as each school chooses their champion to take part in the potentially lethal games. ""Hogwarts"" chooses ""Cedric Diggory"" (Robert Pattinson) but the goblet also chooses our ""Harry"" and so four go into the competition. As this description, so far, probably indicates - there is an hell of a lot going on here and not surprisingly the adaptation to the screenplay starts to leave out detail and characterisation. To do the story justice, it ought to have been two films - we spend way too long establishing and when we get to the climax, it all seems a bit too rushed. Mike Newell simply has to squeeze too many, important, interweaving themes into 2½ hours and it doesn't quite work. It is still a great fantasy adventure building well on the now well-established characters and putting more meat on the bones of the ""Harry Potter"" character."

Walk the Line chronicles the story of Johnny Cash’s rise to fame and romance with June Carter. James Mangold is one of my favorite directors and tells this story powerfully through the Oscar-worthy performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. The acting, music, and directing are all phenomenal. Still, the story is so sad, and its conclusion, while happy, happens so abruptly that it doesn’t feel resolved or satisfied after 2+ hours of drug addiction and hurting loved ones. Cash’s faith and love for his family, which are well known, aren’t represented in the movie and could have provided hope in this dark tale. I understand why this movie was such a huge award winner, but my escapist nature struggled to enjoy such a sad story. || Joaquin Phoenix might take top billing as the legendary American musician Johnny Cash, but it's got to be Reece Witherspoon who steals the plaudits as June Carter. She demonstrates all the feistiness and determination of a woman, in a man's world, quite prepared to do her own thing. Assisted by a fair degree of charisma and musical talent, she can play a stage with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis and Carl Perkins with confidence. The film starts at the now famous Folsom Prison just before he takes the stage and by way of a continuing retrospective, we learn of his childhood - one touched by tragedy very early on, of his strained relationship with his father (Robert Patrick) then his service in the US Air Force before, gradually, his stage career and burgeoning romance with his co-star. He is married to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and they have children, but that doesn't really curtail his passion for Carter and we see that relationship evolve in parallel with his affection for just about anything that comes from a bottle. The life of this man has been pretty publicly documented so there's little room for James Mangold to manoeuvre with the facts here. Instead, we are offered a plausible speculation on just how this couple made it through. I found Phoenix's performance just a little too close to mimicry at times, but there's a solid chemistry between him and Witherspoon throughout with the depiction of his descent into chemically indeed oblivion quite sad to watch.

Luckily, that's more than compensated for by strong efforts from Johansson and from Mortimer who both manage their roles with considerably greater aplomb. The former illustrates her journey from independently minded woman to a frenetically preoccupied one quite convincingly as the story develops, and Mortimer likewise conveys something of the visceral and turbulent nature of aspiring motherhood. It takes a look at the lives of the offspring of the wealthy in a slightly less procedural fashion, too. The benign parents - Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton - are not your stereotypically doting parents, they expect him to work for his new found riches and she, especially, tends to speak as she finds. The denouement is my kind of conclusion, even if it is a little on the far-fetched side, and there's a degree of concluding satisfaction to be had here that I quite enjoyed. I'm still not sure why she didn't marry ""Tom"" though!"

I had seen <em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'</em> before but hadn't watched it for years and years, I remembered the vast majority though - it's a memorable film after all. There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much.

It has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.

Elsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.

I've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me. They'll do well to match this first film, that's for sure. || In my last review (which you can find on my Letterboxd), I said _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ was a ""nearly perfect film."" Well, I am here to say that with this viewing, to me, it is a perfect film. 

I used to always think this film was a sort of step below LOTR, and, while LOTR is indeed a masterpiece of cinema, I don't regard this film as lesser.

The movie is just pure magic! Every aspect of the movie (minus the CGI – which doesn't really hold up [except for Aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! And I find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than I ever have watching this film.

The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is just phenomenal. Especially ""The Battle"" – that goes without saying. But this time, part of the magic and nostalgia I was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it's a song. The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it's actually about halfway into the track ""Evacuating London."") That magical song, combined with the great camera work by Donald M. McAlpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.

Also, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. When Netflix (finally) remakes the films, I don't know how they can top this opening. 
– In fact, that's another thing about this movie: There are so many things that I don't think any remake could top. Liam Neeson as Aslan, Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, and James McAvoy as Tumnus. – Oh, and, though he's not in the book, the centaur, Oreius (played by Patrick Kake), is so cool! Can't top that.

Also, the costuming is excellent – especially for the White Witch – and the gryphons are so cool! The sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).

And I can't go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.
Edmund represents us – represents me, a sinner. I who have walked in rebellion against God, and who am by nature opposed to God. And as such, I deserve the wrath of God, punishment that He would be fully just to give me. But Aslan represents Jesus Christ. Like Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund, dying the death he should have died, Jesus sacrificed Himself in our stead, taking upon Himself the wrath of God we deserved, so that “if [we] confess with [our] mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in [our] heart that God raised Him from the dead, [we] will be saved” (Romans 10:9), we “will not perish but have eternal life” (from John 3:16), and as a result of that faith, “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (from Romans 5:1).

‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:1‭-‬10‬

> “[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— [6] and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [10] For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” || CS Lewis certainly had one heck of an imagination and it is rarely better exemplified than in this lovely fantasy adventure. Four wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive ""Professor Kirke"" (Jim Broadbent) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper ""Mrs. Macready"" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. ""Lucy"" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets ""Mr. Tumnus"" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of ""Narnia"" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the ""Pevensie"" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous ""White Witch"" (Tilda Swinton). They align with ""Aslan"" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams' eerie and gentle score."
254.0,King Kong,"In 1933 New York, an overly ambitious movie producer coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to mysterious Skull Island, where they encounter Kong, a giant ape who is immediately smitten with the leading lady.",The eighth wonder of the world.,"Adventure, Drama, Action",187.0,2005-12-12,en,6.887,8095.0,10.7807,"Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, Jack Black, Andy Serkis, Colin Hanks","Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson","new york city, exotic island, movie business, show business, human animal relationship, great depression, giant insect, remake, prehistoric creature, dinosaur, creature, kaiju, empire state building, giant ape, woman in peril, 1930s, giant gorilla, grand, king kong","They just couldn't leave him on his island could they...

King Kong is directed by Peter Jackson and Jackson co-writes the screenplay with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. It's based on a story by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace. It stars Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrien Brody, Thomas Kretschmann, Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Evan Parke, Jamie Bell and Kyle Chandler. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Andrew Lesnie.

After completing the hugely successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson turned his attentions to a reimaging of that daddy of classic creature features, King Kong. With all the new tools of the trade to hand, Jackson set about making a Kong film full of love and respect the original from 1933, whilst obviously making his own beast as it were. Story remains the same, mankind sets off to a fabled place known as Skull Island, there they find beasties not of this world, not least a gigantic mountain of a gorilla. They stupidly bring him back to America for money making exercises and things go really bad. The End.

I have personally found it most interesting re-watching the film nearly 15 years since its release, especially given we have not long had a different Kong reboot with ""Kong: Skull Island"" in 2017. For the differences, for better or worse depending on your proclivities in Kongdom, are enormous. Kong: Skull Island is a no brain adventure yarn, high on action but low on intelligence, but it does know it. Jackson's Kong aspired to be much more cerebral, and for the most part it achieves it. Sadly it takes a whopping 3 hours to reveal its intentions, which was a problem to many back in 2005, and is still a hindrance sitting down to watch it these days - this even knowing and preparing once again for how long it is. Frustratingly there's a great film in the mix just crying out for an hour of extraneous filler and clunky dialogue to be jettisoned. 

Once set up has been achieved in the first hour, we finally get to Skull Island and it's an absolute technical treat. The look is fantastic, the turn of events as Kong and his acolytes have been introduced is terrific. From here it's creature feature mayhem, the beauty and the beast aspect kicks into gear, and it's all very comforting, thrilling even - with one exception. A dinosaur stampede looks ridiculous, the blend of human actors and CGI is so poor it belies the money spent on the effects for this production. That aside, though, the action sequences are electric, particularly the monster mash ups. Yet the quite reflective periods on Skull Island really strike a chord as well, just sections where Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) are chilling out together, taking in the landscape that money mad men want to take Kong away from...

Then it's back to The States and carnage ensues, culminating in a brilliantly staged last quarter of film, where all that superb period detail gets obliterated during the battle between man and beast, and where even now I'm rooting for Kong to win! As the tenderness of the Beauty and the Beast arc subsides - and it is beautiful - it's then that you once again know that Jackson was too indulgent. His cast were on form, Serkis as Kong a revelation, this is a great picture at times, a real treat in High Definition, if only someone had fronted him up to not over indulge. For then we might have a 9/10 movie as opposed to a bloated 7/10 one. || 05 is the worst of the Kong movies, mainly because it tries to do way too much. It tries to be epic, and because it tries to be epic it drags. DRAGS.

Watching through it, there is about an hour and a half that I would cut, mostly because it's not necessary for a movie like this. There was character development... but too much of it. There was plot, but too much of it.

If the movie was trimmed down with an eye to making it flow, it would have been decent. But instead they let it run too long with with not enough happening in it to be an exciting monster movie.

The result was kind of a drag."

Shane Meadows is fast becoming one of the finest directors to come out of England, his films have such an earthy quality to them it's very hard to imagine that any Englishman can not find one film from his output that they can't identify with. Be it thematically or character wise. Meadows is the man from the street laying out his stories with honesty and gusto awareness. Whether Meadows will ever break out and be a hit outside of the British Isles is highly debatable, his Dead Man's Shoes from 2004 was well received away from his home shores, but you would be hard pressed to find anyone in American multiplexes (for example purposes only) who could tell you who he is, which for a director who has his finger firmly on the pulse of characterisation, that is a crying shame.

A Room For Romeo Brass is the tale of two teenage boys who during a fight with some bullies meet gangly loner Morell, as Morell starts to take an unhealthy obsession with Romeo's sister, their friendship is pulled apart, but this is merely the start of Morell's impact as he is about to explode into both of the boys already fractured families.

That's all you need to know really, for there is no more to tell, and this is one of Meadows's main strengths, there are no hidden agendas, no allegories of wars, this is just an everyday English housing estate with two families awash with everyday characters. Just how often do you see a loner in your neighbourhood? They are there, are they all like Morell? Well it may be best not to find out eh?

Paddy Considine makes his film debut here (thankfully he is now a name across the waters), and his turn as Morell is as scary as it is sad. Anyone who was impressed with his turn as the vengeful Richard in Dead Man's Shoes will be well rewarded here. A young Andrew Shim as Romeo grabs the role with sizzling vitality, a character calling for strength of nature whilst layering in a heartfelt slant that the story benefits from. I must mention big Frankie Harper (Dog in Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels), playing Romeo's estranged father, he gets it absolutely note perfect and I was delighted to see Meadows give him the film's crowning moment.

A film that opens with The Specials and closes with The Stone Roses should always appeal to an English heart, but lets get Shane Meadows' work out there to the masses, for here is a man who even gives an end credit mention for the man who turned on the generators, a man making films for the people, about the people in our midsts. 8/10"

The family themselves seem to have amassed 100 billion dollars between them, yet the employees can't afford the healthcare plan offered by the chain. A bunch of small towns are presented, showing how they've become virtual ghost towns as one business after another has folded. There are security cameras in their parking lots, but they're only used to monitor possible union activity or demonstrations. The rest of the time they're unmanned to save a wage and as a result Wal-Mart car-parks have become a haven for robberies, assaults, rapes, abductions and murders.

Sweatshop workers in China were sent to live in the same dormitory, for which rent and utility bills were deducted from their pay. They were free to move out of the dormitory, but the rent would continue to be deducted anyway.

There are examples all over the country of stores being fined for this practise. And so on, and so on.

The movie was tense and entertaining, with an ensemble cast you have to appreciate.

I have no desire to delve into the politics behind the movie or its accuracy. I am looking only at it for its entertainment value. There were a few things I really liked about it. The chemistry among the mission team, once it developed, was impressive. They are not bosom buddies at all, but they grew to appreciate what each other brought to the team. Although there is plenty of tension here, I also appreciated the angle of these men beginning to question the ethics of what they were doing. That sets this script aside from most other thrillers. And I really like Ciara Hinds. He brings a calmness to the role, a calm backed by strength. I have liked in other roles, so it is no more than I expect.

I am not a fan of thrillers, but if there were more like this one, who knows? || The start of this shows the American news reporting of the atrocity at the Munich Olympiad that resulted in the murder of eleven people at the hands of the Palestinian ""Black September"" movement. The Israeli government faces a difficult task in tracking down those responsible. Some political and diplomatic tightropes to walk, so they alight on a plan to engage five freelance individuals to do the job for them. This group is to be led by ""Avner"" (Eric Bana) and handled by ""Ephraim"" (Geoffrey Rush) on a distinctly arm's-length basis. What ensues now sees these men, with the help of ""Louis"" (Mathieu Amalric) who uses their considerable financial resources to secure information of the whereabouts of these culprits, set about their mission. This isn't a task about justice, it's straightforward revenge. No efforts are needed to capture these people alive, though they do attempt to limit the extent of collateral damage - especially as virtually none of their activities take place on Israeli soil. It's when one of their operations goes spectacularly wrong that they begin to suspect that they are also being used by other nefarious folks to do a bit of housekeeping too. The underpinning story is one of vengeance, of retribution and though initially I did have some sympathy with that cause, I found the marauding actions of these men with a self-appointed justification for their slaughtering to become a little unjustifiable. The actor Bana can't really impose himself - or his character - enough to humanise the proceedings and though Rush does impact now and again when he is on screen, the rest of the cast deliver a lacklustre contribution to what I perceived to be an increasingly unforgivable course of action that was only ever going to make matters worse and sow more seeds of counter-vengeance. To be fair to Steven Spielberg, I think he has presented this film in a fashion that invites comment and criticism. Not just of the random atrocity with which we begin, but of the futility of engaging in a dog-eat-dog cycle of self-perpetuating violence. Michael Lonsdale's outwardly rather benign ""Papa"" living a life of peace and family in rural France illustrating well that there are rarely any winners in these sorts of conflicts - and those that do rarely have any skin in the game beyond the venal. Amalric does quite well in these slightly sleazy sort of roles, but otherwise I was underwhelmed by the whole, somewhat lengthy, thing."

I thought I have seen almost all the films of Jim Carrey, but then I found that's not true, so I decided to start with this. This is a remake of the 70s film or you could say the second screen adaptation of the novel of the same name. I haven't seen the other version, but I must admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly. This is not the greatest comedy I have ever seen, but still so good with great performances, particularly Jim Carrey's.

A simple storyline, a couple loses their jobs and they find hard to get another. They begin to lose one by one, everything that belongs to them and finally the house is the last thing they want to lose. So they plan to do something very serious thing to tackle their situation and seems its working out so well, but for how long. Then comes their masterplan to the permanent solution and how they accomplish it is what leads to the conclusion.

The film was so fast, feels too short or like a TV episode. That means makes us to feel to have more, but it ends very nice way. The story might feel silly, but the comedies are so good. And if you like Jim Carrey and his trademark jokes, then you would have a great time. Truly, I haven't seen a good comedy from the recent time releases, so I'm happy I saw this, even though it is a decade old. There's no serious negative stuffs in it like drugs, sex or nudity, so I think it is okay for family viewing.

I've seen four of Terrence Malick's movies -- ""The New World"" (2005) and his three previous efforts, ""Badlands"" (1973), ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) and ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998). He's an arty filmmaker who isn't interested in making conventional ""blockbusters."" His three earlier efforts are all well-done and in some ways great. For instance, his pictures are always beautiful and imaginative, but there's also an airy, leisurely quality that will turn off some viewers. My favorite, by far, is ""The Thin Red Line,"" a flawed masterpiece about the taking of a hill during the Guadalcanal Campaign in WWII. It successfully transcended it's storyline to seek answers to life's most profound questions. I guess Malick does this in all his films to some degree, but he was particularly effective with ""The Thin Red Line.""

I mention this to stress that I'm familiar with Malick's films and understand his approach. I was really looking forward to ""The New World,"" a historical drama detailing the establishment of the 1607 Jamestown, Virginia, colony with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and others (Christopher Plummer, Wes Studi, etc.).

Shot near the actual locations on the Chickahominy River, Virginia, the film -- to be expected -- is beautiful to look at and the costumes, casting, etc. are all top-of-the-line. Unfortunately, for me, the pace is tedious and the themes aren't compelling enough to keep me spellbound. It's more than a tale of discovering a new world or new culture (for both sides); it's mostly a romance, which doesn't do much for me. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe because the pace was too draggy or possibly because I don't find Kilcher as Pocahontas all that captivating. Don't get me wrong, she's excellent in the role; I just don't find her anything to go ga-ga over, as Smith and Rolfe do in the story.

One problem I have with the movie is the ridiculous romanticizing of the Natives as super-virtuous. Exhibit A is when Smith reflects in a voice-over: ""They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, no sense of possession.""

_Why sure!_

If the Indians had no sense of possession why did they attack the settlement when the Englanders failed to leave the next Spring? Why were tribes in regular warfare all over the Americas? Are we to believe not one of the Natives knew what a lie was? Or jealousy, envy, greed and slander? I get that the naturals weren't yet defiled by European-styled urbanization, but to suggest the above is pretty absurd. You can't tell me there wasn't a brave or two who had his eyes on young Pocahontas and felt a ""smidgen"" of jealousy when Smith stirred her romantic interests.

The only way I can get past such nonsense and enjoy the movie is the fact that the voice-over in question was SMITH's idealized, romanticized perspective of a people with which he was enamored. In other words, it wasn't reality; it was his temporarily clouded opinion.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The New World"" will be more appreciated by those who enjoy arty romantic films. For me, I'm in the middle: I see the good of the film -- even the greatness -- and value it, but I can't deny the film's shortcomings as far as a viewing experience goes. Regardless, it's great to be able to go back in time and visualize how it was when the Jamestown colony was established, highly romanticized as it is portrayed here.

The film runs 136 minutes (long enough) and the extended cut 172 minutes.

GRADE: C+ || So, The New World… where do I start? It’s visually great. The way Malick captures the connection between the tribes, nature, and the land makes it easy to get lost in the world he’s building. But the story? Yeah, it could’ve used some serious work.

The first act kicks things off strong. You get this detailed look at the tribes and their initial encounters with the English colonists. There’s this whole adventurous vibe, like you’re about to watch an epic exploration story unfold. But then the movie pivots hard into the second act and starts focusing on Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Okay, I get it, their relationship is important, but it feels like the broader story gets pushed to the side. And then halfway through that act, Captain Smith is out, and suddenly it’s all about Pocahontas and her new romance with John Rolfe. By the time we hit the final act, it’s entirely about Pocahontas, her life in England, and her trying to find her place in this new world. The whole movie feels like it keeps changing its mind about what it wants to be.

That’s where it lost me a bit. What started as this epic about cultures clashing and survival turns into a love story, and then into a drama about identity and loss. Don’t get me wrong, the individual pieces are interesting, but together? It’s messy. It feels like Malick didn’t know what direction to take the story, so he just went with all of them. The plot kind of fizzles out—like, what’s the point of it all? The English colonize the land, force the indigenous people to adapt, and then it ends with Pocahontas raising a kid with an Englishman in England.

Now, to be fair, the production is stunning. The costumes, the set design, the overall atmosphere... Even though I’m no expert on the tribes or their customs, the emotional connection is there. You can tell a lot of care went into making this world feel real. The cinematography is next-level. Malick knows how to make every shot look like a painting, and that’s something I appreciated even when the story wasn’t holding my attention.

But ultimately, while the movie’s storytelling style works, it’s dreamy and poetic, the overall plot just needed more focus. It starts as one thing, shifts to another, and ends as something else entirely. It’s like it can’t decide what it wants to say, and that’s frustrating because it had so much potential."

Sophia Myles works well as the Irish princess, Isolde, who's given as a gift to the king of the Brits, Marke (Rufus Sewell). Also on hand is Marke's nephew, Melot (Henry Cavill), who's passed up by the king for Tristan; David O'Hara as the wicked Irish king, Donnchadh; and the ignoble Wictred (Mark Strong). These are all strong, memorable characters.

Although there are some contrived plot elements, the story (based on the medieval romantic legend) is coherent and pretty compelling. Meanwhile the locations (Ireland) and cinematography are breathtaking. The score's good too. Yet this isn't just a film that's beautiful in appearance & sound, it's beautiful period, despite the brutal violence, bloodshed and betrayal. The general ambiance is similar to, say, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) and lacks the crude elements of ""Rob Roy.""

Some complain that James Franco is too selfishly sullen as Tristan, but that's a big part of the story. Should he have played Tristan as elated that the one & only woman he's ever loved has become the king's wife, a gift from Ireland?

The whole adulterous tangled web could have probably been avoided if either Tristan or Isolde simply told the truth about their relationship BEFORE Isolde married the king, but it's not always easy to do this, especially when you're so young and dumb. By ""dumb"" I don't mean stupid, but rather naive and lacking the life-skills that only come with age & experience.

There's also a lot of good stuff to glean from the tragedy: Everyone wants someone to believe in them; never trust a proven scoundrel; humble confession, remorse & repentance; the natural desire for freedom and ""true love,"" etc.

Despite its early 2006 release date, it was shot over two years earlier in September-October, 2003.

It runs 2 hours, 5 minutes, and was shot in west-central Ireland at Connemara, County Galway. Exterior shots were done in the Czech Republic at Pruhonice Park and Castle, Krivoklat and Prague.

Queen Latifah shines as Georgia Byrd, a sweet, timid woman who’s spent her life playing it safe. When she’s hit with life-altering news, she throws caution to the wind and starts living the life she’s always dreamed of.

Georgia’s “Book of Possibilities” really struck a chord with me. It’s a quiet reminder that so many of us have our own “books,” filled with dreams we shelve for “someday.” Queen Latifah’s transformation in the movie is so much fun to watch. Add Gérard Depardieu as a quirky chef, stunning European backdrops, and mouthwatering food, and it’s the perfect mix of heart and humor.

The message is simple but timeless: take risks, cherish the now, and live fully. Watching it again makes me want my own “Book of Realities,” a little nudge to embrace life with Georgia’s boldness."

Early on this feels like a <em>'Remember the Titans'</em>, even a <em>'Coach Carter'</em>, copycat but it actually ends up creating its own thing. Those two films are also great, but I felt this one nailed the emotion and rawness of events just that little bit better - the sports action also feels more real, at least to me.

Josh Lucas is very good as Don. I don't necessarily think he gives an outstanding performance in the grand scheme of things, but it's a perfect performance for the role itself. Elsewhere, Damaine Radcliff (Cager), Al Shearer (Shed) and Mehcad Brooks (Flournoy) are all good too.

Enthralling plot, well written dialogue, terrific score, an important message and a cast that seemed to gave their all. A quality film, even with the usual Disney slant/tendencies. My only criticism? That fake nose on Jon Voight, wow! || **Glory Road shares the incredible true story of the determination and bravery of Texas Western's 1966 basketball team, but the script falls short of capturing its full potential.**

Glory Road retells the inspiring story of 1966's first all-African American starting line-up in college basketball. The adversity these young men overcame and the courage to rise above the hatred and prejudice was genuinely inspiring. The cast, led by Josh Lucas, did a great job embodying the boldness and grit of each man. Unfortunately, the screenplay was fairly derivative and formulaic, even with a compelling true story. The movie is enjoyable but feels overdone and unoriginal, which takes away from the power of the story. Glory Road is not a bad movie by any means, but it could have been much better."

I'm shocked, this is not a Disney's or the Pixer's, not even DreamWorks' or the Sony's, but a very good film. I meant only the story, though the animation was outdated, even for a film from the 2005. I had trouble watching it in the initial parts, because of the poor technical quality. Once the flashback began, I totally hooked to it and forgot the production standard. The film was saved because of the very good story.

You know retelling the same old tale is so old fashioned, telling a tale in the different angles and adding more flavour to it is the new thing. Like for example the recent 'Maleficent'. So other than those all the awesome qualities, the film is more a television type. But very enjoyable by all.

It has been a decade since it came out and I never tried it because someone told me that it's very bad, but I regret for believing that and ditching it. So believe me it is a wonderful film, except it's not a top notch presentation. It is too short and well worth spending your 80 minutes for it. There's a sequel to it, so I want to try it as well and let you know how it is in another review under that title.

The sequel to cult fave Underworld (2003) finds vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and half werewolf Michael (Scott Speedman) unravelling the truth about their respective blood lines. Just what caused the feud between the vampires and the lycans?

Unsurprisingly reviews for this sequel are mixed, it's either a smart action popcorner that was warranted, or it's a huge let down after the first film. Personally I'm in the first camp, personally because it does pretty much the same things, only the story has a bit of complexity about it to try and bluff us that it's cerebral.

For a film about vampires and werewolves at war it delivers all that is required in the modern era. There's lots of high energy action, blood and guts galore, CGI overdrive, fast pacing and a sexy lead actress fronting the piece. The story ticks along nicely, introducing new and interesting characters, while flashbacks fill in the gaps for any newcomers to the series. The main villain is one bad-ass winged mofo, a genuine terror that our protagonists have right to fear, and the finale is as expected a bonkers array of bloody chaos.

Smartly put together by director Len Wiseman and coolly photographed by Simon Duggan (steel blues and greys), it isn't ground breaking cinema, but it's a wail of a time for those with expectation levels set at popcorn bonanza. 7/10 || I'm sorry but I've denied myself this for far too long. _Underworld: Evolution_ is a cinematic masterpiece and I will fight to the death to defend it.

(I won't actually fight to the death to defend it, or even really try to defend it at all. I know I am in the vast minority here, but I absolutely love this film.)

_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._ || Now this film will only make sense if you saw, and enjoyed, the original in this franchise from 2003 and as sequels go, it works ok. That is, side from a strangely miscast Sir Derek Jacobi but that's short and sweet. The persecuted pairing of Kate Beckinsale and a still rather wooden Scott Speedman race to track down the imprisoned original Lycan ""William"" before the recently awakened super-vampire ""Marcus"" (his brother) can release him and unleash untold terror on the world. Such as it is, the script is a bit stilted but the action scenes are tight and the film moves along quite sharply. As with the first film, probably not for purists of the genre, but it does have the distinct benefit of being half an hour shorter and the characters are suitably mean and moody."

However, negatives include the underuse/misuse (at least that's how it felt to me) of Casper and the parts of the plot with George Hamilton & Co. - which are, frankly, terrible.

Jeremy Foley remains solid as the voice of Casper since joining with the second installment, while Cathy Moriarty - Carrigan from the original - returns to the series in a different role. The only person who appears in all three opening releases is Ben Stein, as far as I noticed anyway.

After the Declaration of Independence, a fur trapper (Pacino) & his son are inadvertently enlisted in the Continental Army in the summer of 1776, wherein they find themselves fighting The Battle of Long Island. They end up working as scouts and are at Valley Forge during the cold winter of 1777-1778, as well as Yorktown in 1781. Nastassja Kinski plays a woman from an aristocratic family who joins the patriots while Donald Sutherland is on hand as an officer in the British Army.

""Revolution"" (1985) was made by the acclaimed director of “Chariots of Fire” and “Greystoke,” but the film flopped at the box office and was nominated for four Razzies. Is it THAT bad? No. It does a good job of taking the viewer into the midst of the Revolutionary War as a foot soldier or worker with the use of handheld cameras. The situation isn’t fun; it’s chaotic, life-threatening, dirty, grisly and full of hardships. The Continentals are a ragtag group of Americans suffering privations while the Redcoats are a disciplined, well-supplied army with degenerate officers. Speaking of which, the Brits aren’t painted in a positive light.

While the film isn’t as effective as “The Patriot,” especially in regard to character development, it makes for a worthwhile companion piece since it involves the northern theater of the war and the other the Carolina theater. On the downside, the English and Norwegian locations are sometimes a questionable substitution for New York, Pennsylvania and coastal Virginia, especially the mountains of Norway (standing in for northern New York and the Saint Lawarence River region, I think), but at least they’re picturesque and the sequences don’t last long.

The scene where Daisy leaves the fort at Valley Forge and is attacked by a British detachment on horseback is awkwardly executed but, hey, it’s a movie, not a documentary. I was inspired to look-up the real history.

The movie runs 2 hour, 6 minutes, but there’s a Director’s Cut from 2009 that’s 10 minutes shorter and features narration by Pacino. It was largely filmed in southern England, as follows: The old dock area of King's Lynn, Norfolk, as well as near Thetford, Norfolk, and Melton Constable Hall. The main battle sequences were shot at Burrator Reservoir on Dartmoor in Devon and on the coastal cliff top near Challaborough Bay, South Devon, which is where the wooden fort was built. The scenic scenes where Dobb is with the Huron were shot in Norway.

One of the inspiring biopic I have ever seen. It is about chasing a dream and it is never too late to do that so. Based on the story of a New Zealand motorcyclist Burt Munro.

So what's the remaining of the tale reveals is that does his dream becomes reality or not.

Awesome performance by Anthony Hopkins, but in some parts I was distracted by his fake Kiwi accent. Overall, not bad with his effort, he achieved the goal conveniently. It is one of the best road movie that directed by the 'Species' filmmaker. The 120 minutes was too short, but well covered story with inclusion of messages like anti smoking and alcohol consumption.

It is a decade old film, never too late to watch a fine film like this, but inside I feel regret for the delay. I had no idea about the storyline. I thought it might be about Indians and then thought American Indians, but realised only while watching it that it is about a motorbike called Indian. It is surely a good family movie, especially if there is a motorbike maniac in the house. Highly recommended by me.

Final Destination the series moves into its third instalment without really changing the formula that was working for it. Here the opening disaster involves a Roller Coaster crash that is brought via a premonition to Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). As in the previous two films, the visionary and some friends get spooked and get off the coaster to find it actually does crash and a bunch of horrific deaths befall all those on board. Sure enough the survivors start being killed off in equally gruesome ways, it becomes apparent that the old grim reaper is out to claim the deaths that were denied him.

The opening section of FD3 is superb, the credits roll to a back drop of various carnival/fairground attractions that offer up foreboding terror, all backed by an eerie rumbling musical score. Then the crash itself is excellently stage, so much so that anyone frightened of Roller Coasters can point to this as a reason why! Then we revert to type, the youthful cast get bumped off in more ingenious ways, with more gore and lashings of dark humour pumped up this time (the use of Love Roller Coaster by The Ohio Players is genius). The narrative drive this time involves photographs, which is a nice touch and overcomes the triteness of some dialogue exchanges.

It's a safe entry in the series, and it boasts in Winstead the best young lead actress of the whole franchise. As with all horror films - franchises, some will love it and some will hate it, but ultimately it really does exactly what the previous two films did. So if a fan of those then this does a good job as well. The 2 disc DVD comes with a delightful choose their fate option, which with a bit of playing around gives you a slightly different version of the film. While it is recommended you turn up your home cinema systems for the Roller Coaster segments. 7/10 || In short, not a very exciting movie. It was not at all as good as the previous ones. Not that this was very surprising of course since the general consensus on the web seems to be that 1 & 2 are quite good, 3 & 4 not so much while the 5th is supposed to be back in shape.

Unfortunately, in this 3rd installment it seems that the producer took some shortcuts and produced the all to common teenage splatter movie. That is, do not bother about spending time on a decent script nor any acting capabilities to talk about. Replace all that with some wiggling boobs and behinds to appeal to the not too intelligent part of the teenage movie going audience, kill of a few of the bearers of said boobs and behinds at regular intervals in an increasingly goory and spectacular way and you’re done.

I kind of like the goory and violent bit, it’s supposed to be a horror movie after all, but I would prefer that it was strung together in something that at least can be said to be semi-intelligent way. Well, you cannot have a film collection if you do not have all the films in a series can you? So I cannot say that I regret buying the set but I do not think this one will go up on the films to re-watch list any time soon. || ***Decent, but now formulaic entry in this 'Dead Teenager' series***  

The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, as an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly teens, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second it's a horrible highway pile-up while in this third entry it's a rollercoaster mishap.

All of the movies in the five-film franchise tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.

Released in 2006, ""Final Destination 3"" has a quality doe-eyed heroine or 'final girl' in Mary Elizabeth Winstead. There are some other worthy female cast members, like Alexz Johnson, Chelan Simmons, Crystal Lowe and Amanda Crew. These five ladies represent perhaps the best assortment of women in the series yet.

While it’s true that you know exactly how this film plays out if you've seen the first two installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the female cast. For instance, the rollercoaster accident is thrilling and rings true in light of real-life mishaps at amusement parks. There’s also a horrifying tanning booth death sequence, which was done better in “Urban Legends: Bloody Mary” from the previous year (2005). Another death scene occurs at a warehouse where two of the protagonists work. I also liked how an extended sequence outside the teens’ school takes place in the rain, which shows attention to detail (or making the best of a rainy day during shooting, whatever).

For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most probably die in the sequel.

In case you’re interested, there's an interesting 20-minute documentary about ""Dead Teenager Movies"" on the 'extras' disk with Roger Ebert being a highlight.

The film runs 93 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver area, as were all the Final Destination flicks, except the fourth one.

I did not, however, think it would be worse than I expected. I went to see the movie because I am a fan of Steve Martin and his writing. His attempt at either imitating or recreating the Clouseau role (whichever it was) was, in the very least, a failed accomplishment. The beauty of the Sellers ""Clouseau"" was the subtlety that Sellers brought to the character. He was clumsy as opposed to stupid. The real humor in the originals is that Clouseau would solve the case, more or less, by accident through his faults. Thus when he received acclaim it was that much more humorous. Martin's ""Clouseau"" is stupid and vain and has no likable traits. He actually has some police skills that help him in the end, but are not in the vain of Clouseau. He is NOT Clouseau. Why would anyone want to recreate a character that was perfect? || **A decent film, which has what it takes to entertain us minimally, but which is still far from the quality we would like to see.**

After many years dormant, the ""Pink Panther"" franchise was entitled to a very brief resurrection with two films starring Steve Martin. I saw the original films, from the 60s, 70s and 80s, in which Peter Sellers played the infamous Inspector Clouseau. With the death of Sellers, the franchise continued, with some absolutely bad films that dictated its end. This new film was heavily criticized by critics and was not able to give the public everything they wanted, but the truth is that it was a box office success and that, even today, it has the right to recurring exhibitions on TV channels, something that the original movies don't have it anymore.

The choice of Steve Martin for the protagonist, I believe, was quite wise, insofar as the actor knew how to do a job that respects and seeks to honor the legacy of Sellers (an actor that Martin himself admitted that he admired a lot). Martin is good at what he does, and he's a well-known comic actor, but the humor he bets on is more predictable and idiotic than Sellers' humor, and the truth is, he's not particularly funny. Jean Reno was a welcome addition, as the actor is quite comfortable with the role and the kind of humor that is reserved for him. Emily Mortimer works very well as a platonic love interest. I found her much funnier than the protagonist himself. Kevin Kline doesn't work very well as Dreyfus: the actor gave him a seriousness that takes away all the fun. In turn, Beyoncé seems to have been chosen only for her physical beauty and ability to mobilize her fans to see the film. She can't play a character, she's just being herself.

The screenplay is part of the problem with this film, with a far-fetched and rocambolesque story in which the pink diamond is stolen almost in plain sight, shortly after the death of its owner, a famous football coach. The story is simply weak and unappealing. And while the cinematography is decent, the filming locations are well-chosen and well-used, and the animated opening credits are pretty well done, the rest limps a lot: editing and visual effects work are the film's weak points, the pacing seems uneven and unbalanced and the soundtrack seems to be limited to a series of variations on top of the leitmotif given by the tone of Mancini's original music."

This is certainly something different.  It's a different approach to vampires (hemophages), it's a different approach to sci-fi, and it's a different approach to corporate dystopia.  Oddly, the Umbrella Corporation from ""Resident Evil"" is the closest of which I can think.

Milla Jovovich is entirely capable of performing high action sequences, and carrying the movie, which she does wonderfully.  I don't doubt that she has some pull in the production process, but the problems in this are mostly the weak character work and the ""I have this really cool idea I'd like to do on screen, it'll be totally different than anything else out there."" of it all.

Some of it (nose plugs) are actively distracting, and other things are just odd choices (squared off sword), while there are cool concepts (dimensionally printed weapons), and scenes that just look cool even if they're not especially practical or sensisble (swords on fire in the dark).

My only personal gripes are day walking vampires, weird foley sounds for the guns (most are right, but it is hard to tell on made up guns), and why in the hell people with guns would charge someone instead of firing.

Bruce Willis and Mos Def double up well as Jack and Eddie. I particularly like Willis' look for the majority of the film, he genuinely looks how his character supposedly is - good acting, but also some nice make-up etc. 

Mos Def is solid, I remember liking him when he appeared on <em>'Dexter'</em> - I rate him less here, just because of the annoying voice he has; which grates hard at times. Speaking of that Showtime television show, Angel Batista himself (David Zayas) also appears which is cool. David Morse, meanwhile, makes for an OK villain - the casting perhaps could've been greater for the antagonist, mind.

None of the plot is all that shocking or surprising, every crossroad that appears is pretty simple to predict where it's heading. Also, maybe I'm the only one who felt this, but there's one moment on a bus where it seems as if Jack is about to unleash some unbelievable secret plan but it just fizzles out into oddly nothing. Might be just me.

All in all though, I reckon you'll be able to find a satisfactory 105 minutes with this - I did, at least. || 16 Blocks is an incredibly atmospheric movie with some quite incredibly done street scenes. Its intensity draws you in and makes you quickly form strong opinions of each character. I initially considered Mos Def's character to be annoying, but after a number of watches I realised if he hadn't given his character so much character then he would have been inconsequential and that would have weakened the movie severely. I think Bruce Willis was very brave to take the part of Jack Mosley and commit to it in the way he did. He makes this film what it is."

The grittiness of the story cannot be understated, this story is DARK. However, the message of the story is one of hope, and hope is a difficult thing to capture. This film captures both, with the help of excellent cinematography and slow-motion action cuts.

 I get the sense when I watch this film that something bigger is happening around me, and honestly in 2017, this movie feels more relevant than ever. Themes of state-run media empires, government corruption of the highest order, and the suffocation of all that is 'other' permeates the fabric of this film, and everything is captured beautifully in a noir-esque nightmarescape of future, facist London.

I can honestly say that more than a decade later, this film still shines as one of the great comic book movies and its themes will continue to ring true as long as we have people in the world who exist to limit others.

He portrays real life hood Jackie DiNorscio, a man already serving a thirty year sentence when he is summoned by District Attorney Tierney (Linus Roache) and offered a deal. Testify against one of the big five crime families and have his prison term reduced. He sticks to his guns and declines, only to find himself joining the list of arraigned and facing even longer behind bars. Broke, he decides to defend himself and is soon entertaining and annoying the judge and the jury in equal measure with his lively and unorthodox methods. Diesel does not do emotion well, nor subtlety - and when the part calls for it, he delivers poorly. Otherwise though, he turns in a reasonable enough effort as the charismatic crook who makes no bones about his naughty past, but extols the virtues of loyalty, family and decency to try and persuade the jury to acquit not just him, but his gaggle of positively dodgy associates. It's based on a true story so the ending is a matter of public record thus robbing this of any jeopardy and unfortunately, that too, renders the story rather unremarkable save for the fact that the trial lasted all but two years and cost a fortune. Ron Silver stands out amongst the supporting cast as the no nonsense judge but otherwise the others offer little by way memorable contribution to a story that is itself pretty lacklustre and for which this particular star isn't really well equipped. It's over two hours long and to be honest, I was rather tired with it after about half of that time. || I'm not convinced by this one.

<em>'Find Me Guilty'</em> works more than it probably should and I wasn't actually ever bored by any of the events onscreen, but I can't really shake the feeling that it isn't a good movie. Seeing Vin Diesel in the lead role felt off, I adore him in <em>'Fast & Furious'</em> but he doesn't fit this role all that much. The accent, the mob boss-esque acting, the hair...

The vibe of the film is also felt quite ill-fitting. I don't know anything about the real life case that this depicts, but based on a quick look online I can see why the film portrays Diesel's lead character in the way it does. Though I feel like it ignores too much and wants you to root for characters without giving suitable reasons as to why you should; aside from shaking fists in the air at authority figures.

It's not necessarily strictly bad, it is just not one I can personally describe as being good; a standard 6/10 for me. I did like Peter Dinklage and Alex Rocco in this, though."

Inside Man is mind-blowing, clever, fast-paced, well-crafted, and downright brilliant. With an all-star cast led by Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, Inside Man takes twists and turns you never see coming. Denzel’s clever charm combats Clive’s steely calm intensity leaving the audience intrigued and engaged, wondering what is happening from start to finish. The genius writing makes the crazy robbery scheme seem believable and actually possible. Inside Man makes you root for both sides of the law wanting the burglars to succeed and the cops to get their man with a highly satisfying and rewarding resolution. My only complaints would be the final 20 minutes falters in pacing a little as it attempts to tie all the threads together, and all the foul language was unnecessary. All in all, Inside Man is a brilliant must-see for any heist film enthusiast, Denzel Washington fan, or movie lover in general."

RELEASED TO VIDEO in 1995, ""Leprechaun 3"" is the second sequel in the series about a hideous little leprechaun (Warwick Davis) who likes to kill those who take from his pot of gold. This one's set in Las Vegas and features a young dude who gets infected with the Leprechaun's green blood and starts to morph into a (taller) leprechaun himself (John Gatins).

Although ""Leprechaun 3"" plays it pretty straight there's also quite a bit of camp. Regardless, it's nigh impossible to take seriously due to the cartoonish leprechaun; consequently, the film is more comedy than horror. In fact, it's not horrifying at all. But it _IS_ entertaining, and that's the name of the game.

As my title blurb would suggest, ""Leprechaun 3"" is well worth watching for the character of Tammy alone, played by Lee Armstrong. It's great to have an intelligent, winsome female protagonist with actual and natural curves, rather than the usual too-thin blondes with chicken legs and fake breasts. Lee blows them all out of the water and her outfits only accentuate her appeal. Too bad she left acting behind the same year ""Leprechaun 3"" was released, but at least we have this film to remember her awe-inspiring beauty.

THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in Las Vegas.

GRADE: B+ || The idea of a Monkey's Paw in Las Vegas is actually pretty solid, but it's poorly executed, doesn't mesh with the mythology of the series set up at this point, and also is hamstrung by a strange pseudo-""Werewolf in Vegas"" arc that crops up in the second half.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || _**A parody of Star Trek and the first 2 Aliens movies**_

Released to video in 1997, ""Leprechaun 4: In Space"" takes place in the future where a group of space marines travel to a distant planet to stop a power-hungry Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) from harming a Dominian princess, Zarina (Rebecca Carlton). The Marines' civilian boss is a mad scientist by the name of Dr. Mittenhand (Guy Siner). When the Leprechaun eventually manifests on the vessel havoc ensues.

I've only seen the first four Leprechaun movies and this is my second favorite after ""Leprechaun 3"" (1995). As a low-budget horror/comedy, you have to take it for what it is to appreciate it. Davis is entertaining as usual as the eponymous imp and the quality cast take it all tongue-in-cheek.

The Leprechaun rebirth scene is particularly effective, both funny and perverse. The way Dr. Mittenhand de-morphs is also done well. Meanwhile Rebecca Carlton & Jessica Collins are definite highlights as Princess Zarina and Tina, but they coulda done more with Zarina.

""Jaxon X"" (2002) is cut from the same cloth, but had a bigger budget and is all-around superior.

The movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot at Front Street Studios, Los Angeles. ADDITIONAL CAST: Brent Jasmer and Tim Colceri play the main Marines while Debbe Dunning plays a secondary one. Gary Grossman is also on hand.

This 2006 remake of 1959's <em>'The Shaggy Dog'</em> is very bad. That's thanks to some lazy writing and humour, none of the jokes land while the plot - while I praise them for changing up the original - is so lame - their thinking seemingly just stopped at 'man acts like dog' and thought that'll do.

Another thing that hampers the film is the attempt at a heartwarming story with the main family, which is nauseating to see unfold. There's also a scene at the end where the dad (Allen) is stark naked in public and in front of his children, who have literally zero reaction and just stand there smiling ...

With that noted, I will say I didn't hate watching this. Tim Allen, whilst over-the-top and in your face at times, is a good cast to play this silly role - he stops the character of Dave becoming annoying, he's just cringey to me.

The casting is, actually, pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. and Danny Glover are involved, as are recognisable faces Spencer Breslin, Shawn Pyfrom, Philip Baker Hall and Joel David Moore. Rhea Seehorn, star of <em>'Better Call Saul'</em>, also appears - you could make a case that this is a prequel to BCS ...

I have no idea why they decided to remake this, especially given they seemingly didn't put any serious effort into it. It's weird, cringe, dull and entirely forgettable. A poor film."

Rather than ignoring its source material, or taking the other extreme of drearily rehashing it scene for scene, Aja and Levasseur's _The Hills Have Eyes_ simply expands and improves upon the original.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || Aside from some pretty significant plausibility issues, this is actually quite a decent shock horror. A family stop off at gas station where the elderly attendant tells them of a dirt track shortcut across the desert that will save them a few hours. Towing their caravan, off they go, but when a puncture causes them to lose control and crash into a big rock, they begin to realise that they are not the only folks nearby - and I use the term ""folks"" loosely. What now follows sees our travellers terrorised by some hideously mutated people who had been left there ever since the US Government carried out nuclear tests. Reduced to just 3, ""Big Bob"" (Ted Levine) and his faithful hound have to track down his kidnapped baby grandchild - a perilous journey indeed. Now quite why they decided to take the shortcut is just one of a few dodgy decision taken by the ""Carter"" family that made me wonder, and rendered the plot increasingly silly as we progress to an ending that seems to drag on a bit too long. That said, there are plenty of jump moments and Alexandre Aja manages to keep the annoyingly screaming hysteria to a minimum. Once it eventually gets going, it becomes decently paced and the photography is tightly cut to maximise the impact of some pretty gruesome scenarios (and prosthetics!). Though not as gritty as the 1977 original, I think it's still just as good."

Absolutely love this film. The only film so far to make my dad and I cry. || This isn't so much a thriller as a glaring example of the corrupting power of the state, and of those charged with crafting and implementing it's policies. ""Dreyman"" (Sebastian Koch) is an East German playwright who is popular with the communist elite because his works manage to extol the virtues of their people's republic. The minister ""Hempf"" (Thomas Thieme) goes through all the supportive motions with him, but meantime asks the Stasi to keep an eye on him. The very ambitious ""Grubitz"" (Ulrich Tukur) selects his meticulous colleague ""Wiesler"" (Ulrich Mühe) to manage the surveillance and off we go. What dawns on them very quickly is that they are being used by the politician to discredit the writer for an altogether different reason. He has designs on actress ""Christa-Maria"" (Martina Gedeck) who just happens to be the girlfriend of their new quarry. She has very reluctantly agreed to his advances in the past, but on the basis that resistance would be pretty futile as he is not a man to be crossed. If they needed proof of that, they just have to look at the ostracised ""Jerska"" (Volkmar Kleinart) who is now reduced to living in a glorified flat share and who cannot get any work. The hitherto unshakeable loyalty of ""Wiesler"" starts to wobble a bit now. He dislikes being used and as his surveillance continues, he realises that maybe his targets are not the right ones! Gradually, the internecine and political elements close in on all of them and as pressure grows to deliver results, things take a tragic turn for just about everyone. It's quite a potently paced and cleverly written indictment of totalitarian regimes, this. The people live in fear and so conform; the state controls all aspects of the infrastructure of daily life and those who have climbed the greasy red pole soon display all the Orwellian credentials of his ""Napoleon"" from ""Animal Farm"". Plaudits must go to Gedeck who plays well the conflicted character who must juggle her love and her life and to Mühe who shows that as a former master of the indoctrinating arts, ""Wiesler"" too might be capable of change. Of humanity even. There's a fun scene where one of their colleagues is telling a joke about Erich Honecker and is accidentally overheard. We see him again later - but neither character is doing the job they signed up for!"

It has a streak of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE in it. The eclectic arrangement of the deranged is inventive and full of texture. I own it and watch it often! || Brick is a detective/noir film but to the viewer’s surprise, in a high-school setting. It is written and independently directed by Rian Johnson. At the mention of any movie revolving around high school or teenagers, all that comes to mind are the various stereotypes but this movie gives a surprise to the viewer.
The story revolves around a particular, rather abrupt and frantic phone call received by the high school misfit, Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) from his terrified ex-girlfriend, Emily Kostich (Emilie de Ravin) who begs him for his help. Brendan vows to investigate and solve her murder himself and is - in the process - forced to mingle with the very same high school stereotypes that he so diligently avoided. The character of Brendan is quite the risk taker, fearless to investigate all possible sources of information with the help of his only friend and a stereotypical nerd ‘The Brain’. With his vigilant tactics, he is determined to get his way into the neighborhood’s suspicious drug and crime network connected by some of the high school students and the local gang/drug leader ‘The Pin’; in order to get around to solving the mystery.
Rian Johnson took some time to write the script which took inspiration from multiple sources like the noir film era of the 30s-40s. While taking its plot and feel from the celebrated American author Dashiell Hammett’s detective novels, the film is also largely inspired by the Anime “Cowboy Bebop”. Brendan’s character shows a huge influence of the lead character from the anime. Rian has focused greatly on minute details. Each character in the film has a connection with the other making the plot more complex and intricate. Also, a really vague (or maybe not so vague) thing I observed was the alliteration. The title of the film is “Brick”, the characters are “Brendan”, “Brain” & “Brad”. I think this was done deliberately to provoke the thinking of the audience.
A hard to miss fact is that there are only two adults in the movie. One, The Pin's mother; she is in the kitchen as her son makes his deals, making breakfast and pouring juice for his friends, while the film's only other adult, the school vice-president who is using Brendan as an informant. Another amusing writing wonder was the absence of education and parents from the entire high-school/ teenage setup. Small humorous elements keep the film going. The scene when Brendan reaches the coffee place and messes with the straw (a kid is drinking juice from) there will surely make one laugh. Another one is when The Pin’s mother searches for milk to serve Brendan and her son is there with his muscle power making a crime deal.
Now coming to another major aspect that makes the film do wonders is the cast: led by a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt as loner Brendan Frye. It is a film that he made before he was getting big. He was in that transitional phase between child star and adult actor and this is one of the first movies that displayed the true talent that he really has. His character shows such grit that he takes huge amounts of beatings from “Tugger” just to meet “The Pin” Some of the other characters in the film that steal the show are that of the local drug lord “The Pin” played by Lucas Haas and the geeky/nerdy character of “The Brain” played by Matt 0’Leary. It was so enticing that a big number of fan theories suggest that the character of Brain didn’t exist at all and it was just Brendan taking the help of his conscience. Basically, like Sherlock’s ‘Mind Palace.’
The visual set up, lighting and sound design also perfectly compliment the vibe of the film, with effective variations to fit the intensity of what is going on. For the kind of small budget involved; a short 20-day shooting period; the use of feasible editing; production and VFX equipment, the film definitely does not disappoint on screen. The edit team did a great job on the various transitions involved. The ones that mesmerised me in particular were the ‘time transitions’ and the ‘light to dark transitions’. In a couple shots, the scene transitions into another with the focus on the digital clock in Brendan’s bedroom. As a lover of inventive cinematography, the biggest standout for me was the framing, everything is shot from a lower angle, and many characters are defined as much by their shoes as anything else. DP Steve Yedlin made a point that each character’s establishing shot begins with their shoes (making the audience more curious and confused) and then gradually reaches to a close-up. This creativity is well-thought and well-executed. The impressive background score is composed by director Rian Johnson’s own cousin Nathan Johnson. It is mainly made up of Xylophone-like sounds but during fight scenes it shifts to percussion sounds and strings sounds during intense/climax scenes. The combination score is a mixture of both traditional and home invented instruments giving a strange balance in the background.
Brick is a thoroughly enjoyable film, an experimental debut by the director that was surely a huge risk. It is a perfect homage to the noir classics and at the same time, it is a dark and effective take on a high school student’s life belonging to a small town. The viewer is intrigued by the blunt character of the protagonist and is forced to get into his universe. However, those who are not fascinated by indie/experimental films in general might find it boring or confusing. But it surely won’t disappoint anyone. || We start proceedings with ""Brendan"" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) standing over the body of a girl lying dead in a storm drain. It turns out that she is ""Emily"" - and was his girlfriend. He's very much on the edge of society at his school, but with the help of his way more savvy, but just as ostracised, friend ""The Brain"" (Matt O'Leary) he determines to infiltrate the local drug supply network and get to the legendary ""Pin"". This is where he expects to find answers, and maybe even a bit of retribution. Along the way he encounters some of the less savoury characters from his community - notably the hard-punching ""Tug"" (Noah Fleiss) and the manipulative ""Laura"" (Nora Zehetner) and takes a few beatings - but will he get to his well shielded mark? It's really well written, this drama. The dialogue is complex and quickly paced - especially when delivered by JGL and the understated O'Leary. The rest of it, though, is all just a bit like a slightly grittier edition of ""90210"". The characters are all too shallow, the string-puller is fairly obvious from the start and the denouement is both rushed and rather unsatisfactory. The lead role is well enough executed, but as the rather thinly constructed plot unravels I just found I didn't really care one way or the other about this one man detective agency, or who did what to whom - as it steadfastly hammered another nail into the US teenage education system."

Now it has to be said that she could certainly be doing with an haircut, but anything else might be a tad too severe... Terrified by his new obsession, and by the impending arrival of his best friend (her cousin ""Erich"" - Jack Trevor) he flees their home to live with his mother (Ilka Grüning) who is reduced to cutting his food as he, by now, cannot bear to even handle a knife.

I suspect modern day psychiatrists would squirm at the very simplistic ""it's all from an obscure or profound event from your childhood"" - approach taken here, but it's almost 100 years old and the efforts and innovations being exemplified by ""Orth"" are quite intriguing to watch. The first cinematographic identification of the ""id"" that later played such a huge part in films like ""The Forbidden Planet"" (made thirty years later) is quite compellingly broken down for us in a perfectly plausible, if at times overly dramatic fashion. The dream sequence combines efficient special effects with his own personal allegory really quite effectively, and the score did much to add to the emotional angst of ""Fellman"" - who didn't actually want to murder his wife. You'll either love or hate the ending - I don't think there is much middle ground on that, but the whole thing is certainly worth catching up with."

I couldn't tell you one thing I enjoyed about this. To be ultra fair, there isn't anything truly diabolical about it either - hence the (generous?) rating. It's just so basic and limp that it struggles to entertain at all, I'd even question if the younger audience would even like it.

The elephant in the room is also that's practically a rip-off of DreamWorks' <em>'Madagascar'</em>, which was released roughly one year prior. If we're comparing the two, <em>'The Wild'</em> is weaker in every area - and I'm not even a massive fan of that 2005 film.

Animation-wise it's disappointing, it's not just dull but also quite jarring in parts. The cast aren't much better, I wouldn't say any of them are bad but none of them are memorable one bit - if you force me to pick a noteworthy member, it would be Eddie Izzard's koala. Kiefer Sutherland (Samson) and William Shatner (Kazar) should standout, but simply do not.

The story is shallow, predictable and boringly by the numbers. I expect much more from Disney, it's safe to say. Up until this point in time, it's definitely their worst animated release that isn't a sequel/spin-off.

Much more akin plot-wise to the first film, _M:I:III_ has the one advantage over its predecessors that it's villain is much stronger than any we have seen before. Though arguably not the primary antagonist, Seymour-Hoffman (RIP) is actually pretty terrifying as international arms dealer, Owen Davian.

That said, while this third entry is certainly the most engaging thus far, it still had me checking my watch before the end of the movie, so I can hardly give it a glowing review.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Despite the introduction of the always annoying Simon Pegg, this is an huge improvement on the last instalment. It sees the now retired, loved-up ""Ethan"" (Tom Cruise) coaxed out of retirement to deal with the menacing arms dealer ""Davian"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who has just bumped off one of the IMF's finest as he tries to offload the devilishly toxic ""rabbit's foot"" - a weapon with devastating potential. The initial part of the operation goes smoothly enough, but when his prey escapes his clutches, ""Ethan"" soon realises that he is going to be used to obtain the weapon - else his girlfriend ""Julia"" (Michelle Monaghan) is going to be toast. PSH is a super baddie here, very much in the less is more school of menace, but not afraid to get a bit brutal when called for. The story itself is all pretty routine, there isn't much jeopardy throughout, but the action scenes are more natural and less choreographed than last time out, and PSH also does add quite a lot of extra gravitas to the proceedings. It also features one of the more assured performance from the usually wooden as a tree Jonathan Rhys Meyers with Ving Rhames having a more substantial, and quite entertaining, role too. I'm not sure what anyone can really do about the inevitability of the conclusion - we just know these films are going to keep on coming, but this one from the established writing team of Kurtzman and Orci keeps moving well with plenty of gadgets, body morphing and action to pass the two hour mark comfortably. || **Mission: Impossible 3 gives the franchise something more than explosions and cool gadgets. It gives the series heart and family.**

Mission: Impossible 3 carried the heavy burden of trying to ground the fantastical world of Mission Impossible with its insane stunts and extraordinary gadgets after the franchise took it all a little too far in MI2. JJ Abrams took the reins, simplified the plot to Ethan Hunt’s struggle to rescue his fiancée, and filled the cast with excellent talents like Michelle Monaghan, Phillip Seymore Hoffman, Keri Russell, Simon Pegg, and more. While the stunts and gadgets that define the franchise were still in the film, they were not the focus. Instead, MI3 concentrated on developing Hunt’s character and his struggle to protect his loved ones from his work. This movie frequently finds itself at the bottom of the Mission: Impossible rankings, but I think it’s one of the best in the series and gave the franchise the heart and direction it needed to become the box office behemoth it is today."

I found <em>'Over the Hedge'</em> to be a rather dull affair. The cast try, the likes of Bruce Willis, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, Nick Nolte and Thomas Haden Church are all fine and probably help the film avoid an even lower rating from myself.

It's just everything else that I didn't click with, from the lame plot set-up to the animation to the humour. Just real forgettable. Of course I'm not the target audience and all that, but still. Either way, it's a film that failed to hold my attention sufficiently.

Just me? Probably.

Anyway, to summarise my thoughts on this 2006 release: Not good, kinda surprised to see it rated rather well on here - to each their own, as always. It does have a catchy end credits song though, I'll give it that. || Alright, let's talk about ""Over the Hedge""! Seriously, this movie? A solid 10/10! It's like, super underrated, you know?

First off, the animation is just... wow! It's so colorful and lively. The characters move in such a fun, cartoony way, and all the little details, like the fur on the animals or the shiny gadgets, are amazing. It's way better than just ""average"" animation.

And the story! It's so clever. You've got these woodland critters waking up from hibernation and finding a giant hedge and a whole new world of human stuff. RJ the raccoon is hilarious and sneaky, and the rest of the gang, like Verne the turtle and Hammy the squirrel, are just so lovable. It's funny, but it also has a really sweet message about family and sticking together.

The jokes? Oh my gosh, they're so good! There are jokes for everyone, from silly slapstick to smart, witty lines. You'll be laughing the whole time. Plus, the action scenes are super exciting, like when they're trying to steal all the human food. It's a rollercoaster ride!

Seriously, ""Over the Hedge"" is a masterpiece. It's got everything: great animation, a funny and heartwarming story, and characters you'll totally fall in love with. If you haven't seen it, you absolutely have to! It's way, way above average, and it deserves way more love!"

Story essentially finds a cruise liner capsized by chaotic weather and survivors try to make their way out of an upside world before the boat either sinks or the inrushing water drowns them.

The original is one of the highlights of the disaster genre that burst forth in the 1970s, so it really didn't need remaking, but Hollywood insists on remaking old films for cash cow purpose. As it is, this is hardly a terrible movie, it lacks character development, the plot is stripped bare without any additional depth, and ultimately it's the CGI effects (that do work handsomely enough and were Oscar Nominated) that carries the picture to just above average status.

Hardly a must see disaster film but enough excitement and suspense to make it a dent time waster for fans of the genre. 6/10"
591.0,The Da Vinci Code,"A murder in Paris’ Louvre Museum and cryptic clues in some of Leonardo da Vinci’s most famous paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery.

No shadow will be safe again, for you will be hunted by angels.

The Da Vinci Code is directed by Ron Howard and adapted to screenplay by Akiva Goldsman from the novel of the same name written by Dan Brown. It stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Jürgen Prochnow. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.

When a man is murdered inside the Louvre, his body is found to be surrounded by cryptic messages. The police call in American symbology expert Robert Langdon (Hanks) to decode the clues. When he is joined by Parisian cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), it quickly becomes apparent that nothing is as it first seems and a mystery begins to unravel that could shake Christianity to its very core.

Extended Cut (Blu-ray) Version Viewed.

I haven't read the book! And I love treasure hunt/clue chasing movies! So I came to Ron Howard's hugely successful film (over $600 million in worldwide profit) bereft of literary pressure and with only a modicum of genre expectation. Perhaps this is why I'm apparently only in a small percentage of film lovers who really enjoyed the film? In spite of those gargantuan financial figures.

Ultimately it's very safe film making, with a director and cast guaranteeing professionalism, but it weaves a magical mystery tour full of cryptic clues, secret organisations and cover ups. Yes, there is a good deal of corn thrown in as well, which inevitably stops the adaptation from being hyper intelligent. There's also an understanding on my part as to why many feel it's just too talky, but was the film ever going to be unfurled as an action movie blockbuster for the popcorn munching crowd, like National Treasure et al?

It is a clever conspiracy thriller full of twists and turns with a outlandish revelation at the finale. It's also very appropriately performed by the cast (serio brooding and fret), and when McKellen joins the fray after an hour of film it has a little class as well, while Zimmer's score is a majestic blending of choir, strings and synths. I maintain that the film didn't deserve the critical whacking it got, but again I say I had a blank canvas going in for my first viewing. 

I wasn't sold to it because of controversy or had a saliva tinged mouth having worshipped at the altar of Dan Brown, I expected exactly what I got. A flawed but ever so intriguing adult mystery thriller, and not even Hanks' hair stopped me having a great time with the movie. 7/10 || Writing this review might be considered an act of vanity. Until recently I was among the very few who hadn’t seen The Da Vinci Code, or even read the book. But now I have done so — watch the movie, that is. I still have no plans to read the book. But is there anyone left out there who might benefit from a review?

Mostly I thought the movie was rather silly. Oh, I know that the book was researched about as well as your average documentary, and that the plot is intricate and suitably complex for a thriller. Like a spy thriller, it develops that the two heroes can never be sure who they can trust. In fact, the short answer seems to be “No one!” There are plenty of plot twists, reverses and surprising  revelations, some nifty but others that are utterly predictable. But it lost some of its credibility for me near the beginning when the female lead drove her car at a high rate of speed in reverse in and around traffic, faster than most drivers could manage driving forward. Really?

There is a lot of action in the movie, but it lacks the exuberance and humor of a classic like Raiders of the Lost Ark. I guess religion is a serious business. || This had all the ingredients and even a self-flagellating Paul Bettany so what happened? Well it all started strongly enough with the aforementioned man perpetrating a mysterious killing in the Louvre museum. It turns out that the victim is one of the museum’s curators and when the police discovers that his body has been defaced with ancient symbols, they call in “Sophie” (Audrey Tautou) to investigate. She, in turn, invites acclaimed American professor “Langdon” (Tom Hanks) to help find out what this might all mean, and swiftly there are embroiled in the machinations of a legendary society that has it’s roots stretching back to the very beginnings of Christianity. Indeed, as they try to stay one step ahead of these people who would have them dead, too - and who have a multitude of connections throughout French society and government - they begin to suspect that the Holy Grail might be the ultimate goal here as their travels take them, ably assisted by “Sir Leigh Teabing” (Sir Ian McKellen), to a burial site in London reputedly connected with the crusades. The supporting cast includes Jean Reno and Alfred Molina and the story itself is thick with religiosity and controversy, but the end product is really a bit of a damp squib. I think that’s probably because Hanks hasn’t the gravitas to anchor this well enough. Even his looks of panic lack any credible sincerity and there’s precious little by way of chemistry with the adequate Tautou. Bettany does better, he does manage to exude a little of the maniacal zealot and Reno always manages to play the slightly dodgy French cop convincingly but for the most part this is just dialogue heavy with too many clues transcribed straight from the text of Dan Brown’s novel without Ron Howard seeming to remember that this is a visual medium and sometimes it’s more fun for us to be given a few detecting tasks of our own to figure out. It’s long, but that needn’t have mattered had we been more involved in the unravelling of this intriguing mystery. We were not, though, and that makes it a little too ploddingly descriptive for me, sorry."

Worst X-Men movie ever. See rant below:

Not only is the Phoenix storyline butchered, but the script rewrites the personalities of its key characters. Since when were Cyclops, Xavier, and Magneto such assholes? Halle Berry's demand for more screentime basically means she shows up in more scenes. Her character has no arc and often says lines that contradict what she said in previous scenes. Rogue has also turned into a whiny sidenote, part of a shoehorned in love triangle, which is disappointing given that the trilogy started from her perspective.

Throwing in as many mutants as you can on the screen, some with powers that would be good if this were an X-Men spoof, but here it's played for absolute seriousness. It also means every character is essentially one note because there's no time to develop anyone. It certainly doesn't help that the movie carelessly removes or kills off half the team from the previous two films. Instead of shocking me, I'm sitting there never sure who I should be rooting for (except for Wolverine).

X3 hurtles through scene after scene to get from one action set piece to another, and at just 93 minutes, there's never any time to process the plot. Of course the movie has to sequel bait with a final scene that suggests everyone will eventually get their powers back. What a way to render the entire movie pointless.

Lastly, this movie cost $215 million to make. Only about a quarter of that money shows up on the screen. The CGI, green screen, and makeup effects are obvious and look horrible. So the movie looks like crap, tells it's story like crap, and treats it's characters like crap. X3 is crap. || ***A good finale to the original trilogy***  

I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.

The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.

Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.

Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma over taking a cure in order to have human intimacy, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict symbolizing the universal clash of flesh and spirit (id and super-ego), Cyclop's grief and astonishing discovery, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.

On the downside, the big clash on Alcatraz Island feels routine and dull. They should’ve kept the focus on the Dark Phoenix, but the producers probably felt this would take away from the other characters, plus they wanted the clichéd big battle sequence. Nevertheless, there’s enough good here to appreciate.

GRADE: B+ || I'm surprised to see a big drop in average rating for this.

I enjoyed <em>'X-Men: The Last Stand'</em> to be honest. Taking a quick look at some other reviews and it seems to main gripe is how it treats certain characters from the comics, which is fair enough for sure but that doesn't come into play for me as I'm not a comic reader.

I can only judge it as a film and as one I found it suitably entertaining. Hugh Jackman remains the top dog, though at the beginning the way Wolverine acts felt off to me - though that quickly went away. I would've liked if they found a spot for Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), though one of his replacements in Beast (Kelsey Grammer) went down well with me.

From what I read I can understand other people's complaints with this, especially with the aforementioned iffy character treatment, but I gotta be honest and say that I found it to be a good enough watch - even if it is comparatively the weakest entry of the original trilogy.

Based on Dan Millman's hit 1980 book, ""Peaceful Warrior"" (2006) is reminiscent of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" albeit with gymnastics substituting for martial arts.

It's a worthwhile movie but a dad too formulaic and just seems to lack the necessary mojo to pull it out its pedestrian plotting.

Although I enjoyed the constant stream of wisdom that flowed from Nick Nolte's character, ""Socrates,"" the film took a wrong turn with him almost immediately by implying that he had the power to instantaneously levitate 15 feet. From there it gets even weirder. I felt this took away from his character rather than make him more intriguing. Regardless, Nolte does a respectable job in the role and, again, I did enjoy his many gems of wisdom throughout. Some say his philosophies reflects a Buddhist mindset, but I saw Biblical Christianity. For instance:

* The stress on service and humility, i.e. servanthood.

* ""Putting out the trash,"" i.e. putting off the 'old man' (the flesh) and putting on the 'new' (the spirit).

* Random thoughts are not you but they can become you if you embrace them and allow them to control/lead you.

* Joy despite the mundane.

* Discerning the real spirit of others (in the compassionate sense, although sometimes for protection).

* Give to those who ask of you.

* Turning the cheek as one's initial response to antagonism (but, keep in mind, you only have two cheeks, facially speaking).

And much more. These are axioms, universal truths that are true regardless of one's lineage, culture or present belief system. It's this aspect and the character of Socrates that make the film worthwhile.

Other than that, though, the plot mechanics are just too obvious. The viewer's aware of the contrivances just as much as the peripheral actors, who struggle with the material because of it. But the main actors do a splendid job despite these negatives. Speaking of the actors, beauties Amy Smart and Agnes Bruckner are noticeably underused. (I watched the 'deleted scenes' and their screen-time was cut; the fools).

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in the areas of University of California, Berkeley, and USC, Los Angeles.

<em>'Cars'</em> is very good Disney, not quite in the upper echelons of their releases but certainly close. The voice cast do a lot of grand work, while the animation is super. I also like the tension building and set-up of the racing stuff, even if they don't take the overly realistic approach - which is fine.

Owen Wilson is terrific as Lightning McQueen, while Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable Guy give noteworthy performances as Sally and Mater. The rest of the cast are good, including Michael Keaton (Chick Hicks). There's yet another role for John Ratzenberger, who features in a funny end credits gag.

Solid soundtrack, amusing humour and it even has a decent amount of heart to it too. Would recommend. || **A commercial, critical and merchandising success... but with a cliché story.**

When it came out, this movie was publicized and sold like hotcakes. It was a fever. A mania. I was already quite grown up, I didn't feel particularly within the target audience that the film wanted to reach, and I was really exhausted from seeing and hearing about the film everywhere, and on any object that could be sold. So, I sacramentally ignored it and all sequels until today.

What most surprises and delights in this film are the extraordinary visuals and animations, so natural and authentic that it could be said to be real. The production used all the technology that money can buy, and make no mistake about it, there are indeed millions of dollars invested in the film! The racing scenes, on the car track, are particularly magnificent because all the speed and emotion are really conveyed to the scene, and to the audience. The colors and scenery are amazing too, and the soundtrack, while not being anything relatively notable or striking, sounds good and matches the movie. The film features several big names who lent their voices to the characters in the film. Owen Wilson does it flawlessly and Paul Newman and Tony Shalhoub also do a very good job.

Where I really had doubts is in the script. Honestly, it has its quality moments, it's interesting enough that we don't think it's being too childish or being boring. However, it is really a giant cliché: the arrogant and ambitious young man who has to go through a lesson in humility and altruism in order to value others, find love and win the victory he wants. We see this in almost every morally sympathetic movie, with its nuances and differences. This is a problem? Honestly, I think so, that it is not something that favors the film, but it is also not something that should lead us not to see it. || Had no intention to ever see this movie.

Meryl Streep does an excellent job portraying Miranda, while Anne Hathaway matches her as Andrea. Emily Blunt (Emily) is also enjoyable, as is Stanley Tucci (Nigel).

I never, personally, held too much interest in the plot, it does get a little bit repetitive in parts. With that said, thanks to Streep & Co., it's still a film that's definitely worth watching. || ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a smart, stylish film that blends humor with a touch of drama, set against the backdrop of the high-pressure fashion industry. Meryl Streep is magnetic as the commanding Miranda Priestly, delivering a performance that's both intimidating and captivating, while Anne Hathaway shines as the relatable protagonist navigating the chaos of her new role. The movie’s greatest strength lies in its ability to make you reflect on the sacrifices we make in pursuit of success and whether they're truly worth it.

The pacing is well-done, keeping you invested without dragging, and the supporting cast, especially Emily Blunt, adds layers of wit and charm. What stands out is the film's subtle commentary on personal growth, ambition, and staying true to what really matters, all wrapped in sharp dialogue and stunning visuals. It never feels preachy but leaves you thinking about how much of yourself you’re willing to compromise to fit into someone else's definition of success.

While it doesn’t dive too deeply into its themes and follows some predictable beats, the movie more than makes up for it with its entertainment value and heartfelt moments. It's a fun, engaging watch with enough substance to leave a lasting impression. Perfect for when you want something light yet meaningful."

When I saw the first “Clerks” movie, I found it quite rude, uninteresting, based on endless and boring dialogues. And I confess that I did not expect anything better here. The film, however, managed to surprise me and give me more than I expected.

The action takes place about ten years after the first film (which is correct, the sequel only appeared ten years after the original) and shows how Dante, the central character of this plot, left his hated convenience store to work in a fast food restaurant. He's still not interested in the job, and hates the place, but he's engaged to a blonde beauty who plans to take him to Florida, where her father is going to give them a home. However, whoever is destined to be a Nobody cannot expect many strokes of luck, and he will, in a single day, throw everything away. Of course, Randal, his old buddy, will take his share of the blame for what happens.

If the first film failed for having no script, just a succession of intelligent but rude and uninteresting dialogues, this film corrected that flaw and gave the characters a decent story. However, decent does not mean good: although this was a great advance, the film has a huge romantic subplot that seems to have been written on a high school, because it works rather poorly and is unconvincing. Another problem with the film is the quality of most of the characters involved because almost all of them are sketchy, one-dimensional, uninteresting and some of them are just clowns who throw us jokes and more jokes worthy of a military barracks or a college dorm.

This leads us to talk about humour! Thought to be the strong point of this film, the comedy is based on scatological, sexual and unhygienic humour. Jokes about poor hygiene in a restaurant or bestiality or several other sexual practices flow freely and abundantly, like a flood in a sewer after a storm. There are also references to other films (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars…), most of which not very complimentary. Anyway! This humor is not only rude, but also stupid.

The actors from the previous film (Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith) are back for the characters they already know and to do again what they had already done. The big improvement is really from O'Halloran, who showed a better job and talent to do something more challenging and competent. But it's Rosario Dawson who deserves the most attention: her character is convincing, likable and smarter than the rest, while still being funny when she wants to be (brain and humor go hand in hand, take note, director Kevin Smith). Ben Affleck also appears here, in a short, uninteresting and forgettable cameo. Truly pitiful is Trevor Fehrman's performance… he wasn't an actor, he didn't go beyond the most pathetic silliness."

Night Shyamalan,"fortune teller, religion and supernatural, hell, mythical creature, swimming pool, nixe, super power, aftercreditsstinger, sign languages, optimistic","HECK YEAH BICEP MAN || _**Moving magical tale at an apartment complex in Philadelphia**_

A superintendent at an apartment building in a suburb of Philadelphia (Paul Giamatti) discovers an innocent redhead in the pool (Bryce Dallas Howard) who needs the assistance of several tenants to escape the creatures that threaten her and her mission.  

""Lady in the Water"" (2006) is a drama/fantasy based on a bedtime story that writer/director M. Night Shyamalan told his kids. Like most Shyamalan pictures there’s a moving reverent ambiance amidst the amusing and sometimes horrific dramatics. It’s very original, coming across as a Shyamalan flick mixed with elements of fantasy movies, like “The Wizard of Oz” (1939). Think about it, “The Wizard of Oz” meshed a family drama with a dreamlike fantasy involving wonder, humor and slight horror along with a profound message, and so does this film (which isn’t to say it’s as effective as “Wizard”).  

The set of the apartment complex and the cinematography thereof combined with James Newton Howard’s score are all superb. Plus there are some amusing moments, like with the dour film critic (Bob Balaban). Similar to “Signs” (2002), there’s a good theme about coming to grips with tragedy and moving on with a newfound sense of purpose. Moreover, Bryce is very appealing as the naïve fantasy creature and the movie leaves you with a warm feeling.

On the negative side, the somewhat convoluted fable will be less than compelling for certain viewers and some critics understandably complained that it was a mistake for Shyamalan to cast himself as the writer whose words are the seeds to changing the world, although it didn’t bother me; I think he’s perfect for the role. Still, M. Night casting himself as the savior of the freakin’ planet is a tad pretentious.

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Levittown, Pennsylvania, a suburb northeast of Philadelphia.

And then I spent the majority of the time watching this and wondering how much money people in Japan spend on front end alignments and that was about as challenging as the movie got for me.  Otherwise it was pretty paint by numbers from start to finish.

But hey, the colors popped."

Superman returns to Earth after five years trying to find out what happened to his homeworld. As Clark Kent he gets his job back at the Daily Planet newspaper, but finds out Lois Lane has moved on without him -- having a live-in fiancé and a five-year-old child, not to mention winning a Pulitzer for her article ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."" Meanwhile Lex Luthor and his henchmen discover Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steal some of the alien crystals. Luthor's mad scheme is to create a new continent, killing billions of people in the process.

The story is a superhero retelling of the Christ story:

- Jor-el gives his only son to protect (save) humankind. 
- Superman repeatedly states that he's everywhere and will always be around (i.e. omnipresent). 
- Luthor and his henchmen's beating of Supes is reminiscent of Christ's beating before his crucifixion. 
- Superman sacrifices himself to save humanity from Luthor's new continent. 
- When superman ""dies"" above the atmosphere of Earth he is shown in a cross posture.

Meanwhile Lois Lane is an obvious type of atheism. Although she once believed in and even loved Superman, she's now convinced the world doesn't really need him. She's obviously unhappy and bitter; she lacks the pizazz she had when she once believed.

Of course, all this heavy symbolism is useless if the story itself fails to capture the viewer's attention. This is especially vital when the picture runs 2 hours and 34 minutes. 

The film definitely has an epic vibe to it, even more so than the first in the series. It seems more serious, i.e. less campy, especially where Luthor and his team are concerned. The film also possesses an imperceptible reverent quality. Even though the whole Superman mythos is totally absurd, the film somehow enables the viewer to accept it as real. On top of all this there are numerous humorous bits, which are laugh-out-loud funny (watch out for the hilarious ""It's a bird,"" ""It's a plane"" piece).

Other things worth commenting on:

- Some complain that Kate Bosworth lacks charisma as Lois Lane, but this all fits into the bitter ""I no longer believe"" subplot. Bosworth is fine in the role. 
- Some complain about Superman's 5-year visit to Krypton. What's the problem? Part of my youth was spent in Minneapolis and I've gone back there numerous times to quell my curiosity. Why wouldn't Superman feel the same way? Why was he gone so long and why did he need a crystalized craft? Because he was potentially exposing himself to large amounts of Kryptonite (radioactive pieces of his homeworld) which would severely weaken him, not to mention he gets his powers from the Earth's sun. 
- Some complain about Lois' fiancé and her son, the latter of whom may or may not be the offspring of Supes. Wouldn't it be natural for Lois to move on after about two years waiting? Her ""shacking up"" before marriage can be attributed to her new ""I no longer believe"" mentality. 
- Love is a strong theme here as is fitting for any retelling of the Christ story. Superman loves Lois and vice versa, even though Lois is initially in denial. Love gives life and saves from death. 
- I liked the fact that Lois' fiancé, Richard (Marsden), isn't made out to be a villain. Interestingly, Lois picked a man who, as a pilot, could fly her around like Supes, albeit less spectacularly. I also like the fact that the film shows Lois being faithful to Richard even though she discovers she still loves Superman. The human heart is capable of loving more than one person, but can only be faithful or committed to one, if you know what I mean. 
- Frank Langella is his usual charismatic self as Perry White. 
- Kevin Spacey is excellent as Luthor and arguably superior to Hackman; this is especially evident as the story progresses. His larger-than-life lunatic scheme is truly fitting for Supe's main foe. 
- There are numerous dramatic parts where the film takes its time to tell the story; there's obviously no rush to get to the next CGI action scene. Those with ADD beware. Needless to say, this is a film for adults even though kids will enjoy many aspects. 
- ""Superman Returns"" was one of the most expensive films ever made at $209 million but made most of it back in North America ($200 million) while almost doubling it worldwide ($392 million). What's strange is studio heads were disappointed with these numbers, claiming it should have made $500 million.

BOTTOM LINE: I was surprised to discover how good ""Superman Returns"" is. This is an epic and moving superhero film; sci-fi/fantasy at its best. Is it as good or better than the best superhero films? Not only is it as good, it's deeper.

GRADE: A- || The light to show the way. 

After a five year hiatus, Superman returns to Earth to find that Lois Lane is now a soon to be married mother, but some things don't change, loony Lex Luthor is loose and his latest plan will kill billions of people.

I first reviewed Superman Returns some two years after its initial release, I had first caught it on release back in 2006 and was really taken with Bryan Singer's approach to a subject he clearly loves. I was awash with nostalgic fervour back then and the moment the theme tune kicked in (great move by Singer to use the John Williams original) I was grinning like a Cheshire cat, yet it seemed I was in a minority back then as regards the film's worth, and with each passing year I find I still am.

Superman Returns will forever be known as the franchise entry that has too much heart, because it finds Singer giving Superman emotional fortitude and, crucially, making it the heart of the story. Those that purely wanted a big colourful popcorn explosion will forever be unfulfilled it seems. Yet it has to be said that fans of Singer's work (such as I) totally get the emotionally heavy approach he has taken, watching Superman shred himself after learning of Lois' love for another, makes for compulsive viewing. Because our man of steel is conflicted, not only with his sense of protective being, but also in the rigours of love, it's this conflict of Superman that drives the film on. Not to say that there isn't any action here, though, in fact some of the sequences here are truly exhilarating. Oh yes, the popcorn crowd are well catered for, planes, space shuttles and a tension filled helicopter, all figure in and around Superman and Luthor's world.

Brandon Routh dons the cape worn so brilliantly by Christopher Reeve in the 70s, and smartly Routh takes the route of ""if it isn't broke then don't fix it"", there's no need to put ones own stamp on a character already so well defined and well loved. Looking like Reeve, and playing out uncannily like him, Routh studied Reeve's performances to get as close to the Reeve incarnation as he could, and he gets it down pat whilst adding a bit of brooding honesty into the mix. Kate Bosworth gets to be Lois Lane, it's a very solid and controlled performance that would have seen her as a shoe in for the role again if Singer had of taken the reins for a sequel. Taking up the role of Lex Luthor, and clearly having a great time, is Kevin Spacey, this is a more clever Luthor incarnation, it's spiteful and devoid of campery. While along for the ride as Luthor's moll is Parker Posey, she's sparky with a hint of devilish sexiness.

Bryan Singer reinvigorated the Superman franchise, and in doing so brought a new verve to the characterisation of an American icon. It has proved to be divisive amongst the fans and critics alike, so much so that Singer has left the Superman world. But viewing it even now brings many rewards, it is a damn fine Superman movie. You can never have too much heart at your film's core, that is as long as one remembers what made prior efforts work in the first place, Singer did to my mind fuse both very admirably indeed. 8/10 || <em>'Superman Returns'</em> brings an ounce of life back into the series, at least when compared to the prior three installments, but unfortunately overall it's disappointing. For such an overlong run time, I feel like nothing actually happens in this either. I doubt I'll remember it.

Brandon Routh is decent as the title character, I don't have any notable positives about his performance but then I don't hold any negatives about him either. The same can be said about the rest of the cast to be honest, Kevin Spacey plays a bad guy well (barely acting, some may say).

It's better than <em>'Superman III'</em>, which I guess is one of the reasons for this to even exist; given it ignores events from that film onwards. For me, whilst it's not out and out bad, I didn't get anything noteworthy from this 2006 flick."

Macy and Joe Mantegna, not least because there’s a good chance it’s a David Mamet film. Mantegna appears briefly in Edmond, adapted by Mamet from his one-act play and directed by Stuart Gordon, but his intervention is key.

Edmond Burke (Macy) encounters Mantegna’s character in a bar, and after the two bond over their shared racism, the latter gives the former a card with the address of a nightclub, but which Edmond momentarily sees as a Tarot card: the Hierophant.

This is ironic because the Hierophant is believed to bring religious worshipers into the presence of what is sacred, and in The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck it represents conformity to social norms or a deference to the established moral and social order, being a guide to knowledge, perception and wisdom.

Thus, in the Apollonian guise of the Hierophant, Mantegna is actually a Dionysian agent, gently nudging Edmond toward the profane and immoral, and into an downward spiral of hatred, ignorance, and crime.

The protagonist’s name is equally ironic. Edmond is related to Edmundi, which itself is derived from the Old English ēad, meaning “prosperity” or “riches”, and mund, meaning “protector.”

During the course of this fateful night, however, we see Edmond haggling fruitlessly with prostitutes, and generally illustrating the proverb 'a fool and his money are soon parted.' Additionally, more than a protector, Edmond becomes someone to be protected from.

Edmond is an utterly vile and despicable being, concerned exclusively with sex and money — specifically how much of the latter he's willing to part with in exchange for the former (Macy's performance is notable for making Edmond a human scum without entirely repelling us; his company is abhorrent and at the same time fascinating).

His victims are not shown in a much more positive light, though; they are no better than Edmond, only slightly less bad. For instance, the African-American man that Edmond beats up within an inch of his life, each blow accompanied by a racist slur, tried to mug Edmond whilst pretending to be a pimp.

And when Edmond finally manages to hold sexual congress — ironically with the only woman he approaches who is not a prostitute —, she turns out to be just as intolerant as he is. Edmond nonetheless kills her because she, an aspiring actress, refuses to admit she’s nothing but a glorified waitress.

Gordon and Mamet don't just condemn white male supremacy; they accuse society as a whole — everyone is accountable (although some more than others, and Edmond certainly receives a punishment proportional, not only to his crime, but also to his racism and homophobia); it’s only when Edmond is isolated from that society that Mamet and Gordon denounce, only when he himself severs any tenuous ties that might bind him to the outside world, that he finds some sort of redemption, and learns to love his fellow man — literally as well as figuratively."

Description:
A family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant take a cross-country trip in their VW bus.

Review:
Little Miss Sunshine is a 2006 dramatic comedy that delivers all around. With solid cast that includes Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Abigail Breslin, Steve Carrell an oscar winning performance by Allan Arkin and Bryan Cranston and Dean Norris in Albuquerque pre Breaking Bad and a great script Little Miss Sunshine is a film that I missed when it first came out but glad I got around to it.

Kinnear is the loser husband to Collette's Sheryl and Carell is her gay suicidal brother. Dano plays her quiet son and Arkin the heroine addicted dirty Grampa. Breslin's character Olive qualifies for the Little Miss Sunshine competition and it's a race to beat the clock as the family takes a road trip from Albuquerque to California filled with unexpected surprises and personal revelations.

The films ending solidifies the families bond and leaves us wanting to see hopefully another chapter in the families life down the road. No Pun intended. Little Miss Sunshine is defiantly worth checking out if you have not already or just a rewatch as a reminder of how good it is. || Alan Arkin might have got the Oscar but it's Greg Kinnear who steals this for me. Talk about a pain in the proverbial! He is ""Richard"", a rather pompously self-motivated man who is trying to sell his nine point plan for success to ""Grossmann"" (a fleeting appearance from Bryan Cranston). Meantime, his young daughter ""Olive"" (Abigail Breslin) is continually practising for the eponymous pageant under the aegis of her foul-mouthed, cocaine-snorting, grandfather (Arkin) and beside her whacky brother ""Dwayne"" (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence and hates everyone and everything. He just wants to join the air force. There's also a surprise guest in their home. ""Uncle Frank"" (Steve Carell). Now he's just got out of the ER having tried to kill himself after his student boyfriend dumped him for another Proust-spouting, but wealthier, scholar! At the helm, trying to keep this family from complete self-destruction is ""Sheryl"" (Toni Collette) and that task becomes distinctly more difficult when young ""Oilve"" is awarded a spot in the national finals - in California. Dad can't go, mum can't drive, brother couldn't care less - but ""Olive"" is determined so into a clapped out VW camper-van they all reluctantly pile and off on a mini road trip. This entertainingly addresses plenty of their demons, allows for a little tragedy to galvanise attitudes and ultimately, for me anyway, demonstrates clearly the ghastliness of those hideous ceremonies that stink of precociousness and gushing parental aspiration. The journey on four wheels is as much a metaphor for that being taken by all in their push-start jalopy, and with Kinnear really getting under my fingernails at just about every turn it's a much quirkier and more thought-provoking comedy that leaves very little out of bounds. Collette also looks like she is having some fun as they deliver a pithily delivered script that does entertain (and begs the question: why would she ever have married ""Richard"" in the first place?). Thank heavens for granddad and his musical tastes. Oh, and his porn, too...!"
21631.0,The Fallen Idol,"Phillipe, the son of an ambassador in London, idolizes Baines, his father's butler, a kind of hero in the eyes of the child, whose perception changes when he accidentally discovers the secret that Baines keeps and witnesses the consequences that adults' lies can cause.",The suspense is almost unbearable…,"Drama, Thriller",96.0,1948-09-30,en,7.152,178.0,0.6859,"Ralph Richardson, Michèle Morgan, Sonia Dresdel, Bobby Henrey, Denis O'Dea",Carol Reed,"butler, zoo, embassy, suspicion, witness, kids, adult child friendship","It's a great life if you don't weaken.

The Fallen Idol (AKA: The Lost Illusion) is directed by Carol Reed and adapted to a screenplay by Graham Green from his own short story called The Basement Room. Additional dialogue was scripted by Lesley Storm and William Templeton, the music is by William Alwyn and Georges Périnal is the cinematographer. It stars Ralph Richardson, Bobby Henrey, Michèle Morgan, Sonia Dresdel and Denis O'Dea.

Film is told thru the eyes of Phillipe (Henrey), the young son of a diplomat living at the French Embassy in London. With his parents often away from home, Phillipe has latched onto the family butler, Baines (Richardson), for friendship and guidance. Baines regales the boy with fanciful tales of adventure, but in truth Baines himself is unhappy, stuck in a loveless marriage to the shrewish Mrs. Baines (Dresdel). When Bobby happens upon Baines in the company of a young woman named Julie (Morgan), it thrusts the youngster into a world he doesn't understand, and when a tragedy occurs, Bobby is in danger of shattering the friendship between Baines and himself.

The first of Graham Greene's literary works to be directed by the great Carol Reed, The Fallen Idol took some time to come out of The Third Man's shadow and be heralded in its own right. What transpires over 95 minutes is a tight psychological thriller that leaves a lasting image of childhood confusion, disillusionment and the innocence that's lost. Throw into the mix adult secrets, human conundrums and a gripping mystery investigation at its peak, and it's not hard to see why it's such a well revered picture. It's also a film that thrives on dialogue, again not surprising given that Green himself always said it was the best film adaptation of his work, while some of the deep-focus photography from Périnal adds real atmosphere to the proceedings. 

Richardson is superb, and he leads a hugely effective cast, where Dresdel is scarily witch like and Henrey, plucked from nowhere to star as the naive boy, paints an indelible portrait of a child struggling to comprehend the mysterious world of the adults around him. In support there is quality thespians such as Bernard Lee and Jack Hawkins. The ending is notably different to that in the original story, and no doubt about it, the original ending would have garnered a different reaction from many. But Greene was happy to change his own source for the screen, so if it's good enough for him then it surely is good enough for us? Certainly time has been kind to The Fallen Idol, it's Hitchcockian feel blended with literary smarts has made it a lasting favourite of critics and fans alike. 8.5/10 || “Phillipe” (Bobby Henrey) lives a privileged life as the young son of an ambassador, but he frequently finds himself neglected and dependent on the friendship of their butler “Baines” (Sir Ralph Richardson) who helps keep him occupied. With his father away on his latest trip, the youngster discovers his friend having tea with a woman he calls his niece. Whilst we can appreciate quite clearly that “Julie” (Michèle Morgan) is a little more than that, “Phillipe” is too young and is quite excited to be sworn to secrecy so “Mrs. Baines” (Sonia Dresdel) doesn’t learn of their meeting. Back at the embassy, “Mrs. Baines” proves to be quite a suspicious character and sets a bit of a trap that ends up tragically involving the police and tests of loyalty all around. It’s quite a simple story, this one, but the performances from Sir Ralph and from the young Henrey work really well. Their characterisations are gentle, as I found usually the case with the older man, and their almost paternal and trusting rapport is well portrayed as the dangers of secrets and lies are exposed quite potently. The detection element from Denis O’Dea at the conclusion - accompanied by Jack Hawkins - is a little rushed but this is still a poignant tale of trust and affection that’s worth a watch."

Abu Abdullah has two children, one of whom is called Youssef, and he is very good at shooting a gun. What happened was not taken into account, which is that Youssef and his older brother wanted to conduct an experiment to see if the rifle could be used for long distances, and one of the rifle bullets hit an American tourist by mistake, and America considered it an act of terrorism. This is the summary.

I felt that I was spinning in three continents when the director was changing between one shot and the other, so the film would go from one continent to another. Giving the Japanese tourist the gun to Hassan Al-Maghribi changed the fates of the attitudes of people and countries, so America went to consider the shooting incident of the American tourist as a terrorist act, despite The smoothness of events.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._ || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend, especially for a bad movie night.

For such a horrible premise, this actually holds up pretty well.  It's a bad movie, but it's still pretty entertaining.  The snakes almost have the same behavior / pacing as a ""blob"", slowly seeping through the plane and over taking people bit by bit.

Without a veteran actors like Samuel L. Jackson or Kenan Thompson to hold things together this could have easily fallen apart in a much worse way.

The ""realism"" is certainly not a concern.  While pheromones are a thing that can incite some behaviors, snakes aren't loyal to each other, especially different species.  Once you accept the initial scenario, every ridiculous thing that happens is funny, and the tension is up just because you have no idea where the snakes are coming from at any time, and the knowledge that the entire setting could just fall out of the sky, even if enough people survive the snakes it could all end with a crash.

There is likely a truly good version of this movie we could get, but for now, making fun of this one should be a good time."
512.0,Scoop,"An American journalism student in London scoops a big story, and begins an affair with an aristocrat as the incident unfurls.",The perfect man. The perfect story. The perfect murder.,"Comedy, Mystery",96.0,2006-07-27,en,6.592,1662.0,2.4937,"Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Charles Dance","Woody Allen, Woody Allen","daughter, newspaper, journalist, prostitute, drowning, funeral, upper class, afterlife, magic, tarot cards, suspicion of murder, investigation, music instrument, magic show, lordship, headline, swimming pool, wealth, murder, american, united kingdom","***Enjoyable mystery/comedy with Scarlett Johansson***  

""Scoop"" (2006) is a mystery/dramedy/romance written and directed by Woody Allen. Scarlett Johansson stars as Sondra Pransky, a geeky college journalist vacationing in England. She gets a tip from the ghost of a dead newsman (Ian McShane) on the identity of a local serial killer and proceeds to partner with bumbling magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen); the tip leads them to the rich son of a prominent lord, Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), whom Sondra starts to date to acquire information. Is Lyman the notorious killer or isn't he? 

Although fantastical and somewhat goofy, ""Scoop"" is first and foremost a mystery and I did enjoy trying to figure out if Peter Lyman is the ""Tarot Card killer."" In the story we perceive Peter Lyman largely through the lens of Sondra, who is falling for the guy; hence, the viewer warms up to him.

""Scoop"" is a comedy but not in the laugh-out-loud sense of, say, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective""; it's mildly amusing, witty and fun but not knee-slapping funny. So if you're looking for the latter don't bother.

The three stars and their chemistry are a highlight. I enjoyed the team-up of Woody (Sid) & Scarlett (Sondra) and their surrogate father/daughter relationship. I knew when I saw ""The Horse Whisperer"" that Scarlett would grow up to be one of cinema's leading beauties, and so she is! Scarlett was 21 while filming ""Scoop"" and the film is worth catching solely for her; just don't expect any raunch or t&a exploitation (although she does have a one-piece bathing suit scene and a nightie sequence, which are rather modest).

Hugh Jackman is a great modern masculine actor, of course, and he does fine here, although I couldn't help wondering if long metal claws would suddenly shoot out of his knuckles! 

""Scoop"" is an enjoyable mystery/dramedy highlighted by refreshing originality, a quality cast with good chemistry and English locations. I admit that I didn't think I'd like the film during the first 25 minutes or so, but then I caught on to the movie’s vibe. The interactions between the three main characters, their story and the mounting mystery pulled me in and glued me until the end. I also enjoyed the creative zany elements (e.g. crossing the River Styx with the Grim Reaper and the reappearing ghost reporter) and the film's overall refreshing air. 

The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in London & the English countryside.

What are you made of?

Night at the Museum is directed by Shaun Levy and jointly written by Robert Ben Garant & Thomas Lennon who adapt from the book by Milan Trenc. It stars Ben Stiller, Carla Gugino, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs, Ricky Gervais, Robin Williams, Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan. Plot sees Stiller as a newly recruited night security guard at the Museum of Natural History, who discovers that an ancient curse causes the animals and exhibits on display to come to life and wreak havoc. 

Not really one night at the museum, but three nights, it's a film that's enjoyable enough if expectation is set at the level for standard family action/comedy fare. All the elements for such are within, protagonist with something to prove to his son, magical animals and historical characters coming to life; and of course the general malarkey that comes with such a premise. Trouble is is that the premise is stronger than the execution. Sure it's energetic and Stiller makes for a likable loser-cum-hero type, and the effects will no doubt dazzle the kids, but it comes over as an excuse for the latter. Is it fun? Yes, yes it is, when it's in flow, but it does grow tiresome towards the run in and the pay off is as formulaic as it gets. It garnered enough coin to warrant a sequel, something that firms up the belief that the market for action/adventure/family movies is currently starved of portions.

It's hoped that better directors, and better films, are forthcoming in this genre, so as to show the latest generation of fun seekers that efforts such as this are not high points. 6/10 || ""Daley"" (Ben Stiller) is struggling to find a job that will allow him to keep his apartment and in contact with his young son ""Nick"" (Jake Cherry). Even the job finders have given up on him until, that is, there is a potential opening as a night watchman at the Museum of Natural History. His application is presented to the ostensibly kindly old ""Cecil"" (Dick Van Dyke) and his two cohorts ""Gus"" (Mickey Rooney) and ""Reginald"" (Bill Cobbs) and he gets the job! First night, doing his rounds, all fine until things start to move, to come alive, to chase him, attack him - he's terrified! His colleagues arrive for work in the morning and alert him to a few, now rather obvious, facts and next night he has to try and assert himself with his congregation of native Americans, Roman legionaries, megalomaniacs, dinosaurs, lions - yep, just about everything that you might expect to find in a museum like this. He's making progress - discipline is creeping in as he manages to manage his charges a little better each evening. He even feels confident enough to introduce them all to his lad. The scene is set, the lights are dimmed, and the time comes - but on this night there is nothing. They remain statuesque. What's occurring? Well that's where the mystery and a wee bit of comedy bring this amiable film towards it's denouement. Shawn Levy has assembled a decent cast for this Ben Stiller vehicle. The humour is gentle with some ""creative"" history interwoven into the characterisations of Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams), curator ""McPhee"" (Ricky Gervais) and of course the three mischievous co-wardens. It's a smashing advertisement for just what museums can show us and if it encourages kids to go explore our past, then it will probably have done a more memorable job than the film itself ever will - but it's still an enjoyable enough watch."

However, there is always an exception to the rule. Usually that exception comes in the form of a supporting role... as in Old School... but here it comes in the form of a leading role.

It seems like Marc Forster really reigned him in on the one and the pay off was AMAZING. It's seriously a funny and quirky film. It's hysterical and kind of plays to an audience that wonders if writer's creations can come to life.

It's an imaginative script and plays to the people that feel, maybe, a little guilty for leaving a book over night when the characters are left in a bad position just in case they are real and might get stuck there. It appeals to anyone that has ever wrote fiction, and felt like a God because of the control they had over their characters... and it does so in the most ridiculous way possible."

Indeed, British magazine Radio Times reviewed Crank and called it a violent and vulgar distraction, maybe so if you be a little prudish and timid of stomach for high octane thrills. Crank is utterly bonkers fun, and it knows it, star Jason Statham knows it, directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor know it, and quite frankly any action movie junkie fan knows it.

The tongue is planted so firmly into cheek it is in danger of breaking skin, it's a film that lives to take you on a most improbable thrill ride and succeeds admirably in doing so. Plot is kind of incidental, but Statham has been injected with a Chinese drug that will kill him if his adrenalin levels drop. So off he goes in search of vengeance and maybe an antidote? He runs, he jumps, he snorts drugs, has sex with Amy Smart in public, rides a motorbike like Evel Knievel, flashes his arse a lot and gets a major league erection.

He, much like the film, never pauses for breath, it's all very breakneck and kinetic.

Jason Statham and Wesley Snipes deliver solid performances, but the lack of character buildup early on means you don’t get too attached to anyone. The movie jumps straight into action, which might please some but leaves others craving more depth. One thing that stands out, though, is Trevor Jones’ score, especially ""Incident on Pearl Street Bridge."" It perfectly captures the tension and betrayal in the story and has a haunting orchestral vibe that sticks with you.

The cinematography deserves a shoutout, particularly the wide city shots that feel grounded and real. Unlike the overdone CGI cities in so many films today, this one immerses you in the setting, giving the movie an authentic edge. The chaos theory references are a smart touch, blending intelligence with action, though the execution isn’t always as tight as it could be. Fans of straightforward action might find the twists excessive, but there’s no denying the script had some clever moments.

While the last act banks heavily on its big twist, it stretches the reveal a bit too far, sacrificing some depth that could’ve made the finale more satisfying. Still, if you enjoy crime thrillers with a mix of grit, betrayal, and brainy concepts, Chaos might be worth a watch. Just don’t expect it to blow your mind.

Well I can add The Night Listener to my list of films that I believe are criminally undervalued. I be genuinely surprised to see this finely crafted tale rated below 6 on some internet movie sites. Is it just the Robin Williams haters dragging this smart film down? Or perhaps it's kids who don't quite understand a film about the complex and eerie nature of the fragile human condition? Either way this film delivers something outside of the norm, something for those to seek out who require a break from the hum drum of the spoon fed Hollywood masses. 

Boasting the ever reliable and undervalued talent of Robin Williams (gusto without histrionics), and the considerable brilliance of Toni Collette, the film delivers a dark look at the yearning for love in some form or another, at the gullibility of those in need of something, making this film is a smart and intriguing nights entertainment. All those interested in the film should seek out the true story it's based on, that of the Anthony Godby Johnson affair, itself an eerie slice of human mystery.

This wouldn't be out of place on Hitchcock's CV, and tomorrow when I'm taking on the challenges of another working class day, this film will be at the forefront of my mind - because it did its job handsomely.

Danish priest Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen) is both jobian and quixotic (the costume department deserves a pat on the back for making him look, in his priestly garb, like the subject, thought to be Cervantes, of a portrait attributed to Juan de Jáuregui), his insanity the only thing that makes his crappy life bearable. In a stroke of genius, the film explains Ivan’s pollyannish disposition with the pythonesque “Ravashi Syndrome” (“Ravashi was an Indian footballer who lost both feet in a go-karting accident in 1957. In shock from the accident he ran home on the stumps of his legs. His brain blocked out the fact that he had no feet. For two months he went to practice. He kept his midfield position”; “With no feet?”; “It was a bad team. They were in the fifth division or something like that”).

Mikkelsen is pitch-perfect as the clueless Ivan, deadpanning his way through outlandish dialogue and somehow making it sound earnest (in one the film’s funniest moments, he tells the titular Adam – a neo-nazi sent to Ivan’s rehabilitation program for parolees –, in reference to a picture of Hitler: “handsome man. Is he your father?”). Ulrich Thomsen is also very effective as the perplexed and ambivalent Adam, of whom Ivan brings out the best and the worst – for example, taking Ivan to the hospital every time Adam beats the crap out of him.

In general, Ivan takes more physical punishment than any normal human being could survive, but then we’re not meant to take the movie literally (making it easier to laugh at the character’s sundry hardships and tribulations). Like the biblical book from which it draws inspiration, Adam’s Apples is a parable, though not of the ‘in God we trust’ variety.

It'd be tempting to dismiss Ivan as a victim of fanaticism if the filmmakers didn't offset him with the equally fanatical Adam. It’s clear that Ivan's pathological faith is not the answer to life’s problems, but the solution does not lie in Adam’s misanthropic nihilism either. The ideal is to find common ground, which Ivan and Adam do when they visit and comfort a dying old man haunted by the memory of his days as a guard in a concentration camp. || What a strange film... a very good one, mind you.

The cast do great work in this 2005 release. Mads Mikkelsen being the obvious standout - top performance! Ulrich Thomsen doesn't really do all that much necessarily, yet still manages to make a big impact with his showing - amusing, by the way, how much hair can change the way you see someone, that ending is quite the mild cranium contort*!

I'm not really all that sold on what the film attempts to tell, but I can't deny that I had a pleasant time watching it all unfold. I wouldn't actually say it features that strong humour, perhaps some of it was lost in translation (Viaplay's subs were iffy in patches), but all that's there is enough. There is one joke at the death that is probably one of the most insulting, hitting both racist and ableist, that I've ever heard - black comedy, I know, I know.

Aside from all that, final notes: sound and cinematography - super atmospheric in parts. Would I recommend 2005's <em>'Adam’s Apples'</em>? Ja.

I've watch this movie so many times, and it's probably one of my favorite movies.  With the ridiculous premise that you have to go to college, what happens to the qualified people that don't get in: they make their own way, literally.

Just the concept of doing something like this is fascinating, and with the cast, the delivery is amazing: Justin Long, Blake Lively, Maria Thayer, (fat) Jonah Hill, Lewis Black, and even a young Hannah Marx.

The jokes are paced so well, and there is some noticeable punch up, but it's usually so good I don't mind.   Part of the reason I like this writing is that a lot of it is character based: just making weird and fun characters and making them live in this fun world.  So many of the scenes have background action happening, which is risky, but the pay off is magnificent.

On top of that, there are sub-arcs, and a great grand arc all about inclusivity and innovation.

Watch this, I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed."

Robert Wise's Born to Kill has never been one of my favorite noirs. It regularly tops ""best of"" lists, and many film noir enthusiasts whom I respect love it, so I was hoping a fresh viewing would reveal something new to me.

Alas, for me it was still the same old flick. It's an enjoyable picture, but it's wildly melodramatic, there are subplots that never really go anywhere, and its over-the-top characters are mostly two-dimensional. The key to a great noir, like Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944), is the sense that it could happen to you, or to someone you know. No matter how outlandish the schemes in a film are, if they're carried out by believable characters then I'm usually able to go along for the ride without asking too many questions.

Born to Kill tells the tale of a pair of sociopathic social climbers, the recently divorced Helen Brent (Claire Trevor) and the recently paroled Sam Wild (Lawrence Tierney). Their paths cross in Reno, the biggest little city in the world. Helen is there for a quickie divorce and Sam is there with his reedy little sidekick, Mart Waterman (Elisha Cook Jr.). Helen is staying at a boarding house run by the slovenly Mrs. Kraft (Esther Howard), who, when we first see her, is getting lit up on beer in the middle of the afternoon with the adenoidal tart Laury Palmer (Isabel Jewell).

After Laury goes on a date with dapper Danny Jaden (Tony Barrett) just to make the big lug she's dating jealous, she invites Danny inside for a nightcap. When Danny goes to the kitchen, he finds Laury's big lug waiting for him. It's Sam Wild, of course, and his brutal killing of both Danny and Laury is the film's high point. (Or the lurid low point, if you're a prissy scold.) The sound of crickets in the background, the neatly manicured suburban lawns surrounding Mrs. Kraft's boarding house, the dog barking in the background, and the uptempo swing music playing on the radio in the kitchen all lend a sense of immediacy and familiarity to the murder.

The rest of the film, however, just doesn't hang together for me. Sam's little buddy Mart tells him, ""You can't just go around killing people whenever the notion strikes you. It just ain't feasible."" I feel the same way about the plot of Born to Kill. It just ain't feasible.

After the murder, Sam blows town. He and Helen meet again on the train to San Francisco. When they disembark, Sam suggests splitting a cab, but Helen tells him she's going in a different direction. He responds, ""That's where you're wrong. We're going in the same direction, you and I.""


Sam insinuates himself into Helen's life. They are clearly drawn to each other, but she tells him that nothing in the world will stop her from marrying her fiancé, Fred Grover (Phillip Terry). So Sam moves in on her sister, wealthy heiress Georgia Staples (Audrey Long), or, to be more precise, her foster sister, as Helen bitterly reveals to Sam. Not only is Georgia a beautiful blonde, but — as Sam tells Mart — ""Marrying into this crowd will make it so's I can spit in anyone's eye.""

Meanwhile, back in Reno, Mrs. Kraft retains the services of a sleazy, corpulent private investigator named Matthew Albert Arnett (Walter Slezak). Mrs. Kraft is played by Esther Howard, and her bizarre, bug-eyed performance in this film is nearly identical to the ""Filthy Flora"" character she played in Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946).

Helen and Sam pursue their doomed, twisted love affair.
""Fred is peace and security,"" Helen moans.
""You, you're strength, excitement, and depravity. You've a kind of corruption inside of you, Sam.""
Arnett sniffs around. Sam and Georgia quarrel after she refuses to let him run her family's business. Mart Waterman shows up in San Francisco and starts living with the unhappy foursome. (Is he Sam's partner or his secret lover? The film is never completely clear.) Slowly but surely, the plot threads of the film intertwine, culminating in an orgy of murder and betrayal.

This is the second or third time I've seen Born to Kill. While I've griped about the ridiculously melodramatic plot, maybe I just want it to be something it's not. I could certainly see myself watching it again in the future and loving its over-the-top characters, unrealistic scenarios, grotesque supporting players, and generally high level of camp.

I think my biggest problem with Born to Kill is the relationship between Sam and Helen. Claire Trevor is a wonderful performer, but I was never able to accept that she'd love Sam enough to give up everything for him. Helen's histrionics in her scenes in tastefully appointed drawing rooms with Fred, Georgia, and Sam seem more scripted than natural, and Claire Trevor's performance as Helen seems too intelligent and composed for the debased character she's playing.

But maybe that's the point. Lawrence Tierney is a powerful presence, but he isn't a particularly gifted actor, especially when either subtlety or range is called for. Not only does Sam Wild commit murder whenever the notion strikes him, he can bend others to his will, getting his friend Mart to kill for him and getting Helen to provide him with an alibi for murder at the drop of a hat. He's a brutal alpha male, and loving him may go against all reason and sense, but that never stopped anybody before.

Born to Kill is directed by Robert Wise with vigor. The cinematography, by Robert de Grasse, is great, especially in the nighttime exteriors. Paul Sawtell's music is exciting. I found the plot ridiculous, but that shouldn't stop any noir fans who haven't seen Born to Kill from seeking it out.




Written by Adam Lounsbery || Turnip Man and Iceberg Woman.

Lady of Deceit (AKA: Born to Kill) is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Eve Greene and Richard Macaulay from the novel Deadlier than the Male written by James Gunn. It stars Claire Trevor, Lawrence Tierney, Walter Slezak, Elisha Cook Jr., Audrey Long, Isabel Jewell and Esther Howard. Music is by Paul Sawtell and cinematography by Robert De Grasse.

Trevor plays conniving divorcée Helen Brent, who risks her chances at the wealth and security she craves with the man she doesn't love by falling for hotheaded murderer Sam Wild (Tierney), who, with his own agenda, is soon to marry her foster sister.

I wouldn't trade places with you if they sliced me into little pieces.

Hard-bitten noir of some substance that pits two of noir's most unlikable characters against each other. Tierney's psychotic machismo and Trevor's calculating sex-bomb go head to head in a deliriously distorted romance that will only go one way once their inner pursuit of glory comes to the fore.

And he who falls beneath her spell has need of God's mercy.

The plot is a bit hard to take, but when in noirville it sometimes helps to stop off for a bite to eat at the fantastique café. It's a grim tale of pathological persons and it's superbly directed by Wise in what was his first foray into straight edged film noir. Slezak adds some seedy quality as a bible quoting P.I., Cook Junior does what he does best and Jewell inputs the naive sexy glamour.

Voluptuous violence and mad love in the shadows. Hooray! 8/10"

I was completely amazed by how this film was good. The actors all played there role very well. The film has a very good storyline and I was compelled to watch it. All in all a great movie, worth watching. || Life and death. Space and time. Fate and chance. Theses are the forces of the universe. 

The Illusionist is directed by Neil Burger and Burger adapts the screenplay from ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"" written by Steven Millhauser. It stars Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell. Music is by Philip Glass and cinematography by Dick Pope.

How splendid, a period romantic mystery that's filled with the mysticism of magical conjurings and political volatility. Plot essentially has Norton as Eisenheim The Illusionist, who later in life runs into Sophie (Biel), his childhood sweetheart, and finds that she's on course to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell). Leopold has a bad reputation and it's not long before Eisenheim comes under Leopold's disdain, forcing Eisenheim to try and pull off the ultimate magic act to save Sophie and himself.

Creator Neil Burger crafts a picture that has everything going for it. The story is rock solid with intrigue credentials, where appropriately for a story based around magic tricks nothing is ever as it seems. The period flavours are smartly assembled, the Czech Republic locations smartly standing in for turn of the century Vienna, the art production is on point with the era of setting, as is the costuming. Glass drifts a tender melancholic score over the piece, while Pope's cinematography is simply gorgeous, offering up colour lensing that's aura enhancing, the kind you could get lost in for days.

The magic tricks are beguiling, as they should be and are in fact required since the narrative tantalisingly suggests Eisenheim may have supernatural powers? The story itself has no historical worth, but is fascinating none the less. It all builds towards its revelations, and much hinges on if the pay off is worth the admission fee? Most assuredly so it is, even if from a personal point of view this writer wouldn't have minded if pic had finished five minutes before the final revelation. 

Either way, and with smart acting (Giamatti as the police inspector standing out) without histrionics holding things at the top end, this is delicate film making that engages the emotions fully for entertainment rewards. 8/10 || Seen this movie several times over the years and still find it so entertaining and satisfying thanks in large part to Edward Norton's performance.

Mr Blair (Michael Shannon) has only just been elected and together with his pretty openly hostile (to the monarchy) wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) heads to the palace for his appointment audience. When the tragedy does ensue, the Royal Family are at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire and the remainder of this film - intercut with occassional news actuality - postulates on just how the relationship between the prime minister and his Sovereign might have played out in the face of the growing and totally irrational public outpourings of grief and frustrations following the accident. Mirren and Shannon are both on great form here and even if the former is more of a mimic than an actress with this part, she still imbues enough characterisation for us to accept the plausibility that this might just have been the response of the actual Queen Elizabeth. It's beautifully shot and it was nice to see Sylvia Syms on screen again, albeit briefly and again, rather unsympathetically. I can't help but wonder how much of this has become the gospel in many people's eyes as to just how things did happen back in 1997.

The Irish Republican Army (IRA) is a group whose main characteristic is separation, especially from itself; Loach deals with the original breakup, resulting in the first two iterations the IRA, drawing a parallel with the story of two brothers who feel compelled to put ideology before family because each is convinced they bleed greener than the other.

It is said that history repeats itself; first as a tragedy, then as a farce. TWTStB follows this pattern, except that in the end the farce ends up being even more tragic than the tragedy. The first half of the film takes place during the Irish War of Independence, a guerrilla war waged between 1919 and 1921 between the IRA and the British occupation forces in Ireland (which included Irish Unionists and Protestants, in contrast to Catholic Republicans).

The second part takes place during the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) which immediately followed the Anglo-Irish Treaty which resulted in the creation of the Irish Free State. Many of those who fought on both sides of the conflict had been members of the IRA during the War of Independence. The bitter irony is that an English character more or less foretells this when he says: ""God save Ireland if ever the [Irish republicans] take control.""

I'm making it sound like a history class, but TWTStB is far from it; indeed, there is a lesson here, but it is a timeless and universal moral about the fratricidal nature of all wars. Loach and Laverty make their protagonists, Damien (Murphy) and Teddy O'Donovan (Pádraic Delaney) biological brothers to emphasize that all men — Irish and Irish, or even, why not, Irish and English — are brothers and, as As Donne said, ""the death of any man diminishes me"" because ""no man is an island.""

Now, just because their characters are symbolic archetypes doesn't mean that Murphy and Delaney just stand there holding signs that say ""Cain"" and ""Abel""; the former in particular turns in a performance in which we can find shades of Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. || Though quite provocative, I was really disappointed with the anti-British simplicity of this drama. It all centres around two brothers - ""Teddy"" (Pádraic Delaney) and ""Damien"" (Cillian Murphy) and the increasingly desperate - and violent - tactics they employed to eject the occupiers from their country. The latter man is not an instant convert to these activities. About to travel to the UK to be a doctor, it's the thuggish squaddies' brutality that convinces him to stay and join his local IRA branch to fight fire with fire. His war-weary brother, on the other hand, is gradually appreciating the stale-mate nature of the predicament and when a settlement is reached between Dublin and London for the ""Irish Free State"" we find that these siblings are no longer quite on the same side and the conflict turns in on itself. It's not that the British behaved well here, they certainly did not - but the film lacks a key British character to put forward their position. The odious position of Empire, sure, but what, also, of the aspirations of those of a great many Unionists who wanted the status quo and who wanted no truck with the (socialist) republicanism being proposed by ""Damien"" et al. Again, you can see so much of director Ken Loach's own political persuasion here that he makes no attempt to balance or explain the position from the opposing side, and after a while I found it became a bit of a pontificating rant of a film that illustrated well that expression about one man's terrorist being another's freedom fighter. The then all powerful Catholic church has virtually no role at all here. It's beautifully shot and there are plenty of solid and characterful supporting roles, but no - it could have been better had the director been more interested in offering us more of a objective history rather than his own version of history."

We open with a chase that results in a brutal murder, all played out to the wonderful strains of The Small Faces singing ""Itchycoo park,"" it's obvious from this moment that this is no ordinary horror comedy. Comedy as everyone knows is hugely subjective, even more so when it involves horror, some attempts have been roundly accepted such as parody supreme Shaun Of The Dead or nervous titillation in the Evil Dead series, while others are so bad they don't need a mention here. Severance, happily, is as sharp with its humour as one of the knives used in the piece itself, perfectly tuned into the modern world and the bizarreness of it all.

What started out as a working script called ""P45"", where Christopher Smith's film was to be about these ""yuppie"" types literally team building for a weekend where if they didn't pass the tests they lost their jobs, escalated to a slasher with a wry satirical edge. The characters, as the makers point out on the DVD, are the perfect blend of the archetypal office workers. Each of them can readily be found in any Brirtish office on any given day. The ineffective leader who's wormed his way into the position, the jocular wide boy, the creep, the babe attracting all the sexual attention and on it goes. Each character rich with British office traditions thrust together for one bubbling comedy stew.

Enter the central theme of weapons making companies firmly under the microscope and Severance has much to say. As a promo video made by the managing director plays, the irony is absolutely hilarious and sets the film up a treat. Even as the film gets bloody, and it's certainly bloody at times, the smiling assassin nature of the script continues to be bitingly funny. There's reams of clever jokes in the piece, so many in fact that even now after my third viewing experience I'm still finding new stuff. So with that I would urge anyone who has only seen it the one time, and been less than enamoured with the premise, to try again and observe and listen without interruption. 

There's even self mocking of the genre it belongs in, and this from the director of 2004s culter, Creep. The cast are uniformly strong, from Tim McInnerny's weasel team leader portrayal to Danny Dyer's with type drug taking ""cockernee"" boy, all playing off each other with smart and mirth inducing results. A fine fine entry in the horror comedy pantheon, one that just gets better and better with each and every viewing. 9/10"

In the early morning hours of June 16, 1959, George Reeves (Ben Affleck), star of the Adventures of Superman that ran from 1952-1958, is found dead in his Westside Los Angeles bedroom from a gunshot wound to the head. While the official cause of death is listed as suicide, his mother hires a private detective (Adrien Brody) to investigate the possibility of murder. Although it is argued that Reeves had reasons to kill himself due to depression over being typecast and aging issues, several individuals had motive and opportunity to kill him, including ex-girlfriend Toni Mannix (Diane Lane) and her powerful husband, the manager of MGM (Bob Hoskins), as well as Reeves’ fiancé (Robin Tunney). The biggest mystery is why the other three individuals in the house at the time of Reeves’ death waited 45 minutes to notify police. 

“Hollywoodland” (2006) is a crime drama in the neo-noir vein and also a tragic biopic similar to “Auto Focus” (2002), “Mommie Dearest” (1981) and “Changeling” (2008). The only fictional character is Brody’s private eye, but he was based on real-life detective Milo Speriglio. 

The movie effectively details the three different death scenarios with the hint that one is the most likely. But, really, it begins as a mystery and ends as one, which I think is fitting since no one actually knows what happened at this point. In any case, this is a worthy tribute to Reeves and his life in Hollywood during the 50s. After watching, research the case for yourself. 

Also notable on the female front are Caroline Dhavernas as the detective’s girlfriend and Molly Parker as his ex.

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles and the greater Toronto area.

Rafael Cimino","pornography, observer, los angeles, california, neo-noir, murder hunt","I have been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week. 

A box office failure and a neo-noir film that confounded critics and fans alike, The Black Dahlia now appears to be a pic that has had its strengths ignored. As the clamour to kick Brian De Palma continues unabated to this day, and the point blank refusal to accept that Josh Hartnett is a better actor than the likes of Pearl Harbor suggests, it's a film worthy of a revisit by genre/style fans alike. 

Plot revolves around the infamous murder of one Elizabeth Short in Hollywood, 1947. An aspiring actress who was found butchered and her murder to this day remains unsolved. De Palma and his writer Josh Friedman adapt from noir legend James Ellroy's novel of the same name, the crux of the story is about two hot-to-trot detectives who get involved in the Short case, and pretty soon there is a can of worms that has been shaken and opened, and there's dizzying worms everywhere - we think? 

De Palma loves noir, he has dabbled with it for a long time, not all of it works, but often he delivers for like minded cinephiles. With expectation levels high and following in the slipstream of the critical darling that was L.A. Confidential, Black Dahlia never really had a hope of achieving its lofty ambitions, yet it's a tremendously realised picture from a noir stand point. Whilst it showcases the technical wizardry of the director. 

The charges of it being convoluted are fair, it's a spinning narrative, stories within stories, characterisations obtuse, but so was The Big Sleep! I know, I know, this is not fit to lace the boots of Hawks' genius movie, but tricksy narratives have always been a fundamental part of many a film noir, so why the distaste for this one? Especially since the period design, costuming, styling, photography and characterisations are so rich in detail? For instance Hartnett's detective is gumshoe nirvana, while Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank fatale the femme with mischievous glee. 

But of course De Palma then spells it out for the finale, explaining things, a sort of macabre wrap up for those that needed it. Either way he was never going to win, it's too complex, it didn't need spelling out, while Mr. De Palma we have to tell you that your characters have been too cold, we don't feel them?! Huh? This is noirville, a place frequented by bad people, idiots and hapless dreamers, of dupes and double crossers. Hell there's even a suggestion of necrophiliac tendencies in this, and that's before we even delve into the machinations of the two femme fatales, a family that's lacking Adams Family Values and coppers of dubious motives. 

Yeah, it's cold, and yes De Palma is guilty of trying to please all parties by covering all bases, but it's far from being a stinker. Haters of De Palma, Hartnett and complex noir narratives can knock two points off of my own personal rating, otherwise it's 7/10. || OK, I'm in the minority here, but I liked it.

I also like period pieces and I like this period, so...this might be a bit bias.

But it has Scarlett Johansson in it and she is always watchable even when she is at her worst.

And it has Josh Hartnett and I really do like him as well, and I like him in the sort of William Holden sort of he tends to do well when he does a voice over kind of way.

Except he isn't dead in a swimming pool at the start of the film. However, Mia Kirshner is certainly dead at the start of the film and she's one of those actors that usually does a great job despite being constantly over-looked.

What you have is a film VAGUELY about The Black Dahlia, VAGUELY about a couple of buddy cops with a secrete, VAGUELY about a love triangle, and VAGUELY about the period....and that is why it didn't sit well with so many people. It was Vaguely about a lot of things and never exactly about any of them.

However, there is enough mystery to it to hold my attention, enough style to make it cool and fun, and good enough acting to make it believable.

In other words, it still entertains despite the mess. Because of that, 10 out of 10, there is a lot wrong with the film, but ultimately it achieves its goal."

RELEASED IN 2006 and directed by Lucky McKee, ""The Woods"" chronicles events in 1965 New England when a troubled teen (Agnes Bruckner) is dropped off at a spooky remote boarding school for girls by her estranged parents (Bruce Campbell & Emma Campbell). Weird, witchy things ensue. Patricia Clarkson plays the dean while Lauren Birkell and Rachel Nichols play fellow students, one nice and the other mean.   

This is a mystery/horror flick that combines “Suspiria” (1977) with elements of “Carrie” (1976) and “The Ruins” (2008) or “Man-Thing” (2005) (yes, I realize “The Ruins” came out later; I’m just trying to give people an idea of what the movie’s like). The haunting atmosphere and the Montreal location are very good, as well as the unsettling creepiness. 

So the plot is a winner, the film looks good and there’s an effective darkness, if that’s your thang. Unfortunately, the story is underwhelming. It’s too ambiguous and feels incomplete, like a half hour of events were cut from the runtime. The hints of levitation and telekinetic abilities don't amount to much, nor do the leaves on a bed.

The characters are either underdeveloped or unlikable, except for maybe the protagonist (Bruckner). All we know about Heather is that she recently set fire to something and there’s enmity between her and her self-absorbed mother. The father is a pushover. We don't learn much about them or anyone else at the academy. Marcy provokes pity while Samantha is too over-the-top as the villain. You’re more curious about WHY she’s so mean than anything else. With all the young females available, the filmmakers drop the ball by not taking advantage of these resources (and I’m not tawkin’ bout nudity or sleaze).   

The emotionless deliveries of the all-female faculty don’t help, but I realize they were written that way to create a sense of oddness and it works. The witchcraft elements are decidedly subdued, which I liked; the focus is on the formidableness of the forest itself (hence the title). Speaking of which, the woods F/X in the last act are well done. 

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 31 minutes and was shot at McGill University, Montréal, Québec. WRITER: David Ross. 

GRADE: C || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

While I'm going to say that this movie was over-hyped quite a bit, it is good, but I don't feel like it really does anything specifically special.

It has a high level of good, but there is little I can see that would put that up to great.  There are some scenes later in the movie as information is revealed that might surprise the audience, but I don't see it really as ""scary"" moments.

This is more of drip-fed information investigation movie with and all girls school, coming of age story, but the one thing it is clear it is trying to do, it tips its hand fairly early.

While I didn't find that detracting from the movie (it does add a bit of creepy atmosphere to the story), it could be a stronger reveal later.

Ultimately worth the watch, just go with low expectations."

Brilliant, if overrated.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || Let's be honest, almost all of the 1 star reviews are because of how the Mayan's are depicted and stem from a lack of historical knoweldge.

There seems to be the misconception that the Mayans were peaceful and didn't sacrifice humans... which reminds me of when my wife and I went to visit her family in Guatemala where the high point was really watching the American tourists swim in pools of water that probably had the bodies of thousands of sacrificial victims at the bottom... mostly 14 year-old boys.

Yeah, no way I would get in that water, but then I know what's beneath it.

Apocaypto is kind of about that... but it doesn't really convey the fact that, like the rest of Central and South America the sacrifice was to prevent the end of the world... and this kind of makes it about drought (which hit about the time they made contact with the west)

And it really doesn't convey the culture very well... but it does seem to zero in on the point that it wasn't their own people they were sacrificing, it was the people removed from the cities, the people that fell under the Mayan Empire, but weren't exactly a part of it...

... which is what the Aztecs did too.

But, who cares, in the end it's a brutal fight for survival, and it's an entertaining one. || Tapir's testicle, anyone? They're not quite the delicacy the playful warriors claim as they tease one of their pals, but it's illustrative of the nature of the relationship between these young Mayan tribesmen who, thus far, have found their greatest fear emanating from a menacing mother-in-law who is demanding that she gets grandchildren. That all changes when a more dominant war party arrive looking for sacrifices. The shrewd ""Jaguar Paw"" (Rudy Youngblood) manages to hide his expectant wife and their child in a deep pit, but he is himself taken prisoner by ""Zero Wolf"" (Raoul Max Trujillo) and removed to the capital - after witnessing his father's slaughter at the hands of ""Middle Eye"" (Gerarardo Taracena). Once there, in this sight of an almost complete pyramid, they are to be offered to their great god Kulkulkan. It's as if by a divine intervention that this young man is spared, but that mercy is short lived as he merely now becomes the plaything of the warriors. They have one chance of escape, but that only earns him the furious enmity of the powerful 'Zero Wolf"" and soon one hell of a cat and mouse game ensues. The photography really does capture the density of the Mexican forests and the Mel Gibson's direction the gruesome and gruelling lives of the young men who lived and died at the behest of the priests. What we are also exposed to is a civilisation teetering on the edge. Disease is rife - hardly surprising when we see the sheer volume of corpses lying around, and amidst all this desperation some of the dialogue is rousing, powerful and sometime quite relaxed too. Many of the actors are genuine tribesmen and some deliver some more than incidental parts quite well, but it's Youngblood, Trujillo and perhaps best of all - Taracena, who make this a grudge match well worth watching. It's sumptuous, this film. Gritty, bloody, violent - but sumptuous. Well worth a watch, and a big screen does great justice to the super cinematography."
9664.0,Flyboys,"The adventures of the Lafayette Escadrille, young Americans who volunteered for the French military before the U.S. entered World War I, and became the country's first fighter pilots.","When the world first went to war, they were the first to fly.","Action, Adventure, Drama, History, Romance, War",138.0,2006-09-22,en,6.546,814.0,2.05,"James Franco, David Ellison, Jean Reno, Philip Winchester, Todd Boyce",Tony Bill,"world war i, fighter pilot, based on true story, biplane","***Americans volunteers become fighter pilots in France during WW1***  

Before the USA enters WW1, a young Texas cowboy (James Franco) joins the Lafayette Escadrille in France, a squadron of American fighter pilots. The volunteers are trained and soon experience the glory, anxieties and horrors that go with air combat.  

“Flyboys"" (2006) was inspired by real events and comes in the tradition of similar WW1 aviation flicks “The Blue Max” (1966) and “Aces High"" (1976). Whilst not great like the exceptional “Blue Max,” the blockbuster-ish “Flyboys” is more compelling than the mundane “Aces High,” albeit a little marred by comic book storytelling (think “Legends of the Fall”). It’s also significantly superior to the curiously unabsorbing “The Red Baron” (2008). 

The movie’s ambitious and nigh epic, but there are some contrived, unconvincing moments. For instance, the “German spy” part could’ve been cut with no harm done, not to mention make for a more streamlined viewing experience. Yet I’m glad that the film’s not as one-dimensional as the realistic “Aces High” (which, don’t get me wrong, is a quality WW1 fighter pilot flick). For instance, “Flyboys” throws in a good trench sequence involving ‘No Man’s Land’ that LOOKS convincing; too bad it’s not believable at all (the way so-and-so easily saves so-and-so). 

Eugene Skinner, the black pilot, was based on the real-life Eugene Jacques Bullard (the filmmakers just changed the surname). In real life Eugene hoped to join the Lafayette Escadrille, but they stopped receiving applicants by the summer of 1916 after accepting 38 American pilots. So, a few months later, Eugene joined the Lafayette Flying Corps on November 15, 1916.

As far as strafing downed aviators goes, it was considered dishonorable, but the movie suggests that a minority of ignoble pilots did so, which is reasonable.  In the film an ignoble German pilot strafes & kills an American, which is what later spurs an honorable German pilot to make amends in a pretty powerful scene. 

The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes, and was shot in England (Buckinghamshire, Essex, Bedfordshire & Somerset House, Strand, London, with studio work done in Hertfordshire). PS: The lion, Whisky, was a real mascot for the squad, along with another named Soda.

Needless to say, this elicits a variety of unfriendly responses and so he buys an old ice cream van with his pal and decides to take a tour of the country ending up in California. Along the way he meets cowboys, evangelicals, gays, etiquette experts and even manages some naked wrestling, but will he meet and get his gal? It’s perhaps a little unfair to say this is anti-American specifically. I reckon if you travelled into the interior of many large countries where your mum, your dog and your canary might all the the same creature whilst “Duelling Banjos” is on repeat on the juke box, you’d get the same sort of insular responses, but somehow this seems exaggerated by some of the most ignorant and stupid people that he encounters en route. The condescension in which he’s viewed by some of the population, the rudeness and violence he encounters as well as the humorous hypocrisies don’t really show his hosts in a good light at any stage of his drive. Of course, he’s an obnoxious man whose anti-Semitic views, causal approach to violent sex and, indeed, his clumsy attempts at English all reinforce an Eastern European stereotype too, but that country had decades of Soviet occupation to blame. What’s the excuse of those in Texas whose intellect is only marginally greater than their cows. It’s excessive at times and the joke does start to wear a bit thin, but there’s something quite thought provoking about Sasha Baron Cohen’s character here that shines a critical light at jingoism and nationalism amusingly but poignantly. Perhaps he ought to get himself a job as a fact checker in the White House now?"

Set against at backdrop of a Spain still trying to recover from it's civil war, the young ""Ofelia"" and her pregnant mother ""Carmen"" are sent to live with the rather brutish ""Capt. Vidal"". Now he is a singularly nasty piece of work and the girl longs to meet her own real father. It's in the middle of the night that ""Ofelia"" encounters a sprite who offers her some hope. It knows of a faun in the middle of a maze who might be able to help, and so they set of in search of this ostensibly sagely and benign creature. The meeting offers her far more than a glimmer, she need only complete three tasks and will find herself taking up her inheritance as a princess and reunited with her kingly father. What now ensues is a fairy tale full of dark magic and untrustworthy characters whom the young girl must face if she is to succeed. Given the atrocities being carried out in the real world around her, she seeks more and more solace in this nether world that is probably just as dangerous - it certainly has it's fair share of malevolence and duplicity - but with her father the ultimate goal, she perseveres with wisdom and gritty determination. What makes this work is the delicious permutations of evil it offers. Contrasting the real with the fabled, the human with the fantasy - and the decency the young girl epitomises is by no means certain of success. The visual effects cleverly integrate both of her worlds without dominating the look of the film or the potency of the story - one of love, ambition, fear, trickery. It's creatively exciting and captivating too. This is storytelling at it's best, and on a big screen can be appreciate to it's full - and dazzling - effect. || Pan's Labyrinth is a movie that really gets you thinking. You can see it two ways: either it's a dark fairy tale about a princess escaping to a magical world, or it's about a little girl using her imagination to deal with some really tough stuff.

What's cool is that the movie gives you reasons to believe both things. Like, Ofelia draws a door with chalk and actually walks through it? And the root she puts under her mom's bed seems to help? That makes you wonder if it's all real. But then, all the monsters and the things she has to do? They seem to match up perfectly with the problems she's facing in real life. Plus, the bad guy can't even see the Faun.

The best part is, the movie doesn't tell you which one is right. You want to believe Ofelia gets her happy ending in a magical kingdom. But you also realize that maybe you just want that because you feel so bad for her. Del Toro, is really good at making you care, and then leaving you to figure it out. It's not just a story; it makes you think about what's real and what's not, and how our minds try to protect us when things get rough."""

The setup is solid, and the first act does a great job establishing the stakes. But once the second act kicks in, the momentum slows down as the focus shifts almost entirely to training sequences. While these moments have some depth and character development, they drag on too long, making the story feel repetitive. The plot itself follows a familiar formula, and while it has emotional weight, it doesn’t bring much originality. It feels like it’s trying to be Top Gun for the Coast Guard but without the same energy or unpredictability.

That said, the movie is well-executed on a technical level. The cinematography captures the intensity of ocean rescues with some visually striking sequences. The direction is solid, and the pacing is decent. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher both deliver strong performances, with Costner bringing a grounded, believable presence to his role. The script is good overall, even if some parts feel a bit too by-the-numbers. The score and sound design do their job well, adding tension and emotion where needed.

Don't ask me why. I had previously loved the Hong Kong-made 'Infernal Affairs' trilogy on which this is based. Usually I hate when international masterpieces get remade, but this was a sterling exception. This was controversial when it took in a cartload of Oscars, particularly finally a directorial nod for Scorsese, but don't be misled--it's easily one of his finest works.

The Departed is directed by Martin Scorsese and written by William Monahan, Alan Mak and Felix Chong. It stars Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson, Mark Rolston and Alec Baldwin. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.

An Irish gang in South Boston becomes aware there is a rat in their midst, whilst the police force has a mole to contend with - with each one trying to out each other before the other does...

Martin Scorsese remakes Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002) for the English speaking world, and promptly bagged his first Best Director Oscar in the process. It's a thrilling picture packed with suspense and edginess, a psychological gangster picture driven by two men leading double lives that is leading them to the abyss. When the violence comes it erupts in thunderous strokes, all while the narrative pulses with paranoia. There are some irksome contrivances, but with a uniformly strong set of turns from the cast, great musical accompaniments, and a director returning to gangster form, The Departed is a sure fire winner. 8.5/10 || I think this might be my favourite performance from Leonardo DiCaprio as he takes on the mantle of undercover cop ""Billy"". On a perilous arms-length basis from his boss (Martin Sheen) pretty much from the start of his career, he must undergo the violent perils of prison so he can convincingly infiltrate the gang of hoodlum ""Costello"" (Jack Nicholson) who runs the crime syndicate in the city of Boston somewhat enigmatically. Meantime, we also meet ""Colin"" (Matt Damon) who is in a mirror-image position with the State police. As the situation in the city becomes even more dangerous it becomes clear to both the cops and to ""Costello"" that there is a fly in their respective ointment, and those men's positions become even more hazardous. Now each must try to identify the other before the entire house of cards comes crashing down in a blaze of gunfire. If we add to the mix the fiery and determined detective ""Dignam"" (Mark Wahlberg) and a bit of love interest from ""Madolyn"" (Vera Farminga) and we get an engagingly complex thriller that unravels cleverly and slowly over 2½ hours generating a proper sense of menace. Nicholson is on superb form as the maniacal boss whom you just know probably isn't trustworthy - even for those his own side, and the focussed efforts from Leo and Damon deliver well to build the tension effectively. I liked the writing - and the paucity of it. There is comedy here, there is threat here but there is very little extraneous verbiage. The characters have a visceral quality to them that, as the story develops, really does immerse you in their tawdry and shady goings-on. I can't say that I loved the ending - somehow it seemed a little bit rushed, but there's certainly vindication there for someone... This is the kind of drama that thrives by knitting the myriad of threads together without having to faff about with timelines, loops, or repetition. It's a story that evolves in a plausibly hazardous yet characterful fashion and if you can catch it on a big screen, then it's highly recommended. Scorsese - indeed, just about everyone, at their best."

Based on Giles Foden's novel of the same name, this filmic version of a period of Idi Amin's presidency of Uganda is a class act - that is if you can accept it as a loose reworking of events in Amin's life? Thus those who filed in for a bona fide history lesson subsequently either got angry or plain disappointed.

Propelled by Forest Whitaker's barnstorming Oscar winning perf as Amin, Last King of Scotland is riveting and fascinating from first reel to last. The political upheaval at this time in Uganda's history is presented in delicate strokes of dark depressing realisations, and also that of uneasy humour.

The portrayal of Amin is most complex, part man child, part greenhorn political suitor and one heartbeat away from despotic lunacy, with Whitaker nailing every single tick. It's key to note that the film does shed some light on Amin, so as a character study it soars and holds you enthral throughout.

Director Kevin Macdonald films in kinetic style, which is perfect for the material to hand, and he also deserves a pat on the back for ensuring the characters around Amin (circle of family/advisors etc) are a constant intrigue as per Amin's agenda machinations. James McAvoy gives sterling support as the key ""fish out of water"" doctor who Amin takes to his bosom, while Kerry Washington as Amin's wife number 3 also strikes the right emotive notes.

The finale falters somewhat, where it encompasses the Entebbe Hostage Crisis but fails to do that incident justice - instead using it as a cypher to have us rooting for McAvoy's made up character to get out of harm's way. But this is just a misstep that's not film defining. For this is a fine film, if it's not jolting you with harrowing scenes, or tickling your brain for education purpose, then it's demanding your attention for historical noting. Job done. 8.5/10 || According to Wikiquote, a “British official” once said that Idi Amin needed “things explained in words of one letter.” It is one of The Last King of Scotland’s few flaws that it assumes we need things seen through the eyes of a white Westerner.

Sure, James McAvoy has some very good scenes with Forest Whitaker, the best of which is arguably the first (though in retrospect it doesn’t quite hold up to scrutiny), which ends with Amin and Dr. Nicholas Garrigan exchanging shirts (so that Amin can give Garrigan’s to his non-existent son Campbell, brother to the epileptic, and most likely also imaginary, Mackenzie) as if they’d just been in opposing sides of a soccer match.

Other scenes are much less fortunate, especially the one wherein the good doctor assists the dictator in the forced release of a massive flatulence. Good or bad, though, it matters little because none of this happened, and Dr. Garrigan never existed – not that he’s the least bit believable, either; starting with how he decides to go to Uganda (literally spinning a globe, closing his eyes, and pointing), Nicholas invariably behaves more like a character in a movie than an actual human being.

He can grab Amin’s sidearm without being instantly gunned down by the sundry nearby soldiers; he can drive, through streets he presumably is unfamiliar with, Amin to safety after the latter has been ambushed; he’s fresh off medical school but has the poise of an expert physician; and he’s so irresistible that one of Amin’s wives is willing to risk life and limb (or rather limbs, as it turns out) to have sexual congress with him (and even if the character were real, we still wouldn't be interested in his sex life).

Wikipedia tells me “the film mixes fiction with real events to give an impression of Amin and Uganda under his rule.” Well, we certainly get an indelible impression of Amin thanks to Whitaker’s haunting performance; on the other hand, wouldn’t we get a clearer impression of Uganda under his rule if the film stuck to the facts?

What’s the point of shooting on location if we only get a perfunctory idea of the effect the dictatorship had on the country and its people? Even the captions before the closing credits are too little too late, especially considering they aren’t much more accurate than anything that has gone on before. Instead, everything is filtered through Garrigan, who cares mostly about saving his own skin and isn’t really all that concerned with the fate of the Ugandan nation.

It’s a shame because director Kevin Macdonald’s influences are impeccable; Amin’s “Nothing comes from nothing” echoes Lear’s “Nothing can come of nothing,” and the way he dismisses Garrigan at one point is reminiscent of Rolf Hoppe chewing out Klaus Maria Brandauer in Mephisto. Perhaps Macdonald should have leaned completely towards the fictional approach and made a film à clef (Zangaro, The Dogs of War’s faux African dictatorship, would have been a good template). || It’s a very intense film.

Forest Whitaker’s performance as Idi Amin is absolutely incredible—no surprise there since he’s one of my favorite actors. He completely commands every scene he’s in, and you can see why he won the Oscar for it. His portrayal is terrifying but also human, which makes it all the more powerful.

The directing by Kevin Macdonald was solid. The movie is tightly packed with tension and drama, and it does a great job of immersing you in the chaotic world of Amin’s Uganda. The pacing can feel a bit heavy at times, but it works well for the story being told. I think the mix of real historical events with a fictional lens through the young doctor’s perspective was interesting, though it sometimes felt like the movie couldn’t decide whether it wanted to focus on Amin or the doctor.

It’s definitely a gripping and well-made film, the performances are top-notch, and it has moments that really stick with you."

You may be depressed with the state of both the world and mankind, after watching it, but you won't be disappointed in the possibilities of cinema. || **Thought provoking piece of art !!**

**CHILDREN OF MEN**....How a baby's cry can make the whole world stop, the bullets stop flying in a war, people forget all their pain, the only thing that matters is how to make that precious gift of god smile again..The movie depicts it beautifully! When the world is falling apart, coming to its end, how a THEO does things that he otherwise would have not done for anything or anybody else...It doesn't seems practical that how at every point of time there is somebody to see them sail through, but that is all LIFE is about...HOPE...There's a THEO in everyone of us...It's in our hands...to choose, THEO or Luke...The world will surely end someday but till then we must all protect the CHILDREN OF MEN, protect the world...Do our bit for the mother earth..!!

**P.S. - loved the laughter of the babies in the end!!**

Scenes I LOVED - 

1. When Julian was shot.
2. When Theo thought Jasper was dead.
3. When Dylan was born.
4. When Theo said to Luke ""It's a GIRL""
5. When Marichka expressed she isn't coming.


There may be more, but these are all I remembered.

Michael Caine was adorable as always, Julianne Moore was pretty, Clive Owen was perfect, Kee was sweet, Miriam was, don't know, clean...at heart !"

In 2006, the film makers - no longer under the watchful eye of the late Cubby Broccoli decided to run away from making James Bond movies. They also cast a short blonde man as 007.  They screwed with the gun barrel and the tone of the once lively, over the top and amusing series was now one of tedium.


It's all over for Bond films now unless they decide to make real Bond films again and not this monotonous  and bland rubbish.

It's  shame that Cubby was not still around to keep Eon Productions in line and stop them ruining 40 years of hard work.


- Potential Kermode || Arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.

Casino Royale is directed by Martin Campbell and adapted by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul Haggis from a story written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini. It's the 21st film in the James Bond franchise.

Plot finds Craig as Bond, newly promoted to 00 status, he is thrust into the murky world of high financed terrorism.

One of the hardest series of films to get right, with some of the most committed of fans, is that of the James Bond series. To wit, there will never ever be a Bond film that will appease every fan across the board. The complaints will range from not enough gadgets, too far removed from Fleming's essence, not serious enough and vice a versa: too darn serious. Then there is the usual round of arguments concerning the leading man stepping into the tuxedo, for every Bond fan ready to fight to the death in the name of Sean Connery, I'll find you another prepared to back Timothy Dalton's take on the Martini swigging legend. Once it became clear that Pierce Brosnan had run his course as Bond, bowing out with the super silly Die Another Day in 2002, the pressure for any new Bond, both the actor and the makers, was immense. 2006 and time had moved on, and we live in different cinema times, spy movies are a different breed to what went before, The Bourne Identity had raised the bar. The news filtered thru that Bond was to be rebooted and that Daniel Craig was the man to be Bond. The howls of derision could be heard from as far as the tropical locations so in keeping with a James Bond plot. Too Blonde, too craggy faced, not tall enough, and why reboot a much loved franchise anyway? It was war and the heat was turned up to full.

Casino Royale still has its critics, but as majorities go as regards a Bond film, this one has the biggest sway. Sure, the Daniel Craig haters will not be bowed, they can't after all lose face after such a vitriolic campaign against his casting, but few, I suspect, can seriously deny Casino Royale is not a magnificent Bond movie. Just a peak at the Worldwide box office figures shows you how well received it was, making nearly $600 million, those are figures that do not lie. The truth is that Casino Royale has almost everything you could wish for from a Bond movie, and a little more. Gorgeous locations, beautiful women and reams of action; where, the stunt department reach new heights. It's also refreshingly in keeping with Fleming's original story, only major difference here is that the makers have upgraded it to a post 9/11 world. There's nods to traditional franchise staples, whilst also neatly streamlining some of the previous film's comedy scene fillers. Smart villain too, Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre, complete with creepy eye issue and loyal girlfriend, is a villain not trying to blow up the world because he's mad, but trying to outwit Bond to stay alive! That's great stuff that keeps a Bond thriller alive and well.

But for all the energy and pyrotechnics (there's enough in this one film to have filled half a dozen of previous Bond entries), a Bond film can only succeed if the leading man is up to scratch. Thankfully, and joyously, Craig nails it, both in physicality, swagger and raw egotistical aggression. More telling is that Craig's Bond is more human that what we are used too, at one time suave and appearing unruffled, the next, bruised battered and emotionally conflicted. This is a new and rounded Bond, given impetus by Craig's powerful presence. He is helped by Eva Green putting brains and slinkiness into Vesper Lynd, a Bond girl to turn Bond's head in a way not seen since Diana Rigg's Tracy di Vicenzo in OHMSS. Though one of the film's rare missteps is to under write the part. Felix Leiter also gets a quality tune up in the form of Jeffrey Wright, Judi Dench's M kicks arse and Giancarlo Giannini adds a touch of continental class as Bond's Montenegro contact René Mathis. Layered over the top is a nifty score by David Arnold, blending traditional Bond flavours with high energy bursts and Phil Meheux's photography brings optical delights in the Bahamas, Czech Republic and Italy.

Opening with the best chase sequence in the whole franchise and closing with an ultimate Bond moment, this is reboot supreme. It's high energy with intelligent humanistic smarts and Bond is back: blonder, brutal and most assuredly better. 9/10 || i liked Daniel Craig more as the right bond with action, charm, cunning all in one"

After a terrorist explosion of a ferry in New Orleans, an ATF agent (Denzel Washington) joins an experimental FBI surveillance unit that uses space-folding technology to find the culprit and maybe even avert the disaster. While looking in the past he starts to fall for a notable victim of the tragedy (Paula Patton). Val Kilmer plays the head FBI agent and Jim Caviezel the antagonist. Adam Goldberg is on hand as a tech geek.

While watching ""Deja Vu"" (2006) I couldn’t help thinking of “Enemy of the State” (1998) because of the kinetic editing and advanced surveillance technology. Turns out they were made by the same director, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott’s brother, who unfortunately jumped off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2012, ending his life at 68 years-old. (Ridley claimed it was due to his secret struggles with cancer while others say it was due to two antidepressants known to cause suicidal thoughts or paranoid ideation). 

“Deja Vu” is good, especially the compelling last act. Although it may not be as great as “Enemy of the State,” the filmmaking expertise is off the charts, particularly in regards to the depictions of surveillance technology. It’s mind-boggling to think of the effort that was put into making everything gel and dynamically move along without confusing the viewer. However, it admittedly does get a little convoluted in the second act with the experimental observation equipment, which culminates with a thrilling-but-highly-unbelievable past/present car-chase sequence.      

Another problem, a minor one, is the revelation of the terrorist, which brings to mind someone like the infamous Timothy McVeigh. Never mind that 99% of the terrorist attacks the world over are by radical Islamists (e.g. 9/11, Orlando, San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Fort Hood, Boston Marathon, Paris, Nice, etc.). Shh, don’t tell anyone.    

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in New Orleans.

GRADE: B || Pacing could've been better but still an effective sci-fi thriller thanks to Denzel Washington's charisma carrying over the finish line. Even though this was my third viewing, first time in at least a decade, my feelings and rating remains the same. **3.5/5** || Déjà Vu is a compelling blend of science fiction and action, showcasing Denzel Washington's exceptional talent. His portrayal of ATF agent Doug Carlin is both engaging and nuanced, bringing depth to the character. The film's production is noteworthy, with director Tony Scott utilizing advanced visual effects to create a seamless narrative that explores complex themes of time and memory.

The cinematography by Paul Cameron effectively captures the vibrant essence of New Orleans, adding a rich backdrop to the unfolding mystery. Washington's subtle humor, particularly the quip about the ""seven dwarves,"" adds a light touch to the intense storyline. Jim Caviezel delivers a strong performance as the antagonist, contributing to the film's tension and depth.

Overall, Déjà Vu is a well-crafted film that combines innovative storytelling with strong performances, making it a memorable addition to the genre."

There are also a couple of soapy sub-plots asking who's having an affair with whom and the whole thing is interspersed with some actuality of the night's real-time political events as if to give it some weight. Sadly, though, despite it's pretty stellar cast the whole thing just doesn't knit in anything like an interesting enough fashion. It's as if Emilio Estevez determined to get as many of his friends and family (and their friends and family) to take part in a Democrat fundraising movie peppered with some rousing dogma from the archives. It's over-scripted, pace-less and there are way too many distractions to make this anything compelling to watch.

RELEASED IN 2006 and written & directed by Brad Silberling, “10 Items or Less” is a drama about an aged has-been actor (Morgan Freeman) who researches for an indie gig after a four-year dry spell. He meets a spitfire checkout clerk named Scarlet (Paz Vega) at a supermarket in a Latino community of Los Angeles. Impressed by the young woman, he decides to help her while psyching-up for the role.          

The plot is obviously borrowed from 2003’s “Lost in Translation.” To key you off, the girl is named after Scarlett Johansson. But don’t let that keep you from seeing this minor gem because the characters are very different, plus other nuances. For instance, Morgan’s character (simply called “Him” in the cast list) reflects the “joy of living” (joie de vivre) as opposed to Bill Murray’s amusing curmudgeon in “Lost in Translation.” 

Moreover, “10 Items” is less melancholy; and the girl isn’t naïve and overly sweet like Charlotte (Johansson) in “Lost.” It’s a small film, with the end credits rolling a mere ten minutes after the hour mark, and so it lacks the depth of “Lost” and isn’t as moving (at least as far as pulling your romantic heartstrings), but it’s more heartwarming and overall inspiring.              

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 21 minutes and was shot in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and nearby Carson (to the south).

The script is witty and there is good chemistry between the prospective couples, although it takes a while to develop with Amanda and Graham due to their awkward and clunky start.

My only real issue was their deploying that awkward rom-com device when two characters have sex first and then fall in love. The movie does a fair job of recovering from the lustful beginning, but I can’t help but think there could have been a more creative way to make the relationship awkward and in need of recovery.

Harsh Times is written and directed by David Ayer. It stars Christian Bale, Freddy Rodriguez, Eva Longoria, Chaka Forman, Tammy Trull, J.K. Simmons and Michael Monks. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Steve Mason. 

South Central Los Angeles, and best friends Jim Luther Davis (Bale) and Mike Alonzo (Rodriguez) begin hurtling into violence that threatens to derail their respective future plans.

This was to be David Ayer's directorial debut, and with him already boasting the writing credit for Training Day, the comparisons between the two are hard to ignore - but that's ok right?! Bale goes full tilt as the unpredictable and unnerving Jim Davis, a scarred Gulf War Veteran on a road to self destruction. Question is, will he take his best friend with him?

This is very much about Bale's barn storming show, which while it  thrills us greatly, it also hinders the Rodriguez characterisation of Lopez, making the pic a bit lop-sided. Narrative threads focus on the scrapes the pair get into, whilst in the background their love partners are waiting for their men to wake up and commit. Another features Davis suffering bad dreams from the war, all while he is head hunted by Homeland Security after he had failed to get into the LAPD. Davis firmly believes he belongs in the protection business, if only his habit for finding trouble wasn't so prevalent...

The violent action scenes are brisk and bloody, marking this out as a hard movie for sure, a hard movie with dialogue to match. Yet it's also a pic laced with black comedy, where there's a perverse pleasure in watching Davis and his not very bright cohort being bad boys. Longoria is not done any favours in the writing, but it's kind of ok since this really is about a friendship spiralling towards a day of reckoning that we obviously know is coming. Which when it comes to us, does not disappoint at all and leaves us some reflecting to do as the adrenaline finally slows down. 7.5/10"

The film isn't all action and shows the living conditions there. Djimon Hounsou, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly were very good in the film || Rewatching Blood Diamond reminded me why it’s such a powerful and unforgettable film. It’s not just a movie—it’s an experience that grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of his best performances as Danny Archer. His character’s journey from selfish opportunist to someone who finds his humanity is so raw and real that it hit me on a deeper level this time around. Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy was equally breathtaking; his portrayal of a father’s unshakable love and desperation to reunite with his son brought me to tears more than once.

The film’s depiction of conflict diamonds and the devastating impact they have on innocent lives is brutal, but it’s a story that needs to be told. It forces you to confront the harsh realities of greed and exploitation, while also shining a light on the strength and resilience of the human spirit. There’s a particular scene where Solomon finds himself face-to-face with his son, who has been taken and brainwashed—it’s heart-wrenching and stays with you long after the credits roll.

Edward Zwick’s direction is stunning. The action is gripping, the emotional beats are deeply moving, and the film’s message is clear without being preachy. The cinematography captures the beauty and tragedy of Africa in a way that feels both poetic and unflinchingly honest. The soundtrack, too, weaves perfectly into the story, adding to the intensity and emotion.

This movie is more than just entertainment—it’s a reminder of what people are willing to sacrifice for love, for family, and for what’s right. By the end, I was left emotionally drained but also inspired. Blood Diamond is a masterpiece, a film that hits every chord, and one I’ll always hold close to my heart."

Lovely film :) <3 || Decent watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend for younger audiences.

It's based off of a famous book, Dakota Fanning, Steve Buscemi, Julia Roberts are all charming in their own ways, but I never realized what a dud of a character Wilbur was before this.  Sure, he's a happy-go-lucky guy and social trend setter, but he's a character that needs a lot of help and doesn't even really give back.

The story feels like a more modern fable: there is a lesson of morality and life here, but it is a lot more subtle than I'm used to fables being.  Of course this has a cooked in version of explaining life and death to young children, but it feels like it tries to convey that a life well served, however short, is good life.  This does make the movie oddly charming, but I can't say that it makes it as great as I remember the book being.

Now, that may be nostalgia glasses, or maybe I have them for the this movie, but I think, in the end, it's an average movie with a good story that kids might like. || The kindly young “Fern” (Dakota Fanning) manages to rescue a runt piglet and rear it as her own pet - despite the reservations of her dad. As it grows up, though, it becomes too big to live in their home so it’s sent to a nearby family farm and that’s where we all meet “Wilbur”. He’s an engaging and curious little critter who fits in with his talkative farmyard friends quickly and obliviously coasts through life until one of his new pals mentions the dreaded “C” word! He’s naturally quite terrified but what can he do? Well fortunately, the ingenious spider “Charlotte” lives in their barn too, and she concocts a plan that might just save his bacon! What now ensues sees a series of mischievous incidents that allows each animal to characterise a little as “Wilbur” and “Charlotte” come up with a plan to immortalise the young piggy. This is one of those stories I recall reading at school, and though it can run a little to sentiment, it’s still an entertainingly thoughtful story of fitting in, of team playing and of enduring friendship and though many years later I have undoubtedly become more of a cynic, it still has the power to reduce things to basics in quite a poignant fashion. It’s about optimism and sacrifice and the voice talents (on the English language version, anyway) offer us a friendly and touching story that still celebrates a vicarious version of humanity, well. Fanning delivers amiably, the animation is enjoyable to watch and if the last ten minutes doesn’t make you smile and blub just a little, then you’ve left your heart in the fridge."

Thirty years since Rocky, the underdog from Philadelphia, graciously climbed into the ring and gave Apollo Creed a run for his money. Then a sequel was commissioned. And another one. And another. Until the negligently produced ‘Rocky V’ was released with its disappointing conclusion, leaving fans underwhelmed. Stallone too, discontent with the final product. Thus, the sixth title in the series was conceived, with Stallone starring, writing and directing the feature. Throughout the sequels, many tropes were repeatedly utilised to capitalise on the resounding success of the original instalment, after all it received the Best Picture award of ‘76. The training montage to “Gonna Fly Now”, the awkward conversational exchanges between Rocky and a potential love interest, the old optimistic monologue and Stallone attempting to demonstrate he isn’t just a masterpiece wax work by shedding one tear. All culminating into an emotional boxing match where it doesn’t matter who wins, “it’s about how many hits you can take, and still keep moving forward”.

The narrative difference in all these thirty years? Rocky is older now. Fine, that was somewhat harsh. Stallone implements some note-worthy additions to the linear storytelling. The brooding aura of melancholy that envelops Rocky and Philadelphia, struggling to move on from the passing of his wife Adrian. This sorrowful force restraining Balboa to a mere relic within the sport that he fought so viciously in. Guests visiting his restaurant (aptly names “Adrian’s”) to intently listen to his tales, as if a museum piece for all to reminisce. Struggling to retain his symbolic status within boxing.

The problem is, Stallone never progresses the plot. In fact, he maintained the narrative to be a simple yet dull nostalgia trip that relied heavily on sentimentality. A wearisome derivative of the original that, unfortunately, felt fatigued in terms of homaging certain plot points. The entire first act was Balboa moping around, despite Adrian passing years ago, embodying remorse. Stallone, as Rocky, nailed the consistency of his character. From the awkward dialogue to his emphatic mannerisms, he constantly reminded us that he is the only actor available to play this legendary cinematic character. Whilst Stallone’s performance was commendable, others not so much.

There’s an underlying issue with insufficient chemistry between the actors. Stallone and Hughes, reprising the character of Marie, were decent if undercooked. Stallone and Ventimiglia on the other hand, who portrays his son, had nothing. All dialogue exchanges between them felt forced and lacked emotionality, particularly when Ventimiglia was “supporting” his father outside the ring. Young was passable as Paulie, although acting talent has diminished considerably over the years with his constant shouting.

The third act boxing match was filmed concisely, with Stallone taking a distant approach in order to exploit the energy within the room. The corny punching sound effects were removed, with Stallone and Tarver actually throwing real punches. It certainly exhumed realism, if a tad pedestrian. However, Stallone then opted to embed unusual visualised effects within the fight to indicate Rocky’s thought process as he remembers past fights in search for vigour. Far too cheesy and cumbersome, breaking up the flow of the match with unnecessary slow motion. Rocky’s opponent Mason Dixon was severely underdeveloped, lacking strength within his motives as he yearns to be taken seriously as a heavyweight champion.

Rocky Balboa will entertain fans of the franchise. It encompasses several vital narrative elements that many have learned to adore. However, for the casual audience who are neither here nor there regarding the series, it’s a drained formulaic story that depends too heavily on paying homage to its predecessors. Ultimately exhausting itself before the penultimate fight commences. || You know this was the story that SHOULD have been told in Rocky V, or at least this is the kind of story that should have been told.

Unfortunately it is a story told sans Talia Shire, who along with Burt Young and Carl Weathers are Rocky staples... of course Creed was dead in the timeline, so his absence is excusable... but we all kind of wanted to see Adrian, and wanted another story that developed her especially since they kind of stopped developing her as of Rocky III and relegated her to the sidelines.

But, you got to see a typical Rocky story. You got to see Rocky dig in and be inspiring again... and that is why we all love Rocky stories isn't it? Rovky V lacked the inspiration, Rocky Balboa came back with full force and it has continued though Creed, and, hopefully, when I get around to watching it, it will be there in Creed II as well.

The magic is that it comes back to the Rocky I and II dynamic, where it's not just about boxing, it's about Rocky and his story. And that is what we all missed in III and IV, and was attempted but failed miserably in V.

It felt like an early Rocky film, it felt like both an end and a rebirth of the franchise, and it was a very satisfying film to watch... especially given didn't really pull the punch we were all dreading and hit us full force. || **_Rocky as a has-been and, maybe, still-is_**

It has been over 20 years since Rocky’s been in the ring. He runs his Italian restaurant in Philadelphia named after his wife while trying to get closer to his distant son, a corporate lawyer, and reacquainting with Marie (the troublesome girl he escorted home in the first movie). When the surprising opportunity arises to return to the limelight, the fading boxer must discover if he still has his fighting spirit despite his age.

""Rocky Balboa” (2006) was the sixth Rocky film, appearing sixteen years after the previous installment. Also known as “Rocky VI,” this is a fine way to end the proper series, although Sylvester Stallone says a seventh film, an epilogue, is being considered (and I hope materializes).

To be expected, this one sticks to the tried-and-true Rocky formula, effectively showing where the key characters are at three decades after the original flick, plus introducing a few new faces, including an old canine named Punchy. Sure, it’s predictable, but it’s entertaining as it continues Rocky’s story in his mid-50s.

Of course, the successful spin-off series, Creed, brought Rocky back in 2015 and 2018 with a third installment to be released this year. 

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and, was shot in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

We both enjoyed it. I wasn’t concerned when a few reviews remarked that it moved slowly, as we have always appreciated movies that build a quiet story carefully, and mostly this one did that.

My only criticism is that at the outset of the movie, I didn’t quite believe that Walter was in love with Kitty. He said he was, but I wonder if a scene or two showing him falling for her ended up on the cutting room floor. He merely seemed to stalk her around the party and want to marry her before he left for China. Similarly, Kitty falling for Charlie didn’t seem well constructed. It felt like one scene they stared at each other, flirted a bit, and the next scene they are in bed.

But once I suspended that bit of disbelief, the film was great. Gradually Kitty develops as a character, and her marriage begins to be rebuilt from the rubble of her earlier actions.

The final scene, a few years after the action in the bulk of the movie, brings the story full circle in a satisfying manner. All around a fine movie well worth watching patiently. || I enjoyed this film a good more than I expected I would, based on the poor critical response and so-so viewer scores.

Initially he is full of the joys of spring, his task a patriotic duty. Increasingly, though, as his hastily arranged marriage to ""Margaret"" (the sparingly used Angelina Jolie) starts to suffer, cynicism creeps in and what semblance of decency he had begins to become subsumed into a determination to get results - regardless of the methods frequently employed by his sidekick ""Ray"" (John Turturro). Robert De Niro clearly has pulling power with his directorial promise, but most of the supporting cast add little to this muddling drama that trips over it's own cloak way too often looking for the dagger. Quite where Billy Crudup's accent came from is anyone's guess and the plodding nature of this rather wearisome, if stylishly filmed, drama makes it quite a slog to sit through. It's all just a bit too self-indulgent and presents us with a rather ungracious and arrogant side to an American superiority complex that I found a bit dull."

At times, it does stray a little too close to domestic melodrama, but for the most part this is a cracking story of how these women prove their own mettle. They regale against the male-dominated music business; increasingly try to assert themselves not just in the industry but with their management but, towards the end, with there own personal relationships before a powerful and vindicating denouement. Henry Kriegen and Tom Eyon have written some strong and powerful lyrics for the ladies to belt out with aplomb, particularly the title song, ""It's All Over"" and the show stopping ""One Night Only"". The production detail, photography and general pace of the film really do make for an an engaging watch; the performances are vibrant and frequently the emotion they generate is compelling to watch. Foxx is not the best, to be fair - especially when he bursts into song, but Murphy fares a bit better on that front and all told, this is an entertaining look at just how these women took on and defeated a system and a society that was stacked against them from the start.

Dench's acting, I thought she was a little too one-dimensional in this role. But given her choice, she executed the role with the usual Dench precision.

This is a twisted love triangle story with very real characters. If you're the kind that picks up the dirt rags in the checkout line at the supermarket, you'll probably love the story. I gave it a 7 on my scale. It won't blow you away, but you won't feel like you've wasted your time either. || **Lust, loneliness and bitterness in an engaging film with two great actresses.**

I was very impressed with this film, which combines two huge and very talented actresses and a script full of tension and very well developed. It's not something new or original, and there are a lot of relatively tense films that are set in a school environment. I can quote one that I saw recently, and that I remembered while watching this film: “The Children’s Hour”. Alright, the movie is about a hypothetical lesbian relationship between teachers, it's a different kind of scandal than what we have in this movie, but somehow it came to my mind. It is not an award-winning film, but it was nominated for two BAFTA, three Globes and four Oscars. Moreover, it was a competitive year, with several great films competing.

The script is very loosely based on a real case in which a female teacher had a sexual affair with a minor student. The situation is scabrous and criminal, despite the fact that it is also a type of frequent sexual fantasy to be found. However, the film is not about that, but about the tortuous relationship between the young teacher and an older colleague, who discovers the secret. Lonely, bitter, critical, psychologically unstable, with serious problems relating to other people and, eventually, a strongly repressed lesbian, the elderly woman creates an abusive relationship where she subjugates and blackmails her supposed friend, mercilessly manipulating her to obtain almost exclusivity of your attention.

In addition to a really good story, the film has an excellent cast and two great actresses who do a superb job. Judi Dench deserves a standing ovation for the work she leaves in this film: in addition to the sarcastic, almost cruel way in which she narrates the story, the actress was huge and impressive in the way she brought the character to life and played opposite Cate Blanchett. This one, in turn, was also very good, and does an equally good job, but it does not manage to have the magnetism of Dench. The two characters are also very different: Blanchett has on her hands a softer, more one-dimensional, less complex character than Dench, who is given more challenging, more complicated material, and a character who is really challenging to play convincingly. Despite being young, and having a minor role in the film, I also enjoyed Andrew Simpson's contribution.

Technically, it is a discreet film, with excellent cinematography, with dark notes of great skill, which help to thicken the tense environment in which the film develops. With good sets and costumes, but within the predictable, and a relatively good soundtrack that was composed by Phillip Glass (not as good as the one he made in other films, however), the film is discreet, but competent, and gives us excellent production values."

Where to start with <em>'Curse of the Golden Flower'</em>? Firstly, I need to show some appreciation for the score - incredible! From the very first scene I knew I was in for a treat in that department, it sets the tone perfectly throughout.

This also features outstanding performances from Gong Li (!), Chow Yun-fat, Chen Jin and Jay Chou, among some others. I was particularly impressed by Gong, she truly is terrific from beginning to end - as what is a memorable character. I know I say this a lot with actors, but I'm gonna need to try and check out more of her filmography!

Chow is the only actor in this that I'm familiar with, but this clearly tops what I've seen (not enough, granted) of him thus far - still a fan of him as Sao Feng in <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'</em>, though. The rest of those onscreen, despite the commanding presence of the aforementioned, still manage to standout in my memory as well, from earlier noted Chen and Chou to Li Man to Liu Ye.

The costumes, the sets... I personally do not think this film really put a foot wrong in terms of how it's made. How about those battle sequences too? Visually stunning, but also audibly so. The ending didn't go the way I was expecting, which is very much a positive thing.

Admittedly, this film hit an unwritten cheat code for me. As in: Give me strong performances and a great score and I am hook, line, and sinker. This Zhang Yimou flick gave me that in abundance. Overall, in my opinion: top notch!"

I'd say that aforementioned release pips this companion piece, but the difference in quality is virtually indistinguishable - both are very good films. Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya and Ryo Kase all give excellent performances, I enjoyed that trio throughout <em>'Letters from Iwo Jima'</em>.

It's really cool to see the Japanese point of view of the Battle of Iwo Jima, having previously seen the American view last time out. It's also pleasing that the film portrays this side of the story correctly and tells the tale in Japanese, despite being an all-American production. The film reportedly did well in Japan, which I guess confirms that it did a respectable job."

There's a running eyeball motif throughout this revamp/reimaging of Bob Clark's much revered culter of the same name (1974), after sitting through it you may, like me, feel like extracting your own eyeballs and playing ping-pong with them! 

Bunch of pretty sorority girls get menaced and mangled by a deranged killer who has come home for Christmas...

This lacks everything that made Bob Clark's film so effective. The less is more approach has gone, thus there is very little suspense, and in place is a gigantic back story for the killer. The characterisation of the girls, some acted by some very capable actresses, is practically non existent, so very little emotional heft to draw you into a state of caring for them. There's some good gore on show, but since tonally the pic is all over the place, it's never once scary or ironically funny.

A poor show all round. 3/10 || Obviously doesn't hold a candle to the original, and some of the acting is pretty genuinely bad, but it knows what it wants and it goes for it. What it wants, here being: To be hamstrung to keeping in step with its predecessor but also being wildly different enough to piss anyone off who was expecting an actual ""remake"".

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || _**More entertaining than the original, but marred by a ridiculous tacked-on ending**_

During Christmas Eve at a sorority house in New Hampshire, the students & housemother are harassed by a killer who likes to gouge out eyes. For some strange reason the mad slasher knows all the inner rooms and crawlspaces of the house (attic, basement, etc.).

“Black Christmas” (2006) is the first of two remakes of the original film from 1974 (the other being released in 2019 and is a remake-in-name-only). This version is more colorful and entertaining than the original, but also more twisted, highlighted by a superior cast of women, including Michelle Trachtenberg (Melissa), Lacey Chabert (Dana), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Heather), Jessica Harmon (Megan), Leela Savasta (Clair) and Katie Cassidy (Kelli).

Written & directed by Glen Morgan, the film is inventive with its backstory and the way the killer haunts the innards of the house, spying & preying on the girls. This is genuinely compelling stuff. Unfortunately, the film's tone and ending were marred by the interference of studio exec Bob Weinstein, who wanted a more over-the-top horror flick with cartoonish embellishments. The preposterous ending in particular seems tacked-on and (almost) ruins the movie. Thankfully some versions of the film are closer to Morgan’s original vision, at least as far as the climax goes.

The movie runs about 1 hour, 30 minutes, with a couple other versions longer or shorter by 4-5 minutes (depending on which ending was used). The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the hospital scenes done at Riverview Hospital in nearby Coquitlam.

Luckily, we have an invisible narrator for this exercise who adopts a god-like position on the shoulder of ""Camillo"" reminding him to live to the vows he took to his church despite his inclination for fisticuffs and disputations with just about everyone, but that is becoming much harder when rumours of some Nazi cash reach his ears and he wants some of it for his project.

The novel from Giovanni Guareschi upon which this is based offers quite a gentle analysis of post-war, and soon to be post-kingdom, Italy and looks at the roles of the church and it's traditions in a subtly thought-provoking fashion. Director Julien Duvivier has managed to capture quite a bit of that thrust and incorporates it engagingly into a series of scenarios that do raise a smile, but also an eyebrow too.

Largely regarded as ""you know, that movie with Timberlake in it."" Alpha Dog was enjoyable. And Timberlake did a great job. He is definitely all grown up now. A strong supporting cast of Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis sure didn't hurt. I loved how the cast worked so good together. They were very believable. The movie did a great job of showing us just how crazy and out of control a simple misunderstanding can get. Hopeful Hollywood does force Ben Foster down our throat! Small doses please! NOTE: Alpha Dog has a lot of language in it. || Going into this film, I had no idea what it was about, only that it was based on a true story. And the more I think about this fact, the truth behind it all, the more it saddens me.

The story that unfolded before my eyes last night is not one I'm likely to forget anytime soon. The characters, as I understand, are eerily like the real life people depicted, and all of the actors have done a great job terrifying me, surprising me, and making me feel sadder than any other film I can remember in recent history. Which is by no means meant to discourage you from watching this film, as I believe it is an absolute must-see for anyone who cares about the society we live in.

Jake Mazursky, an explosively charged skinhead, owes a large sum of drug money to a young thug called Johnny Truelove. After they get into a fight, Jake retaliates by trashing Johnny's house. Johnny then takes revenge by kidnapping Jake's 15-year-old brother Zack. Surprisingly though, Zack is OK with this, as he trusts his brother to come up with the ransom. In the meantime, Zack forms an unlikely friendship with one of Johnny's cronies, Frankie. But then, as fear starts to spread of having to do hard time, Johnny and his allies make a decision that spins the situation horribly out of control...

The character of Jake is played by Ben Foster, and I think he did an amazing job. Some people have suggested that he overacted his part, but I disagree. I think he was very convincing as a strung-out, aggressive, creep of a skinhead. Johnny Truelove, the young gangster, is played by Emile Hirsch, and his role is light years removed from anything he's done so far, and he's as equally impressive and convincing as Ben Foster - just as menacing and intimidating. Actually, he appears almost as though it's not a part he's playing, he's really some thug they plucked off the streets and put in front of a camera. Very impressive. This character in real life is known as Jesse James Hollywood, and he is the youngest person ever to be on the FBI's 'most wanted' list.

Zack is played by Anton Yelchin, and he's is everything his character requires him to be; young, naive, even a little endearing, and most of all desperate for a little excitement in his life. The role of Frankie is performed by Justin Timberlake, and I must admit, he was better than I would have initially given him credit for. Actually, there wasn't a single actor or actress who was miscast in my opinion. All roles, big and small, were equally well played. I must not forget to mention the parents: Johnny's father is played by Bruce Willis, and even though his part is small, is it crucial. Sharon Stone plays Zack's mother, in a role that is gut wrenchingly emotional and very well played. Although there is one scene at the end where she wears a fat suit, and it's so obvious that it's distracting, and this is a discredit to an otherwise excellent and very important scene (but that's not her fault, of course).

What makes Alpha Dog so important, I think, is that's it's a testament of the times we live in. A time where, apparently nobody seems to be shocked anymore about the fact that young people in their teens and twenties lead a lifestyle of drugs and guns and no respect whatsoever for other people's lives and wellbeing. The ease with which some ideas and actions are executed, exemplifies and also amplifies the anarchy and devil-may-care attitude that lives within the hearts and minds of these people. Who cares if you beat a person to within an inch of his life. Who cares if you hurt, damage or even kill another human being, just so long as you can save your own neck. It's dog eat dog in the hierarchical food chain that is life, and this film is a disturbing reminder of that. I thought we'd moved on since the Dark Ages, but apparently I'm mistaken.

Aside from the heavy, moral message of this film (which, for once didn't tick me off, but really engaged me), I must also praise it on a technical level. It really is very well made, and it draws you in from the very first second with the beautifully edited opening scene. Director Nick Cassavetes ('John Q') has constructed the story into a balanced, properly paced whole, seemingly letting his actors run free and do what they do best, creating a spontaneous, natural feel and environment. The music is excellent and well dosed.

Alpha Dog is a film that you must see at least once if you care about this world and the people in it. It is a portrait of frighteningly laconic individuals and the shockingly low bar to unnecessary violence, and it shows just how easy it is for young people to get involved with all the wrong influences, simply because they have not yet lived enough to know any better, or lack the proper role models to show them alternative ways.

I cannot recommend this film enough. It's heavy - but very, very much worth it.
_(October 2012)_ || You ever have that dream: the one where you did something... You don't know why, but you can never go back?

Alpha Dog is a filmic interpretation of the real life Jesse James Hollywood/Nicholas Markowitz case of 2000.

We are in the company of young dope dealers, a group of wannabe gangsters who ultimately are way out of their depth, whose decisions are so moronically misguided they form the basis for what is the tragedy of this story. Directed by Nick Cassavetes, the pic has serious intentions but never quite gets to reach the greatest heights for dramatic verve purpose. Yet for all that, after being in the company of genuine lost boys and girls, watching them as 24 hour party people bluster for majority of the piece, it means that once the tragedy strikes the film has done its job. It becomes something to last in the memory, where Cassavetes' flashy techniques (split-screens - freeze frames etc) don't detract from the harsh reality of it all. There's a bunch of committed exuberant performances on show, with a roll call of then up and coming young actors to note. 7/10"

There was some good stuff to this one when it mattered. One of it's best parts was it's big actions scenes early on with there being two really great chase scenes through the forest in here. The first one is really great, with the suspense of not knowing what's going to happen during the course of the scene, and that makes the initial set-ups with the group appearing at the ceremonial grounds with the prisoner stuck in the middle. Once it switches over to the hunt, it becomes all the greater with the atmosphere from the imposing forest being used to perfection, the wolves' chase is rather fun and the whole thing is a big plus. The second one works with pretty much the same points but with the added benefit of featuring a really nice werewolf battle at the same time. The battle is quite long and enjoyable, using the surroundings and setting quite nicely with the action coming from the realistic wolves that can only be done that way, and it becomes quite exciting. Another rather good part about it is the film's action-packed ending, which is all sorts of awesome from the energetic and engaging street chase where they're jumping around the buildings to the big confrontations inside the hideout. The hideout sequences are the best, with a fine mixture between gunfights, brawling, wanton destruction and even some explosions placed in the mix to end the film on a high-point. The last plus here is the fact that the mythology with the werewolves is impressive and incredibly original, using a lot of the facts known while mixing it in with the new facts presented make for some great times. These here are the film's good points while there were some pretty big flaws to this one. One of the biggest problems is that the film uses real wolves for the transformation into werewolves. It's a cheap ploy, doesn't for the slightest look anywhere near convincing and makes it seem like a horror film was the furthest thing possible from the makers, which isn't a good sign. This is just lazy and makes the whole movie feel quite cheap in the process, besides looking wrong and oddly out-of-place. That feeling also works on the romance angle in here which just feels so tacked on just to have it here that it serves no point. Add onto that the fact that they constitute so much time in the middle segment of the film that almost nothing at else takes place during these scenes, making them quite dull and boring all around. The last flaw is the tameness of the film which is perfectly captured by the rating, which takes out much of the opportunities for this one to be entertaining since it can't show too much blood or gore, and the werewolf kills can't be too intense as the rating implies, which is what really hampers this one here with a series of off-screen or completely bloodless kills in here. These here are the big damaging factors to this one.

Rated PG-13: Violence and Language. || ***Dynamic Bucharest werewolf flick feels like it’s in a rush*** 

Two former-American youths meet in Bucharest, Romania, and develop an affinity for each other (Agnes Bruckner & Hugh Dancy). But one of them is a traditional werewolf (a person who can morph into an actual wolf) and is reluctant to pursue a relationship with a regular human. Meanwhile the city’s pack leader (Olivier Martinez) wants the pretty young thing for himself and so sends his son (Bryan Dick) to get rid of the dude.

""Blood and Chocolate"" (2007) was based on the 1997 book by Annette Curtis Klause and debuted 22 months before “Twilight” (2008), which was based on the 2005 novel by Stephenie Meyer. As such, don’t expect a “Twilight” clone.

What’s great about this movie is the magnificent Bucharest locations and the polished kinetic style and great music, not to mention the decent cast. There are elements of “An American Werewolf in Paris” (1997), “The Howling” (1981), “Wolfen” (1981), “Wolves” (2014) and “Twilight” (2008). The last two came out later, of course; I’m just providing reference points.

Unfortunately, ""Blood and Chocolate"" starts out like it’s in a rush, like it’s trying to cram too much material into the first 15 minutes plus cater to people with ADHD. It eventually finds its footing just enough to enjoy it, for the most part, but it needed more room to breathe. The flick only runs 97 minutes; another 20-22 minutes would’ve done wonders. As it is, it feels like it lacks the confidence to slow down and take its time.

As far as comparisons to the book go, the filmmakers dumbed down the plot (naturally) and made it more ""hip.” The book's message was to accept who you are and don't try to be something you're not while the movie's moral is to not let others determine your identity, customs or destiny; go after what you want and do not allow yourself be limited by the hand dealt you or what others say.

I actually wanted to like this film, because I enjoyed the Pang Bros. previous well-known horror film ""The Eye"" and for that reason alone, I had some really high hopes with this one too. Well, I guess it was my bad and I must say now that I'm genuinely disappointed; since I was expecting something that would be just as dark and scary as ""The Eye"", considering that we are talking about the same directors, but this time, they even had a bigger budget to work with. Proof that good directors can screw it up (or at least in my humble opinion) and that won't have anything to do with the financial resources.

In ""The Messengers"", the Solomon family, moves to an isolated farm, with the purpose of starting a new life and leaving an unpleasant memory behind. However, as soon as they arrive to their new house, the teenage daughter Jess, starts to experience some really odd situations and she claims to see people living inside the cellar. Creatures that are not in peace with themselves and need to give her a message before it's too late. However, her parents, who are pretty much fed up with her and her dreadful behavior, don't believe a word she says. Unfortunately, it is only a matter of time for them to realize that Jess may not be lying this time, after all and that there's actually something in that house…something that has been waiting in the dark for a few years and is waiting to be released.

I won't complain about the fact that these kinds of stories were already told about a thousand times. I'm not one of those movie fans who complain about the lack of innovation when it comes to the plot. Honestly, I think most films (especially horror films) out there, share a decent number of similarities and while many reviews comment on the simplicity and unoriginality of the plot, I will mainly focus on the fact that this film is overall not scary, which is my main concern. It seems like The Pang Bros. basically sold their talent to the devil, just to enter in the American film industry, without realizing that there was no need to copy the most superfluous and silly PG-rated contemporary horror flicks. ""The Messengers"" turns out to be one of those movies where nothing really happens...ever. It's just a nice variety of hallucinations and situations that end up being reduced to ""Did it really happen or was it just my imagination?"". No, I'm sorry but I just had about enough with these nonsense. I suppose the real action starts happening during the last twenty minutes, but that just doesn't do it for me. The denouement turns out to be somehow far-fetched and it left me with the hateful ""That's it?"" feeling inside my head. Overall, not the worst movie ever and it's not like it is unwatchable. It happens to be entertaining for moments and it has a small number of well-done ghostly sequences that made the whole thing endurable in some way. I also enjoyed the scenes with the crows, since they reminded me a lot of ""The Birds"", which is like partying with an old best friend, or something like that. The music during the opening and final credits is in my opinion the actual high point and that is not a very good sign, unfortunately. Another thing that is not exactly a good sign, would be the overhead microphone that can be seen more than once during the film. No comments about that little detail. || Bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

I actually like Kristen Stewart, and I think she performed decently in this, but she worked her ass off carrying the movie.  John Corbett was the only other person pulling their weight in this movie.

The story itself was okay, but it does have a lot of problems.  My biggest was just their defiance of reality.

The ""in you face"" thing is that the farm is plague with ""crows"" that are clearly ravens.  This is done because you can train ravens much easier, but they're GIANT birds by average comparison of what size birds most people see.  And then they do stupid things like leave feed out far enough away from where you would take it (those are not light bags), and when birds come, he shoos them farther into the car as the trunk is the only part open.

They are planting sunflower seeds, which just means lots of things trying to eat it, but the timeline is all over the place.  They go to plant seeds, and there are tiny plants in the background.  There is an incident early on, then what seems like a week passes, but then it's almost end of harvest.  And then there is still a giant bag of seeds to plant, and it isn't part of the harvest because it's by itself and I don't think they start harvesting during the movie.

There is also the mold which she doesn't seem to know how to treat or why it would come back...just silly.  But its details like these that show how poorly written the script is, especially the dialogue.

The effects are actually pretty interesting, they did a good job on the birds, the wall, and the ""flowing ground"" was really interesting, but it's not enough to have a cool effect or two.  You might as well, just have lots of odd explosions then.

Overall, just not worth the watch, unless you want to see a movie where Kristen Stewart is objectively the best actor. || _**Little Haunted House on the Prairie**_

A troubled family from Chicago (Dylan McDermott, Penelope Ann Miller and Kristen Stewart) moves to the prairie of North Dakota after purchasing a dilapidated farmhouse where they plant a sunflower crop. Unfortunately, the estate’s past interrupts their enjoyment of their new home. John Corbett plays a drifter who hires-on while Dustin Milligan plays the daughter’s potential beau.

“The Messengers” (2007) is a haunted house flick from the Pang brothers of Hong Kong, which is their first American film. The basic set-up is exactly the same as “Cold Creek Manor” (2003) with the difference of a rundown farmhouse substituting for the woodsy manor. From there it throws in elements of “The Grudge” movies mixed with “The Amityville Horror” and “The Birds.” 

While I appreciated the colorful prairie setting, this is easily the least of these because the story is too simplistic and dramatically dull. Fans of Kristen might be interested though; she was 16 during shooting.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot at Indian Head and nearby Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, which are just a couple hours’ drive north of the border of North Dakota.

Indeed, director Peter Webber and author Thomas Harris bring us Hannibal Lector (ne: Lecter) the formative years. Off the bat you have to say it's not overtly a horror film, something which has proved to have annoyed many who ventured in expecting something different. Which on one hand is a shame because it's a very effective thriller, ripe with literary smarts and boasting some very good acting performances. While there is horrors around, genuine ones that history has taught us as fact.

On the other hand it is a disappointment to fans of the Hannibal series, and to horror fans in general. The marketing didn't help, it was sold to all and sundry along the lines as the cannibal begins in earnest, thus nobody was quite prepared for the fact Hannibal was a normal kid once, even human! Once the pic kicks into being a revenge killer thriller, it lacks an emotional wallop, with the screenplay shaking too many eggs in the basket and not coming up with a tasty fava bean based omelet.

Who knew Lars von Trier could make us laugh? In ""The Boss of It All"", he doesn't just satirize corporate culture - he dismantles artistic pretension with surgical comedic precision.

The film opens with von Trier himself, reflected in a window, perched in a cherry picker camera dolly - a literal deus ex machina, playing God while simultaneously mocking the very concept of directorial omnipotence. Here, he's gleefully playing God and immediately undermining himself.

Using Automavision, a computer program that randomly determines camera angles, von Trier literally relinquishes directorial control. It's a brilliant mirror of the film's narrative: Ravn hiring an actor to be a fictional boss, thus avoiding personal responsibility. The director becomes just another actor in his own absurdist play.

Kristoffer, the hired ""boss"", embodies this perfectly. ""I have to consult my character,"" he says - a line that skewers both corporate role-playing and Dogme 95's Rule 6, which demands that action must be motivated solely by character emotion. It's a delicious mockery of the very artistic constraints von Trier champions.

Ultimately, von Trier's message is disarmingly simple: Don't take life - or art - so seriously. It's only life, after all. It may even mirror the ""senior six"" throwing the beloved Teddy Bear over the cliff.

A comedy that's also a profound philosophical joke? This is vintage Lars von Trier!"

Johnny after many years is provoked by devil again to kill Blackheart, Devil's own son and turns him into Ghost Rider. And the story goes on from punishing evil souls till the punishing of the Biggest Evil itself. The movie turned out to be a Decent Hit even though it did not perform well at the box office but still the way the character was portrayed and the way the graphics turned out jaw dropping is something we cant miss.
Well to be True Ghost Rider is one of the most coolest Marvel Character ever portrayed by one of the Biggest Hollywood Star. || The problem is Ghost Rider isn't bad enough to be up there with the Nicolas Cage ""classics"", and it's not good enough to be seen as a fun time at the movies. It kind of just exists in this rather bland netherrealm where mildly entertaining meets instantly forgettable. Eva Mendes is terrible and Sam Elliot is great, so the acting in this movie is all over the place.

Sure, I love any scene where Nicolas Cage starts freaking out as he changes into the Rider. Or the scene where he tries to scare him self by going ""booga booga"" in front of the mirror. It's especially great when the half rendered fire skull shows up (seriously, how did the studio approve this effect?). But they're few and far between. Better just watch the You Tube clips then. || _**""You can't live in fear""**_

Johnny Blaze and his father make a living as Evel Knieval-like stunt riders in a carnival. When dad is diagnosed with cancer Johnny is misled into making a foolish deal with the devil, which results in his being cursed to become the Ghost Rider – a supernatural flaming skeleton.

Mark Steven Johnson's ""Ghost Rider"" (2007) combines Faust and Spider-Man and mixes in elements of all the variations of the Ghost Rider comics up to the present, including the 50's Western hero, but its main inspiration is the 70s-80s comic featuring Johnny Blaze as the protagonist.

What makes Ghost Rider appealing? Well, the only thing cooler than a guy in black leather and chains driving a Harley is a flaming skeleton in black leather and chains driving a supernatural flaming Harley. That pretty much explains it.

Some criticize Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze because Blaze is supposed to be about 30 years old, while Cage was around 41. I suppose someone like James Franco would have been better for the role, especially since Franco looks exactly like Mike Ploog's version of Blaze, but Cage does a fine job. Besides, Cage is in great shape and I know guys 25 years old who look older than him. As for Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's girlfriend, she's ten years younger than Cage and is both voluptuous and adequate in the role.

Some criticize the film as too serious, others as too goofy, but the fact is that ""Ghost Rider"" has the same general tone as all the other superhero flicks released since 2000. It's a serious story for the most part, although completely unbelievable due to the subject matter, with bits of humor thrown in for good measure. In other words, it's neither deathly serious nor a campy goof-fest; it rides the line between these two extremes.

If all you want out of ""Ghost Rider"" is an entertaining supernatural superhero flick ""Ghost Rider"" delivers and is worth viewing for this purpose. But the film delivers on a deeper level. Here is a smattering of noteworthy elements: 

Note that Johnny is misled into ""selling his soul"" to the devil and has to face the negative consequences of his decision. Few people will literally ""sell their soul"" to Satan but we can all relate to the struggle with the evil that exists within our own hearts. If we decide to live according to the inclinations of our lower, destructive, selfish nature are we not, in a sense, ""selling our soul"" to the devil; that is, giving over our lives to evil? (regardless of whether you view the devil as a literal spiritual being or merely as a symbol of potential human evil). Whenever we choose to live according to this lower nature will we not automatically perform evil and, in that sense, fulfill the devil's will?

Peter Fonda as Satan is perfect and entertaining, as is Sam Elliott as the old Westerner.

Love is an important theme in the story. Johnny ""sells his soul"" for love of his father. He didn't do it for greed or some other carnal purpose. This is agape love, self-sacrificial love, love in its highest and purest form, which puts Johnny on God's side (as Elliott's character observes) and makes him a serious threat to the devil's purposes on earth.

We also witness Blaze's great love for Roxanne and vice versa, as well as Mack's love for Johnny, etc.

This is contrasted by the total absence of love in Satan's kingdom. The devil hates his son and vice versa. This is a fitting depiction because God is described as love in the Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be an enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy. Hate in all its ugly manifestations is therefore the essence of the devil's kingdom and relationships.

When Blaze first turns into the Ghost Rider and goes for a ride in his flame cycle he causes great havoc wherever he goes. You'll note that this is toned down in his later excursions as Ghost Rider. The explanation? Johnny simply didn't know how to control the supernatural hellfire and ""spirit of vengeance"" during his initial conversion.

Although it's supposed to be amusing, it makes sense that Johnny would listen to The Carpenters in his down time. Blaze's daredevil lifestyle and his problems with the Ghost Rider curse would understandably cause him a great deal of stress. Listening to Karen's ultra-soothing voice would be a great pacifier.

There's a great scene of Ghost Rider riding off the top of a skyscraper, whipping his chain in exulting fury, and then riding full blast down the building smashing into the pavement below as police and onlookers observe in total disbelief.

In the comics Blackheart was the only comic character that ever sent chills down my spine (in Ann Nocenti's Daredevil). I didn't get this feeling from Wes Bentley's portrayal in the film, although there's a hint of that. Regardless, Bentley does a fine job in the role. And Blackheart's ugly wickedness is certainly revealed or demonstrated here and there.

There's a great musical interlude featuring the Ghost Rider and the Caretaker (Elliott) riding through the night desert for hundreds of miles to San Vengaza. Fittingly, the song is a modern hard rock version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky."" (I love that song! Who doesn't?) 

The Ghost Rider himself (itself?) is a triumph of special effects. Needless to say, the film is enjoyable just to look at.

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, with the Extended Cut running 13 minutes longer. It was shot in Melbourne, Australia, and other areas of Victoria.

The story was huge news so there's not so much jeopardy, nor does Billy Ray really try to manufacture any.

Police Constable Nicholas Angel is the pride of the London Service, trouble is is that he is making everybody else look bad, so much so his superiors promote him to Sergeant in the sleepy village of Sandford, Gloucestershire. Yet all is not right with Sandford as the locals start meeting grizzly deaths, thus thrusting Angel into his biggest case so far.

The biggest question on most film goers lips was could the pairing of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg triumphantly follow the monster cult success of Shaun Of The Dead? Well the plot premise for Hot Fuzz hardly leaps out as something to grab the attention span of many, but they have crafted a tremendously funny film that winks at the action genre with genuine love and admiration.

Simon Pegg and his trusty sidekick, Nick Frost, clearly have an earthbound appeal that many (even outside of Britain) can warm too, not pretty or over svelt, these guys are fans of movies making movies purely for the fans, and it shows. Neither Pegg or Frost try to steal scenes from each other, both men after over a decade of working together are clearly comfortable with their coupling and thus manage to fine tune their working chemistry.

Once Angel (Pegg) lands at Sandford Village we are introduced to a ream of British Village stereotypes (archetypes actually), all characters ripe for hilarious scenarios that our fish out water (big city cop) Sergeant struggles to comprehend. We observe as he is dumb struck at the ineptitude of the Village Police Force (erm service actually) and is then forced to work alongside dough eyed Constable Butterman (a film stealing Frost). Angel's exasperation at where he finds himself is mirthful joy to us the viewers. The dialogue is priceless, one liners and hat tipping nods to the action genre come thick and fast, in fact you can watch Hot Fuzz repeatedly and play spot the homage each time. I mean come on people, we got both James Bond (a delicious turn from Timothy Dalton) and Belloq in here strutting their stuff. The action set pieces are not found wanting either, director Wright having the time of his life with the crash bang wallop that flows in the final third.

The test of a great comedy is how it stands up to repeat viewings, to me Hot Fuzz delivers no matter how many times it is viewed. For even when you know what is coming up next, the smile on your face is already there before the event, wonderful, wonderful film made by guys who love movies as much as ourselves. 10/10 || I was not sure what to expect from this movie that I found on Netflix a while ago while browsing through the catalog. The movie poster makes it look like a hard-boiled police action movie but reading the reviews it became clear that it was more of a comedy. I had not heard of the movie before but it generally got good reviews so the other evening me and the boys sat down to watch it.

This is a fun movie. A good, old-fashioned British comedy. The core story could very well have been a serious crime story but the way it is implemented makes it so incredibly silly in a fun way. It starts off pretty much right away when PC Angel is told that he will be promoted but moved, because he makes the rest if the bunch of the dimwits at the precinct look bad, to a small British town where the most fun you can have is to watch the grass grow or get drunk and from there it goes downhill for Angel.

His new colleagues are somewhat weird not to mention more or less useless when it comes to police work. The by-the-book Angel is getting more and more frustrated and his only friend is the son of his new boss, whom he arrested on the first day by the way. When the grizzly “accidents” starts to happen the movie, in particular the explanations as to why they are “accidents” and not crimes, become more and more absurd. The special effects guys seems to have learned a trick or two from the Monty Python gang when it comes to over the top gory blood splattered scenes by the way.

In the final showdown between Angel and the totally whacko gang that keeps the town “clean” by deadly serious methods is short references to great many action movies. The amount of shots fired and the ratio of misses versus actual hits is nothing short of ludicrous. It was just so absurdly funny that it is difficult to describe.

If you are in the mood for some good solid British comedy then I can recommend this one. It is a very well done comedy and a lot more enjoyable than the get drunk and/or fall on your arse and/or and puke all over the place “comedies” that comes thirteen to the dozen today."

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

While I wouldn't normally consider clairvoyance ""time travel"", the way it is implemented in this movie is essentially time shifting.  He ""thinks"" himself forward in time, and then essentially time shifts himself backwards to a time before he witnesses the consequence.

It's such an interesting concept, but potentially un-cinematic.  They honestly do an amazing job of displaying Nicholas Cage standing in place to ""see"" and making it seem interesting.

Juliane Moore helps by being a badass lady in charge, but Jessica Biel (a proven entity herself) just doesn't have the opportunity to be little more than a damsel.  Cage carries most of the movie, but is a lot less ""crazy"" than he is in other movies, if that is any comfort.

Definitely check this out next time you're looking for an ""out of the box"" action flick. || Entertaining if not uneven sci-fi thriller. Nic Cage was fine but it was weird having a guy in his mid-50s (adding black hair coloring didn't make him look younger) wooing a woman in her early 30s, and given the romance was a good part, that is a big strike against. Another strike was some shoddy CGI, seems like they didn't have the budget that would match the action sequences.

It possibly doesn't help that much of the drama is set in a wet and gloomy 19th century England but Ioan Gruffudd as the pioneering abolitionist William Wilberforce comes across as weedy and lacklustre. The same can be said for Benedict Cumberbatch's Prime Minister William Pitt and for the most part this felt like a chronological history lesson instead of a drama that enthused me with the controversial issues of a debate that took all but a decade to reach a meaningful parliamentary vote. There is little of substance to what debate there was and whilst the film makes no bones about the position it takes, it does not flesh out the arguments out using rigorous discussion or characterisation to help illustrate just why it all took so long; just why the populace were indifferent to these atrocities. I found that this just overly relied on our own repugnance for the subject matter to bother developing the themes interestingly and provocatively - and I found myself struggling with it as it neared the two hour mark.

PLOT

Is this some hillbilly reality show type of thing?--Kat

Eight young college students are on their way to Florida for spring break when they all take a shortcut through a southern town who has a strange way of showing southern hospitality.

MY THOUGHTS

I see our barb-a-cuties got the skewering rod raring to go.--Mayor Buckman

We have eight interesting kills. I’m not counting the town people who died over 150 years earlier. We get drawn and quartered, acid funneled down one's throat, a bell crushing someone, and that’s just three of them. One of the more painful ones that had me cringe was when the two girls rammed a rod through Ricky’s ass going all the way through him and coming out his mouth. Ouch! All of the kills were decently made and creative. 

We have some great genre actors in 2001 Maniacs. Robert England (known as Freddy Krueger in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and several other horror movies) plays Mayor Buckman, the mayor of Pleasant Valley, a confederate town during the Civil War days where northern aggressors wiped out the town. And Lin Shaye (known for Critters 1-2, Hood of Horror, Insidious franchise, A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 and New Nightmare, Ouija, and several other horror movies. She’s also the sister of Producer Robert Shaye.) plays Granny Boone, kind of the matriarch of the town. Both did great with their roles.

The rest of the actors did a decent job with their roles. The college kids were just annoying enough that you rooted for them to die. The exception is Anderson and Joey who you hoped would live but die in the end.

We start with 3 college friends who are heading for Florida for spring break. At a gas station they run into 3 other people also going to Florida. Anderson, one of the guys from the original group has his eyes on the hot blonde from the second group. Joey seems to like him too, but they go their separate ways. 

The next day our three guys find a small town called Pleasant Valley that is having a summer celebration called Guts and Glory. They decide to check out the celebration because everyone is so friendly. Soon after they arrive, the other group of friends show up there as well, followed by a biker couple. Somehow the mayor and the townspeople get them to stay overnight. Despite their racist comments about the biker couple who are African American and Asian. 

One of the young ladies eyes one hick and she goes off with him to make out. He blindfolds her and when he takes the blindfold off, all her limbs are tied to different horses. He makes a comment and then sets the horses off, tearing off her arms and legs.

For the rest of the movie they are basically singled out and killed. One guy is seduced by a milkmaid and pressured into funneling what he thought was moonshine, which turns out to be acid.

The next day the girls are sent with Granny Boone to get pampered and dancing. We have two girls left when Joey decides to leave and find Anderson. At this point Ricky shows up and joins in the fun. Unfortunately while the girls are singing they don’t pay attention to the words. If they had then they may have lived. The one girl there stands under a bell and Granny Boone pulls a rope, dropping the bell on her, killing her. 

Ricky runs off, but is captured by the guy he hooked up with the night before. He gets a pretty painful ending. They have him held over a table while two girls ram a rod up his butt, coming out of his mouth.

Now at this point, why are the remaining people not wondering where their friends are? Finally Joey does when one girl is holding her friend's dog tags that she would never have let anyone have.

The one nerdy friend (which all of these kinds of movies have) finally gets a girl to pay attention to him. Unfortunately, while she is going down on him, she puts in her mouth some sort of metallic teeth. And you can guess what she does. Yep, she bites his dick off.

Now the biker guy is wondering where his girlfriend is when he thinks he sees her run off. He chases her and it turns out not to be her. He gets caught and killed by some sort of press that the townspeople push until his eyes pop out.

It’s down to our last two survivors: Joey and Anderson. She is tied to a chair and Anderson to the table. Anderson gets free and fights the mayor, only to force him to let them go. The mayor gives his word that they can go and the couple drive off on the motorcycle.

The next morning the couple shows up to the police station telling the cops what happened. The sheriff (?) takes them back to the location and it’s just a graveyard. He tells them how over 150 years ago the northern army came through and killed everyone. He explains that every year some drunk college kids pull pranks saying the same thing they were saying. 

Anderson apologizes and says they will leave. As they leave the area they end up hitting a wire that beheads them. The final victims of Pleasant Valley that year.

Overall, I found this movie a fun, bloody and gory ride. There were times I was rooting for the college kids to die as well as the townspeople. I found the movie was made really well and if you don’t mind the nudity (LOL), and some of the rather colorful language, then you should check out this movie. If nothing else, for the kills and the great Robert England and Lin Shaye.

And now for your Forever Final Girl Exclusive…Did you know?:

Robert Englund and Lin Shaye appeared in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994), and Wish You Were Dead (2001).
2001 Maniacs serves as both a sequel, as well as soft reboot to Herschell Gordon Lewis’ 1964 cult classic Two Thousand Maniacs.
The plot point of the massacred town in Georgia was loosely inspired by General Sherman’s destructive march through Georgia, which left Atlanta burnt to the ground.
Both Tim Sullivan and Chris Kobin (screenwriter) returned 5 years later to make a sequel, 2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams. However, Robert Englund was recast without his knowledge.
There were two notable cameos: Kane Hodder plays a man who seizes Anderson right before the big fight between Anderson and Mayor Buckman. And Eli Roth who plays a man whose armadillo is hit by a car near the beginning of the movie. He plays the same character he played in his own feature directorial debut, 2002 Cabin Fever.

I have seen it written that this film shows that Fincher had grown up, and whilst I understand that train of thought, it simply isn't true. What Fincher has done is give a true story his meticulous care and standard deft precision by leaving no stone unturned. We get simply one of the (if not thee) best films to deal with the investigating process of a high profile serial killer, a film that as a character study is actually essential viewing in the pantheon of genre productions.

The devilish greatness of this film is in the fact that it can't pay off with a pandering mainstream ending, the makers are telling a true story and any sort of research will lead viewers to the fact that there is no twist here, no joyous ticket selling round of applause at this ending, it is what it is, frustratingly brilliant. The case the film is about consumes all involved with it, and to see how it affects those involved is engrossing (yet sad) because if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board then it will consume you as well, the film and the actors within demand you see this for the affecting character piece it is.

The acting here gives me hope that classic acting is alive and well in this generation, I was once not enamoured with Mark Ruffalo in his early days as an actor, but here he puts such heartfelt verve into the role of David Toschi I felt I need to send him a written apology!. Robert Downey Junior is joyous as Paul Avery, all 60s chic and swagger without tipping over the edge of the mountain caricature (both men to become future Avengers of course). Yet surprisingly to me I found that it is Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith who is the film's key axis, the central heartbeat, with a performance that demands undivided attention, a performance brought about by Fincher's quest for perfection from everything to do with film making. Gyllenhaal hated working on the film, he hated Fincher's work ethic, but in time he must now look back and see that here the director coaxed out a performance that has in time been seen as not only great, but also beneficial to his career (hello Nightcrawler).

This is not Se7en 2, and British film mags like Empire should have known better than to use that tag line to get the readers' attention, because fans of serial killer thrillers need not apply here, fans of outstanding cinema about the human psyche during the pursuit of a serial killer - Well get in line folks, for this is one of the best movies of the decade. 10/10 || If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

If you've been following me closely for the past week, I'm currently (re)watching five of David Fincher's films in preparation for his next movie, Mank, which premieres on Netflix in a couple of weeks. I've already revisited Se7en and Fight Club, two iconic films that not only profoundly impacted filmmaking but also our culture. However, Zodiac isn't one of Fincher's most popular movies, and maybe that's one of the reasons why I'm watching it for the very first time. Based on a real story, Fincher's first non-fiction adaptation is also one of the longest films of his career. I didn't know anything about the true events before watching this movie, which leads me to the biggest compliment I can offer to this type of film.

There are hundreds of characteristics that a viewer can observe, analyze, and through them, ultimately form an overall opinion about a movie. Nevertheless, when it comes to cinematic adaptations of a true story, there's always one aspect that I value tremendously, which is how much the film convinces me to research about its story after I finish watching it. Truth is, midway through Zodiac, I started to acknowledge its lengthy duration. Don't be mistaken. It's not what people call a ""slow movie"", much on the contrary. It's long, yes, but it's packed with non-stop, rapid-fire dialogues that Fincher himself asked the actors to speed up so that the runtime wouldn't stretch even more.

Throughout the entire film, I feel the exact same manner as the main characters. For the first hour or so, the case is ramping up, the murders increase in quantity, new developments emerge, just like new suspects, letters, ciphers, and everything that comes with dealing with this serial killer. During this period, I feel extremely captivated, but then comes a phase where the characters themselves start to give up due to the lack of concrete evidence to finally convict a suspect. I feel the frustration, depression, and even the infuriating absence of a clear path to the killer. However, Robert Graysmith's (Jake Gyllenhaal) obsession with the case starts becoming my own, and the last thirty minutes are incredibly stressful, frightful, and enthusiastic.

Zodiac possesses 157 minutes, mostly consisting of talking and only a couple of stylish, slow-motion murder scenes, so obviously, this is a dialogue-driven narrative. James Vanderbilt's screenplay is packed with detailed characterization, extensive conversations, and from what I could gather, an impressive historical accuracy. Fincher and Vanderbilt prove their unbelievable commitment with the mind-blowing preparation for this flick, which basically included an entirely unique investigation on the real case (interviewing the people who give life to the movie's protagonists, family members, police departments, witnesses, etc.). Yet another evidence that supports the importance of the pre-production phase in filmmaking.

So, in case I forget to answer my own question, Zodiac achieved its primary mission. As soon as the film ended, I found myself googling everything about the real case, trying to find out new information, obsessed with the intriguing story. It doesn't even matter if the viewer loves the movie or not, its impact is undeniable since most people will feel the same urgency to understand more about the real case. Two other attributes deeply contribute to this result: the cast and the editing. The latter is performed by Angus Wall, and his work is some of the best film editing I've ever witnessed. It's the main reason why the huge runtime feels adequate and why the narrative moves so well. No wonder almost every job of his got so many award nominations.

Finally, the actors are all extraordinary. Mark Ruffalo (Dave Toschi), Anthony Edwards (Bill Armstrong), Robert Downey Jr. (Paul Avery), and Jake Gyllenhaal portray distinct, well-developed characters who deal with the case in their own way. Obsession is definitely the fundamental social theme present in the movie, depicted differently with each character. Armstrong completely moves on and never looks back. Toschi tries to forget, but he can't accept that he failed to do his job. Avery develops a mental condition and/or addiction due to its inability to deal with the pressure, stress, and frustration of reporting the case. Graysmith lets his total obsession over Zodiac impact his personal life, affecting his family in the process.

Fincher is able to represent each and every one of these behaviors in an astonishingly realistic fashion. The use of long uninterrupted takes helps the conversations flow better, and the simple, non-distracting camera work from Harry Savides lets the viewer focus on who they're listening to. It's one of those films which I can't really point out direct flaws. There's that period during the second act where I start to feel tired and worn out, and despite the irreprehensible dedication to providing every single bit of knowledge about the actual events, it's still an enormous amount of information to process, which made me feel a bit lost occasionally. Fortunately, the movie ends strongly, culminating in a simple yet powerful exchange of looks.

All in all, Zodiac gains the most generous praise that a film based on a true story can ever receive from me. James Vanderbilt's screenplay convinced me to research everything about the real events as soon as the movie finished, which is undeniably an impactful effect of watching such a well-written, captivating narrative with well-developed, authentic characters. David Fincher's commitment to being as historically accurate as possible is visible on-screen, a remarkable result of a massive preparation that very few filmmakers would even think about performing. With some of the best editing work in the history of cinema, the lengthy runtime flows better than expected, but the amount of information to digest is overwhelming and tiresome, dropping the levels of entertainment, especially during a certain period of the second act. Nevertheless, a phenomenal third act, three outstanding performances from Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., and Jake Gyllenhaal, and an emotionally compelling, realistic approach to extreme obsession turn the entire film into one of the best of its genre. Another massive recommendation from this side.

Rating: A- || A great character driven crime-drama with wonderful performances from Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey Jr. Been a few years since I last saw this one but decided to give it a re-watch (seen it I think five times now including the rated version in theaters and then DVD). Even though it's 2.75 hours, never gets dull and is engrossing through and through, even if the conclusion might not be accurate. **4.5/5**"

For large portions of <em>'Pusher 3'</em> I was not truly feeling it as it was giving major 6/10 vibes, yet by the time it's gut-wrenching (pardon the pun?) final few scenes had concluded I actually wasn't unhappy with what I had just sat through. As noted, I do believe it's below the original two flicks but it kinda works still.

The major reason for that is Zlatko Burić. I'm not sure what it is about his (relatively low-key) acting but I just really enjoy watching him perform. He's solid enough in the 1996 and 2004 flicks and I like him in <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">2012</a>, so finally getting to see him in a lead role I was actually unsure if he was lead worthy - but he is, just about. Burić kept my interest in the film alive, that's a fact. I see he later 'reprised' the role of Milo in the 2012 remake... weirdly. I'll have to check it out one day.

The rest of the film doesn't spring any major thoughts into my head, if I'm truthful. I will not forget that final act though - they sure went there!"

In spite of my Classics degree, I won't complain about the divergences from recorded fact. The film is clearly meant to be a fantasy on historical themes instead of a faithful account of the event. Rather, what irked me was the hammy dialogue. There were the tropes of recent Hollywood battle scenes: warriors on the good guys' side defending themselves with little exertion as they trade silly quips about how they've got each other's backs. A queen gives an address to a council that is all melodrama -- are we back in George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels?

Having enjoyed <i>Sin City</i>, a film with a similar green screen approach, I thought that <i>300</i> would be enjoyable on the basis of its special effects, but alas it wasn't. For one, the cinematography is claustrophobic. All outdoor scenes but one were filmed with a green screen, and the digital backdrops add no depth. Even when supposedly standing on the Greek coast under a big sky, everyone seems like they are just standing around in a fairly small room. Also, the fight scenes seem more primitive than considering that this film followed years after <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>.

The little I can recommend <i>300</i> for is the variety of demonic monsters and exotic costumed assassins that fill the Persian army. As I said, this is a fantasy on historical themes, and the additions are often interesting. Still, I had a hard time sitting through the whole film. || Leather underwear and a cape is honestly such a Look™.

_300_ cops a lot of flak for being all style and no substance, and I'm not gonna stand here and lie to you by refuting that. What I will say however, is that style over substance does not inherently make a movie bad. _300_ is a lot of fun, you get what's going on, and there's some genuine rewatch value.

Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time. || Only the third time seeing this one, first time was in the theaters and then I think on DVD. Didn't care a whole lot in either viewing. So with the 4K being released, decided enough time had passed to give it another shot and... it was okay, a bit too stylized for my taste (and yes I know that's Snyder's thing) and lacks the emotional impact Snyder was going for, but there are some bad ass moments, including just Gerard Butler's overall performance, but didn't really do much for me otherwise.

Probably my least favorite of Snyder's movies, though haven't watched Sucker Punch in a long time. 3.0/5"

It seems like I may be one of the few who didn't like it and even though ""The Abandoned"" is a watchable horror/drama flick that can be mostly appreciated for the nice imagery, I mostly found it redundant and tedious. To me, it was like an hour and a half of pointless sequences and bogus scares and while I do appreciate creative and artistic dark imagery, it can become ineffective when the story is not held properly. I mean, directors like Dario Argento can get away with plain stories, pointless sequences and underdeveloped characters... because he makes his films entertaining and puzzling. Nacho Cerdá, on the other hand, cannot. flawless and the setup is brilliant as well, but the movie still doesn't work. Why? because it's tedious! I'm pretty sure that several ""serious"" movie lovers will claim that people who think this film is dull, it's because they are untrained watchers who can only appreciate torture porn and fast-paced films with a lot of action. Well, it's really not my case, because I actually have great tolerance for low-paced films. The low-pace, in several films serves a purpose, but not with this film.

In ""The Abandoned"", a film producer named Marie, who lives in the United States with her young daughter, goes back to her homeland in Russia, when she is informed that she has inherited an old house from her parents. Unfortunately for her, the place is situated in the middle of nowhere and Marie is not exactly familiarized with the Russian language or the culture in general. Without having a clue of anything, she intends to visit the place anyway with the help of a guide, who disappears in the middle of the night under strange circumstances. Completely desperate and with no one else to turn to, Marie starts looking for her guide, without realizing that something is waiting for her out there: Secrets from the past, that have been waiting for over 40 years, and that she's about to discover in the worst possible way.

This was really a great disappointment for me. I was expecting a promising story, exploring a family drama and all I got, was the same worn out plot about the impossibility of escaping fate and our past (I think we had enough of that silliness already). I guess ""The Abandoned"" is overall watchable. Definitely not a masterpiece, but still not the worst movie ever. A movie that is going to be appreciated mostly by people who are in favor of those long and unnecessary situations that lead to nothing whatsoever and video-game sequences that don't add anything at all. By the way, the story supposedly takes place in Russia, even though it was actually filmed in Bulgaria and they didn't do a very good job hiding it.

Starter for 10 is directed by Tom Vaughan and adapted to screenplay by David Nicholls from his own novel of the same name. It stars James McAvoy, Alice Eve, Rebecca Hall, Dominic Cooper, Benedict Cumberbatch, Catherine Tate and Elaine Tan. Music is by Blake Neely and cinematography by Ashley Rowe.

Set in 1985 England, working-class student Brian Jackson (McAvoy) navigates his first year at Bristol University - which lends him the opportunity to feature on his favourite ever TV Quiz Show - University Challenge.

I have never read the book so have no frame of reference there, thus the complaints from devotees of the written source are null and void to me. For I absolutely loved this film, a fresh and breezy coming of age comedy that's tinted with dramatic intelligence. How nice to have a pic of this genre ilk that's not built around trying to lose one's virginity, or standing up to bullies etc. For sure there's a whole load of angst on show, a bit of class distinction dichotomy, the perils of formative fumbling romances, and of course whimsy. Yet the framework of education, the thirst for knowledge and an understanding of the problems evident in the world at time of pic's setting, all make this a smarter than your average bear British rites of passage piece.

Cast are on splendid form to make the multidimensional characters work (each main character moves away from being mere caricatures). McAvoy is splendidly affable as Brian, who is still nursing the loss of his father years previously, and then has to watch as his mother (Tate) takes a lover - the local ice-cream man (John Henshaw). It's no easier at University, where he lusts after the blonde bomber (Eve) when in fact he obviously should cop on to the fact that the girl for him is bleeding heart socialist Rebecca Epstein (Hall) - but she isn't the quiz type! McAvoy has a good comedy way about him, gawkish but lovable and perfect when portraying Brian out of his depth in certain scenarios.

Of the others it's Cumberbatch who steals the show as Patrick Watts, an absolute toff, an upper class twit who has no comprehension of the working class system and the perils within that structure. He is burned by his miserable failure on University Challenge the previous year, his inadequacies and stubborness blinding him to the benefits that others around him can afford him. The facial expressions, the posh vocab speak and the need to be in charge are brought vividly to comic life by Cumberbatch. Eve smoulders as Alice, but deftly plays her vulnerabilities, Hall has her character down pat, while Cooper, Tate and James Corden leave favourable marks. As do Charles Dance and Lindsay Duncan in unforgettable scenes as Alice's parents.

The whole play is covered over with an 80s soundtrack, mixing student favourites with punky pop tunes, while the period detail for Brian's home life prior to going to University (Southend-On-Sea) has been given great nostalgic thought. A lot of the humour is sure to be too British for none UK folk, more so those not familiar with what the mid 1980s were like in Britain, while it has to be acknowledged that where the story ends up holds no surprises. Yet this holds many pleasures for the right audience, so fingers on the button and see if you get this starter for 10. || Starter for 10 is a fun and entertaining movie, and it’s even better because it stars three of my favorite actors—James McAvoy, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Alice Eve. James is great as Brian Jackson, a college student trying to fit in at university and make it onto the ""University Challenge"" quiz team. He really nails the mix of awkwardness and ambition, making his character super relatable.

Benedict is hilarious as the overly serious team captain, and Alice Eve adds a lot of charm as Brian’s crush. The cast really makes this movie shine, even if the story itself is pretty predictable. It’s your classic coming-of-age tale, but it’s done in such a fun way with a lot of humor and heart.

The soundtrack and 1980s vibe give it a nostalgic feel, and while it’s not perfect, it’s just one of those movies that’s really enjoyable to watch. If you love these actors like I do, it’s definitely worth checking out."

The movie focuses on one family’s ongoing battle: not merely against the monster but also struggling against the authorities who want to capture them, suspecting they have been infected with a virus by coming in contact with the creature.

The dialogue is pretty ordinary. I seem to recall a few unintentionally funny moments, though I cannot say for sure that it wasn’t due to the translation. I don’t intend to be hyper critical here: I sort of let the movie wash over me to get to the end, and you may or may not need to do the same.

Jane Austen was a nonconformist. She was the seventh child of an Anglican priest and belonged to what we might now call the middle class. She had many books at home, and both parents taught her to read and write, supported her, recognized in her the same talent we all know her now. Moreover, she was unlucky in love: it does not seem that her parents sought to marry her, it is quite plausible that she did not want to marry for economic reasons and the love affairs that we know of her were short and fruitless. With the publication, very shy, of her first editions, the writer's financial situation improved, and public recognition begin to appear. Sadly, the author died quite young, without collect the fruits of her talent.

I am not an expert on Jane Austen, but this is, very briefly, the author's biography, almost sketched in a stream. The film focuses on her youth and builds romantic fiction around her. Personally, I'm dubious about much of what happens in this movie. I think much of it is romantic invention, almost turning Austen into one of her own characters, torn between the attention of two very different suitors.

The film is not bad, but it is far from flawless and will never be one of the reference “biopics”, at least in my understanding. Julian Jarrold's direction was effective, but he gives us a work that bets more on the construction of the characters and the story than on the relationship between the film and the real life of the biographed person. The cinematography is good and there are some good effects. The soundtrack is mediocre. The period recreation was reasonably done, resorting to decent costumes and good locations and sets. In between, however, there are some grotesque errors and anachronisms: in the ball scene, Jane appears with a dress twenty years ahead of the time, in another scene we see wedding rings, something that did not exist at that time, and in another one we see Jane being recognized as the writer of a novel when, in fact, she published anonymously several of her books and got very little recognition in her lifetime. Even her epitaph, on her tomb in Winchester Cathedral, ignored her literary output until it was replaced by new text in the late 19th century.

In the midst of all this, the extraordinary dramatic interpretation of the actors stands out, and especially Anne Hathaway, who gave the character a touch of kindness mixed with a marked rebelliousness and nonconformity. She didn't want to be like other women. James McAvoy also does a very interesting job in this film and deserves our full attention. The film also has good performances by James Cromwell, Julie Walters, Maggie Smith and Ian Richardson."

The photography is good; we do get up close and personal with the frequently quite brutal action, but it appears that another side effect of surviving a mushroom cloud is a seeming invincibility when shot in the head at 5 paces - which after a while becomes really quite dull to watch.

“Black Book” (2006), aka “Zwartboek,” is a Euro WW2 film by Paul Verhoeven that balances drama, action, intrigue, romance and suspense. It’s reminiscent of contemporaneous flicks like “Inglourious Basterds” (2009) and “Valkyrie” (2008). It’s not great like the former, but it’s in the same league as the latter. 

Despite its length, the story movies along swiftly, albeit awkwardly on a couple occasions. Carice shines in the challenging key role and Koch is likable. There was one scene that I didn’t find convincing, but it was forgivable. Unfortunately there’s a twist in the last act involving a character that doesn’t gel with the character’s previous actions.   

The film runs 2 hours, 25 minutes, and was shot in the Netherlands with the bookend scenes filmed in Israel and studio work done in Brandenburg, Germany.

If ever there was a tagline that would instantly persuade audiences to leap up from their sofas, drive to the nearest cinema complex and purchase a couple of tickets, it’s this one. Sure, using a phrase from the Book of Numbers (as opposed to Exodus which is the primary plot device of the film...) certainly sets the religiously inclined tone, that eventually dissolves into the plagued river of blood but more on that later. It also indicates the unimaginative stupidity that ensues, leaving logic and science behind for a faith-based apocalyptic tale that is in need of some serious stoning. A professor in debunking miracles is invited to investigate a “river of blood” in the nearby town of Haven, but is quickly ensnared in an apocalyptic mystery.

Whilst not the worst horror film in the existence of cinema, with a tepid schlocky tone that somewhat juxtaposes the devoted Christian ideologies presented, yet is so inexplicably dumb that it will leave you questioning why such a film was created in the first place. Its initial introduction commenced with much promise. Science against religion. Simple logical explanations explaining what many describe as religious miracles. Yes, it’s relatively on the nose and misses the point of acquiring faith, yet remained an interesting direction for the first half that managed to conjure up various problematic conversations.

Hot off her Oscar win, swanky Swank muddles through this unusual mystery with much trepidation, choosing not to believe that the plagues of Egypt condemning Haven are in fact coincidental, offering scientific explanations. Algae bloom for the “blood river” that has the consistency of red-dyed water (sorry not sorry...). Infections terminating frogs, that is never explained how they fell from the sky, but whatever. Flies consuming the flesh of the frogs, and you get the idea. She remains unconvinced throughout these biblical mishaps, and provides an interesting angle.

Well, that is until about halfway through when she switches from being Bill Nye the Science Guy to Pope Francis of the Vatican. Suddenly she has faith, despite her tragic backstory clumsily spliced with the main plot, and holy reaping balls do events get crazy. CGI locust infestation, satanic cult crazes and a thunderstorm of fire that incinerates life in a matter of seconds. It went from a minor science experiment to absolute chaos, quicker than a snap of your fingers. The change of pace is so jarring and bewildering, that when the predictably obtuse third act arrives you’re stunned into silence. The tantalising debunking approach now plagued by, well, the plagues. The mystery is ham-fisted and makes no sense whatsoever. Constant flashbacks providing clues, more like clear answers mind you, were choppy and fragmented. It’s not scary in the slightest. Main characters are expended and forgotten about almost instantly, a shame considering Elba was decent as always. And what’s Rea’s purpose in this? No seriously. Except for providing basic exposition, he seemed pointless in this endeavour.

A very minuscule part of my soul wants to like this for being the barking mad mystery that it is. To an extent, it is watchable if you know to turn your brain off and devour all the spiel on religious provocations, despite the interesting first act. It has this surreal allure, making each watch tolerable. But then I think back to the last thirty minutes and I then really want to experience all ten plagues for myself. Incomprehensibly ludicrous. What hath God wrought you ask? This. || _**Intriguing first act gives way to dull second act, but decent ending**_

Released in 2007, ""The Reaping"" is a about a former ordained missionary who's now a professor who debunks supposed miracles around the world (Hilary Swank). She and her assistant (Idris Elba) venture to a bayou town where, amazingly, the ten plagues of Exodus are manifesting (!). David Morrissey plays their host in the town while AnnaSophia Robb plays the 12 year-old focal point of the plagues. Are the plagues real or can they be scientifically explained? If they're real, who's the source, God or the devil?

This is a haunting mystery horror film rather than a monster/slasher movie, so if you're looking for the latter don't bother. That said, this is an extremely well-made production. The visuals of the various plagues are awesome, particularly the bayou turning to blood, the locusts and fire raining from the sky. Moreover, Swank looks super sharp in the manner of Raquel Welch (neither are my type, but who can deny their looks that kill?). Elba is a likable partner and Morrissey seems creepy from the get-go. As for AnnaSophia, it's clear even at 12 years of age that she was gonna morph into a curvy cutie.

Where the movie goes wrong are elements of the story/script. It starts out good and is intriguing for the first 45 minutes or so, but then the next 30 minutes seriously lag. When the plot twist is revealed in the last act it turned me off the first time I watched the film, but I was braced for it with my second viewing and was able to accept it. The ending, while cartoonish, is spectacular in the manner of the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" So this is a solid mystery/horror movie, but it could've been better if they worked out the kinks in the screenplay, like the draggy second act and unsavory plot twist.

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in St. Francisville, Louisiana (the bayou town), Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Shreveport & New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as San Juan, Porta Rico (the opening sequence) and Austin Texas.

GRADE: B- || Watchable enough supernatural horror (in the vein of The Omen I guess), there's not a whole lot that was memorable save maybe for the finale. Hilary Swank felt like she was mailing it in as I didn't have much emotion in spite of her character's tragic background while Idris Elba, as great of an as he is, didn't make much of a mark and felt wasted. Can't say I was once scared but in fairness, these type of horror movies rarely do much for me. **2.75/5**"

The cast aren't great either. It's cool to see a Disney film, especially from this era and before, give new voices a chance; rather than giving roles to the usual suspects. Unfortunately, none of this cast are memorable - at least to me. Matthew Josten has one or two funny bits as Goob, they could've done more with him.

We are in the not too distant future and the Sun is fading out. After a first mission to reignite it with a nuclear bomb fails, with the ship apparently lost in space, a new team are sent to try again. But it really isn't as simple as that...

Director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland team up once again for this sci-fi adventure thriller. For as long as I can personally remember, outer space and the planets that dwell within it, have always served us well for cinematic treats. Fears of the unknown and worries over the destruction of Earth, by and large make for great premise's. Not all films realise this potential of course, but it always makes for a great starting point. For his first venture into this realm, Boyle has gone for the Sun as his point of reference, and it makes for a marvellously claustrophobic picture that poses as many questions as it does answers. And even tho ultimately the science fiction aspects of it do not naturally add up, it's dazzling in its visuals and thought provoking into the bargain.

Boyle has never hid his influences and favourites from the public, and here he homages everything from Alien to Event Horizon, stopping for tea and crumpets at 2001s house along the way. But that is no bad thing, molding elements from great sci-fi past with his own intriguing story has given Sunshine a tremendous heart, to which Boyle then manages to cloak it with high quality drama. The crew are up there and we know that this is a genre piece and things invariably go wrong, this gives the discerning viewer an eager anticipation, a sense that one shouldn't go to the toilet for something will be missed. And Boyle lives up to the promise showed, such a pity then, that Boyle didn't let us get better acquainted with his characters at the start. Because then the impact would surely have doubled as each perilous and wrought scenario unfolded.

Having racked up the tension and intrigued us with the premise, expertly fusing CGI with his own craft work along the way, Boyle's Sunshine lives or dies by it's last quarter; depending on your proclivity of course. It has proved to be a most divisive point with critics and fans alike. To say it's a genre shift accompanied with implausibility is being a touch unkind I feel, this is after all a sci-fi picture about a ship going to reignite the Sun! Never the less it doesn't quite close the film triumphantly after the twists that preceded it, turns and explosions have lulled the viewers in, but personally it satisfies this entertained observer. Not in a big bang dynamic way, but in the way that asks me for a further thought process, and that may just be what Boyle and Garland envisaged when they sat down to make the film? Again, depending on your proclivity of course! 8.5/10 || Danny Boyle has assembled a stellar (had to be said) cast for this rather far-fetched story. The crew of the ""Icarus II"" are charged with dragging a massive nuclear bomb towards the sun with a view to giving it a bit of a pick-me-up. It's dying, you see. Needless to say their journey is fraught with danger, made worse when they discover the wreckage of a previous ship sent on a similar mission many years earlier. When they board it, though, all is not as it seems and danger lurks! Alex Garland knows how to write a good story and Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne and Chris Evans work quite well together as the extra-terrestrial adventure gathers pace. The dialogue is not the best and the score overwhelms at times, but Boyle still manages to create quite a decent degree of peril mixing well the high quality special effects, a bit of sabotage, sexual tension and a good old-fashioned baddie. || This sci-fi thriller started so strong. It began as a hard science fiction film with a spaceship basically pushing a nuclear bomb the size of Manhattan towards the Sun. The ship and crew's task is to reignite the dying Sun. The look and feel of the first half of the movie are wonderful. One of the best parts occurs early as the crew gets to witness the tiny planet Mercury passing between them and the Sun. The science of the movie; the 2001-""feel"" of it, the repair of the ship and the golden space suits are really excellent.

Unfortunately, in its last 30 minutes, **Sunshine** confuses, becoming more like _Event Horizon_. It also becomes quite confusing as Capa (Cillian Murphy) struggles or hallucinates, I'm not sure which, to complete the mission. It's difficult not to like **Sunshine** for its Sci-Fi wonders, but it falls off sharply in its final half."

Is that in a stalker's handbook somewhere? 

As the all mighty great and powerful Hollywood continued to mine ""Hitchcock's"" works for inspiration, they landed upon the idea of re-imaging ""Rear Window"" for a modern audience. Directed by D.J. Caruso, Disturbia actually turns out to be a solid suspense thriller. The first half of the pic is all jocular with hormonal character introductions that come with giggly slices of humour, and then there's the big shift to the thriller that most viewers were expecting, as the makers manage to pull it off with a great final act that is edge of the seat viewing.

There's nothing new on offer here, the formula has been (and will for ever more be) done a zillion times, but the two fold splicing of genres works well and the makers aren't trying to fool anyone with their approach work. Cast are fine, Shia LaBeouf's follows on from his enjoyable turn in ""Transformers"" with this pleasing on the eye show, he shows signs of some good acting chops around some rougher edges. Sarah Roemer is solid enough, and nails down that teen love interest characterisation, whilst Carrie-Anne Moss puts a bit of meat onto the adult bones of the Mother character.

Unfortunately, in what is one of the key roles, David Morse is underused, he does OK with what he has to work with, and convinces in a two layer role, but one feels his talent doesn't quite come to the fore here. Still, it's a minor complaint, for this is a solid genre entry with both halves of the film never less than entertaining - even if you might find yourself yearning for some ""Hitchcock"" genius afterwards. 7/10 || **_Shia LaBeouf in a Rear Window-like thriller_**

Five months shy of 18 years-old, a teen in suburbia (LaBeouf) finds himself under house arrest but, thankfully, an attractive new girl moves in next door (Sarah Roemer) to stir his interest. He starts to suspect that a neighbor might be a notorious serial killer (David Morse). Carrie-Anne Moss is on hand as his mother. 

""Disturbia"" (2007) has a set-up similar to Hitchcock’s “Rear Window” and later imitations, such as “Fright Night” and “Abominable.” LaBeouf’s star was rising at the time and he’s fine as the everyman teen protagonist. Roemer’s star was also rising, but her career never panned out into anything significant. 

It’s perfectly fine as a psychological thriller with a one-dimensional milieu in the mold of “Rear Window” or “What Lies Beneath,” but never becomes anything more than that and is easily the least of ’em. It’s strangely dull. But, if you like the cast, give it a try.

It runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the heart of Greater Los Angeles in the town of Whittier.

GRADE: C+ || Disturbia is a modern thriller that captures the essence of suspense through a clever blend of drama, tension, and relatable characters. The film introduces us to Kale, played by Shia LaBeouf, a teenager under house arrest who finds unexpected ways to pass the time. His curiosity about the lives of his neighbors quickly escalates into something far more gripping. The movie's strong setup in the first act establishes both the stakes and Kale's emotional depth, making the story feel grounded despite its escalating tension.

David Morse's performance as a mysterious neighbor is one of the film's highlights, delivering an understated but chilling presence that keeps the audience guessing. The cast as a whole is well-chosen, with Sarah Roemer and Carrie-Anne Moss rounding out the ensemble in complementary roles. One of the more thought-provoking aspects of the film is how it toes the line between innocent curiosity and intrusive stalking, making you question Kale’s actions as well as your own perspective as a viewer. This layered tension adds depth to the experience, even as the story transitions into its action-packed third act.

What sets Disturbia apart is its ability to combine an intimate, character-driven story with moments of real suspense. The film may flirt with familiar tropes, but it does so with enough charm and style to stand out. With a solid script, strong performances, and a touch of modern flair, Disturbia is an engaging thriller that’s well worth revisiting for fans of suspenseful storytelling."

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Some of you may find (or I should say try to) faults in this gripping courtroom drama but for the rest this movie is a lovely, more than just about courtroom, dual between the ever talented Anthony Hopkins and the not just about looks Ryan Gosling.The chemistry between the two is really difficult to not feel right from the first time in the courtroom where the Hannibal Lecterish Crawford gestures Beachum to adjust his bow tie.It is amazing how the movie grips you despite knowing the fact right from the start who is the killer.Though Crawford is too smart to be believable, the way its played it doesn't raise the slightest of doubt in your mind about its actual existence.Beachum's urge to put the devilish Crawford behind bars for trying to kill his wife and then getting away with it can be seen greatly in the scene in the hospital when Beachum tries to stop Crawford from pulling the plug of his wife's ventilator.The only thing i found missing was the almost lifeless, short lived, romantic relation of Crawford and Nikki Gardner(Rosamund Pike who looks stunning in the movie).Maybe it wouldn't have helped the movie's plot in any way except Crawford's asking for a favor from Gardner's dad later in the movie that's why they didn't put too much efforts to make them a couple.In all a great courtroom, psychological, thrilling, drama with great acting.And i'd better not forget to mention David Strathairn's portrayal of DA Lobruto which was too good and I'd have loved to see more of him... Don't miss this one if you like an intriguing courtroom drama!! || This is my kind of film. Suspense throughout, mystery till the very end... I could write a long review about the film but I realise it wouldn't be that different to what others have already said about it, so my only criticism goes to Anthony Hopkins.

I enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins. I really do. He is a brilliant actor and deserves all the credit he gets. However, his acting seems rather repetitive. He is always assigned to play the role of a man who is highly intelligent, mysterious, always a man of wisdom. Yes, this makes him an interesting character to watch, but we have seen it so many times. The funny thing though this never gets boring. So, I guess, hats off to him for his ability to make us watch the same character over and over again.

Would I watch this film again? Well, I guess so, only if it was on the telly and there is nothing else to watch it. Would I make my friends watch it? Possibly. || This has all the ingredients of a classic crime drama - a great cast, some slick writing and a healthy dose of suspense. Sir Anthony Hopkins as the meticulously fiendish aeronautics engineer/millionaire (""Crawford"") who discovers his wife is up to some mischief and so takes matters into his own hands (or does he?). Ryan Gosling (""Willy Beachum"") is the sloppy and complacent prosecution attorney with his eyes on a big, private sector, promotion away from the district attorney's office so is initially easy prey in this sophisticated game of manipulation/counter manipulation. When he begins to cotton on that he's being played, then the rest of the plot makes for a really enthralling, tensely written and deviously plausible story. We are never in doubt as to who did what - but can they get away with it? That's the million dollar question in this well crafted battle of wits. Well worth watching."

Although I wish that would be the only thing wrong with Spider-Man 3. But almost every storytelling decision - from the creation of Sandman to Peter instantly falling in love with his new costume to that thing that was never actually called Venom - is just plain stupid. Right from the get go you hate Peter Parker.

Studio interference did not mandate the jazz bar dance scene. It did not have the Green Goblin 2 storyline make absolutely no sense whatsoever. It did not create that stupid love triangle between Gwen and Mary Jane, betraying everything Peter Parker is supposed to be about.

These were fundamental issues in the script and direction the film took. These were issues that doomed the film for failure.

Dreams are windows to the imaginative capacity of the subconscious. Manipulating memories to fabricate worlds unbounded by the physical laws of reality. An endless wave of colours and possibilities, requiring no legitimacy for their existence. In psychology, dreams are a method for interrogating the mentality of its subject. Recurring nightmares could be a sign of stress-induced anxiety, fear or mental disorders. The late Satoshi Kon, in what was his last full feature, harnessed the concept of Tsutsui’s novel and challenged the limitations of Japanese animation once again.

Paprika is the equivalent of a hallucinogenic warped mind-bending drug-induced fever dream that tests the attentive abilities of its audience. This is as “anime” as Kon’s work gets. Bashfully bonkers. Colourfully confusing. And plenty of Paprika. Whilst ‘Perfect Blue’ is his most accessible feature for adults, Paprika tends to engage itself with fans of the art form instead. That’s not a derogatory trait to have, as it allows Kon to exercise his visionary ingenuity one last time, but the narrative requires patience. A quaint approach that resembles the personality of doctor Chiba, the head scientist of a revolutionary new psychotherapy treatment creatively entitled “Dream Therapy”. But when a dream recording device is stolen, a plague of nonsensical dreams start to merge with the realms of reality. A parade of dancing frogs, strange dolls, wiggling electronic appliances, colossal Shinto gates and golden cat statues just to name a few composites of the ominous fever dream that plagues the minds of unsuspecting dreamers.

Infiltrating such a cluster bomb of visual splendour would be no simple task for Chiba’s dream alter-ego Paprika, when at one point she is groped by a colleague who physically splits her fleshed shell in half (not nearly as traumatic as it sounds though...). Yet beneath the mesmerising dream-bending extravaganza is a narrative centralising on the sophisticated theme of control. Taking one’s life back. Detective Konakawa represents this exquisitely when trialling out the “DC Mini” device to treat his anxiety. The recurring nightmarish dream regarding his homicide case prevents him from being in control of his life, unable to watch films at the cinema due to past trauma in his childhood. The amalgamation of present and past within his dream perfectly illustrates the haunting abilities that our subconscious infects our mind with. From a non-scientific perspective, it’s a large reasoning for the development of mental disorders.

Of course, the underdeveloped affection Chiba has for her obese child-at-heart genius colleague Tokita somewhat negates the central narrative on psychotherapy, but still focuses on the action of taking control. She finally manages her emotions during a time of distress, and that’s exactly what Paprika revolves around. The whole dream within a dream concept, which apparently was inspiration for Nolan’s epic ‘Inception’, is just a science-fiction shell that enabled Kon to express his creativity without diminishing the novel’s sense of originality. Not to mention Hirasawa’s euphoric score which inventively utilised a vocaloid name “Lola”.

Will you fully understand the story on your first watch? Unlikely. Even with the occasionally clunky dialogue that explains the psychotherapy concept. This was the first anime feature film I ever watched (excluding the likes of Pokémon...), and now four watches later I finally understand every single detail of Kon’s cinematic piece of expressionistic art. It’s science-fiction at its most gentle. It’s psychology at its most cerebral. And it’s anime at its most “anime”. Satoshi Kon, you’re a legendary visionary, and always will be."

Husband “Grant” (Gordon Pinsent) is dreading what has to come next as they both realise she needs professional care rather than stay in their beautiful but impractical wintery home. One of the more onerous conditions of her residency is that for the first month she can’t receive visitors and though she is a bit more stoic about that, he is struggling after 45 years of marriage to come to terms with that. Muddle through he does, though, and eagerly anticipates the day when he can see her again. His arrival at the home doesn’t quite go to plan as he discovers she is playing bridge with a new friend “Aubrey” (Michael Murphy). She is friendly enough but what’s clear is that she can no longer quite place him in her life. What now ensues sees him sensitively try to reintroduce himself whilst she obliviously continues with her new friend and new life, gradually deteriorating. Meantime, he meets “Marian” (Olympia Dukakis) who is married to “Aubrey” and in similar situation, largely unrecognised by the man she has loved for many years. Without compromising their other affections, the two start to find solace in each other’s company and start to realise that they have lives to live too - but always in a shadow. Christie delivers poignantly here but it’s actually Pinsent who has the hardest task as his character gradually loses all the points of reference from his adult life: his best friend, his lover - and yet she is still there, pleasant and polite, in front of his eyes. Dukakis is a fine character actor and she, too, imbues her character with a sense of sadness and reservedness as the inevitable begins to take firmer shape. The writing takes us into the heart of something ghastly but avoids sentimentalising the story. It introduces a little of the vagaries of the science - an imprecise and fluid collection of theories, and makes it’s point with just an hint of optimism for those left to constantly and repetitively pick up the pieces as the days get no better. Despite the doctor extolling the virtues of communal care and living, I still looked at the facility and wondered if these places don’t actually do more stifling than providing, and that’s a testament to an ensemble effort from some chirpy residents and from a direction that treats us as observers for whom this could easily resonate one day. It’s a tough watch but worthwhile, I’d say."

Pardon the pun, but you would think that by this time, everything in the land of zombie movies would have been done to death, but I remain consistently admiring of just where the best and most thought-out renditions of the template can go. In THIS case, the most intriguing dynamic is a cowardly husband choosing his life rather than helping his wife out of a horrible crisis, then infanticide (or worse) of his own children, rather than face their wrath over the poor decision he had made.

It's interestingly hilarious that when you think about it, humanity is doomed because a 12-year-old had to go back and get a picture of his mother, because he was afraid that without it, he would forget what she looked like...A surprisingly satisfying work, that for horror fans, is worth a purchase and rewatching.

28 Weeks Later is directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo who also co-writes with Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo and E. L. Lavigne. It stars Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Enrique Chediak.

Six months have passed since the Rage Virus decimated the UK, but now people are returning to London's District 1 with the U.S. Military overseeing the project. However, the Rage Virus can be carried in people with no outward symptoms.

After the monster success of ""28 Days Later"" it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. With director/writer combo Danny Boyle and Alex Garland off making ""Sunshine"" with Cillian Murphy, the big players from the first film were missing (Boyle and Garland were Executive Producers here). There was reasonable cause for some concern that this would be the latest in a long line of horror sequels that, quite frankly, suck the big one. How great to find that not only is ""Weeks"" an excellent sequel, it also doesn't sit idle and copy Boyle's winning formula.

The blood and ick factor is considerably amped up, as is the action (there's running, lots of running, guns, lots of guns, panic, lots of panic), but the writers have put intelligence into the writing by expanding on the Rage Virus victims as not just being an outwardly ferocious beast, and some topical smarts are spliced into the narrative with the presence of the American military ""enforcing"" the reconstruction of London. Also, with the film's central focus being on a splintered family, brilliantly set up by the breathtaking/horrifying opening 10 minutes, there's a mighty heft of humanism flowing in between the blood vomit and body shredding.

Cast are mostly terrific, with Carlyle and the impressive young actors, Poots and Muggleton, leading the way. The American lads playing military men have to make do with slender written stock roles, but Byrne provides spunk and McCormack leaves an indelible mark in a small, but key, role. Fresnadillo (Intacto) ensures Boyle isn't missed in the director's chair, with a keen eye for action construction and an awareness of pacing for such a horror movie. While Murphy again scores with that knack for doom mongering beats. There's some missteps, logic at times goes out the window and in the case of Renner's character, outcome is a bit too much of a bitter pill to swallow. While dialogue at times shops at ""Clichés ""R"" Us"". But this is still a mighty fine thrill ride, often scary and stomach turning, and even flecked with emotional worth. On this evidence a part 3 would be most welcome. 8/10"

I actually quite enjoyed this rather derivative adventure, possibly because the annoying donkey takes much lesser a role as their search plays to many other fantasies, a bit of Arthurian myth and has plenty of action to keep it moving along for ninety minutes. It was always going to be more difficult to keep the character fresh after six years, and the writing here isn't quite as witty as we've seen before, but the underlying characters are still quite engaging and the hero/anti-hero storyline did rise a smile from time to time.

It has been on my ‘films to watch’ list for like a while after watching **Sing Street** - another **John Carney** film. And i did like his other film **Begin Again **(love the song Lost Stars). All have similar themes…not just music, but the process of making music. 

**I love the simplicity of Once** -  feels more raw and natural (than Sing Steet and Begin Again). And the songs are really beautiful. I have been listening to it everyday. My top 2 favorite scenes are: Falling Slowly (video above) at the music shop - instant connection through music! Doesn’t have to be a love story between the guy and the girl, just relate and connect for their love for making music. Second one would be the recording studio scene: When Your Mind’s Made Up. I love how the guy who’s ‘pressing the buttons’ was like meh just here to work with whatever wannabee band, and then when they start to play he’s like…what is this? this is actually good - support! And from there it’s just something magical for all of them, that you know these musicians are in their element and will remember it for the rest of their lives, doing something that they are all so passionate about. Everyone inside the studio - just very endearing characters.  

Well I love the whole film so all the scenes are great. My favorite emotional song, Lies. It’s so powerful and heartbreaking, I think most relateable scene as well. 

Just might replace Garden State as my background film to play when I am doing something else, just to hear it. A must see for musicians and just music lovers like me. || Perfection and I fell slowly in love with this film.  

Challenge: Make an Indy hit with a tiny budget; ""no name"" actors in there; and use actors with no or limited acting experience.  Have the plot be basic (Guy meets Girl early on), but realistic.  Keep the characters relatable and add humour.  Now make it a musical with at least 10 tracks.  Oh and also, make sure an Oscar is won.  

THIS is just what this movie achieved and Im blown away by it.  

Hansard and Irglova are so believable in their roles, I didnt know they had such limited act experience.  And the music they make together is glorious, heart felt and raw.  

This is the modern-day musical that people should watch.  Not the over-rated Hamilton, or self indulgent La-La Land, or the tragedy that is Cats.  

This is just: love, music, people.  

And I love it (despite the tears it brings).

(And reading up on this, I teared up again - There is a moment towards the end of the movie  when Guy asks Girl whether she loves her husband. Girl responds, ""No. I love you"" (her response is unsubtitled), so Guy does not understand her).  

If you have a heart and love being moved by movies, watch this.  WATCH THIS ASAP."

At ten minutes shy of three hours the story just isn't substantial enough to sustain it and I must confess to finding my attention dwindling a bit at various stages of the proceedings. Thankfully, Geoffrey Rush has rejoined the cast as the whole ensemble must now risk life and limb - and sail to the very edge of the world - to save ""Jack"" (Johnny Depp) from oblivion and thwart the seemingly unstoppable ""Lord Beckett"" (Tom Hollander). How to do this? Well they must galvanise the entire global pirate community and that means the dreaded ""Sao Feng"" (Chow Yun-Fat), ""Capt. Teague"" (the one and only Keith Richards) and a consortium of the most corrupt, venal and treacherous folks ever put on Earth. This time, though, it is ""Elizabeth"" (Keira Knightley) who steps up to the plate and demonstrates that she has come a long way since she was kidnapped from her father's home just a few short years ago to become a true kick-ass captain in her own right. This has much less of a story than the first two films; it sort of rehashes the tail end of the story from ""Dead Man's Chest"" (2006) just a bit too much and although the visual effects are superb, as usual, the whole thing just looked more like a victory for the marketing executives than the creative ones at Disney. The last half hour is all good fun, though, with a denouement that we could have had half an hour earlier and that would have served as a fitting conclusion to the adventures of this disparate band of pirates, lovers and scaly monsters. It's still watchable, but I fear this is all a bit tired and Verbinski et al are really struggling for that innovation that we have seen before."

He’s addressed it head-on as both fiction and fact, but Bug sees him take a more oblique route. Here’s the story of a man so thoroughly possessed by paranoia that his delusions are contagious. One demon leaves one body to enter another, but an obsession is Legion.

Every Michael Shannon performance is arguably his best, but this is a film tailor-made for his fascinating idiosyncrasies. Aphid and spastic, his body language stops short of actually turning into a freaking insect.

Ashley Judd, however, has a more challenging role, because not only does she have to sell the transition from sane to crazy, but then she has to catch up with Shannon, go toe-to-toe with him, match his manic intensity — and I’ll be damned if she doesn’t; Judd digs deep and reaches a place of utter darkness and desperation. She stares right into the abyss and doesn’t flinch.

Everybody is in point, though; Friedkin and screenwriter Tracy Letts, pull off the rare double-turn (to use wrestling terminology). Harry Connick Jr., who plays Judd’s character’s abusive ex, is all brawn and no brains, while Shannon starts out helpless and meek (his patented, infallible calm-before-the-storm routine); we begin to dread the seemingly inevitable moment when Connick beats Shannon within an inch of his life, only to end up wishing that the former would slap some sense into the latter.

The only problem with this film is that it builds so much momentum it just can’t help crashing and burning. It’s so climactic that it actually becomes anticlimactic. There’s no resolution, no catharsis. For all its shock and awe, The Exorcist allows itself a hopeful, optimistic coda; Bug lacks such an escape valve. This time, the Devil wins."

This is about as good as the original without the historical mark.  I love the alternative motive of getting revenge for a friend, this way it's not about how much you can steal, its about how much you can make someone else lose, and it's against someone might be justifiably shot, not that it would help Reuben.

This movie gets every bit as complex with less over explaining than the last movie, keeping it fresh and interesting.

All the same production value, good cast, and good writing with new twists and angles.  A must see even if you've watched the first and are skipping the second."

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || **_Cheesy, but colorful space fantasy with Caroline Munro, et al._**

A smuggler and her extraterrestrial cohort (Caroline and Marjoe Gortner) are enlisted by an eminent space Emperor (Christopher Plummer) to find a lost individual (David Hasselhoff) and extinguish the secret weapon of his diabolical nemesis (Joe Spinell).

""Starcrash"" (1978) is an Italian production with American actors, obviously inspired by the success of “Star Wars” from the previous year, but also influenced by past flicks like “Forbidden Planet,” “Planet of the Vampires” and “Barbarella,” as well as “Jason and the Argonauts.” It’s similar to the movie & series “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,” which came out the next year, and is the precursor to the “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies with Robert Tessier as Chief Thor reminiscent of Drax (Dave Bautista).

I didn’t name Star Trek only because that’s serious science-fiction with the milieu of space exploration as opposed to the space fantasy of most of the others (not “Forbidden Planet” and “Planet of the Vampires,” which are closer to Star Trek).

Caroline was 28 during shooting and one of the obvious highlights in her alluring getups, yet there are other attractions. Gortner does surprisingly well in a non-goofy role where he’s almost Spock-like. The colors are vibrant with the space background looking like a Christmas tree if the tree were black. Sure, it’s all second-rate compared to “Star Wars” with some laughable fight choreographies, but the sets & costumes are flamboyant and the production required quite a bit of imagination. It’s a turn-off-your-brain and have fun flick; a “good” bad movie.

It runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot at Cinecittà studios in Rome, as well as other areas of Italy (Mount Etna), and Morocco, Tunisia and Hollywood.

A sequel to 2005 box office winner, ""The Fantastic Four"", ""Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" sees director Tim Story and the original cast principals return for more super hero schlocky fun. The story is based around the Marvel stories that featured the first appearance of said ""Silver Surfer"" in the comic book franchise. Silver Surfer (Doug Jones with Laurence Fishburne dubbing the voice) is acting as a herald for the planet devouring Galactus, the next target? Earth. Which is a bit untimely as Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm/Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba) are trying to get married. Things are further problematic when after his first encounter with the Silver Surfer, Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Chris Evans) finds his powers a bit off - in fact when he touches any of the others I the team their powers are exchanged, much to Ben Grimm/The Thing's (Michael Chiklis) amusement. Not only that, but the military are starting to get heavy and annoyed with the four - and who is this back on the scene? Doctor Doom! (Julian McMahon) Thought he was dead, and how come he's in league with the military now? All of this issues must be addressed or the Earth will suffer the direst of consequences.

Budgeted at $130 million, this sequel only just made its money back domestically, however, the Worldwide takings gave it an overall profit of nearly $160 million. Which when you consider that the first film (again raking the coin in) was met with very disdainful reviews (mostly warranted outside of Evans & Chiklis' efforts), it's somewhat surprising. Yet, and it's certainly no towering genre picture, ""Silver Surfer"" is a hugely enjoyable movie for fans of the source comics and the undemanding popcorn muncher. The fans, and I don't speak for all of them of course, should in the main be happy that the makers have been faithful to the origins of the story. There's also some nifty humour and both Alba and Gruffudd aren't as dull as they were in the first movie. Perhaps they are more comfortable now knowing that the paying public held sway over the critics?. Evans is still the best thing in the franchise (no surprise he would go on to play ""Captain America"" in ""The Avengers"" franchise), and the appearance of Andre Braugher as General Hager is a welcome edition. While the effects are considerably better than the poor fodder served up in the first movie - granted it wouldn't have been hard to improve on that score.

With a lovely light hearted approach, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" does its job. In the pantheon of super hero movies it sits some where in the middle, neither great or bad, just honest wholesome family fun. 20th Century Fox have announced that a reboot of the franchise is to come, so while Chris Evans goes off to mouth wateringly play ""Captain America"", the next lot of actors are charged with the not so easy task of winning over a tough comic book crowd, and, the critics too. 6.5/10 || Oddly enough, I did prefer this to the original (2005) outing for this not so very fab-four. This time the ""Reed"" (Ioan Gruffudd) and ""Sue"" (Jessica Alba) romance is about to tie the knot when the army intervene to enlist their help is dealing with the menacing threat posed by a mysterious ""Silver Surfer"" (who looks like an award your eight year old might have got for a Californian surfing competition in 1975). Anyway, it turns out that he is but a precursor to the far more deadly, planet gobbling, ""Galactus"" who is hungry - and Earth is on his menu. Meantime, good old ""Victor Von Doom'' (Julian McMahon) has not forgotten his shabby treatment from the last time, and so has his own agenda that will manipulate the army and the messenger and, he hopes, give him world domination. Can the four put aside their differences and save the day? What do you think? This is about as unmenacing and devoid of jeopardy as any adventure film could ever be. Again, Evans - now even more cock-sure than before, has all the best lines and action scenes (such as they are) and the special effects are well presented. The casting and writing, though, continue to let the whole thing down and the plot really does lurch along to an ending that - like ""Galactus"", you could see from space! Hopefully the last of these, and it's now pretty clear why ""Hornblower"" isn't going to make an Hollywood star anytime soon."

While I don't enjoy the aspect of shoving an addiction (actually compulsion) story into a Nancy Drew story (as she has to stop sleuthing), and I don't enjoy the relocation aspect of a world they built so well so quickly, this movie has far more benefits than drawbacks.

Once we get past the awkward ""lying to your parents"" aspect of the story that usually gets attributed to drugs and alcohol, the actual ""sleuthing"" is really fun and present in a charming and light-hearted way.

The mystery itself is actually complex enough to keep you interested throughout the movie, and the characters are fun, if eccentric.  Having a ""world's clash"" aspect to the story seemed unnecessary, and that's the only real hang up this movie had.

Firstly the movie was supposed to be the opening of a potential franchise to revitalize the Nancy Drew brand, but instead of giving it a strong opening movie, they jumped right in as if there were already 3 movies and they had already jumped the shark a second time.  I had several young people ask me if ""Nancy Drew was a thing?"".  Because it was mistreated in the writing process, what should have been a great movie is only a good movie.

I really liked this though: Emma Roberts showed early that she was up to carrying a movie, and I love that Rachel Leigh Cook (""She's All that"") got involved as she was from a different novel based franchise (""The Babysitter's Club"") that also didn't take off."
