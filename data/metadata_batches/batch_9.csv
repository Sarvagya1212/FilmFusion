After years of a disciplined, rather pedestrian existence he now feels a need to emancipate himself and start to live a little. The story is told through two threads: one looks at the end of the old gent's life from his own perspective; the second takes a retrospective view from the wake as his family and colleagues gather to remember him. Kurusawa is clearly making a point with this delicate, poignant film - perhaps life needs to be appreciated and enjoyed - not necessarily in a jovial, happy fashion, but by achievement. In this case ""Watanabe"" sets about using his position to help locals get a park, but he also starts an empowering relationship (platonic) with a younger girl, who is quite keen on her food, it has to be said. As his colleagues at the wake suffer from excesses of saké their traditionally stiff, reserved, view of their late friend becomes more of a tool to evaluate their own roles and purpose as they determine to be more like him.... The writing has plenty of humour and again, Kurosawa uses weather as a wonderfully potent instrument to create a great atmospheric feel to this gentle story of profound change, and - maybe - contentment. || I watched the English follow-up version (Living) before watching this original, and wished I had reversed my order. I liked Living much more than this original, but since both were written by the same Japanese scriptwriter, my preference might be cultural rather than due to quality issues, not to mention the scriptwriter had come up with improvements through the intervening years.

The club and bar scenes near the beginning seem to go on much longer than in the remake, or at least it felt like it! And the same for the later scenes with the young woman. Then again, that wouldn’t be surprising since this older version is 40 minutes longer.

Still, the differences in the details based on the separate cultures are interesting to note, and I recommend both versions, though I would start with the older one as I mentioned above. || Typical Kurasawa creative framing in the beginning of the movie. The scene of dancers shot through bead curtains swinging in time to the music was brilliant.  His choice of Miki Odagiri for muse is brilliant. Her laugh is infectious. The last act stuck me as rather static. It's perhaps from cultural mores about the dead I don't understand (like the taboo of not ever sticking your chopsticks into the rice bowl!). Kurasawa waxes philosophical on life and government here, and indeed, nothing has changed in 70 years."

I had to wait an entire day, after watching the dreadful 'Disaster Movie', to get the acrid taste out of my mouth to watch this one, by my fourth favourite director ever ('Viridiana' is still probably my favourite of his, though). Luckily it had three of my favourite French actors from the period, in Bulle Ogier (just check out 'Maitresse' if you don't understand why), Delphine Seyrig and Fernando Rey (for the two 'French Connection' films alone)--even though for a director of Bunuel's strength, any actors could have sufficed. It's the ideas that stand out most triumphantly.

It's most known for being Bunuel's Oscar-winner for Best Foreign Language Film, but its OTHER nomination is what's almost neglected when people talk about him. Yes, they talk about Bunuel the director, or (from David Thomson) Bunuel the photographer, but people never realize his two nominations for the Calanda, Spain-native were never for director, but for writing (with another nod for his swan song, 'The Obscure Object of Desire'). || It's quite a difficult film to review this, as it essentially has no real plot and very little structure. It is a series of dream sequences following a group of friends - each with some form of skeleton in their closet - as they try to meet for a dinner that repeatedly gets aborted. Fernando Rey is on good form as the Ambassador from the Republic of ""Miranda"" - a man living in fear for his life from revolutionaries at home, and who is also not averse to adding a little spice to the contents of the diplomatic bag. Jean-Pierre Cassel and Stéphane Audran are the ""Sénéchal"" couple - they like a bit of al fresco nookie; the ""Thévenot"" couple (Delphine Seyrig and Paul Frankeur) are ostensibly the most normal of the group, though the latter has a bit going on the side with ""Florence"" (Bulle Ogier). We are never quite sure why they are friends at all, but none of that really matters. It is the very unstructured nature of this that makes it work. Each of their dreams offers us a different - sometimes amusing, sometimes rather violent - short story as the group try to sit down to eat. Personally, I was rather fond of the gardening Bishop ""Dufour"" (Julien Bertheau) who seems to flit between his religious and gardening garb as if by magic. The dialogue isn't maybe the best, but the scenarios and a lot of imagination from director Luis Buñuel combine to offer us something that is quirky and entertaining. It doesn't really need a cinema screening - the production and photography are fine but really this is all about some whacky characterisations that don't always make sense, but do engage."
20815.0,The Handmaid's Tale,"In a dystopian, polluted right-wing religious tyranny, a young woman is put in sexual slavery on account of her now rare fertility.",A haunting tale of sexuality in a country gone wrong.,"Drama, Science Fiction",108.0,1990-02-15,en,6.2,250.0,2.255,"Natasha Richardson, Faye Dunaway, Aidan Quinn, Elizabeth McGovern, Victoria Tennant",Volker Schlöndorff,"rebellion, future, canada, rape, based on novel or book, escape, paranoia, dystopia, slavery, sexism, surrogate mother, feminist, religious fundamentalism, misogyny, impregnation, political unrest, totalitarianism, theocracy","Now look at this, someone made the Handmaid's Tale into something watchable. You know what the difference between this and the series is?

I'll give you a hint it's two things... do you have it yet?

Time and story. The TV show has FAR too many episodes, and each is far too long to tell a compelling story. The 1990 HBO version is only about 100 minutes. It's not dragged out to the point where it is filled to overflowing with, well, with filler. It delivers a clean and concise story that didn't spare a cut. And because of that it works.

But.... it also has Faye Dunaway, and it has Natasha Richardson, and it has Robert Duvall, and it has Aidan Quinn... and those are all people that everyone would be honored to cast, and they were certainly people that anyone would be thrilled to cast back in 1990.

So, what you have is a clean script that is void of unnecessary filler (and in the case of the TV series, free of painfully long unnecessary filler) and that script is acted out by some of the best people in the industry.

You can't ask for more. || Yikes, but there must have been some volume of hairspray used in this production that makes the ""Stepford Wives"" look like an ordinary family street. The women are divided into two groups in this futurist version of the USA. The blue are the privileged and wealthy, the red are the surrogates in a society that cannot now readily breed. A few lucky men are the commanders, lording over everyone and having their own fun trying to conceive children much as roosters fertilise hens. ""Kate"" (Natasha Richardson) is one such red dress. She is to be indoctrinated into the mansion run by ""Serena Joy"" (Faye Dunaway) so she can service the sexual needs of the boss (Robert Duvall). Now they only have a certain amount of tries at the conception lark, and if they don't come up with the goods then they go back to an homeless oblivion. She isn't getting pregnant but nobody dares to ask if it's the ""Commander"" who is firing blanks so she befriends him, tries to earn his trust whilst all along making plans with his driver ""Nick"" (Aidan Quinn) to get the hell out of the place. She might just be in luck as there is an increasing unrest amongst society at large with this hierarchical and zealous societal structure that sees the wealth - money, food and children, in the hands of very, very few. It's starts off quite intriguingly but pretty quickly runs out of steam with some really stilted performances and dialogue - despite having Margaret Atwood and Harold Pinter as the wordsmiths. Dunaway doesn't really appear enough to make much difference and by half way through I thought that it might have worked better on stage - though whether I'd have bothered to leave the bar after the interval is a good question. It's all adequate enough, just nothing special."

The Medallion has so many hallmarks of the early 2000s style of filmmaking with the choppy editing and lame humor. **1.75/5** || The Medallion is a fun, lighthearted action-comedy that’s perfect for a casual movie night with family or friends and a few beers.

Plot finds the demon known as The Creeper (Jonathan Breck), still having a little time left for feeding and harvesting human parts before his 23 year hibernation. A buffet bar of high school kids on a bus returning from a basketball match are now in his sights. But an avenging father played by Ray Wise is willing to take the fight to the monster. 

It's a simple as it sounds, really. Creeper picks off various members of the bus, which is the usual array of annoyingly obnoxious teenagers. The tension comes from wondering who is next in line, all while the fractured group (racial/sexuality tensions) try to come up with some sort of plan to survive until help arrives. Logically it's a laughable nightmare and goofs aplenty are within, but there's a neat gory ""B"" movie vibe about it driving it forward. Plus there's more of Creeper in flying mode and a bad ass Ray Wise to root for.

After the success of the first Jeepers Creepers film it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. With a little sadness we find that this sequel fails to capture the strengths that made the first film a refreshing horror joltathon. But regardless it still has some merits for a fun horror time waster. 6/10 || A most prime example of how to refute the “bigger is better” adage.

It was only when I saw this film that I realized that it is the last film in a trilogy that begins with “Mariachi”. However, I saw it after having seen “Desperado” and that allowed me to have a better understanding of the story: the gunman and his girlfriend are chased by a drug dealer until the day his men manages to kill the girl. Devastated, the Mariachi retires to live out his days in bitterness. After a while, he is called by a CIA agent, who gives him the opportunity to take revenge while preventing the total success of a military coup that will assassinate the Mexican president.

Sound confusing? Maybe because it is! The script is very light, without beauty, care for details or stylistic refinement, and the text ends up being dominated by what I defined, sarcastically, as “latinxploitation” when I wrote for “Desperado”: a bunch of cheap stereotypes about Latinos and Mexicans. And I continue to have the feeling that these films are not healthful to clear up these preconceived ideas that dance in the heads of white, Anglo-Saxon, English-speaking America.

If we saw director Robert Rodríguez dazzled by action scenes in “Desperado”, here he lost his mind: there are enough bullets for another invasion of Iraq. For those who live far away, Mexico may seem like a highly corrupt country and the difficulties that the authorities face in the fight against well-armed, cruel cartels with strong allies abroad are very well known. The film, however, takes two steps further and transforms Mexico into a land without law or ruler, where the order comes from those with bigger weapons and their hands deep in cocaine. Perhaps for this reason, the film did not have much support from the Mexican authorities and ended up not even showing the Mexican flag which, in the film's presidential palace, is replaced by something else with stars. I am still unable to fully understand this flag exchange. Speaking of action, was I the only one who smelled a faint whiff of Tarantino in this film's action scenes?

Of course, with all this, the film develops and evolves very quickly, and we don't have any dead or boring moments. From an entertainment point of view, the film works very well, considering that we are an audience that seeks action and doesn't mind turning off our brains and accepting what is given to us. The underlying problem is that, if the script is already weak, things get worse if it speeds up like this. After a point, it no longer matters who is trying to do what. They're all shooting. For what reason? Maybe they don't even know!

Despite the poverty of the material given to him and the poor construction of his character, António Banderas continues to deserve our attention, even if, in this film, it is unquestionably Depp who stands out when we talk about the cast. There aren't many actors capable of shining in an underwritten character, but he does it and steals the spotlight whenever he appears, sending Banderas to the corner and turning Salma Hayek into an extra. Eva Mendes is sexy, but she has no material to work with, and Willem Dafoe is very weak. There are a lot of renowned actors and even a singer – Enrique Iglesias – in the cast list, which shows more desire to be in this project than the ability to add something good to the final product."

Although I found myself laughing out loud a few times at Bill Murray and his quips, BY NO MEANS should the average movie fans think this is a comedy. It is an independent art film and should be treated as so. || True love transcends sexual expression

RELEASED IN 2003 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, ""Lost in Translation"" was a big hit in 2003-2004. It's about an aging actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who's in Tokyo doing commercials for a week. His home-life is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. He runs into an attractive 20 year-old something woman, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who's in Tokyo with her photog husband (), but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.

This is a mature, semi-arty film and you have to be in the right mode/maturity level to appreciate it. I said ""maturity level"" and not ""age"" because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. For me, the story, music and visuals pulled me into these characters’ temporary world for the 102-minute runtime.

The film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. I'll only focus on the deep love element. It's been noted that the story originated from Sofia's experience with an aging actor when she was younger, possibly Harrison Ford. Sofia is obviously Charlotte, while Charlotte's husband is Sofia's ex and Anna Faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be Cameron Diaz in real life. So there's a lot of reality in the picture.

But it's not just a cathartic piece. Sofia has some potent insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 35 years older than Charlotte). For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. Not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes, the windows of the soul, in a profoundly naked sense. This can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just KNOW, or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with Bob and Charlotte (which is a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob COULD take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vulnerable. Will he or won't he take advantage? 

***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.

If Bob loves Charlotte so much, not to mention his wife & kids, why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer (Catherine Lambert)? Bob slept with her to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and Charlotte. This was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure but, have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). While all this is obvious, it goes deeper...

Bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. Bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.

The ending is powerful and tear-inducing. No CGI, explosion or action stunt can compare. It's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million strangers. Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. They could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll never see each other again, at least on this physical plane, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.

GRADE: A || Lost in Translation is one of my all-time favorite movies. The film grabbed me when I first saw it in the theater (unusual for back then, but my cineplex got this one in) and since I've watched it dozens of times. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson are both great and Sofia Coppola's direction taking in the sights and sounds of Tokyo (a city I've always been curious about and wanted to visit) was amazing."

Father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, under Peter Bogdanovich's superlative direction, produce one of the most affectingly warm and cunningly sly movies of the 1970s. Set in depression era America and beautifully photographed in pristine monochrome by Laszlo Kovacs, it's a period piece that refuses to get old, such is the deft imagery and sharpness of the screenplay.

Story essentially comes down to conman Moses Pray (R. O'Neal) hooking up with orphan Addie Loggins (T. O'Neal), who may or may not be his actual daughter. Addie proves to be a precocious live wire, not easily fooled and she smokes, cusses and is more than capable of pulling a con herself. After initial indignation, Moses comes to court Addie's strengths and they form a dynamic partnership as they travel through Kansas, pulling cons left right and centre and piling the money up. But can it last forever?

The chemistry between father and daughter is obviously set in stone, with young Tatum an absolute revelation. The screenplay gives them both ample opportunities to enchant and amuse the viewer as they get up to all sorts of tricks and scrapes. Yet there's always that feeling hanging in the dusty air that something has to give, that we are treading firmly in bittersweet territory, the crafty couple having earned our complete investment in their well being keeping us concerned even as we laugh out loud.

Delightful. 9/10 || ***Ryan O’Neal and his kid daughter Tatum in 1930’s Kansas***

In Depression-era Kansas, a conman who sells Bibles (Ryan O’Neal) is coerced into allowing a precocious 9 year-old (Tatum O’Neal) to ride with him as they travel to St. Joseph, Missouri, where her aunt lives. Madeline Kahn plays a carnival “dancer” with P.J. Johnson as her teen aide. John Hillerman appears in a double role as a bootlegger and police officer.

""Paper Moon"" (1973) is a B&W drama with amusing moments. Imagine “The Highwaymen” (2019) and “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967), but with a lighter tone and much less severe criminality, mixed with father/quasi-daughter antics. The movie’s entertaining throughout, but the ending’s too low-key for my tastes (How about some good ol’ fashioned emotion?). But that’s a minor quibble.

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot in Kansas, Nebraska & Missouri (with one part done in Pasadena).

A man (Art Hindle) investigates a pop psychologist’s unconventional therapy techniques after his daughter shows signs of abuse when visiting her mother (Samantha Eggar) undergoing the secretive treatments. The mystery deepens when people linked to the situation wind up slain by… the Brood. Oliver Reed plays the strange, formidable doctor.

“The Brood” (1979) is a psychological drama/horror written & directed by David Cronenberg after his divorce & custody battle, which makes sense once you see the movie. As my title blurb states, the theme concerns the personification of internal rage, whether conscious or subconscious, which wasn’t a new concept in 1978 when the film was made; think “Forbidden Planet” (1956). A couple issues of the Man-Thing comic also addressed the issue in 1974. To forge the script Cronenberg combined this element with the oft-used idea of nefarious offspring a la “Village of the Damned” (1960) and “Children of the Damned” (1964).

One highlight is Reed’s intense performance and understated, intimidating presence. He was one of Brando’s few contemporaries that matched his brooding magnetism. Another highlight is the setting of Toronto in the late winter (or early spring), particularly the awesome Somafree facility in the country. The realistic tone is good and the movie has the confidence to take its time, but some parts & dialogues are too slow, which tempts your mind to wander. Also, the movie scores poorly on the female front.     

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Toronto & Mississauga, Ontario.

GRADE: B- || They're her children. More exactly, they're the children of her rage. 

The Brood is written and directed by David Cronenberg. It stars Oliver Reed, Samantha Eggar and Art Hindle. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Mark Irwin.

Frank Carveth (Hindle) attempts to uncover the truth about  an unconventional psychologist's therapy techniques on his institutionalized wife. Could the treatments at the Somafree Institute have anything to do with the recent series of brutal murders?

Come 1979 one David Cronenberg was getting into his grove for laying down a marker for body horror and psychological distortion. The Brood is at its core a little ""too"" out there, but it is high on thought provoking worth and as we would come to expect from the great director, it's also in turns repulsive. Crucially, as is the director's want, it isn't spoon feeding you answers, the narrative gaps are deliberate, pic urges you to invest your all or get nothing in return.

Pace is very much on the slow burn, the story trundling along as we get to grips with the key characters - most importantly that of Nola Carveth (Eggar). Working with a par for the course tight budget, Cronenberg goes big on atmosphere and simmering tension (utilising his cinematography know how), stopping only briefly for some short sharp shockery as strange mutant children - maybe? - suddenly appear to unleash brutality. There's a cold and distant disquiet about proceedings, which ironically matches the settings for the play unfolding.

Interesting to note that not for the first or last time Cronenberg was accused of over stepping the mark. Recently off of a caustic divorce, he then made The Brood, which on the outside definitely does have anti woman leanings. To say more would be spoiler territory, so make up your own minds on that score, but either way it's the clinically unsettling work of an always challenging director. 7/10 || Oliver Reed plays the sophisticated, secretive psychologist ""Raglan"" who is treating ""Nola"" (Samantha Eggar), the wife of ""Frank"" (Art Hindle). His techniques are either cutting edge or reckless, depending on your point of view - and his peers take the latter view, so he carries out much of his work in a remote facility that appears little better than a glorified cabin. When his young daughter returns from a visit to her mother, ""Frank"" notices some rather nasty bruises on her back. Concerned, he forbids his daughter from returning, but when firstly his mother, then his father are brutally killed by being beaten to death, he begins to suspect all is not right with ""Raglan"" and his practices. Now, we are given clues far earlier than ""Frank"", so I found there to be little jeopardy with the developing plot. David Cronenberg's story, here, is not one of his more complex, or finest for the matter and the ending made me laugh. It isn't that it is nonsense, it's just that it lacks any sense of peril or horror. The Howard Shore score tries hard to create a sense of fear, but we all know (or can easily guess) too much, too early in the proceedings for it to really build-up a head of steam, with the effects - especially at the end being more comical than terrifying. Much more could have been made of the meta-physics themes that underpinned the story, but as it is - it's just a bit half-baked."

After the incredible success of Jaws in 1975 ""nature runs amok"" flicks became real popular for the next decade or so; in fact, they're still being made. ""Squirm"" was released one year after ""Jaws"" in late July 1976 in the USA and most other countries in 1977-1978.

THE PLOT: A storm downs power lines in a coastal Georgia town, electrifying the wet mud and unleashing millions of 10-18 inch sand worms of the area. City slicker Mick (John Scardino) comes into town to visit redhead Geri (Patricia Pearcy), eldest daughter of a widow (Jean Sullivan). A slow-witted local hick Roger (R.A. Dow) is attacked by the worms and goes mad as slimy creatures attack the citizens over the course of a day and night. The opening claims that the events are based on an actual incident from September 29, 1975.

The first time I saw ""Squirm"" I was about 13 years old and high as a kite (something I don't do anymore) and, man, it scared the you-know-what out of me! I was completely taken in by the story, the eerie mood and Deep South ambiance. I was ENTRANCED. Seeing it again as an adult (and sober), it's understandably not as scary or captivating, but that first viewing won my utmost and eternal respect.

""Squirm"" was actually shot in the deep South, in Port Wentworth, Georgia (just North of Savannah), and all the actors go for the whole ""Southern"" bit with aplomb. So the film has a real authentic Southern feel.

The story is generally slow-paced but that's okay because the movie only runs 92 minutes. It has loads of atmosphere and a few really creepy scenes, like when the worms attack Roger's face while fishing in a rowboat with Geri. The story isn’t campy at all, as some claim, although there’s some realistic humor. It's pretty much presented in all seriousness; and the acting by the main characters is believable and good (not so much with the peripheral characters). Roger strikes you as a likable genuine country boy before the attack.

All of these factors explain how I was able to get swept up in the story and take it seriously (at least as serious as such a story can be taken). It may not be a Grade A film like ""Jaws"" or ""Orca"" but it's certainly a quality ""B"" film, that is, if you have a taste for ""nature runs amok"" flicks. Don't listen to those who say this is a Grade Z flick. It's not; it’s a well-made B picture.

How you will take ""Squirm"" depends on your personality. Some will find it unintentionally funny or cheesy, while others, like me, will take it seriously and enjoy the eerie air, Southern locations and a few good frights. ""Squirm"" is effective for the type of film it is.

Jerry (Jason Briggs) is a fledgling writer in the Big Apple with an inept agent (Danny DeVito). As Jerry starts a relationship with a loose girl (Christina Ricci) he gets counsel from an older writer with a great vocabulary named Dobel (Woody Allen), usually while walking Central Park. Stockard Channing plays the girl's irritating mother and a young Jimmy Fallon has a cameo.

Written & directed by Woody Allen, ""Anything Else"" (2003) is a dialogue-driven romantic comedy that reflects on the mysteries, absurdities and ironies of life while focusing on the attraction and power of a nubile woman. Briggs is a quality protagonist and I enjoyed Jerry and Dobel's mentee/mentor relationship. Dobel uses a lot of obscure terminology so I recommend using the subtitles to keep up with it, as well as the low-key humor, which is quite entertaining. It's also nice to see Erica Leerhsen in a small role.

Christina looks great and is a fit as can be, but her morally loose character is a mass of conflicting impulses. Her actions are controlled by whether or not she's excited by her sexual partner and, of course, only a new partner excites her, which means no sexual relations with a man once he becomes ""old hat."" While she's looking to find excitement elsewhere Jerry does everything he can to keep the relationship going, which is hard to do when the girl's obnoxious mother is living in the same apartment. 

Not only is it frustrating for Jerry to deal with this situation, it's frustrating for the viewer as well. No doubt these types of aggravating people and relationships are the point of the movie, and it IS amusing to a point, but it naturally makes the viewing experience aggravating as well. Plus sympathy for Jerry only goes so far; after all, he's the fool who dropped his perfectly suitable mate (KaDee Strickland) to pursue the sexy-but-unfaithful new girl. In short, he's sleeping in the bad he made.

Nevertheless, the movie’s witty, thought-provoking, well made and performed. It’s one of Tarantino’s 20 favorite flicks from 1992-2009.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot entirely in New York City.

A troubled New York City couple (Dennis Quaid & Sharon Stone) move to the country after purchasing a dilapidated estate at a can’t-refuse price. Unfortunately, the manor’s past interrupts their enjoyment of their new home. The cast is rounded out by Stephen Dorff, Juliette Lewis, Dana Eskelson, Christopher Plummer and Kristen Stewart (who was 12 years-old during shooting).

“Cold Creek Manor” (2003) is a drama/thriller with a bit o’ horror that mixes “What Lies Beneath” (2000) and “The Messengers” (2007) with “Undertow” (2004). Instead of cabin-in-the-woods, it’s a manor-in-the-woods flick, but don’t expect over-the-top slasher antics (e.g. silent masked killer with a machete), as this one’s more low-key and realistic, albeit saddled with eye-rolling thriller/horror clichés.

If you can roll with that flaw and a laughably executed snake sequence, this is pretty much on par with “What Lies Beneath” and “The Messengers” although it lacks the artistry of “Undertow.” Stephen Dorff is outstanding and the movie brings to life the small town/rural area with the residents thereof. People criticize the casting of gruff Dennis Quaid as a “wuss,” but he’s not a wuss; he’s just not rash because he knows a reckless social mistake can bring life-changing tragedy in seconds. Most other nitpicks can be just as easily explained. For instance, a person can’t very well push someone into a well if they’re no longer in the area.

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot at Cruickston Park, Cambridge, Ontario, and places nearby in the Kitchener/Cambridge region with studio stuff done in Toronto, which is just an hour’s drive east.

GRADE: B- || I always had a bit of a crush on Stephen Dorff, and his topless torso helps this start off quite promisingly. Sadly, that is the undoubted highlight in this otherwise really poor horror mystery. ""Cooper"" (Dennis Quaid) and his wife ""Leah"" (Sharon Stone) take their kids from the city to live in an old rural manor house. It needs a bit of work, and they hire in the son of the former owner ""Dale"" (Dorff) to help out. That's mistake number one as we quickly discover that this house might not be the family's most shrewd purchase. Mike Figgis tries quite hard to build and sustain a sense of menace here, but he is completely let down by a storyline that is far too thinly stretched and by a really lacklustre effort from both Stone and the really weak Quaid. It doesn't so much end, as just peter out - I couldn't have cared less about any of them and once Dorff put his shirt on, my interest waned completely. An early outing for Kristen Stewart and a pointless one for Christopher Plummer (who didn't even have to get out of bed) add quite literally nothing to this mundane thriller that is really light on thrill."

The manner in which the past history was told to the boy reminded me of Peter Falk in the Neverending Story, but I guess there are only so many ways you can have an old man relate an adventure yarn to a youngster.

Some of the storyline seemed rather predictable to me, but there were enough surprising little touches to keep me interested. It was well worth the time. It was apparently considered to be a transitional role for the young lead actor, Haley Joel Osmont, from The Sixth Sense and Pay It Forward, to more mature roles. 

Interestingly, when it showed comic strips drawn by the boy as an adult, it reminded my strongly of Walt Kelly’s Pogo, and the character’s name is also Walt. But it was probably just my perception, for I read the fictional strips were drawn by Berke Breathed, an excellent cartoonist In his own right, who was apparently influenced by the a Doonesbury strip, not Pogo. || _**Learning about life from your two eccentric uncles in central Texas**_

In the summer of 1962, a troubled, introverted boy (Haley Joel Osment) is dropped off by his dubious mother (Kyra Sedgwick) at the remote home of his two great-uncles in central Texas (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall). His money-loving mom and other relatives are only interested in their (supposed) hidden cache of wealth while the kid simply needs their acceptance, wisdom and love. 

""Secondhand Lions"" (2003) is a quirky coming-of-age drama that combines elements of “A Perfect World” (1993) and “Sling Blade” (1996) with the amusement of Indiana Jones, “Simon Birch” (1998) and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” (2000). It’s entertaining, enlightening and heartwarming all at the same time. Yet it’s more than just a coming-of-age drama because it effectively addresses one’s usefulness in life after his/her physical prime. It’s also a good animal flick, although they’re peripheral.

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in the Austin, Texas, area, including Pflugerville, Manor (fight at store) & Lockhart, Texas.

Somehow, _Underworld_ did though, and yes, it's very much a product of that early '00s industrial inspired age, but it is a solid, solid take on some realistic(ish) aspects of supernatural monster mythos.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || **Overall : Action, horror, monsters, guns, striking practical effects, spectacular creature designs, and a surprisingly proven and fantastic cast led by Kate Beckinsale all get mashed together to create one of the best creature features there is!**

Underworld brings a new twist to the vampire and werewolf genre by pitting them against each other as they vie for control of the criminal underworld ruled by nightmarish creatures. It's hard to believe the budget for this film is relatively small because it doesn't feel limited in any way. The action and fight sequences are superb, with Kate Beckinsale proving herself an unstoppable action heroine for the first time with her prior career consisting of primarily romcoms. The creature design, special effects, sets, cinematography, and even the rest of the cast are all top-notch. Len Wiseman found a way to take a small budget and produce a big-budget genre-blending masterstroke that any action or horror fan is sure to love. || True, this isn't the most original of concepts and we have oft seen similar styles of treatment of these ancient rivalries, but Kate Beckinsale's lithe and deadly ""Selene"" and Michael Sheen's menacing ""Lucian"" are engaging enough in this tale of vampires v werewolves. Scott Speedman provides the eye candy (but very little else) as the hapless human ""Michael"" whom she rescues only to discover that he might prove a lot more important than  either of them realise, and Bill Nighy is superbly over the top as the recently raised from his slumbers ""Viktor"" who really did fancy a (very) long lie in. Clad in leather and scurrying from place to place amidst the darkened environments the breadth of the city, the two must avoid capture and find a way to thwart ambitions that will re-enliven the timeless conflict between the two warring species. The combat scenes are heavily choreographed and do repeat themselves quite often and least said about Shane Brolly's weakly portrayed ""Kraven"" the better, but I did enjoy this."

But on other levels, this film is fascinating. The cast, especially Sarah Polley, does a bang up job. Every character real and believable - even the kids.

First and foremost, the film is a strong advocate for ""viva la vida"" (Frida Kahlo before Cold Play!). There is an old Buddhist parable about a man running from a tiger and suddenly faced with a cliff. In one direction, the tiger; in the other, the cliff. He looks down and sees a branch growing out of the rock. Somehow, he casts himself down and grabs that branch. The tiger looks over the edge at him. He doesn't think either he or the branch can hold on too long. Then he spies a wild strawberry near the branch. He grabs it and eats it. It is the very best strawberry he ever ate in his soon-to-be-over life. And so it is with our protagonist. Having the harshness of mortality shoved in her face at a young age, she begins to live each day with full attention. Something humans hardly ever practice.

Second, the interesting, but perhaps unrealistic, decision to withhold her diagnosis and prognosis from everyone, creates an entirely unexpected space. She takes her cue from Dr. Thompson (Julian Richings), who can't look someone in the eye and tell them they're going to die. From there, she decides not to put anyone else in Dr. Thompson's situation. This frees us from the overly maudlin watching someone die thread."

Dustin Hoffman already had some grittier parts in his repertoire; but for Robert Redford this is more of a departure from his usual roles and the rapport between the two, initially suspicious journalists, builds as we all begin to realise that there is a hell of a lot more to this than just some unlucky burglars. Jason Robards and Martin Balsam serve as the real life editorial leads at the newspaper, but also as characters we can all use to take stock during these rapidly advancing, and incriminating developments. Alan J. Pakula subtly and deftly takes us through the chronology in an enthralling manner; exposing crossing sub-plots and personalities - as well as demonstrating the palpable risks being taken by many to uncover the truth. We all know the ending, but this film is quite possibly the reason why many still recall this momentous story. || **Fifty years after Watergate, what have we learned?**

The “Watergate Affair” was fifty years ago. For those who don't remember or weren't born, it all started with the invasion of the Democratic Party offices in the Watergate Building, in Washington D.C., by a group of men, caught while trying to install bugs and copy documents. The group's connection to the CIA became obvious and, as the inquiries progressed, the story became more bizarre: after all, everything had been done under orders coming from within the White House, from people very interested in manipulating the elections that year, in which Richard Nixon was going to run for his second term against the Democratic candidate, George McGovern.

The film tells us about this, but stops here, focusing on the contribution of journalists from The Washington Post, who investigated the matter and published relevant information. The film doesn't say what happened next, but as we know, Nixon was re-elected and quickly found himself under suspicion about his involvement in the Watergate break-in. Nixon refused to give explanations, hiding behind his office prerogatives, not even when it became known that there was a voice recording system in his office. With Congress demanding to hear these recordings under serious threats of impeachment, Nixon preferred to resign and, since then, “Watergate” has been an eternal synonym of political corruption at the highest level.

Directed by Alan Pakula and released in the years following the events, the film would have needed no further explanation. The names of those involved and the details of the story would be fresh in everyone's memory. However, more than fifty years later, who remembers the details? As the film does not give us explanations, only people who know the subject well or have read about it will watch the film without needing to go to the Internet every ten minutes. Even I, a historian, needed to refresh my memory. Aside from this problem, the film is good and is faithful to the events and what the two “Post” journalists did.

There is another problem with this film, although it is a minor problem: at this time, in the 70s, it seems that a politician was required to have bulletproof morality and a virtually untainted character. And now? We are in 2024 and democracy, instead of maturing, seems to have rotted to the point that American citizens allow a former president, who is in the grip of justice and apparently involved in a direct attack against Congress (which represents all the people) to presents himself again as a candidate without any problems, ready to be carried on shoulders to a cabinet he should never set foot in again. I am not North American, but as a European I refuse to consider such a matter a mere internal issue, taking into account the role that the USA wants to maintain on the international stage, in NATO or in the UN. Unfortunately, the degradation of democracy happens here too, and has been taken advantage of by Putin, President Xi and other enemies of the free world, a world of peace and freedom that our fathers worked hard to build together, and we are letting disappear.

Returning to the film... it's worth seeing the performance of Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford in two roles that helped a lot in the evolution of their careers. They are some of the best actors of that period and did a colossal job in this film. The supporting cast is equally remarkable and deserves our full attention. I particularly liked the work of Martin Balsam, Jack Warden and Jason Robards, outstanding actors who transformed three roles without much relevance into good additions to the general plot. And although we only learned more details recently, Hal Holbrook was an excellent choice to bring to life the mysterious “Deep Throat”, one of the decisive sources for linking Watergate with the White House.

Technically, it is a discreet film that bets everything on the rigorous reconstruction of the settings, environments and events. There are some very good sound effects (the association of the sounds of typewriters with the sound of gunshots was intelligent and well done, for example) and the lighting effects were equally well-used. Note the dark and mysterious atmosphere of the encounters with “Deep Throat”, with the light almost reduced to what is essential. The film deservedly won four Oscars (Best Sound, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction and Best Supporting Actor) and was one of the big contenders for Best Film."

As the film opens, we are introduced to Martine and Philippa, daughters of a charismatic preacher in a tiny Jutland village. Dedicated to their father's work, they turn down the courtship of a Danish officer and a French musician. Decades later, the musician sends them Babette, a refugee from the destruction of the Paris Commune, in the hope that the sisters can shelter her and employ her as a maid. When she wins an annual lottery, Babette decides to put on a feast for her employers, but no one expects the depths of selflessness she goes to.

<i>Babette's Feast</i> is entertaining enough, and it gives an idea of just how dull and messy life in Jutland was at this time. The details of the feast will make you salivate and dust off the French cookbook, and certainly the ending will make you say ""Aww"" in spite of how clumsily it's put on film. Otherwise the acting isn't too revelatory, and the humour is pretty basic (the same joke is even used twice). One professional reviewer said this doesn't aim much higher than a television movie, and I'd have to agree. || Well, <em>'Babette’s Feast'</em> is exactly what it says on the tin, that's for sure.

It is a film that I'd personally refer to as 'good', though my interest did ascend and descend interchangeably throughout. The religiously and sing-y scenes were the parts that kinda lost me if I'm honest, but there is still enough there that I had a fine time seeing unfold - the characters for one, and then the final feast itself is decent viewing.

Stéphane Audran is the best performer onscreen, I enjoyed her showing. The actresses that play Filippa and Martine, both younger and older, are solid. Beyond them, the rest of the cast all kinda merge into one in my memory as being alright. It's very much all about Audran, I'd say.

I do like how the film unfolds and what it has to end up saying, there is charm in there. I just personally would've had it move along at a slightly quicker pace because this does drag a tiny bit in parts; and that's despite it only being practically a 90 minute movie. Overall, though, it's a pass from me. || **_The moment when “Mercy and truth… have kissed each other”_**

In a northern Jutland village, two daughters of a pietistic Lutheran pastor are dutiful spinsters by 1871 (Bodil Kjer and Birgitte Federspiel) when they take-in a Parisian refugee who “can cook” (Stéphane Audran). Fourteen years later, the latter insists on banquet for the dwindling congregation and a Hussar general, a former suiter of one of the sisters from decades earlier (Jarl Kulle).

A Danish production, “Babette’s Feast” (1987) was based on the short story by Isak Dinesen, aka Karen Blixen, who’s also known as the author of “Out of Africa.” I point that out because this has the same quietly dramatic tone, just transplanted to a family of ascetic rural Protestants in 1800’s Denmark.

To enjoy this, you have to be in the mood for period drama along the lines of “Mysteries” (1978) or “Mayflower: The Pilgrims' Adventure” (1979). This is even more mundane and subtle than those, but it’s rich with underlying meaning, such as two opposing things meeting at the table of the true artist for respite, e.g. worldly disillusionment and stiff pietism, Protestant and Catholic, upper-class and lower-class, the experienced and the naïve, bickering congregant and fellow congregant, older self and younger self, etc.

I said the movie was subtle, and it is, that is until the third act when a couple of bits are laid on too thick. But, man, I loved the part about loving someone every day, decade after decade, even though you can’t physically be together for one reason or another.

It's at least 20 minutes overlong at 1 hour, 42 minutes. And was shot in Denmark with the village located at Vigsø, Thisted Kommune.

1991 

""One out of every twenty-one Black American males will be murdered in their lifetime""

""Most will die at the hands of another Black male""

""Increase The Peace"" is the closing message of John Singleton's powerful, intelligent and affecting call for calm in South Central Los Angeles. Often mistakenly presumed by those who haven't seen it to be a film that glamorises violence, Singleton's debut film takes us into South Central and holds us there by just shooting the story. No trickery or overtly moralistic posturing from the director (and writer), just an unpretentious look at life in a modern ghetto.

The story follows three black teenagers as they ponder on what life holds for them as adulthood lurches from around the corner. Brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) and best friend Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr), each have the usual worries that come with leaving the teenage years behind. Parents, girls, careers, not returning to the pen! But this is no ordinary coming of age drama, we have been party to this neighbourhood that these boys live in. This is a place where a trip to the store can get you killed in a drive by shooting. A place where those keen to learn and do their homework have their muse shattered by the frequent sound of gunshots and sirens filling the South Central night.

Though Singleton can be accused of painting some of his characters as too saintly, he should be forgiven since this is after all, a message movie. Besides which his portrait of this particular neighbourhood is done from honest memory since he himself be a former youth of South Central LA. There in lies one of Boyz's trump cards, Singleton, through his own observations, asks of those in ""The Hood"" to take responsibility for what they do. Something that is potently given narrative credence courtesy of Tre's father's (a fabulous understated Laurence Fishburne) deep musings. Once the built up tension explodes with the inevitable tragedy that all should be ready for, the impact is like a sledgehammer hitting bone. Not in a blood letting for impact sake, but with the aftermath as a family soaks up the situation. It gives 90s cinema one of its most affecting and damning scenes, one that once viewed is hard to fully shake out of the memory bank. Here Singleton could possibly have bowed out of the story, but he goes further, expanding the aftermath and taking us, along with the characters, to the final ""Increase The Peace"" dénouement.

It's been called everything from an After School Special to the most important Black American movie made thus far. I agree with the last assessment. 9/10 || John Singleton really isn't my thing. I mean, the movie came out in '91 but didn't get much exposure out in the country where I grew up until it was on HBO. However ""Poetic Justice"" DID and when I finally came around to watching ""Boyz n the Hood"" I had extremely low expectations.

I honestly thought it was going to be as absolutely pointless as ""Poetic Justice"" was.

And, yeah, I did kind of like ""Higher Learning,"" which I also saw before this, but I still kind of feel that he was pointing the finger at white people and telling the viewers that we are all evil and the cause of all the problems in the world.

So I went in here thinking it was going to be a talented racist mess.

However, it wasn't. The fact is the film was absolutely amazing. And, honestly, it was the first film I saw about gangs, from a non-police POV, that didn't glorify them. And it remains one of the few gangland movies I've seen that doesn't glorify the lifestyle.

And I understand that they are two completely different beasts, but the film felt like it was taking the issue of gangs and giving it a ""The Godfather"" treatment...and it worked.

It worked brilliantly. You can both relate to the characters--although I'm probably not supposed to say that--and see that the gang culture is a horrible thing.

Unlike ""Poetic Justice"" it has a point. And unlike ""Higher Learning,"" it doesn't cast as racist of a finger.

It actually deals with issues and tells a story and, honestly, to watch it is to love it."

Not songs you might recognise by their titles, but ones your toes start instinctively tapping to when the ensemble break into their well choreographed delivery. It's an OK watch, this, but I found that the initially innovative joke wore a bit thin quite quickly and the scenarios prove just a little too repetitive.

Bugsy is directed by Barry Levinson and written by James Toback. It stars Warren Beatty, Annette Benning, Harvey Keitel, Ben Kingsley, Elliott Gould and Joe Mantegna. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Allen Daviau. Film is a biography adaptation of Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, a notorious American mobster who rose to prominence in the 30s and 40s.

Barry Levinson’s epic film didn’t turn out to be the mobster film many had hoped for. There was great anticipation that this would be Levinson’s Goodfellas. What ultimately came to pass was a film of epic scope and detail, alive not with violence and mobster edginess, but of romanticism, of visionary peccadilloes and of folly. This is both a blessing and a curse, for Levinson seems to be caught in two minds between being respectful to his main characterisation, or unleashing the beast as we know it.

Story concerns itself with Siegel being sent to tidy up West Coast operations, from where he would fall in love with starlet Virginia Hill and become one of the most prominent names in Hollywood of the 40s. Whilst the pic has moments where Siegel seethes and teeters on the edge of murderous rage, much of the history here is scratchy to say the least, where again Levinson and Toback ignore just what a nasty piece of work Siegel was in real life, and instead put dreamy ideals and hot to trot passions in instead.

It’s all perfectly mounted, this is very good film making, it just always seems to be on the periphery of making a telling contribution to the Siegel legacy on film. Beatty is dandy and ever watchable, but this is not a Bugsy Siegel we can identify with, rendering an air of falseness to the story telling. The support cast are strong, though Mantegna as George Raft is miscast, but the likes of Kingsley and Gould make telling contributions with only morsels to feed off of from the screenwriter.

In its longest form it runs at two and half hours, and it’s testament to the film maker's craft that it always maintains interest. Yet the various splinters trying to dovetail into one never quite make it and that’s a shame. 6.5/10 || I just reviewed Reds, a movie where they managed to make John Reed boring and now I am reviewing Bugsy... a movie where they manage to make Bugsy Siegel boring.

And honestly, like with Reds, Bugsy helped Luciano rise to power in what is one of the most interesting mafia stories in American history... which you really don't see here. In fact, it's hardly even mentioned.

But... after Bugsy did that he built Vegas, that has to be a cool story, right?

And... yeah, it is a pretty cool story, only they kind of ignore that and focus on a love story instead with the whole Vegas thing as a secondary plot.

So, you know, at least they made Bonnie and Clyde good."

Unless its for any number of the nearly-identical-but-better movies he did in the same era.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || This is where the law stops and I start, sucker!

Cobra is directed by George P. Cosmatos and written by  Paula Gosling (novel Fair game) and Sylvester Stallone. It stars Stallone, Brigitte Nielsen, Brian Thompson, Reni Santoni, Andrew Robinson, John Herzfeld and Lee Garlington. Music is by Sylvester Levay and cinematography by Ric Waite. 

A tough-on-crime street cop must protect the only surviving witness to a strange murderous cult with far-reaching plans.

Cobra is a tantalising peek as to just what Stallone's ""Beverley Hills Cop"" would have looked like. He had turned in a gritty and ballsy action screenplay but the studio balked at the cost and thus went with the comedic Eddie Murphy route (which worked great as it happens).

This truncated 1hour and 20 minute Cobra just hints at what a dark edgy action film we should have had before the scissor suits at the studio got panicky and cut out a third of the pic.

What we have left though is still good fun, Stallone is on cocky and cool bad dude mode, the villain is OTT (Brian Thompson actually looks like Arnie in some facial shots), Nielsen is in her natural bodily state... while the action we do get is high octane. It's hardly a stinker, if a little frustrating with a ""what might have been hanging"" over it, and of course the editing is shoddy. 6.5/10 || Short and sweet.

<em>'Cobra'</em> is a straightforward, by the numbers action film with Sylvester Stallone. It doesn't really do much to drift you away from the obvious, but the action itself is entertaining and some of the deaths are quite cool to watch. The songs are passable, if not entirely well chosen.

Stallone, as you'd likely expect, is the only performer worth noting. He does his usual stuff and it comes across strong enough, one thing I didn't like about his character is his speech - the dialogue is kinda poor, they attempt to make Cobra a smooth, cool badass but it doesn't really work in that way.

I'd almost considering this a disappointing film, but the watchable action and Stallone himself carry this over the line for a good film in my opinion."

Argento the director is doing good work here, which explains why the film has a sturdy reputation. His eye for striking imagery and horror scene staging is evident here for sure, but Argento the writer (along with Franco Ferrini) fails to string a decent enough narrative together. Pace is all over the place, the dialogue often boorish, while wasting Donald Pleasence is a crime against horror film making. Still, there’s enough good Argento at work here to keep Phenomena above average, even if it’s more for the eyes than the brain. 6/10 || Both a great chance to see two acting icons (one, Donald Pleasence, at his prime, and the other, Jennifer Connelly, just starting out on her filmic journey) and one of the films on director Argento's great run of horror classics, this is worth purchasing the finest print and will award the horror aficionado many great times in rewatches.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || **I expected much more: this film is a shadow of what it should have been.**

I think it's redundant to say what everyone already knows: the Monty Python represents the pinnacle of British humor, and if each of those comedians is excellent alone, seeing them together is always an added bonus. This film, however, is a late work by the group, when each of them was starting to have a solo career and the group's notoriety was consolidated. There are incredible partnerships in the artistic world, and if we think about it, we will think of huge music bands, television series or troupes of actors that worked incredibly well and were successful for a certain time. The issue is that many of them did not know how to harmonize a joint existence with the growing commitments of individual agendas. And I think that's what happened with Python, and that helped complicate this project.

The film makes us laugh, it has some good moments, but it is a shadow if we try to compare it to “The Holy Grail”, for example. That's the crux of the matter: it's not bad, but it should have been much better, considering the talent of those involved! For me, a good part of the problem comes from the fact that it is a succession of humorous sketches with almost no obvious correlation between them. We can admit that in a TV comedy show, it is done routinely, and it works very well. In a film, greater cohesion, unity and homogeneity are expected. It's not an unbreakable rule, but it was an expectation I had.

Another problem with this film is the quality of the humor. We already know that the humor has more puerile moments and others that are frankly acidic, but the film resorts too much to easy laughter and simplistic and unrefined humor: a man who is condemned to death and chooses to fall off a cliff after being chased by naked women; an enormously obese man who, in a fancy restaurant, vomits everything around him and eats a regimental dose of food; a sex education class for totally naive boys (something impossible to believe, even considering the time when the film was made) and with the right to practical and very visual exemplification of the act in the classroom... what's the funny in all this?

As I said, the movie has some good moments. I loved the delivery room sketch, I think it's an absolutely delicious sarcasm and that it still works as a critique of the general state of public health services. I also liked Crimson Insurance, which is nothing more than a gigantic parody of Errol Flynn's piracy films, especially “Sea Hawk”, but which has a sympathetic touch and a critique of globalization and unbridled capitalism. Much less pleasant, but equally hilarious, was the huge musical sketch of Irish Catholics, stuffed to the bone with political incorrectness and with very accurate stings to the rejection discourse that the Catholic Church was maintaining with regard to contraceptive methods. || Well, I suppose if anyone was ever going to be able to get to grips with the meaning of life, it was going to be the “Monty Python” lads but for me their brand of comedy never really worked. This starts with it’s equivalent of a B-reel: a bunch of geriatric insurance processors who react with unexpected violence when one of their number is fired. Next thing their building is a weapon of war wreaking havoc on the glittering world of a-personal commercialism! It’s quite entertaining how these folks intermingle “Spartacus” into the plot as they cannibalise everything from the ceiling fan to the filing cabinet to arm themselves. Thence to the main feature - and that starts with a stinging swing at the monetisation of life, right from the process of birth followed by a sarcastic critique on the attitudes to family planning of Roman Catholics with their sacred sperm! That sticky wicket starts us off through a cycle of education and onto the thing man does best: make war. This is maybe the funniest part as they have to cart around an officer who has a bit of a sore leg! Thereafter it begins to strain a little and descends too much into the realms of the vulgar. Perhaps songs about the penis raised a titter in the 1960s but in 1983 they are less potent, as is the sight of a large gent over-indulging then spewing all over the place. Finally, the man with the scythe turns up to herald the final chapter and convey everyone to a perpetual existence of tinsel and mince pies. It has it’s moments and at times it successfully uses exaggerated scenarios to provide quite a witty observation on just how mundanity governs pretty much all we do from cradle to grave, but it misses more than it hits for me.

Directed by Brian G. Hutton and adapted to the screen from his own novel by Alistair MacLean, Where Eagles Dare stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. Music is scored by Ron Goodwin and cinematography is by Arthur Ibbetson.

A small group of allied agents are sent on a mission to rescue a Allied General from a Nazi castle stronghold. But there is more than what meets the eye here...

Boys own men on a mission in grandiose strokes, MacLean's complex story makes for riveting and exciting entertainment. The story twists and turns like a Python on acid, thus requiring full attention to conversational details is very much advised. And yet joyously it's the fun and kinetic action that holds the most attention, especially for what is quite an explosive and thrilling last third of picture. There are stunts galore amongst the Austrian Alps (beautifully photographed by Ibbetson), and as the espionage hokum reaches its crescendo status, so does the kinetic carnage, with the makers wasting no opportunity to blow everything up.

Burton is classy and enjoying himself, Eastwood laconic and cool, while good support comes from Mary Ure (great to have a well written spunky female lead), Patrick Wymark, Michael Hordern and Donald Houston. The running time is a touch too long as MacLean's prose is given weighty treatment for extended chatter, and some back projection work feels unnecessarily cheap for such a grand production, but this is good old machismo fuelled classic cinema regardless. 9/10 || _**One of the greatest action/adventure films ever made**_

RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Brian G. Hutton, ""Where Eagles Dare"" is a World War II adventure about handful of commandos parachuting into the wilderness surrounding a German castle-fortress high in the Bavarian Alps. Their mission is to rescue a captive general before the Germans can interrogate him. However, not everything is as it first appears.

The film is not a conventional World War II flick. Alistair Maclean wrote the script based on his novel and thus the movie is, unsurprisingly, a spy thriller just as much as it is a war picture. Keep in mind that spy flicks were super-hot when the film was released (e.g. James Bond). Are 60's spy films plausible? Realistic? No, they only have the veneer of plausibility and realism; underneath it's all escapist fantasy. So it is with ""Where Eagles Dare.""

The opening with the breathtaking Alps and Ron Goodwin's exhilerating score is one of the greatest cinematic openings in history. From there you get intrigue, thrilling action scenes, a magnificent castle, Richard Burton at his charismatic best, two beautiful women (Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt), surprising plot twists, cable cars, a suspenseful escape and a don't-see-it-coming ending, not to mention Clint Eastwood.

Speaking of Eastwood, he plays a taciturn American lieutenant, second fiddle to Richard Burton, the British leader of the operation. Believe it or not, Burton's charisma is so out of the ball park that Eastwood pales by comparison. Of course, this has a lot to do with the way their roles were written, but you still have to give Burton credit for blowing Eastwood, who's no slouch, out of the water.

Some complain about the utter ruthlessness of the Allied commandos, particularly the characters played by Burton and Eastwood, but they're Special Forces on a secret mission, not conventional soldiers in infantry combat. They're professional killing machines, which is why they were given the job. There was no room for mercy in this operation at this stage in the war.

In any case, it's exciting to see Burton & Eastwood and their team mow down scores of Germans. The film's so well-done and compelling that you sorta don't realize how unbelievable it is while watching. This is because it lacks the cartoonish-ness of, say, ""Rambo 2"" and ""Rambo 3"" and maintains an air of realism throughout (which is different than saying it's realistic).

FINAL WORD: ""Where Eagles Dare"" is one of the greatest action/adventure films of all time and is as-good-or-better than any war flick you care to name. The exhilarating score itself is worth the price of admission, as is the opening. If you're in the mood for a World War II flick, ""Where Eagles Dare"" belongs near the top of the list.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 35 minutes and was shot on location in Austria with studio work done in England.

GRADE: A || So close to being a great film.

There is a lot I enjoyed about <em>'Where Eagles Dare'</em>, the core of the film has some greatness to it. The action sequences are fun, the acting is terrific and the music is strong. However, it has far too many lull moments for me to consider it anything other than 'good'.

A 2hr run time would've been perfect, instead it's stretched out to 2hrs 30mins+ and it really shows. The pacing is bad, any moment of quality is immediately followed by the film dragging its heels. It heavily overstays its welcome, in my opinion.

Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are excellent together, while the rest of the cast are very good themselves. It's just a shame about the aforementioned, as I could quite easily see this being one of my favourite films if what I've stated wasn't true.

I'd personally be up for a shorter, tighter remake of this, because all the ingredients are there; it's like a <em>'Bond'</em> film mixed with <em>'Fast & Furious'</em> in parts."

The murders are getting personal when the killer chooses victims who are acquaintances of Block.

Tightrope is directed by Richard Tuggle and Clint Eastwood, Tuggle writes the screenplay. It stars Eastwood, Genevieve Bujold, Dan Hedaya, Alison Eastwood and Rod Masterson. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Bruce Surtees.

New Orleans and Detective Wes Block is plunged into a hunt for a rapist serial killer that brings out his own deviant peccadilloes. 

One of Eastwood’s best movies also happens to be one of his most under appreciated, the actor challenging himself to explore a darker characterisation than the iconographic ones he was most famed for. Wes Block is a damaged man, a divorced father of two girls, who he adores but they are uncomfortably at arms length due to his work. He’s afraid of affection, to be touched in a gentle manner by a member of the opposite sex, preferring to indulge in seamy sex by way of prostitutes who frequent the dark abodes of Orleans’ French Quarter. 

If you knew what’s ahead…

Enter the doppelganger effect, as a mysterious serial killer is at large murdering the ladies of the night that Wes takes his pleasure with, the guilt factor hanging heavy on his haunted shoulders. As Wes tries to bring down the killer, he is battling to realign his mindset about the female sex, his daughters and also Beryl Thibodeaux (Bujold), the latter the rape counsellor who was once his sparring adversary, but is now a potential lover if Wes can put everything back on an even keel.

Tuggle, Eastwood and Surtees bring plenty of film noir touches to their picture. Surtees’ photography is strong in colour but dark in shading, perfectly embodying the seamy side of The Big Easy. Between them, actor and director fill out this fascinating tale with classic noirish scenes. A Mardi Gras warehouse is eerie, as is a chase through a cemetery, then there’s clowns and balloons, things that are associated with childish fun but so often in noirville carry a sinister edge. The sleazy dives that Wes frequents are foreboding places of sin, more so when the killer is stalking his prey. While a railroad location is used to great effect as well.

It has some problems, Hedaya is wasted and the Wes and Beryl relationship is telegraphed a mile away. While the formula of such movies inevitably means the culmination of tale is no surprise, but the journey is a dark and interesting one and Tightrope is a damn fine thriller. 8/10 || ***Dramatic, melancholic Eastwood detective flick set in New Orleans*** 

A divorced detective in New Orleans (Clint Eastwood) juggles raising two daughters, pursing a serial rapist/killer, cultivating a romantic relationship (Geneviève Bujold) and dealing with his own dark side, which he realizes is too close for comfort to the killer.

“Tightrope” (1984) is another Eastwood detective flick, but it’s not as entertaining and compelling as his Dirty Harry films or “The Gauntlet” (1977). It’s darker, more dramatic and brooding, not to mention a tad sleazy. This may bring to mind the original “Dirty Harry” (1971), but the subdued tone is closer to “Blood Work” (2002).

The title refers to a person walking the tightrope between his/her good side and bad side.

The movie runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot entirely in New Orleans.

GRADE: C+/B- || How is this not super entertaining?

<em>'Tightrope'</em> should have all the ingredients to make the viewer be on the edge of their seat, and yet I really didn't care much for it. Clint Eastwood, who apparently took over unofficially as director from Richard Tuggle during filming, gives a solid performance and the bond with his character's children is cute.

However, the story just didn't do anything for me. It's not particularly unnerving, despite a dark on paper story, and it's rather predictable - the villain... well, the villain I've already forgotten about and I only finished watching about an hour ago.

Not terrible, but not good."

This is another Clint Eastwood cop thriller. What immediately comes to mind? The five Dirty Harry films, right? Or “The Gauntlet” (1977)? All great or near-great Eastwood cop pictures. So you'd expect the same from 1990's “The Rookie,” costarring Charlie Sheen as the sidekick. Well, you'd be wrong.

Something keeps “The Rookie” from attaining the heights of those other Eastwood cop films. It even pales compared to “Tightrope” (1984) and “Blood Work” (2002). Don’t get me wrong, there are some entertaining elements and the thrills certainly pick up in the overblown last act, but the flick’s too contrived and even falls into camp territory at times.

Furthermore, Sheen’s unconvincing as a tough cop who can singlehandedly take down a bar on the wrong side of town, not to mention the miscasting of Latino’s Raul Julia and Sonia Braga as German villains. While Braga is stunning, she’s not utilized to her potential; neither is Lara Flynn Boyle. Meanwhile Tom Skerritt is wasted in a trivial role as Sheen's rich dad.

So this is a disappointing, even laughable Eastwood cop flick and rightly forgotten. The constant macho f-bombs don't help. Still, there are enough engaging moments to make it worth catching if you can laugh with it.

The movie runs 2 hours and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

GRADE: C/C- || Decent action flick, rubbish buddy cop movie.

The reason for the latter is that Clint Eastwood and Charlie Sheen just don't really work as a pairing, when I think of great buddy cop duos - see the preceding <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/lethal-weapon/"" rel=""nofollow"">Lethal Weapon</a>'</em> or the succeeding <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/rush-hour/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rush Hour</a>'</em> - I always recall the banter and that the two are subconsciously looking out for each other. Here, it just felt like Eastwood and Sheen weren't connected - despite being policing partners.

The action elements help raise this film from the depths though, as all the set pieces and stuff like that come off - there's one scene that Michael Bay would love, I'm sure. The support cast are alright too, I recognised - among one or two others - Xander Berkeley and Tony Plana.

Despite those (minor) positives, the initially mentioned parts override them in <em>'The Rookie'</em>. These type of films need to make you love watching the two leads together, but here I simply didn't - they make for an average partnership, at best. || There is a movie with James Woods that I keep mistaking for this one.  

Anyway, it falls under the ""What did you expect?"" category of flick.  It's not good... it's not bad either.  No one expected it to be a box office bomb, no one expected it to be the next big thing either.

They set out to make a fun and entertaining throw away cop movie and that was exactly what they ended up making, a fun and entertaining action flick.

And that is all it is, something to like and throw away, so it did it's job."

The weight of expectation for City Heat was massive, two iconic Hollywood actors together in a buddy buddy cop movie, one with nods and homages to film noir and old school gangster movies, it wasn't unreasonable to expect a movie to sit with the best on Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynold's then CV's circa 1984. Unfortunately it's no masterpiece or close to being in the upper echelon's of each actor's respective works. But that doesn't make it a bad film.

A change of director saw Blake Edwards replaced by Richard Benjamin after Eastwood and Edwards, ahem, couldn't see eye to eye, so that immediately put the film on the back foot in many critic's eyes. Ironically Benjamin does OK - working from Edwards' script (there's a whole bunch of back stories and tittle-tattle assigned to this film if you care to search for it). Lots of fun here, though, as Clint and Burt, one a cop, the other an ex-cop turned PI, reluctantly team up to cut a swathe through the gangsters ruling the roost in prohibition era Kansas City.

Eastwood does his straight backed machismo act, throwing awesome punches along the way, while Reynolds is wonderfully cheerful as a tough guy who all things considered, would rather not get hurt! The script is full of zingers, delivered with customary sardonic self parody by the stars, while the roll call of supporting actors is not to be sniffed at. Period detail is high end, with Nick McLean's photography carrying the requisite neo-noir impact, while the music tracking is pleasingly nostalgic.

It's over the top of course and needlessly convoluted as per its yearning to be noirish, yet if you can cut back your expectation levels? And you can simply enjoy the sight of Eastwood and Reynolds having fun romping in this period? Then you just might enjoy this more than you dared to believe. 7/10 || Clint Eastwood carries it, but <em>'City Heat'</em> as a whole is just about good.

Burt Reynolds makes for a solid partner for Eastwood, though his character isn't as strong as the latter's - who is played by the film's standout, no doubt. There's not any star performers behind those two, though Richard Roundtree and Rip Torn are alright. One positive, though, is the 1930s set design, which I really liked.

Not the most memorable flick, you could say it ought to be due to the double act up top, but I still found it to be a satisfactory watch."

It's bleak, grim and repulsive - and all in a great, intentional, cinematographic fashion. The thread centres around the young ""Flyora"" (a superb effort from Aleksey Kravchenko) who is taken from his Belorussian family farm at gunpoint (along with anything it's possible to eat) by the invading Nazi troops. What now ensues follows this young man as he escapes his captors, finds an old rifle and determines to join up with the communists who are fighting almost insurmountable odds to thwart their encroaching, heavily armed, foe. What really resonates here is the simplicity of the production. There are no specials effects, no CGI to create many when there are few - it tells the simplest of stories in a manner that is truly brutal at times, then truly evocative at others. Man's inhumanity to man and all that - but writ large and depicting an invading army devoid of any semblance of humanity on just about every level. The experiences of this young man are truly horrific, but the presentation here is not especially graphic - though it's not for the faint hearted. We are shown what is happening, but Elem Klimov leaves plenty of scope for our own imagination to augment, if that is actually possible, the true grotesqueness of war, of random killings and destruction and all quite possibly exacerbated by the fact that the conquerors had no real idea what they were doing, or why - the film almost imbues them with the characteristics of the wildest of animals who enjoy their regime of torture and malevolence for the sake of it. The ending has a certain degree of vindication about it - but oddly enough it's not especially satisfying. The emotional exhaustion of the viewer has long since set in, and the true fate of what I can only really call these uniformed bullies is just, yet somehow inadequate. The film is gently paced, it could almost be a video diary as young ""Flyora"" meets and hides from those he encounters and we share his fears and risks en route.

There are similarities to “The Rage: Carrie 2” (1999), but it’s nowhere near as effective.

It could be said that in the fervor of Italian directors going from one filmmaking trend to the next (from the neorealist agenda of 'Ossessione' and 'Rome, Open City', to swords-and-sandals epics, then spaghetti westerns, then the crime films of the 70's, then space invasion films, such as this, after the huge global success of Sir Ridley Scott's 'Alien' and George Lucas' 'Star Wars') has had almost as much an influence on cinema as the groundbreaking game-changers that initiated this mass-production. It taught virtually all filmmakers that with a fraction of the huge Hollywood budget, a couple of ideas could be extrapolated into a much cheaper film that could ride on the coattails of success of its way-more-famous predecessor.

Being nostalgic, there were some things that really scored big for me and made me raise my rating: Seeing the Twin Towers of New York City again, the Goblin soundtrack and the Cannon Pictures logo, especially. It's a suspenseful, well-made for its expense sci-fi film that isn't simply worth a watch, but is worth owning a copy and re-watching as well. This is most definitely one of my finer finds from my ominous Mill Creek 50-pack, 'Nightmare Worlds'. || For those who saw ZOMBIE, this film starts hilariously similar, featuring an empty vessel floating into New York Harbor while a cop comments that the skipper of that craft ""must be a real turkey"". Also you'll hear right away a lot of voice-over by Nick Alexander, who was the voice of one of the most prominent characters in ZOMBIE. It's an exploitation movie exploiting a fellow exploitation movie!

Things immediately fall apart once we're treated to some truly hideous dialog, poor production values, and even worse editing choices as the film gets into its narrative. The first act of the film benefits most by delivering some juicy exploding body effects though the plot can't really figure out a good way to factor it all into a cohesive and entertaining story. Instead, the characters zip off to South America (I assume because the producers wanted a vacation) and do... nothing! They get to take a tour of a factory and Louise Marleau gets in a non-revealing shower scene. Eventually they get around to battling a motionless alien sitting at the end of a corridor straight out of the similarly Italian co-produced first season episode ""Dragon's Domain"" of SPACE 1999.

Uncharacteristically for sci fi director Cozzi, things stay frustratingly grounded on Earth in this cheap ALIEN knockoff and there's no cut-rate stop motion Harryhausen references to be found. Instead, all the thrills come from the kills which vary heavily in quality.

Had this film gone a little more exploitation and featured more exploding bodies, it'd be better remembered. Instead it suffers from a dreadfully slow pace not done any favors by the mundane dialog and weak character development. Decent supporting cast including Ian McCulloch, Siegfried Rauch, and Marino Mase go largely wasted, while star Marleau doesn't look enthusiastic at all. As of now the only consolation comes with a couple of Simonetti's synthesizer tracks which effectively give the film an eerie and otherworldly tone.

I think the most amusing thing about CONTAMINATION happens to be the ending in New York, where some of the exploding toxic pods found their way into some random pile of trash on the sidewalk. One of them bursts into the final freeze-frame, but amusingly I'm sure none of the local passersby, accustomed to the filthy cesspool the city was in the 1970's and 80's, even noticed. || # Weeeee Wooooong
Inexplicably one of the better movies Rifftrax has done. Not to say that it's good, but might even be watchable without the joke commentary.  

Everyone can act, the dubbing is halfway decent, the lead actress is good looking, the premise is good enough. The aliens are unique. 

The highlight though is the music is by _The Goblin_.  I've never heard of them before, but his 1980 as hell music really works. 

So I give it a Weeee Wooong out of 5."

“Leap of Faith” (1992) tackles the topic of a fraudulent traveling evangelist/faith healer played by Steve Martin. One of the trucks of his religious circus breaks down in a small town in Kansas and Jonas Nightingale (Martin) promptly takes advantage of the situation by holding a camp meeting. Debra Winger plays his assistant while Liam Neeson is on hand as the skeptical sheriff who smells a con. Lolita Davidovich plays a waitress Jonas sets his eyes on while Lukas Haas appears as her crippled brother. Jonas’ team includes the likes of Meat Loaf and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

This is a drama and not a comedy and owes a bit to the likes of “The Music Man” (1962), “Dream No Evil,” (1970) “Elmer Gantry” (1960) and “The Faith Healer” (1921). But it goes deeper into the philosophic wellsprings of human need: the quest for meaning in life and the longing for the eternal.

Jonas justifies his show on the grounds that it makes people feel better by entertaining and inspiring them. He works the crowd with what he has learned about human nature, zeroing in on those needing him the most with the help of his 'angels,' Jane (Winger) & crew. The average person throws $10-20 into the plate and they get entertainment and inspiration in return. They go home with a stronger faith. So what’s the problem?  The Sheriff, Will (interesting name), sees the scam, but also sees, like realists do, the hypnotic draw of religion and the corresponding faith. He settles for trying to reach one of whom he senses genuineness.

The drama is a mishmash of kinetic parts, mundane parts, disturbing parts and moments of wonder. The ending is great, though, in that it both entertains & inspires; and you leave with a good feeling, ironically just like the people who visit Jonas’ tent revival, lol.

The movie runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot entirely in the panhandle of Texas (Plainview, Groom, Tulia, Claude and Happy), plus studio stuff done in Irving.

The first establishes the characters and the crime, the second the pursuit and it's consequences - and Richard Brooks adapts the story and directs these two chunks with considerable aplomb. There are also strong performances from the two men whose aspiration becomes desperation in double quick time, but who still struggle to display any semblance of human decency - except, maybe, when collecting refundable glass. There's precious little graphic violence here, but there's plenty of it implied and left to our imagination. Perhaps that's more potently delivered when it's mixed, especially by Blake, with at times a sort of gentleness and consideration - an almost childish style of behaviour. There are plenty of psychological aspects of their persona to evaluate as this progresses and that's as much of interest to ""Dewey"" as it becomes to us. The scoring also adds powerfully to the general menace, as does the frequently mobile and intense photography and at times there's almost a temptation to feel just a little sorry for these obviously flawed men as fate takes it's inevitable steps.

A wonderful spirited picture that begs and demands to be viewed in today's context. Unwavering in its flag waving patriotism, this was unashamedly a moral booster that acted as a recruiting poster for the war effort - of which George Cohan was rightly lauded.

<i>Knife in the Water</i> is entertaining enough. The cinematography on the lake and the low-key soundtrack by jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda are memorable. But personally I don't find this to be an especially great film. It feels derivative of Italian cinema of the time, without an original touch. The casting of the weathered, 32 year-old Malanowicz as a 19 year-old student undermines its credibility.

The perfect vehicle for Jack Black, a film to show that given the right material he’s a bona fide comedic actor of some worth. Plot has Black as Dewey Finn, a wastrel musician who has no job prospects and who spends his time mooching off of his best mate Ned Sheebly (Mike White). When Dewey is fired from his rock band he’s left in limbo and in danger of being homeless. But when he answers a phone call offering Ned a job assignment, Dewey decides to take it upon himself to impersonate Ned and take the employment himself; as a schoolteacher!

So it’s Jack Black in a classroom full of kids, it probably shouldn’t work, and even might seem like some sort of cruel and unusual punishment to anyone with an aversion to Black, but this is feel good nirvana and a paean to rock and roll. It’s perhaps unsurprising that it’s crammed with clichés from the classroom splinter of moviedom, the kids a roll call of characters we have seen numerous times. The spoilt swot, the roughneck, the one suffering parental peer pressure, the weight issue one and on it goes, but boy can they play music when Dewey takes them out of classical mode and into rock central.

How nice to find that director Richard Linklater and writer Mike White have managed to rise above the clichés and avoid syrupy fodder, there’s such a zest and earnestness to it all, and the kids acting is high in quality as well, led by the big kid himself, Black on full tilt. But most of all, even as the morals and life affirming threads come wading in with the pulsing rock soundtrack, it’s a very funny picture, the gag quota enormously high. Be it Black trying to bluff the kids, the kids trying to bluff everyone else - or the wonderful Joan Cusack as the scatty stickler for the rules Principal Mullins – a laugh is never far away. Rock on! 8.5/10 || Our family loved this movie. While the language is a little strong, compared to other movies that are rated the same, it is relatively mild. If your children like rock, it is a lot of fun. If you are a family who tolerates no swearing whatsoever, or if ""kick some ass"" would shock or offend you, then it's not for you. The overall message is that uptight kids use their skills to create a rock show, a slacker finds a calling and realizes what is really important in life, and forgiveness abounds.

Out of Time is directed by Carl Franklin and written by David Collard. It stars Denzel Washington, Eva Mendes, Sanaa Lathan, Dean Cain and John Billingsley. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Theo Van de Sande.

Matthias Whitlock (Washington) is chief of police in little Banyan Key, Florida. Respected for his work and basically honest in the line of duty. Away from work, however, his marriage to Alex (Mendes) has failed, he's having an affair with an abused wife and he likes a little drink on duty. So when his lover Anne Harrison (Lathan) springs on him the shocking news that she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, it naturally shakes his world. But this news is merely the start of something bigger, for pretty soon Matt will be in the unusual situation of having to stay one step of his own kind or face dire consequences.

It's a film proudly wearing a badge of homage to film noir of the 40s. In fact it very much plays out as a contemporary riff on John Farrow's excellent Ray Milland starrer of 1948, The Big Clock. But that's fine, especially when you have some knowing craft in front and behind the camera in the shape of Franklin (Devil in a Blue Dress) and Washington (take your pick here really!). Yet as great as Franklin and Washington's work is, they all owe a debt to Collard's screenplay. Inventive in how it plays out as a plot, with it's many tight situations laid down for Washington's duped law enforcer to try and get out of, the screenplay has a knack for deft humour, often sly, which is something that even some of the hardest of noirs from the golden era are tinted with. The secret is being able to blend the humour with quality moments of suspense, and this picture manages to do that with some interest.

Film also benefits greatly from the tight atmosphere created by photographer de Sande. Sweaty Florida in daylight doesn't cry out as being a good starting point for an offshoot of film noir (real Florida locations were thankfully used), but the scenic beauty is never realised during the drama sequences, colours are toned down, even for a stunning red sky, and this perfectly becomes at one with a near frantic Washington as the tricksters of Banyan Key start to close in on him. It's nice too see, also, interracial couples forming the core of the story, while the dominance of sexuality is firmly given a shrewd work over by director and writer. There's good thought gone in to making this, enough to steer it away from charges of just being a faux neo-noir production.

Problems? Yes, a few. Inevitability of outcome is hard to shake off whilst viewing it, especially for those well versed in the genre (sub-genre). Clichés and contrivances are stacked up like a pile of cop thriller 101 books, and Franklin goes smug (daft) by dropping in a couple of slow frame sequences that the film clearly didn't need. While the big showdown in the finale lacks a gut punch. But this is a good viewing, sexy at times and always eye catching, it also pleasingly chooses perky dialogue over action to make its dramatic point. The cast around Washington enhance the quality: Lathan in the tricky role shows a number of layered gears, Cain is imposing as a bully boy husband (where did this Cain go?) and Billingsley almost sneaks in and steals the movie as the loyal and stoic comedy side-kick.

So pesky flaws aside, this is a good recommendation as a night in movie for those with a kink for contemporary neo-noir. 7/10"

Released in 2003 and directed by Clint Eastwood, “Mystic River” tells the story of three men from a working class neighborhood in Boston. While playing in the street as kids, one of them is abducted and sexually abused for days. As adults they’ve drifted apart. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a reformed con who runs a successful market when his daughter is suddenly murdered (Emmy Rossum). Sean (Kevin Bacon) investigates the murder with his partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), with evidence eventually pointing toward Dave (Timothy Bottoms), the one who was abducted. Marcia Gay Harden plays Dave’s anxious spouse while Laura Linney plays Jimmy’s loyal wife.

This is similar in tone & theme to the melancholy “Sleepers” (1996), but less episodic and more dramatically gripping. The movie has the confidence to take its time and flesh-out the characters. It’s a psychological crime drama that works as both a whodunit and a tragedy. The intrinsic problems of vigilante justice are cogently illustrated.

Some people have misinterpreted the movie because they missed some things. For instance, they criticize the curious Lady Macbeth-like monologue of Annabeth (Linney) at the end. But watch the movie again, pay close attention, and the answers are there. I’d say more, but I don’t want to give anything away (you’re welcome to write me if you’d like some insights). 

“Mystic River” is not something that can be casually watched; it’s a deep drama with three-dimensional characters, potently exploring several intriguing issues: How abuses of the past affect the present; the danger of hiding recesses of your psyche; the folly of not getting spiritual help for deep-rooted psychological concerns; disloyalty/loyalty; doing the wrong thing for the right reasons; jumping to wrong conclusions based on dubious info; houses divided cannot stand; the importance of encouraging one’s spouse for the sake of familial health & survival; “king of the castle”; etc.

The film runs 2 hours, 18 minutes and was shot in Boston.

GRADE: A || Mystic River continuously outflows its poignant crime investigation through a meticulously gritty screenplay. The past haunts us. Experiences and encounters, grossly susceptible and an impressionably young age, returning viciously with psychological detriments. A naive boy that just didn’t know any better. Abducted. An unresolved mystery that manifested itself into an intricately societal Massachusetts neighbourhood, where one disturbance can erupt into a multitude of hatred from the cold concrete beneath them.

A father’s daughter mercilessly murdered in the streets that he, and his two ex-friends, played hockey in. Anguish. Guilt. Vengeance. His childhood pals, one assigned the task of searching for the killer and the other forced into battling his own justifications for not murdering her, sending their condolences to the grieving father. Yet, Mystic River refuses to tell a simple crime drama. Eastwood, with his insatiably concise attention to the screenplay, elevated the mystery by providing an illustration of emotive complexity. One that many inflict upon themselves. Torment. These three individuals, with one visibly undergoing traumatic bewilderment, exhume indications of self-torment.

Mystic River does not flow water. The elaborate dialogue is too viscous for the aqueous substance. Rather, it flows blood. Bacon’s detective role combating his duties as a justice seeker, that with the liabilities of adolescent friendship. Determining the fate of neighbours within his hands. Robbins’ psychologically damaged husband role, fabricating stories to protect his moral high ground. And Penn’s award-winning performance as the father, embroiled in a plethora of intense emotions that express the full journey of bereavement. As separate souls, these three give life to Helgeland’s script that, whilst frequently becomes overwrought with unnecessary conversations that repeat earlier information, undeniably captivates with its foundational strength in investigation building.

Eastwood takes a differing approach. Instead of the classic yet saturated “who dunnit!?” narrative structure, he settled for displaying the mechanisms of detective fieldwork. Composing a timeline but questioning witnesses and suspects. Revisiting evidence to accurately imagine the murder as it happened. See, Mystic River works not for its “twists” and “turns” so to speak, but for its richly developed characters and constant focus on the investigation itself. The sensational performances, acute direction and gritty aesthetics provide the script with leverage. It exposes the rawness of the situation beautifully. Not to mention the exquisite pacing that made two and half hours flow by quicker than a hockey stick crashing down a raging waterfall.

The conclusion should’ve been tighter, with Eastwood diminishing much of the staying power by unnecessarily extending its resolution. By simply ending on Jimmy and Sean coming to terms with what’s just happened, it enables the shock of its ending to simmer much more violently than Linney exclaiming how everyone else is weak compared to her and her husband.

So whilst not perfect, Eastwood adapts Lehane’s novel with a sense of emotional urgency. Once the grit settles in, it never lets up, taking you on a roaring ride down a river of torment. || Excellent!

I'm not fully sold on the ending, though it isn't anything less than good either way, but the rest of <em>'Mystic River'</em> is quality. The cast are superb, whether that be the main trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon or the supporting Laurence Fishburne and Marcia Gay Harden. Bacon and Fishburne make for a terrific buddy cop duo, miles better than director Clint Eastwood's attempt with Charlie Sheen in the former's 1990 release <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-rookie/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Rookie</a>'</em>.

The conclusion does I guess go in line with what precedes it, particularly with Robbins' character, but I'm not fully convinced by who is eventually unveiled as you know what. That's not to say it's a bad end, as noted at the top, as it's still entertaining no matter what."

Fox, Daryl Hannah, David Carradine","Quentin Tarantino, Quentin Tarantino","martial arts, japan, kung fu, showdown, coma, sword, asia, yakuza, bride, sword fight, revenge, vigilante, female yakuza, animated scene, wedding, samurai sword, eye patch, retribution, somber, pessimistic","This is the movie he made after Jackie Brown. I thought I might just point that out. A big budget, larger scale action blockbuster. This is the one that would change the direction of Tarantino's films. And honestly, it might be my favorite besides Pulp Fiction.

This movie oozes with style and beautifully choreographed action. This movie has an anime section akin to Japanese anime. That's some cool stuff. Even the non-action parts are some really good stuff. Like the guy from the old Street Fighter movies as Hatori Hanzo and making the Bride's sword. And the fantastic soundtrack. The great opening scene where the Bride gets shot and then the somber ""Bang Bang"" by Nancy Sinatra plays. 

But of course, the amazingly choreographed action makes this movie. A lot of it is showcased in the Crazy 88 fight and the few fights before it. It has some brilliant uses of the style. Of course, there's black and white which was actually used to avoid an NC-17, but works very effectively. And the beautifully shot battle between the Bride and O-Ren. No music really adds a lot to it. It's quiet and oh so effective compared to the loud blood fest of the Crazy 88. 

But there's also the opening hand to hand fight scene with Vernita Green which is also very well edited. Very surprising scene as it is interrupted by Green's daughter coming home and then they talk. And it starts back again as quickly as it began and then ends once again with a knife to Vernita's chest. What a brilliant tension filled scene.

The movie also never takes itself too seriously. That's for the sequel. But the fun action and style leads the whole way. Also along with Buck, and other fun scenes. Lest we forget other great scenes like the whistle scene as Elle Driver comes to kill the Bride in her sleep. Or interrogating Sophie. ""These will be things you will miss."" I love it.

Honestly, it might be the best action movie of the 2000s, at least for me. And Tarantino has a lot of my favorite movies. Maybe I enjoy his movies a bit too much. But even with that, it's one of the my favorites. Kill Bill Vol 1 gets a 10/10 || Not so hush hush but very much on the QT.

After being gunned down on her wedding day by her former colleagues, assassin Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) rouses from a four year coma with only one thing on her mind, revenge! Striking up a death list of five, she sets off for bloody retribution.

Quentin Tarrantino writes and directs what is in all truth, a homage to all the cinema conventions close to his heart. Think an amalgamation of chop-socky, sexploitation, samurai, spaghetti Westerns, anime and cop shows of years past, and you get the heart of Kill Bill. A film that was so epic in scope it had to be cut into two films. What it lacks in Tarrantino dialogue dynamite it more than makes up for with action and astute visual flair. And it's bloody, very bloody. Thurman is great as the avenging Mamba/The Bride, while the inclusion of Sonny Chiba & Lucy Liu adds a touch of class as QT revels in his East meets West berserker narrative. It could have been trimmed down, particularly in the middle section where Tarrantino deals in a calm before the storm ideal, but Volume 1 was one of the most exciting movies of 2003, and most notably it shows Tarrantino to be adept at action directing. His action skills perhaps explains why the script doesn't crackle with the wit and panache of his previous offerings? You sense he wants more than the words ""fine writer"" engraved on his granite mined Curriculum Vitae.

Hugely enjoyable with a neat end of film cliffhanger, roll on part 2... 8/10 || Uma Thurman as an anti-superheroine  

RELEASED IN 2003 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is an action/thriller/fantasy starring Uma Thurman as The Bride who seeks vengeance on the team of assassins who betrayed her, a group of which she once belonged. Her journey takes her from El Paso to Pasadena to Okinawa. Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, ravishing Julie Dreyfus and Michael Madsen appear as various assassins or accomplices.

""Kill Bill” is a creative mish-mash of 60s-70's Bond-isms, Spaghetti Westerns and martial arts flicks, but with modern production values. It sometimes plays like a superhero movie in that The Bride is essentially an anti-superheroine who mows down literally armies of skilled fighters, e.g. the overly drawn-out B&W fight with the Crazy 88s. I loved the inclusion of Ennio Morricone's ""Death Rides a Horse.""

On the downside, there’s an overlong lame anime sequence and the characters lack substance and realism, but who can deny the film’s pizzazz? Sure, it’s style over substance, but it’s entertaining in a voguish, quirky way. Since both parts were meant to be ONE MOVIE, it’s mandatory to see “Vol. 2” to properly appreciate and appraise “Kill Bill.” The second part fills in the holes.

THE MOVIE RUNS 111 minutes and was shot in Texas, California, Mexico, Tokyo, Beijing and Hong Kong.

Gene Hackman is ""Fitch"", a man who makes a very good living acting on behalf of these organisations. His job is to probe into the private lives of prospective jurors, of their loves, peccadillos, politics - looking for weaknesses or reasons not to select them. This case involves one of the most contentious in the US pantheon of criminal law - the right to bear arms, and it falls to ""Rohr"" (Dustin Hoffman) to bring an action against a weapons manufacturer that is going to be tough. As the case proceeds, we are introduced to the less honourable nature of one of the jurors, and his girlfriend who have a plan of their own - and, as you'd expect, there is money and pressure being applied to ensure that the jury reach the ""correct"" verdict. Intriguing as the plot is, though, the film itself stutters along without much innovation. The courtroom scenes are a bit dreary and once we have established the premiss, Hackman's efforts are all rather repetitive and become less and less menacing and sophisticated as the story slips into a rather mediocre melodrama of private life shenanigans. Hoffman is adequate, no more, as are Rachel Weisz and John Cusack as the eagerly duplicitous but not awfully bright ""Easter"". Based on one of John Grisham's more inventive stories - nobody ever actually wants to be on a jury - this loses much in it's translation to film and by the mid-point I was really pretty turned off by the whole thing. It's watchable, but becomes more preposterous as it proceeds to a conclusion that, though not quite what you might expect, is still a bit flat."
9373.0,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"After picking up a traumatized young hitchhiker, five friends find themselves stalked and hunted by a chainsaw-wielding killer and his family of equally psychopathic killers.",What you know about fear...doesn't even come close.,Horror,98.0,2003-05-21,en,6.291,2728.0,4.8231,"Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Andrew Bryniarski, Erica Leerhsen, Eric Balfour",Marcus Nispel,"suicide, sheriff, psychopath, trauma, telephone, gore, stalker, friends, remake, murder, hitchhiker, slaughterhouse, chainsaw, torture, cannibal, killer, family, human skin mask","Producer Michael Bay steered this remake of the infamous 1970's horror flick, without bringing in anything new. When I first saw the trailer for this version of the story, I thought it looked a lot like a hurried sequel to the contemporary silly release ""Wrong Turn."" Five youths on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert pick up a young hitchhiker who commits suicide in the back of their van. Looking for help, and a little common sense, they stumble upon a weird family and their chainsaw wielding offspring. Much violence and such ensues.

While the first TCM was not perfect, I eventually learned to love the shaky camera, lousy sound, and cheap look. One reason that film worked for me was the fact that much of the horror took place in blinding daylight, the cast was hot and uncomfortable, and it showed. In this version, even with the original's director of photography, most of the shots are too calculated. The horrors in the dark are not all that horrifying. This might be the rantings of a jaded horror film fan, but I never got the same feeling of unease as I did in the first film. Much of the original's story has been changed as film makers tried to keep the audience guessing by not doing a shot by shot remake, like Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho."" The absolute lunacy of the first film's family was strange enough, here the members are more dimwitted than scary. This lessens the impact of Leatherface's scenes. You know he is the worst it can get, you don't have an equally sick family to fall back on. One disappointing scene involves the heroine Erin (Jessica Biel) running to a trailer and meeting two women who will obviously not help her. Instead of being a tense moment, where mind games involving drinking a seemingly harmless cup of tea could be played out, the women are there for nothing more than exposition, blaming Leatherface's penchant to kill on being teased when he was younger for a degenerative skin disease. The five victims all meld together, Nispel's direction is okay, but the cinematography is too nice for this type of horror film. The black and white scratchy scenes recall TV's ""Millennium"" or ""The Blair Witch Project."" If I would compare ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to anything, it would be the terrible sequels that came out after the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to that point. Just one was watchable, ""Leatherface,"" but with the exception of Part 2, they were all simply remakes of the original film. Most direct to video sequels do that now, and while this film tries to be something different, it is simply a remake that cannot match the original. As Leatherface and the clan enter a new millennium, their wrinkles were showing."

Anyone with even the vaguest of interests in these two giants of English-language literature cannot help but be disappointed by this shallow depiction of what made this vibrant and destructive dynamic work - or not! At times, it is almost as if the two stars were offering some sort of apologia for daring to make their money in the Marvel or Bond universe by committing to this poorly written, if very good looking, film to beef out their claim to be legitimate thespians.

<em>'Brother Bear'</em> leaves heartfelt feelings and features a cute story. It does get a bit too melancholic in moments where it doesn't need to be or where it's not set up perfectly. It can also feel a little predictable, but the twist is decent enough. Animation-wise it's fine, while that early aspect ratio stuff is oddly done.

The voice cast aren't amazing, despite the talents of Joaquin Phoenix (Kenai) and Michael Clarke Duncan (Tug). Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas are pretty amusing as Rutt and Tuke though. As a whole, I just don't feel the voices suit the characters greatly.

The pacing is pretty good while Phil Collins does a satisfactory job with the music, not sure how I feel about the ending though. Overall, it's very much mid-range Disney. || ""Kenai"" is a young Inuit warrior who disturbs the spirits when he kills a bear. His punishment is to be turned into one himself, and be left to wander the wilderness alone. Luckily, he encounters the young cub ""Koda"" who thinks he might know the exact spot where ""Kenai"" might be restored to his humanity. What doesn't help their quest is that his human brother ""Denahi"" thinks that ""Kenai"" has been killed by a bear, and so is chasing his new form with lethal intent. As the two bears start to bond, they have some fun escapades, meet the ""Stadler & Waldorf"" of the moose fraternity and ""Kenai"" learns the values of friendship, loyalty and community - as well as how to catch some leaping salmon! The quality of the animation, the Phil Collins-led soundtrack (with a decent number from Tina Turner too) and the spirituality of the whole thing is breezy and enjoyable to watch. The young ""Koda"" reminded me frequently of a sort of ""Mowgli"" character. Friendly and playful but still staying on the right side of annoying. I also rather liked the denouement - that, too, had a sort of joy to it that exemplified the symbiotic nature of the relationship that ought to exist between mankind and the rest of nature. Characterful animations and cave paintings too! Worth a watch, definitely."

“Interstate 60:Episodes from the Road” involves a confused college man, Neal Oliver (James Marsden), who wants to be an artist while his father pressures him to go to law school. He desperately wants answers and O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman) magically grants him his wish. Neal ends up on the non-existent I-60 traveling to the non-existent city of Danver where he hopes to meet his dream girl (Amy Smart). Along the way he meets many interesting people and learns several valuable lessons. Christopher Lloyd is also on hand along with glorified cameos by various notable actors (e.g. Michael J. Fox, Kurt Russell and Ann-Margret).

The plot starts out a little tortuous, but it morphs into a road movie before too long, broken up into several quirky segments, which is why the flick is subtitled “Episodes from the Road.” Critics deride the picture on the grounds that the messages are clunky, moralistically naive, and preachy. But it’s unique and intelligent with quality reflections about life, which are made simple so “stupid people” or teens can grasp them. In short, this is a fairly entertaining oddball road fantasy that’s distinctive and insightful.

If you like films like ""Michael"" (1996), ""City of Angels"" (1998), ""Holy Man"" (1998), ""Bruce Almighty"" (2003) and “Evan Almighty” (2007), “Highway 60” (2002) is cut from the same thematic cloth, except that the supernatural being is a magical Irishman.

The movie runs 1 hour, 56 minutes and was shot in Ontario (Sunderland, Cannington and Toronto) and Arizona (Phoenix).

When he encounters aspiring Ziegfeld gal “Julie” (Evelyn Keyes), she brings an whole new dimension to their lives as she hopes to enjoy success in a slightly different fashion that will mean retirement to a new house in the country. The question for Jolson, though, is whether he can be satisfied with this more sedentary existence or whether the smell of the greasepaint and the roar of the crowd will prove too much for him to resist. It’s all perfectly watchable fayre in the vein of so many of these 1940s biopics that selectively and creatively re-write history but with a solid musical score underpinning a story of it’s time, it is still watchable enough as an illustration of just what did entertain folks desperate for diversion after years of WWII austerity. It’s also quite interesting that much is made of the “Blackface” characterisation here and yet so many of his own contemporary African Americans acknowledge that this very activity, considered racist nowadays, actually served to help acclimatise a considerable number of the not so tolerant American citizenry to the idea that black people were every bit as equal and talented as their fairer skinned compatriots. Moreover, many are ready to certify that Jolson didn’t have a racist bone in his body. Could this be an early conduit for more enlightened thinking?"

As Melville's fake quote from the Buddha that serves as the intertitle goes, ""When men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever the diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle."" These men are Corey (Alain Delon), who has just been released from prison, Vogel (Gian Maria Volonté), who has escaped from his police guard before he could even reach prison, and the alcoholic marksman Jansen (Yves Montand). In the jewelry heist that these desparate lowlifes plan together, they are pursued by the detective Mattei (André Bourvil).

Meville's pacing is extremely slow – it has to be in order to ensure that the audience understands the complex relationships of who knows who – and suffice it to say, people who don't already like mid-century French auteur films may find this intolerable. However, if you are a fan of the French New Wave, you may find Meville's ability to sustain suspense a delicious torture. This viewer was on the edge of his seat the whole time waiting to find out what would happen next. Melville's visual aesthetic is also consistently attractive: muted colours, careful shots of the characters faces at a couple of key moments, and a striking constrast between the quiet world of these criminals and the bustle of everyday Paris.

I must admit that I was prepared for some disappointment, as this was Meville's third film of criminal conspiracy in three years (preceded by the hitman drama <i>Le Samouraï</i> and the French Resistance saga <i>L'Armée des ombres</i>). However, in spite of Meville's continued interest in the genre, <i>Le Cercle rouge</i> offers something fresh and individual. There are a couple of intertextual looks back to <i>Le Samouraï</i> in the sets, but Meville shows how talented his favourite actors were by having a couple of good guys in that film play baddies in this one and vice versa.

All in all, this is not a must-see, life-changing film, but certainly a classic film that has stood the test of time and well worth seeing. || Though it takes quite a while to get going, and I constantly wanted to rub that annoying moustache from the face of Alain Delon (""Corey"") I really rather enjoyed this crime caper. Delon recruits the dapper ex-cop with a drink problem - ""Jansen"" (Yves Montand), and the recently escaped ""Vogel"" (Gian Maria Volontè) into his plan to rob an exclusive Parisian jewellers. Situated on the top floor of a town house with state of the art security, they must recce the scene and use all of their initiative and ingenuity to crack the systems and pinch - and dispose of - $20 million worth of loot. Simultaneously, a couple of hoodlums are chasing ""Corey"" after he relieved his former boss of some cash, and the police - led by accomplished copper ""Mattei"" (André Bourvil) are on the hunt for ""Vogel"". I can't say the acting set the thing on fire for me, it is certainly ""cool"" but you can over-do that, and at times these three men are pretty devoid of much depth to their characters. I could also have been doing with more going on in the first hour; the plot establishment all takes too long - but once Jean-Pierre Melville gets his ducks in a row and the film has a clearer focus, then the pace picks up nicely and there is quite a decent degree of tension peppered with the odd bit of dark humour.

Truthfully, though, the real Year Of The Matrix was 1999, when the groundbreaking original proved to be the right film in the right place at the right time. Tapping into the cultural zeitgeist and Y2K fears about the power of machines over mankind, The Matrix not only revitalized slo-mo action sequences with its 'bullet-time' style, it had a political relevance that already seems dated in a 21st century world dominated by a war against terror, not technology.


The Matrix Reloaded, for all its faults, did try to up the ante, both in its creation of a wider Matrix myth and its budget-heavy effects. Revolutions, however, is content to follow in its wake, the final couple of hours of a four-and-a-half hour slab to which the original movie, in the makers' minds, is but a pre-title sequence. Granted, there's less philosophical babble and more emphasis on action in Revolutions, but the Wachowskis, having backed themselves into pseud's corner, can only deliver with a formula where spectacle and pretentiousness follow on from each other in steady succession. Gut thrills and intellectual stimulation are never integrated as one.


Revolutions' sustained action set-piece - the Sentinels' attack on Zion - is undeniably exciting, but it sure doesn't feel like an episode from a close sequel to the original Matrix. For a start, Zion was off-screen for the entire first movie. Secondly - and dramatically more importantly - this centerpiece relegates the main characters to, at best, mere bystanders. Neo and Trinity are off on a mission of their own. Morpheus - now dressed in what looks like a burgundy Benetton jumper rather an outfit consistent with his standing as the coolest dude on (or under) the planet - takes a literal backseat to Niobe's driving. Instead, the key players are the Kid, whose backstory is apparent only to those dedicated enough to watch The Animatrix cartoons, and Mifune, whose on-screen impact is unfortunately as brief as it is memorable.


That such a primary scene is completely filled with secondary characters isn't just disappointing - it's damaging, because it draws attention away from the protagonists' climactic acts. Basically, this is the bit you remember, more than Neo's vital conversation with the Wizard Of Oz-like face of the machines or his up-in-the-air fisticuffs with Smith (a fight whose sfx impact has dwindled following Reloaded's Burly Brawl).


Some viewers will indeed be completely satisfied, their questions answered, as the final credits roll, but they're the ones who have done their homework. Without filling in plot gaps by watching The Animatrix or playing derided computer game Enter The Matrix, a sense of confusion reigns. And those who are confused can't emotionally engage with the characters, thus rendering any amount of sacrifices and love themes null and void. In the original film, the casual viewer could relate to a slave race of pod people and their need to be freed, but the Wachowskis seem to have moved the goalposts as the story has progressed, sidelining what began as a focal point of the plot.


In other words, few box-office-storming blockbusters have been aimed so consciously at such a narrow and precise cult audience. The Year Of The Matrix will be remembered as an indulgence for fans, while the original movie will be affectionately held as a separate entity by a bigger crowd.


Verdict - What once represented the future of science fiction cinema has become little more than a solid genre offering. But, hey, it wasn't supposed to be the Second Coming, was it? Oh, hang on...

3/5

- Empire Magazine || The Matrix I loved.

The Matrix Reloaded I liked AND used it to teach... seriously.

The Matrix Revolutions just stank.

Seriously, it was really bad.

Reloaded was kind of heavy handed on the philosophy... but it still had enough stylized action to compensate for characters who were so transparent representations of religious philosophies they were as vapid as steam.

Revolutions kind of abandons the conflict of philosophies, doubles down on one and then.... it commits the BIGGEST crime of all.

It switches gears into CGI battles and all but abandons the stylized Wire-Fu and gun violence that made the first two movies so much fun.

HELLO! We weren't watching them because of the plot, we were watching them because they were trippy cool kung-fu shoot em up sci-fi films... and you went and abandoned the action that we loved in place of CGI battles that are even boring almost 20 years later.

It basically left everything that made us go ""WOW!"" when we saw the first one behind and took a totally new form for the climax and... you lost me there."

And for me, that is a fairly short list, such as A Christmas Story and the ubiquitous It’s a Wonderful Life. (Interestingly, Peter Billingsley, who plays the lead Ralphie role in A Christmas Story, has an adult role in Elf.)

The script goes over the top a bit sometimes, resulting in cringeworthy moments for me, but it is harmless and easily forgiven. There is wit, pathos and sight gags galore. I like the chemistry between Will Farrell and Zooey, and it is a treat to have national treasures Ed Asner and Bob Newhart leading off the film as Santa and the Papa elf. James Caan and Mary Steenburgen are credible as Elf’s prospective new family in New York City.

So there is not a lot of depth to this movie, nor is there supposed to be. It is a great film to watch with friends or extended family. It shouldn’t offend anyone and you can visit with each other, because you don’t have to pay close attention to the plot. In fact, many viewers will be able to recite he lines along with the characters. || Good watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend.

For all the good this movie has in it, there is a fair amount of annoying as well, which is what keeps it from being a great movie.

A family reconnection trope, with a character out of his element trope, crossed with one of the most annoyingly positive characters of all time trope.

Ultimately, it's a sweet, hear warming story that really captures the spirit of family, Christmas, and togetherness.

It also captures all of the insanity Will Ferrell can conjure up for his character, basically as if he wrote a SNL Christmas special and just rode rough shod over the other actors.

The cast does a wonderful job of backing up Will Ferrell, but that's clearly what it is.

Around the holidays, especially, don't be afraid of giving this a try, and bear through the annoying bits, because there is likely something really funny just about to happen. || _**Destined to be played on TV every Christmas the rest of your life**_

Released in 2003 and directed by Jon Favreau, ""Elf"" is a Christmas dramedy/fantasy starring Will Farrell as an orphaned infant who stows away on Santa Claus' sleigh and isn't discovered until he's at the North Pole, where he's adopted by Papa Elf and named Buddy. After growing up as an elf, he travels to New York City to meet his father (James Caan) and starts a relationship with his neglected younger half-brother. He also starts a relationship with a department store worker (Zooey Deschanel) and helps spread Christmas cheer as Santa (Ed Asner) arrives to the city.

This is an all-around entertaining Christmas flick highlighted by Farrell's goofiness as the quasi-elf. It's fun with consistent laughs, not to mention a nice Christmas moral.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in New York City and Vancouver.

London, England, and it's the run up to Christmas, and we are in the company of a number of couples dealing with the joys and problems that love can bring.

We open with a narration from Hugh Grant who tells us that when he is troubled by the hate in the world, he thinks of the arrivals area of Heathrow airport. A place where loved ones greet returning loved ones, a place that indeed showcases a strand of love in its joyous form. He further ventures that when the aeroplanes hit the twin towers on 9/11, as far as he knows, all those phone calls from those sadly involved were messages of love, not hate. Pertinent musings that although somewhat sombre for an opening, sets it up nicely for what Richard Curtis (writer and director) wants to say.

A roll call of fine British and Irish actors, and American Laura Linney, lend their considerable talents to Curtis' ensemble piece. The structure is surprisingly simple considering the number of stories being woven together, the result being that there is sure to be a story in there to either love, or, yes, even hate. Is it sentimental? Of course. Is it as stuffed as a turkey on Xmas day? Naturally. Does it stretch credibility in some strands? For sure. But only the coldest of hearts could truly decry that Love Actually is all around. Very often it's funny too. Curtis, following on from writing credits such as Four Weddings And A Funeral, continues to show himself to be a very fine writer of comedy. None more so than with Bill Nighy's past his sell by date pop star, Billy Mack. There's something for everyone in here, indeed there's likely to be something that many can associate with.

It's a lovely affecting film that should hopefully perk up those that get blue around the holiday season. With perceptive writing, some excellent acting (Nighy, Emma Thomson, Colin Firth et al) and a soundtrack of some worth, Love Actually is a winner. 8/10 || Love Actually coulda been somebody; it coulda been a contender. There were scenes and characters I loved, but the movie was all but ruined by the irritatingly bad bits.  They could have dropped two entire  subplots and raised the quality considerably: I am thinking pf the needlessly crass over the hill singer with the Christmas song competition, and the male fantasy thread about the idiot going to Wisconsin and encountering three shapely nymphomaniacs. The time saved cutting those scenes could have been allocated to Laura Linney’s special needs brother and her infatuation, a plot that just petered out near the end, and to the Emma Thompson character’s marriage, which showed promise but similarly fizzled out with a half-hearted scene at the end. Or they could have given more screen time to Natalie, the prime minister’s love interest, who stole a few scenes and deserved many more.

So it was fun in places and touching at other times, and I can just about see myself watching this star-studded near-miss again, as long as I can keep a finger on the fast forward button. || **Bringing together several plots, the film is not about love, but about Love in its most diverse facets… and not always happy.**

Unlike most romantic movies, which stick to a sugary story and follow it to the end, with the invariable marriage at the end, and everything in rosy, this movie seems to care more about love itself. , as a feeling. In fact, there are nine sub-plots involved and each one explores a different facet of love: we have teenage love, we have illicit loves, we have unlikely romances, we have love triangles, we even have a love that blossoms without one or the other. speak the same language… and all during the pre-Christmas times! So I won't waste time sifting through each plot, maybe it's for the best.

The movie could have gone terribly wrong, but the truth is that it works reasonably well. It's not a film where we can like all the characters, obviously many of them are making mistakes in the name of love, but the truth is that the film brings, with all this, a much more human and realistic tone than others of its genre. : who has never made a mistake because they fell in love, or found themselves in love with the wrong person and with full awareness of it? Even so, and despite the merits, there are indeed some subplots that seem underwritten and poorly developed, and others that I just don't understand why they were added. And I'm not in favor of some of the jokes that were being made, there's some humor that doesn't work, even though the dialogue is good and well written.

I lost count of the number of great actors that went into this film. It seems that all the good British actors of the decade decided to book a coffee and show up. Some are more prominent, others not so much. Hugh Grant is one of the highlights of the film and he is really good in the role he has been given, and he plays very well with Martine McCutcheon, who also does well in her role. I also enjoyed the performances by Liam Neeson and his teenage stepson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster (who would later break out as an actor in Maze Runner). It is still beautiful to see the way their characters relate to each other and the intimacy that is created between them. Bill Nighy is funny and irreverent, but I didn't understand his subplot here, and Laura Linney is good at what she does, but I wasn't captivated by the character. The same can be said of Keira Knightley (I never particularly liked this actress). Emma Thompson is better, and she does a good job here. Finally, a small word of praise to Colin Firth, and also to my compatriot Lúcia Moniz. It feels good to see someone from our country shining abroad, and to hear our mother tongue in a foreign film.

The film is not brilliant on a technical level. Betting everything, or almost, on the script, on the performance of the actors and on the very competent direction by Richard Curtis, the film is not particularly remarkable in these points, assuming a standard aesthetic and having almost nothing at the visual level that surpasses the average. There are, however, some good aspects, related to the scenarios and the choice of filming locations, very well selected and used."

And when it comes to the Tunes, we know what's going to happen: there's going to be a lot of crazy animation, explosions and funny effects.

This film will please Tunes fans, putting the most adorable and iconic characters on the big screen, and giving the spotlight, of course, to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the duo that is inseparable, even if they are always at odds. It all begins with the dismissal of Daffy and a human employee of the Warner studio, and will end in a kind of fight against evil, in support of the father of that employee who, in fact, is a secret agent in the image of James Bond. A seemingly crazy mix, but one that works thanks to the skill and irreverence of the Tunes.

I won't waste time talking about voice actors. The studio intelligently took advantage of those who usually voice these characters, so we are dealing with professionals who know very well what they do and what the characters ask of them. We have, however, an excellent comic performance by Brendan Fraser, who seems completely comfortable with what was asked of him and even seems to have fun with it all. Jenna Elfman isn't bad either, but she can't keep up with Fraser.

The movie is very good. It's pure entertainment, with classic touches that we're used to seeing in Tunes material.

Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is directed by Peter Weir, it stars Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin. It is spliced from various novels in the Aubrey–Maturin series written by Patrick O'Brian. The film takes place during 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars and finds Captain Jack Aubrey and the crew of British frigate HMS Surprise ordered to intercept, destroy or take as a prize the French privateer Acheron. But the Acheron (The Phantom as the crew of the Surprise call her) is no ordinary ship, and her Captain is smart. So Lucky Jack has his work cut out; not only in the pursuit of the Acheron, but in harmonising the crew under his command. Especially his loyal and trusting friend Stephen.

It's pretty evident within the first few minutes of Master & Commander that this is no standard blockbusting naval based war movie. If you are after, or was expecting, a wave to wave Bruckheimer carnage a-like piece, well you best, or should have, stay(ed) away. For this is a Peter Weir movie, in fact this is a Peter Weir ""period"" movie, where attention to details and character dynamics are the order of the day. There's battle action here for sure, beginning and end, and terrific they are too, as first cannonballs crack and splinter their targets (note the sound work here), and later as blade meets blade - it's exhilarating stuff alright. However, this is more interested in palpable tension, both on deck and on the waves. Threat is never far away, again, this is is covered by the impending duel with the Acheron and Aubrey's tactical pursuit/escape of her. As the Aubrey machinations unfurl, the crew give us a series of character dramas to involve us in the make up of a man-o-war's personnel. How different classes and males (there's not one female in the film) of all ages have to work together as one efficient unit in order to survive and triumph. Except for an interlude spent on the lusciously filmed Galapagos Island (Russell Boyd Best Cinematography Academy Award Winner), the film is set 99% of the time out at sea, on a cramped ship, this tells you that Weir is interested in telling a character driven story, one that is cloaked in realism above all else.

The teaming of Weir with the highly rated O'Brian material looked a good one, and to someone like me who has never read an O'Brian novel, it is. Unsurprisingly many of O'Brian's fans have been upset by either the stuff missing in the film, the stuff put in to fully form Weir's vision of the characters, or for Crowe not being Pugwashy enough. These complaints were inevitable since they come with practically every adaptation of novels these days. It should be noted, though, that Weir was very much a fan of O'Brian, and in fact always felt inspired by the tight intricate detail of his writings. What of the author himself? Well he passed away three years before the film was released, but he had always envisaged Charlton Heston for the role of Aubrey. So, who in the modern era comes closest to Heston's physical presence on screen, why Russell Crowe of course. Who not only brings that to the character, but also depth, because Aubrey comes with many traits. Strength, honour, stubbornness, leadership and loyalty are a given for a Captain on the high seas. Yet Aubrey is also vulnerable, self aware, playful, knows his limitations and is able to laugh at himself. Crowe peels off each layer and delivers a high quality performance - from our first encounter with Crowe as Aubrey, the realism so loved by Weir is given a shot in the arm - and it stays throughout the movie.

So an excellent piece of casting then, as is that of Paul Bettany as ships surgeon, science and nature lover, and best pal of the Captain, Stephen Maturin. Bettany and Crowe had formed a friendship on 2001's A Beautiful Mind, where their on screen chemistry lifted an already fine film, to an even better one. So it be here also. Stephen & Jack's relationship is the core of the piece, two very different men yet as tight as two peas in a pod, with Stephen serving as the code breaker for the audience as sea talk and tactical intrigue weaves in and out of the story. It's there where Bettany excels, for he not only has us believing in this warm (platonic) friendship, he's also got us rooting for him since he is in essence the odd man out on this ship. Our sympathy is firmly with him, our friendly rebel if you please. Of the rest there's note worthy turns from Billy Boyd, James D'Arcy & Edward Woodall, while Lee Ingleby gives a really heartfelt and emotionally engaging turn as the haunted Hollom.

The film is not without flaws, though. The pace of the piece does slip from time to time, while the talky middle section may stretch the patience of some, and the film isn't long enough to give the main characters some back story for the audience to work off. Yet it's still a terrific movie, ripe with intelligence and interesting characterisations, and boasting enough adrenalin, humour and upset to fill out a big budgeted 1950s historical epic. So get on board folks, for this is quality film making and it demands to be seen via the best format available. 9/10 || This is a rousing sea yarn with great camera work, but it also shows comraderie and relationships in a realistic way on board a British fighting ship.

As happens sometimes but not always, I enjoyed this movie more than I liked the book it was based upon. O'Brian has written a lot of great sea tales, but this one confused me. I felt like checking to see if the pages were in the correct order. The story seems simplified in this adaptation. (Some may say that is not a good thing!)

The first several minutes of the film move the viewer around the ship, and I felt like It was a realistic representation of what it was like to sail on it. The creaking and other ever-present noises, the tight spaces allotted to the crew, all helped me feel like I knew what it was like more than just reading about it.

There are a lot of characters aboard ship, so out of necessity some of them never really developed, but even the glimpses we get of them here and there illustrate that they are people, not stereotypes. There were a few rather unlikely plot turns later on in the film, but by then I was drawn into the story and right there with the crew, so I forgave them.  I have watched Master and Commander twice so far, and wouldn't be averse to seeing it again. || I enjoyed <em>'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'</em>.

The early scenes are surprisingly (given the relatively close release dates) similar to fellow 2003 release <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</em>, with a hidden enemy ship spotted amid foggy conditions and then one person spots unexpected cannon fire and tells others to duck... there are even main characters named Jack (lead!) and Will!

With those amusing (to me, given that POTC is my favourite film) connections noted, the film goes on, of course, to do it's own thing and I'd say it comes out very nicely. The constant (supremely shot) action is a major plus, as are the performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. I coulda done with more characterization for those behind Crowe and Bettany as I didn't overly care for them, though the support cast are all solid to be fair."

And that will take a man away.

The Missing is directed by Ron Howard and adapted by Ken Kaufman from the novel The Last Ride written by Thomas Eidson. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Cate Blanchet, Eric Schweig, Evan Rachel Wood, Jenna Boyd, Ray McKinnon, Val Kilmer & Aaron Eckhart. James Horner scores the music and Salvatore Totino is the cinematographer.

New Mexico 1885 and frontier doctor Maggie Gilkeson (Blanchet) has to seek help from her estranged father Samuel Jones/Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan (Lee Jones), when her eldest daughter is kidnapped by Pesh-Chidin/El Brujo (Schweig) an Apache Warlock who sells girls into prostitution.

An obvious variation on John Ford's The Searchers, The Missing slipped under the radar some what of Western fans who were greatly served by Kevin Costner's Open Range released the same year. It was a box office flop; which in a genre that has rarely hit great heights in modern times is hardly surprising, but to dismiss Howard's film as a fop is just wrong. True enough it's hardly original on the page, but it manages to not sacrifice character depth as it crams in the Western staples. While there is plenty enough here for none Western fans to enjoy; from the many colourful characters on show (including a great horror movie like villain in Schweig), to the panoramic scenery, and the number of action sequences that flit in and out of the narrative. There's a little something for most movie loving fans.

The cast, too, are value for money. Blanchet gives it guts and layers as Maggie, emotionally cold, is forced to put family dissension to one side and take up arms as a Western heroine, and Wood equally holds court with her transference from irksome waif to bold babe. Tommy Jones enjoys himself as he finds a cowboy role to suit his craggy features, features that impressively dovetail with Salvatore's stark photography of the landscapes. Along with the plucky and endearing young Jenna Boyd's performance it obviously only really mounts up to a broken family coming together under duress. But as a quartet, and with Schweig's vile turn as the ""monster"" of the piece in amongst them, they function so well, thus all character arcs are acted skilfully and please the senses. Also to be applauded is the use of genuine Apache language from some of the actors, a nice touch that shows a director taking his material seriously.

There's a few endings available to view via DVD etc, but the one that Howard chose for its general release is the right one. It perhaps doesn't hold any great surprise, given the directors reputation and output thus far, but it works well in the context of the story and the period tone set throughout. A safe film, then, one that is very well made and tells its story efficiently in structure and verse. If only the script had dared to take a few more risks then this surely wouldn't have been the monetary flop it was. Still, give it a go and you may find as much to like as I did. 7/10"

While ""The Cat in the Hat"" is a famous children's book, this is clearly just aimed at the folks that might have read it when they were children.  That mixes the nostalgia factor with the slew of adult oriented jokes (like infomercials) and the unnecessary addition of mother being single and dating.  Kids aren't going to find humor in those situations.

The material that is closer to the original book is much more charming and I imagine that kids will relate to it more as the kids are much more involved, or even the focus of the scenes.

The Cat in the Hat, even though he is the title character, is a support character to the two kids, played by Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, who both do all they can with the writing to balance out Mike Myers as the Cat.  I don't feel like Mike Myers understands the idea of being a supporting character: he gives me a very Tom Cruise / Jimmy Fallon vibe where if there was a pause, then would just center himself in the camera and do something to draw attention.  ""Oh yeah!"" is a good example for this movie, a repeated, unnecessary line that doesn't once help the scene let alone the movie.

One would think after Jim Carey's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""  (2000) there would be a formula for how to adapt Dr. Seuss books (20 pages) to full length feature films, and someone clearly figured it out later in ""The Lorax"" (2012) and ""The Grinch"" (2018), so I'm....gonna blame Mike Myers.

Him aside, the movie has a lot of charm to it, and Alec Baldwin manages to work an unnecessary part to at least be a believable antagonist, though the best acting in the world can't make a bad part good.

If you're just really into Dr. Seuss, then give it a watch, but you're not going to miss anything special if you skip it. || lifechanging, thank you so much the guy from shrek and the white mask man who kills. You did a good job creating a masterpeice Xx. || Bad!"

Whilst hardly being a very good horror film, it's not exactly the stinker some would have you believe.

The problems with it are that it becomes overblown, after initially pulsing away as a very moody and atmospherically tight spooker, set to a superbly eerie asylum backdrop, it gets away from itself in the final third. The makers never quite grasp the concept of keeping the mystery aspects of the plot still cloaked in scary tints. Tech credits are dandy, though an impressive cast list are not asked to stretch themselves. 

It's not ever overtly frightening and lacks suspense in some key areas, but there's still enough of a creepy vibe here to not waste the time of first time viewers. Repeat viewing prospects, though? Unlikely. 6/10 || Not great, yet enjoyable.

Halle Berry is the star of <em>'Gothika'</em>, but is also joined competently by Robert Downey Jr. and Penélope Cruz; though we don't see much of the latter, unfortunately. The execution of the premise comes out alright, though could've been better of course.

There's also a tonne of screaming, most of it unnecessary. As for scares, I can't say it produces in that regard to be honest. It's mainly just the cast that stick out, but I still like the vibe of the film even if it never had me feeling tense or anything close.

Thankfully they kept it relatively short at just 98 minutes, even just 10-15 additional minutes would've crippled my feelings towards it. As such, it's passable. || Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Halle Berry carries this great Pyschological Thriller of a doctor turned mental patient.  This definitely has the production value to support its needs.

They do a great job of calling into question whether or not she's crazy at any given time while still presenting the ""other worldly"" aspects consistently.

I even think it holds up (currently) 18 years later as there are technological restrictions in place.

The sheer amount of production value in the movie to make the mansion look as good as it does, plus all the ghost effects, is daunting.  The story is good, and the way they go about investigating the mystery is good in the traditional sense: a good cycle of drip fed information, search and discovery.

Otherwise, it's a pretty lacklustre vehicle for a very mediocre star who has long since lost his lustre, supported by some folks who largely bring very little extra to a party that suffers from quite a paucity of, well, haunting... To add a bit of weight to the storyline, the writers have included a sort of familial neglect angle to the characterisation with ""Evers"" too focused on a successful career and not so attentive on his wife and two rather annoying children. It does all come to an head eventually, with a bit of help from the ethereal ""Madame Leota"" (Jennifer Tilly) and whilst it's entirely forgettable on just about every front, the visuals are quite fun and ""Ramsley"" is possibly the best butler since Tim Curry.

Dead Of Night is brought to us courtesy of Ealing Studios, somewhat a veer from the normal output associated with that bastion of British cinema, it is none the less one of the finest films to have come from the place that gave us The Ladykillers, Kind Hearts And Coronets and The Man in The White Suit. I often wonder if Dead Of Night sometimes wrongly gets marked down by the modern audience on account of its familiarity with creepy anthology shows such as One Step Beyond and The Twilight Zone? Or because of the numerous other movies with the same horror format that followed this, the best of them?

There are five segments in Dead Of Night that are jointly directed by Alberto Cavalcanti (Went the Day Well?), Basil Dearden (Victim), Robert Hamer (Kind Hearts and Coronets) and Charles Crichton (The Lavender Hill Mob). In the cast we have Mervyn Johns, Googie Withers, Sally Ann Howes, Roland Culver, Frederick Valk and a stunning Michael Redgrave. The stories consist of ""The Hearse Driver,"" ""The Christmas Story,"" ""The Haunted Mirror,"" ""The Golfing Story"" and the chilling crowning glory that is ""The Ventriloquist Dummy"" (the latter being responsible for my fear of talking dummies even to this day).

In spite of my obvious love for this film (it ""is"" the greatest anthology spooker ever) I'm aware that it suffers from a variance of pace (the bane of anthology films), whilst the light relief in the form of ""The Golfing Story"" , whilst being a jolly bit of cinema, is in truth a segment that doesn't sit quite right. More so when you consider it precedes the film's acknowledged Dummy led high point. Yet dust off the terribly British cobwebs and you find a hugely influential picture in the pantheon of horror anthologies. A film backed up by two genuinely creepy episodes (RE: The Haunted Mirror as well as that damn Dummy one). Thankfully, as Ealing films have found a new audience on DVD, Dead Of Night has been subjected to worthy and complimentary re-appraisal. Especially in America, where confusion reigned back in the day as two segments were cut from the released picture (segment 4 Golf and segment 2 Christmas), I mean imagine trying to make sense of character continuity there!

So turn off the lights, listen to the sharp dialogue, and always keep one eye on what's stirring in the shadows, especially at the Dead Of Night... 9/10 || Ever since I was a small child I have loathed ventriloquist's dummies. They put the fear of death into me - and I am fairly certain that seeing this film in the 1970s is to blame. It's a compendium of four stories told by guests at a farmhouse, and is all kicked off by Mervyn Johns (""Craig"") who has a recurring - and rather menacing - dream that predicts doom and gloom. Before he can finish his story, though, we hear from three of the others. One involves a married couple where the husband becomes drawn into the life on the other side of his mirror: a mirror that comes from a room with a grisly past. The second is a more light-hearted haunting mystery with Basil Bradford and Naunton Wayne before the third, featuring an effective Michael Redgrave, is the one with the ghastly puppet - and then it is all rounded off by Mervyn. Thing is - is any of it real? Is is prophetic? Well you have to get to the end, and even then... It is well written and editing together. The episodic nature of the stand-alone stories works well keeping them short and snappy and the swathe of character actors who pepper the whole hundred minutes are all well cast and deliver solidly as we build to quite a gripping - if short - denouement. Watch in the dark with a glass or two and the rain beating against the window and this is really quite effective!"

Sam Raimi’s trial run for the Spider-Man franchise is a whole bunch of fun. Liam Neeson plays Dr. Peyton Westlake, a super scientist who after a major run-in with the villainous Robert G. Durant (Larry Drake), reinvents himself as Darkman, a super-anti-hero who sets about ridding L.A. of its mobsters.

It’s a comic book film that isn’t based on a comic book, Raimi inventing his own tortured protagonist whilst homaging similar beings of eras past. All the silliness of such fare is here of course, overblown violence and colourful characters are frequent, but there’s good thought gone into the revenge theme, while the action sequences are often excellent. The pace hardly sags, as Raimi’s creations move about a Los Angeles that is equally decaying or affluent, and in Neeson the story has a lead actor with swagger, pathos and emotional force in abundance. 7/10 || Full Review:

I recently rewatched Darkman and there is just so much to like about this movie. In comparison to today's superhero overdose, Darkman just sticks to the basics and tells an incredible emotional and captivating story which is real. No over the top CGI, no storylines forced in by studio producers, not really any characters used just as a device, no cut scenes of blatant Easter Eggs and no political agenda in sight. Comedy is used appropriately and not to undercut the tone of particular scenes and characters.

I really miss these kind of movies in today's superhero landscape. I do like the MCU and how they bought these comic book characters to screen, but after watching Darkman (after about 15 years or so) the MCU are doing so much wrong. I loved you could just watch this movie and not have to worry about what is means to the overarching story or where this story and character fit into the larger universe. It also did such a great job of focusing purely on one character and the journey through the pain he has to go through.

I love this movie, it's one of those movies which will always stick in my memory. It's a real testament to great film making and knowing what works. || This is interesting... this is one of those B-Movie gems that is packed full of pro-talent before they really became pro-talent. And that is right down to the Cohens who did uncredited script polishing.

This is worth the watch, even if you are one of those people that hates B-movies... wrongly hates.

And, it's a comic book movie, it is over the top, it is campy, it packs serious action into a short little plot that still manages to be compelling. The MCU could take lessons on story crafting from this."

A psychiatrist becomes romantically involved with the sister of one of his patients... 

There comes a time in every film fan's life - those who commit to writing reviews, starting blogs etc - where you happen upon a film that you find oneself very much going against the general consensus grain, Final Analysis is one such film for myself. Not that it's a great under appreciated gem or anything like that, but revisiting some 25 plus years later I have found it to be far better than I found it back in the day.

Alfred Hitchcock is my absolute number one favourite director of all time, but I'm never closed off as many often are to any sort of homage or thematically charged movie in lieu of the great man. In fact I'm encouraged that he still influences modern day directors this way. It also helps me that for fifteen years I have buried myself in all things film noir, which has given me opportunities to pick out fine noirish traits in otherwise reviled films of the neo-noir type. Case for the defence closed then!.

Final Analysis is very Hitchcockian but lite, so much so it plays as ""Vertigo's"" illegitimate offspring. In fact it's even De Palma lite, who was one of the best exponents of Hitch type suspensers. It's a little clumsy at times and trips itself up, with director Joanou failing to build on the promise of his neo-noir of 1990 - the blistering ""State of Grace"". While stretching it out to a two hour run time by throwing twist after twist at it - when the writing isn't good enough to veer away from Hitchcock conventions, is a bad move.

However, the core basis of a film noir world painted here is quite vivid, with two femme fatales, Freudian splinters and many trawls down a murky dark lane of mystery. The look is terrific (various Calif locations), this does after all feature the work of the cinematographer who photographed ""Blade Runner"". There a numerous gorgeous shots, light filtered through slats, up tilts into spiral golds, sublime primaries, while the court room sequences are magnificently akin to something that ""Roger Deakins"" would achieve further down the line.

Cast performance wise it's not something to shout from the rooftops about, but nothing that hurts the pic. I'm a big fan of Gere, but here he's on auto-pilot, which is where Joanou should have earnt his corn. Basinger sexes it up and does good enough crafty, but it's a turn that doesn't come alive till late in the day, likewise Thurman in the sister role. David isn't in it enough and just seems to serve as a point of reference at various junctures, but faring much better are Roberts (super smarm charm with deadly heartbeats), and Guilfoyle as the lawyer balancing court determination with private yearnings.

I couldn't recommend with utter confidence, but I would suggest that neo-noir/Hitchcock fans may find a revisit more beneficial when picking through the bones of it. 7/10"

The Freshman is a sort of comedy drama sprinkled with self aware barbs at film analysis. It’s a great opportunity to see Marlon Brando relaxed and fully playing up the self-parody angle. Plot finds Matthew Broderick as Clark Kellog, a film student arriving in New York who through unfortunate circumstances ends up working for a man who is not too dissimilar from Don Corleone!

Writer and director Andrew Bergman spoofs the Mafia via screwball scenarios and satirical scripting, though the latter is done to death and grows tiresome at the mid-point. Penelope Anne Miller and B.D. Wong get choice support roles and deliver the goods, in fact the casting across the board is spot on, and the tech credits are firmly in the plus column.

It was with much interest to me to revisit this early 80s hacker piece armed with the knowledge of just how the advent of change in the computer world had evolved. With that in mind the film could quite easily be classed as a bit clunky due to the now almost Neanderthal toys, games and computers used in the movie, but casting aside the nostalgia feelings I had with it, it still hits the spot as both a poignant piece of interest, and a damn good thriller as well.

Matthew Broderick is David Lightman, a young computer gamer geek who is something of a whizz kid on the PC. He can change his school grades and hack into various sites he shouldn't be even looking at. During one eventful sitting he hacks into a computer called Joshua and plays a game called Global Thermonuclear War, he harmlessly chooses to be The Soviet Union and proceeds to launch a nuclear attack on his own country, the U.S.A. Trouble is, is that the game is for real and the wheels are in motion for World War III!.

It helps to remember the time this film was made (for those old enough of course), for it was the time of the ever worrying cloud of the Cold War, a time when nuclear war was more than a hearsay threat. I really think that in this day and age where computers literally do run our lives, this film stands up really well not only as a warning piece about messing with technology, but also as a gentle poke in the ribs about defence systems and the people we trust to run them. Though the film is a kind of watered down and accessible 2001: A Space Odyssey for the 80s set, it impacts well and only really suffers from a pointless romantic plot strand involving the sprightly Ally Sheedy (could they not just have been pals?) and the aforementioned dated gadgets. The ending to the film is excellent as the tension builds up nicely and we are left chewing our nails watching a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, sounds simple doesn't it? Not so.

Good honest and intelligent entertainment. 7.5/10 || Ally Sheedy, whatever happened to her. When I was a little kid, I mean REALLY little she was one of the few stars I could name...and then she disappeared save for a couple memorable appearances in Psych. It's a shame.

Anyway, my fiance is a Millennial and I've been trying to introduce her and her friends to some classic films. This one was a fail. They sat through it, but really only to mock the technology. Mocking things that are old for being old is kind of one of their favorite things.

So, despite that, the film made ripples in congress and the only other film that I recall doing that was JFK. It rewrote laws.

And, it was extremely entertaining in the process, despite the fact that Matthew looked like more of a push-over than a computer geek. Not that it matters, he still played the part of a teen pretty well. || When the young computer whizz-kid “David” (Matthew Broderick) is showing off to his girlfriend “Jennifer” (Ally Sheedy) about how he can improve her grades and book them on a first class trip to Paris, he inadvertently dials a telephone number that wants to play a game. A game of thermonuclear war! Next day, the news is full of stories about the mobilisation of American defence capabilities and his phone rings again. It’s the computer, it wants to play and he’s just a little terrified. Not so afraid as he is about to get, though, when the FBI turn up and next thing he is in a top secret facility trying to explain to boffin “McKittrick” just how he accidentally tapped into a computer system that now seems to be trying to start WWIII - and nobody knows how to stop it. Can he come up with a solution before the increasingly exasperated “Gen. Beringer” (Barry Corbin) goes to DEFCON 1 and obliterates the globe? It’s a good, solid, sci-fi entertainment this film with Broderick, Sheedy and Corbin on good form, but it also serves as quite a potent reminder that, just as with “The Forbin Project” (1970), the whole idea of automating our defences and letting computers do our thinking for us is fraught with danger. Logic is the ultimate in two-dimensional thinking for a machine. For anything more nuanced, balanced or sophisticated then believe it or not, you need a hormonal teenage boy and some very basic rational thinking."

Jane Eyre is directed by Robert Stevenson who co-adapts the screenplay with John Houseman, Aldous Huxley and Henry Koster. Based on the Charlotte Brontë novel of the same name, it stars Orson Welles, Joan Fontaine and Peggy Ann Garner. Music is scored by Bernard Herrmann and George Barnes is the cinematographer.

After a harsh and eye opening childhood, orphan Jane Eyre gains employment at Thornfield Hall as governess to the young ward of Edward Rochester. A Difference in class and life outlook, Jane and Rochester are by definition polar opposites, but a bond exists, a bond that surely can't conquer the mysteries of Rochester the man, and the secret of his estate - can it?

Stevenson's version of the often filmed Jane Eyre has been pored over numerous times before, the constant question that arises is that of just how much input and work did Orson Welles have in the production? Knowing what we now know of Welles' 40s output, Jane Eyre undeniably has the Wellesian stamp all over it, with Fontaine herself quoted as saying the big man was often found behind the camera. This is not to decry Stevenson in any way, he himself would carve out a good career in directing further down the line, but this take on Brontë's famous novel shines because of Welles' presence in front and behind the camera.

With that comes one of only two quibbles with the film as a whole, namely it's Welles' portrayal of Rochester that dominates the film, and not that of Fontaine's Eyre. Which is quite staggering considering he doesn't enter the fray until 34 minutes into ty epic. The other problem, naturally, is that with a running time of just over an hour and thirty five minutes, it was never going to be a detailed adaptation of the novel. However, what exists is still an excellent mounted production, a film pulsing with aggressive atmospherics and simmering emotional passions.

It has been argued that the opposing acting styles of Fontaine and Welles are a distraction, I don't see it that way at all, as one of classic cinemas greatest voices emotionally spars with one of its most beautiful faces, this is monochrome gold dust. In mind of the difference of characters as written on the page, it actually comes off as inspired casting. With the production that surrounds them perfectly in keeping with the characters' state of mind.

The look is assuredly what would become known as film noir, with George Barnes' (Rebecca/Spellbound/Force of Evil) vivid black and white photography dovetailing splendidly with the matte paintings and Gothic set designs. It still amazes me to this day that this film was entirely produced on stage 2 at 20th Century Fox. So many images burn into the memory. From the shards of shadows that accompany young Jane as she stands on the punishment stool at Lowood Institution, put there by the despotic Henry Brocklehurst (a menacing Henry Daniell), to each chiaroscuro lit composition of Rochester in and around the oppressive like family home, the film has visual moodiness in abundance. 

Herrmann's (The Devil and Daniel Webster/Citizen Kane) score is crucially in tune as well. Orchestral swirls to portray Jane's longing are counter pointed by the menacing down beats that attack the viewer for Rochester's bluster. Away from the two leads it's young Peggy Ann Garner who delivers the most telling performance. She gives the child version of Jane a sorrowful edge that sets the tone of the film, her early scenes with an uncredited Elizabeth Taylor (beautiful and effectively correct in vocals) are a lesson in child acting. The rest of the cast is filled out with admirable performances from Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me in St. Louis), John Sutton (Captain from Castille), Sara Allgood (The Lodger) and Agnes Moorehead (The Magnificent Ambersons). 

This may not be a definitive Jane Eyre adaptation, and the compromised ending does knock it down a point, but all told it's still a top piece of classic cinema. 9/10 || Undoubtedly my favourite Brontë story, and amongst the best adaptations of period drama you could ever wish to see. Joan Fontaine is superb in the title role, a girl forced into a brutal orphanage following the death of her father. After many years of abuse at the hands of the monstrous ""Brocklehurst"" (Henry Daniell) she finds a post as a governess to the daughter of the reclusive Edward Rochester (Orson Welles) at his remote, gothic Thornfield Hall. After an initially rocky start with her employer, things begin to thaw between them but is any of it as it seems...? Robert Stevenson has created a wonderfully evocative glimpse at Victorian Britain, and with Charlotte Brontë's superb eye not just for the detail of the story, but for a subtle and nuanced social commentary of a time when - even amongst the most civilised in society - human beings had little, or no value. The film takes it's time to develop the characters, the locations - the use of light, shadow and another striking score from Bernard Hermann all augment the two leading performances offering us a gripping adaptation of a strong, characterful book. I always find that colour is an inherent enemy of stories like this - monochrome is always king, and never more so than here..."

The combination of innovative, intimate and intense photography coupled with the beautifully expressive facial expressions from Miss Falconetti; the subtle but potent brutality of her persecutors - personified well by Eugene Silvain's Bishop Cauchon but also well exemplified by the cold and soul-less panel of judges all make this an effective and chilling film. The score - semi angelic, frequently intimidating but always powerful helps create an atmosphere that genuinely makes you feel fear and trepidation for this young woman, a pawn in things she little understands, but sticking faithfully to her beliefs of divine intervention and pureness of spirit. That emotional link is contagious, and even as a man of little faith myself, I found myself feeling an overwhelming pity for this person caught up in a trap of very much earthly ambition and deceit. It's a tough watch at times, especially as the chronicles remove even the slightest of chances for this woman. It is also pretty short - and that helps keep that momentum moving really well; there is no time for extended and sprawling cinematography to lessen the impact - it's a film about humanity, trauma and fear; and takes some beating... || There are a few different versions of this movie with different audio tracks. Dreyer himself criticized a bastardized version in the 1950s that changed the vignettes and audio to better fit for audiences of the time.

I saw this movie long ago from a poor reproduction with what I assume was the original score and it was pretty good. Years later showed it to someone else and we saw the remastered Voices of Light version. It had been elevated to a true masterpiece.

The higher video quality really lets us see Dreyer's decision to not use the extremely common heavy makeup found in the silent film era. The missing puzzle piece was found in the form of perfectly fitting vocals. Dreyer will simply have to excuse us for modifying his film."

The backgrounds, the grand sets, the sheer amounts of extras, and the animation of the stars and the coloring of the biblical scenes.  Just...wow.

WI first heard about this version after seeing a video on TCM about silent films.  Gonna watch the '59 version tomorrow.

An absolute must watch if you like Bible fanfiction.

Better than paying Google for it. || With the Roman legions securely ensconced in his Judaean homeland, Prince ""Judah Ben-Hur"" (Ramon Navarro) hopes that the arrival of his childhood friend ""Messala"" (Francis X. Bushman) might make things a bit easier for his conquered people. Fat chance! His erstwhile friend is far more concerned with impressing his boss and keeping the locals under control. An incident during the arrival procession of the new Governor gives the new regime exactly the opportunity it wants to stamp it's authority and that sees ""Ben-Hur"" sent to the galleys and his mother and sister to prison. Luck hasn't quite abandoned our hero, though, as the fleet on which he serves goes into battle and he ends up rescuing the Consul ""Arrius"" (Frank Currier) who proceeds to adopt him as his son and give him the opportunity to race his teams of horses in the great circus of Rome. He's determined to get back home to find his family, though, and soon returns to find them dead and his former friend a champion of the races. With the backing of ""Sheik Ilderim"" (Mitchell Lewis) he takes to the track to avenge himself on his rival. This is all set at the time of the rise of Christianity and culminates with the crucifixion of Christ - a man in whom ""Ben-Hur"" had enormous faith. Perhaps even a faith strong enough to restore his loved ones to him? It takes a little while to get going, this, but once the action elements of it take shape, it's an astonishing piece of cinema. The maritime scenes - not just the battles, but the triremes and the sheer scale of the cinematography are truly impressive. I suspect there quite literally was a cast of thousands involved at the chariot race which is photographed excitingly with some creative direction (and editing) making for compelling stuff. Navarro is a natural in this part with his characterisation animated and personable. The supporting characters deliver well too, with Betty Bronson's ""Mary"" and May McAvoy's enamoured slave girl ""Esther"" giving us a little more than fluttering eyelashes and vacant smiles. Parts of it are in twin-strip colour and when in Rome, well they have the effect of making it look like Oz as compared to Kansas. The sacred imperial city in it's gold and purple contrasting with the dark grimness of his monochrome native land oppressed by a great fortress. It does take a few liberties with Lew Wallace's book, but I think Fred Niblo decided to leave the more biblically focussed epics to Cecil B. and what we have here makes 2¼ just fly by. This is great film-making with actually very little need for a musical accompaniment or even inter-titles."

The KGB are involved as are the Americans - and soon it all points to the enigmatic furrier ""Osborne"" (Lee Marvin) who has a nifty line in sable hats. What now ensues is a rather dry and procedural mix of thriller and romance with the very presence of Marvin as much of a dead giveaway as you are ever going to get. Marvin brings a certain screen presence, but that just serves to illustrate just how much Hurt is going through the motions - he usually underwhelmed I found. Here the supporting cast led by Brian Dennehy and the occasional contribution from Ian Bannen as the slightly duplicitous prosecutor ""Iamskoy"" don't really add up to very much either. It all just lacks any sense of intrigue and the plot takes far too long to build up steam. It's very wordy, too - far too much dialogue that actually drags the story down to a almost glacially slow pace. A tighter edit and less verbiage might have made it more attractive, but as it is - well, it's all just bit dull. Chilly, but dull. || **_Of Sables and Men… in snowy Moscow and Stockholm_**

A militsiya inspector (William Hurt) examines the murder of three people in their 20s in the woods near the skating rink of Gorky Park, all with their faces and finger tips removed. Linked to the investigation are: a KGB major (Rikki Fulton), a movie set worker (Joanna Pacuła), the Chief Prosecutor (Ian Bannen), a smug American sable importer (Lee Marvin) and a New York detective (Brian Dennehy), amongst others.

Based on Martin Cruz Smith’s novel from two years earlier, “Gorky Park” (1983) is a police procedural with the distinction of taking place behind the Iron Curtain during the cold winter of northeastern Europe. It features an honest detective under pressure in a system that seems to operate only through corruption while underlining the conflict between Russia’s socialism and homegrown capitalism.

I guess this explains why the Soviet Communist Party denounced the movie as anti-Communist and anti-Russian, denying the crew access to shoot in Moscow. So, it was filmed in Helsinki, with the Kaisaniemi Park substituting for the titular one, as well as Stockholm.

The score by James Horner is great and one of the highlights, mixing the 80s with a Russian feel for a hauntingly bleak mood. Some people don’t think it fits, though.

Marvin, Hurt and Dennehy are superb in their roles, especially Marvin as the cocky American importer. He was 59 during shooting and would appear in only three more movies before his death in 1987 at the too-young age of 63.

It’s comparable in some ways to the dialogue-driven “The Russia House” with Sean Connery, which debuted seven years later, but this is all-around more interesting and artistic IMHO. It subtly distinguishes between the noble souls and corrupt ones; and then impressively refuses to deviate from that first impression with a moronic ‘twist,’ such as in the eye-rolling “Along Came a Spider.”

There’s a lot of talk about escaping the shackles of Communistic rule and fleeing to the perceived paradise of America, which is ironic for several reasons, including the fact that the Iron Curtain would be down in a relatively short time. Regardless, the symbolism of the climax is potent.

It runs 2 hours, 8 minutes.

The photography has a tendency to draw out the shots a little too much, but again - they help create a genuine sense of scariness. Nothing gory, or bloody - just eerie, and enormously effective.

Lars von Trier once said he knew at the latest fifteen minutes into a movie whether it was worth continuing, and I took that advice to heart, so here we are.

Okay. Seriously. SERIOUSLY? Yes, 102 years ago, ""cinema"" was in its early years. Silent movies, someone on a piano going plonkty plonk while people were drinking moonshine, smoking plutonium and coughing up pneumonia. Great. How fantastically interesting in a historical perspective. (Seriously, though, it is.)

But hello, and welcome to reality in the now. This is absolute garbage. The only way this is useful in any way is as a source for memes. I'd like to see this with a death metal soundtrack. Or in MST3K form. Anything. Or simply as something displayed on the wall at a rave, for kitsch.

Written/directed by Michael Crichton and released in 1978/79, “The Great Train Robbery” was loosely based on the real-life Great Gold Robbery of 1855 that took place in England. Sean Connery plays the mastermind, Lesley-Anne Down his girlfriend and Donald Sutherland a safecracker with whom they team-up.

I generally don’t like caper films because the protagonists are criminals, but Crichton wisely makes the characters played by Connery and Sutherland likable rapscallions; meanwhile Down is babelicious, in particular in her jaw-dropping first scene. Crichton intentionally made the movie more farcical compared to his novel and I appreciated the wit and low-key humor. I didn’t expect to like this movie, but it won me over.    

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot primarily in Ireland (Dublin, Bray, Cork & Moate), but also Pinewood Studios, England.

GRADE: B-/B || Seen this once before many years ago but decided to check out the new Blu-ray from Kino Lorber. A solid heist-thriller though what struck me was these thieves were stealing gold meant for British soldiers, so not exactly stealing from some corporation, and our lead played by Sean Connery had no issue murdering a guy. Even so, still found it entertaining and some suspense-filled scenes, among them a great sequence with Connery on top of a moving train. **3.75/5** || I think it's Jerry Goldsmith's opening theme that gives a clue that we're in for some fun antics on the railways! That's confirmed when Michael Elphick chucks some would-be robber from the speeding carriage down an embankment where he lands at the feet of ""Pierce"" (Sean Connery). This bowler hatted gent wouldn't have been out of place in the Reform Club at the start of ""Around the World in Eighty Days"", so is a natural at another gentleman's club where the manager of a bank is bragging about their impregnable transfer of gold to pay the soldiers of the Crimea. Hardly patriotic, but ""Pierce"" has his eyes on this bullion and so with the help of girlfriend ""Miriam"" (Lesley-Anne Down) and cracksman ""Agar"" (Donald Sutherland) sets about doing the impossible - robbing a ton's worth of gold from a moving train. Each key to the safe is kept separately, so they have to use their guile and wits to find them, copy them, and return them without anyone suspecting! It's this series of escapades that is quite fun to watch whilst shining a light on the double-standards of the Victorian elite. Can they all get away with it? Well this is one of those charismatic ensemble efforts that makes you hope that they do. There's mischief a plenty, some precision thievery and quite impressive acrobatics from the nimble Wayne Sleep along the way too. Hats off to Sutherland though.

It’s lucky for the family that she is there for her other sisters “Holly” (Dianne Wiest) and “Lee” (Barbara Hershey) don’t have their own problems to seek. The whole thing now plays out like a top-notch radio play with emotionally internecine personas played out to the full as the neuroses thrive, the stereotypes wrestle each other for prominence and poor old Michael Caine finds his “Elliot” - married to “Hannah” - character constantly scratching his head when he isn’t ducking it. Sister “Holly” is a bit of a loose cannon. An under-employed actress who thinks she would be better off catering instead. Just to make matters worse, she hooks up with “Mickey” (Woody Allen). Now here’s a fruit loop if ever you’ve seen one. He used to be married to “Hannah” but now lives day to day convinced that each one is going to be his last! Moreover, his (Jewish) faith has long since gone the way of the dodo, so what will happen to him afterwards? Meantime, “Lee” is sitting waiting to be discovered. A blank canvas of a woman who has no idea what she wants; whom she wants nor where she’s going and on whom “Elliot” is developing one hell of a crush. With all the ingredients of some intellectual slap-stick and a really quite striking cast, this manages to stay the right side of cringeworthy as it develops into an engagingly characterful and frequently quite witty maelstrom that borders, at times, on farce but that never quite takes that route. Caine is a good comedy actor and his laconic style works well as his relationships are put under a spotlight that extends to us questioning which, if any, of these folks could ever be lived with! Sure, there are certain identifiable threads that run through all of Allen’s works, and they are here too - but having assembled a cast that is able to deliver effortlessly and naturally like this allows this film to come across more distinctly than some of his other works. It’s also holding it’s value well. The story and it’s characters have lost little of their punch over the last forty years and this is proof positive that letting a story breathe can work wonders with a good cast. Now I have to go and watch “Jaws: The Revenge” which kept Caine away from the Oscars."

An action movie star researching a role is allowed to tag along with a hardboiled New York City policeman, who is less than enamoured with his company as he looks to stop the serial killer known as ""The Party Crasher"".

Given John Badham's CV, The Hard Way looked to be right up his street, his career containing solid if unspectacular buddy buddy action comedy pictures. This is just above average thanks to the Woods and Fox pairing and some nifty dialogue one liners. The concept of a Hollywood star tagging along with a grizzled real copper is smart, but the pic ends up over stuffed, even if the action and comedy - courtesy of some high energy set-pieces - rewards enough to stop tedium setting in.

Lang's maniacal villain is over the top, though he seems to be enjoying himself, while such is the brisk pace for the most part, when it sags into its quieter periods it strains the patience - the blend uneasy. Yet the finale rewards on basic action terms, with suspense intact, to ultimately give us a just above average pic of its type. 6/10"

Dear reader, I start with a challenge: think about sequels to great movies. There's no shortage of great and valorous titles, which otherwise contradict the general idea that sequels are flawed films and doomed to failure, right? But there is also the other side of the coin, and a long list of names that gave strength to this installed belief. This movie is, indeed, an excellent candidate for a spot on the disgraceful list of the worst sequels ever released!

Well, “Highlander” was a film that, despite the criticisms and weaknesses (I didn't spare myself to list them in the review I wrote for it), worked well and gave the audience pure fun and entertainment. This film, however, completely ignores it, contradicts the entire story of the first film and gives us... an hour and a half of rubbish that involves things as absurd as a threat of extinction due to the disappearance of the ozone layer and the return of characters who actually died in the first film, because they came from another dimension conveniently created for that purpose! Fans of the first film rightfully booed it, condemning it to oblivion.

I believe that everyone involved, from the director to the actors, prefers to ignore this humiliation that they subject themselves for a good pack of dollars. Sean Connery, for example, seems to be parodying himself, and Christopher Lambert seems contrived and unbelievable in his old age outfit. Although the list of actors includes other relatively respectable names, there isn't a single actor here that could be worth the painful effort of seeing the film... and believe me, I saw it in its entirety and felt I would have made better use of my time watching the Teletubbies."

The extent to which much of the detail in this interpretation of their lives is true is anyone's guess, but this depiction is a compelling one with two strong leading performances and a well paced feel to it. It also tracks the political scenario quite well too. We get a sense that, initially at any rate, Hoffa did want to improve the lot of his 1.8 million members before a degree of invincible megalomania set in.

Danny Aiello plays Hawk’s partner and Andie MacDowell his maybe babe. James Coburn is on hand as a top CIA agent. 

The film advertises right out of the gate that it’s a goofy comedy, a parody of caper/spy flicks. The creators & cast bend over backwards to amuse the audience, but there are too few lulls to catch your breath. It’s an almost constant barrage of over-the-top camp and comedy. I laughed several times, but too often I didn’t. Still, it’s a likable albeit curious throwaway comedy and should especially be worthwhile for fans of the cast. It cost an incredible $65 million (no doubt due to the costly globetrotting) and understandably flopped at the box office.

If you're all alone, at midnight and in the dark then stick it on but don't fall asleep... || When San Francisco is invaded by pod-people  

RELEASED IN 1978 and directed by Philip Kaufman, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" stars Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams as friends, Matthew and Elizabeth, who work at the Health Department in San Francisco. They increasingly suspect that people are somehow being duplicated and trace the problem to alien plant pods. Leonard Nimoy plays Matthew’s pop psychologist friend while Jeff Goldblum & Veronica Cartwright are on hand as a couple who run a mudbath parlour.

This could be viewed as a sequel rather than a remake. The entries in the series are as follows: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956); ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978); ""Body Snatchers"" (1993); and ""The Invasion"" (2007).

The first one is in Black & White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. This 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city. The 1993 movie shifts to an army base in the deep south while the 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC.

This rendition has a peculiar tone with a lot of the events taking place at night. There’s a subdued eerie and dreary air with paranoia morphing into conspiratorial and then ghastly reality. The 70’s atmosphere and cast are highlights, as is the score with its unnerving pieces. Brooke Adam’s has exquisitely sculptured facial features (eyes, nose, lips, teeth, chin, cheeks and forehead). The creepy pod-birthing sequence in the garden is cogently done.

To do so, Kimble needs to find Crisp's son and ex-wife. All he knows for certain is the name of the small Oregon town where the live and that the boy is kindergarten age. Kimble goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to try to find the boy. Even though he's a tough cop on a mission, Kimble realizes, to his amazement, that he enjoys teaching the kids. He also finds a love interest in one of the other teachers, Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller) - a single mother whose son is in Kimble's class. And, as luck would have it, Kimble discovers that Joyce is Crisp's ex-wife. How convenient! Kimble will have to act fact, though, because Crisp is on his way to collect his son.

For the most part, Kindergarten Cop is an enjoyable movie. Schwarzenegger seems naturally unnatural around the kids, but that works in the film's favor. Kimble should be awkward around his class. There are a number of humorous interactions between the un-humorous Kimble and the kids - my favorite being his reaction to the kid obsessed with death. Good stuff. As awkward as Schwarzenegger is around the children, it's the exact opposite when it comes to his co-star, Miller. There's a nice chemistry between the two that really shows on-screen. I would have loved to see the pair make more movies together. Another plus for kindergarten cop is Pamela Reed playing Kimble's partner. Reed is always good and gives a solid performance here. Throw in some nice action toward the film's conclusion and Kindergarten Cop ends up being a nice experience. 

I do, however, have two complaints. First, the film is too long. I really think that if just 10 to 15 minutes were cut from the runtime, it would be a better, tighter movie. Cut the scenes with Cathy Moriarty, for example. They add zilch to the final product. Second, baddie Crisp and his mother aren't threatening enough. They're jokes. Had the pair been played with a more menacing tone, the final showdown would have been even better. Still, it's a solid film as is. || Between Kindergarten Cop and Predator, you will learn about half of Arnold's famous one liners. That doesn't mean Kindergarten Cop is laughable trash. In fact, it's a wonderfully heartwarming story about broken families and how we learn to communicate with children. Also, it's just hilarious watching Arnold interact with kids.

This is one of those personal favourites of mine that I watch at least once every couple years or so. I love it from it's hilariously campy opener right up to its surprisingly violent ending. It's perfect for the guys to laugh and quote Arnold, and perfect for the girls to gush over how adorable the kids are. || It's his toughest assignment so far! 

Kindergarten Cop is directed by Ivan Reitman and it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as John Kimble, a tough police detective who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to catch drug dealing baddie Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) before Crisp can get to his ex-wife and son. However, having no teaching experience previouslly, Kimble finds the children a right handful. Not only that but he finds himself attracted to another teacher, Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller) to further complicate things.

Sandwiched in between ""Total Recall"" and ""Terminator 2:Judgement Day"", is this light action comedy on Arnold Schwarzenegger's Curriculum Vitae. With a salary of $12 million in his pocket the big Austrian revels in playing comedy. Much as he did with ""Twins"" from 1988, Schwarzenegger is comfortable in making himself the butt of the jokes. With a crazy premise such as this one it was imperative that he got the feel of the comedy right, something that he achieves in spades.

Schwarzenegger's play off with all the children is good fun cinema, even tender at times. For in amongst the froth the writers still slot in serious issues, issues that Schwarzenegger, in spite of his obvious lack of acting gravitas, grasps with two gigantic hands. There's no surprises in store within the plot, and I'm pretty sure for a film of this type nobody is seriously expecting any. Yet the good honest fun makes this one for all the family to enjoy. 

With good support from Miller & Reed, and of course the army of sprightly children, Schwarzenegger once again doesn't take himself seriously. Hollywood, like it or not, is all the better for it. 6.5/10"

If 80's and 90's action is your cup of tea, this is definitely something you need to see! || You know, for a dancer, he is one hell of a detective. 

Written by Shane Black and directed by Tony Scott, it's not the biggest surprise in the world to find that ""The Last Boy Scout"" is full of high octane action and serious one liners. Plot has Bruce Willis as a private detective whose protected female witness (Halle Berry) is murdered, prompting him and the victim's boyfriend - a disgraced gridiron star (Damon Wayans) -  to investigate the crime together and all roads lead to the higher echelons of American Football. 

There's shades of ""Die Hard"" here, but really it's unfair to simply put it in the cash in on an action classic genre. Anyone who knows Shane Black's career will know that plot is secondary to action and dialogue, more so when Tony Scott is on directing duties. This may actually be Black's most under appreciated literary work (though it was a box office hit), his buddy buddy formula, that was so brilliantly realised with ""Lethal Weapon"", really shines here - making it Wayans' best work and Willis' most laconic.

It's all a bit blokey, meaning that unless the girls watching are in it for the stars alone, they are sure to be disappointed by the machismo washing over the female characters of the piece. But this is electrifying stuff, both visually and orally. It's fun and thrilling, so strap yourself in and enjoy the ride. 8/10"

For a film that's essentially about passion, this is an entirely sterile affair with little actual chemistry between the couple as Bertolucci exposes us to endless pointless female nudity, some clumsily choreographed sex and a surfeit of dialogue that doesn't generate steam so much as spray amidst a series of gratuitous nookie that did neither Brando nor the marginally more natural Schneider any favours. If it's supposed to be a penetrative look at the human psyche, or at our animal instincts, or maybe even at our dependencies, then I'm afraid it was all just too plodding, repetitive and undercooked.

The alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing, stretching back to the likes of It's A Wonderful Life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It's a sub-genre of fantasy that has over the years produced very mixed results. Back in 1990 was this James Belushi led production, rarely mentioned when the said topic arises, it appears that it has largely been forgotten. Which is a shame, for it oozes charm and is high scoring in the humour department. We know that we are being led to the ultimate message come the end, but it's still a fun and enjoyable path to be led down. The film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor James Belushi was. I mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation isn't your thing? then chances are you would avoid this film anyway. But for those engaged by the likes of Red Heat, K-9 and Taking Care of Business, well Mr. Destiny is right up your street.

She is also a bit of a gold-digger and quite aware that if she plays her cards right, he can offer her a new, more prosperous, life than that she shares with her mother (Fréderique Meininger) and two brothers. The older brother (Arnaud Giovaninetti) is a bit puritanical when it comes to his sister, her younger (Melvil Poupaud) is more shy and usually content to keep his head down and play his piano. Despite the initially venal nature of her relationship, there gradually develops a bond that is both loving and turbulent as the political situation overtakes their love, with the French leaving Vietnam to local government. This is a well scored and stunning looking film but the story is remarkably thin and repetitive and once we've seen them have sex a few times, I began to wonder if Jean-Jacques Annaud was just a bit bereft of ideas as to how to develop either character beyond the physical or material. It's a slow burn and I'm afraid that I just didn't really engage with either as the story trundled along, narrated occasionally and rather melodramatically by Jeanne Moreau, to a conclusion that was quite a long time coming and not really worth the wait. It's watchable, and illustrates well the gap between rich and poor here in the 1920s, but is very much an example of style over substance."

The film failed upon its release but is now considered a classic.  Robert Mitchum has never been better as the malevolent ""preacher"" who marries the hapless Shelley Winters.  Mitchum had been in prison with Winters husband and knows there is money to be had from a robbery the deceased  husband committed, but where is it?  Though Shelley falls under Mitchum""s twisted religious zeal, her children a little boy and girl instinctively know this man is bad, bad, bad.  Spoiler alert: Shelley Comes to a watery end and the children must flee from Mitchum who has discovered the money is hidden in little Pearl's doll.  After an arduous journey mainly by boat (the Ohio river?) John and Pearl come to rest in the saintly arms of the magnificent Lillian Gish.  But Mitchum is relentless in his pursuit and that is when the eternal battle between good and evil is fought one more time.  I will not reveal which side prevails but let's just say for an old broad Lillian is a formidable opponent.  A film I saw as a young boy it left an impression on me that was powerful.  A  deeply disturbing yet uplifting movie ""Night of the Hunter"" is not to be missed.  This is Gummshoe signing off with two fists up for ""Night of the Hunter."" || Laughton crafts a nightmarish fairytale that stands up now as a true masterpiece.

A religious maniac marries an idiotic widow and mother of two children in the hope of finding out where the $10,000 is hidden that the now executed husband and father garnered from a robbery. 

Upon release back in 1955, the critics of the time kicked this first directorial effort from Charles Laughton to such a degree he never directed again. Watching the film now and observing the tide of praise for it as each year goes by, one can only hope that those critics were rounded up and sent to a faraway island to learn about how to view with open heart. 

The Night Of The Hunter is to me quite simply one of the greatest films ever laid down on the screen. Firstly you have to ask yourself exactly what genre the film belongs to? That alone should lead you to find out that the film is something different, even unique, because it covers so many bases. Perhaps that is what the critics back then couldn't quite fathom? Is it Crime? Is it a Thriller? Horror, Drama, Noir, even a terrifying mother goose fairytale (that last one was Laughton's terming of his masterpiece), truth is, is that it's a multitude of earthly traits masquerading as a good versus evil parable. 

The work on the film is as good as it gets, the direction from Laughton is sublime, his visual style alone makes the film a feast for the sharp eye connoisseur. Observe some of the cutaway sets, take in the expressionist use of shadows, an underwater sequence that is gorgeous yet terrifying at the same time. I dare you to stop the hairs on your neck standing up on end as the silhouette of Mitchum's evil preacher Harry Powell looms large over the children at bedtime. The film is full of striking images that in themselves are telling the story, witness the pursuit of the children by Powell, the children's river journey is all dreamy and calm, rabbits, frogs and spiders all are prominent to give the feeling that the kids are safe, cut to Powell all in black, cloaked in evil, always one step away from his prey, perhaps a devil in priests attire? 

The acting is top draw, Mitchum (in a career making role) plays it perfect, evil personified mixed with gentle panto fusion at just the right times. Lilian Gish, in what surely has to be one of the great feminine roles of all time, is precious, quite simply precious, while the children are a believable delight because Laughton has got us viewing this uncertain world through such untainted eyes. Crowning it off is the cinematography from Stanley Cortez, I can only describe it as bleakly beautiful, it impacts on the eyes as much as the head as this truly majestic piece of work unfolds. 

If you don't see this as a masterpiece then I urge you to watch it every year until you do. Because when it hits you, that bit that you just didn't get, it's the point when you realise why you love cinema after all. 10/10 in every respect. || Continuing with my quest to establish where or not Charles Laughton ever made a bad movie, I recently came, again, to this - one of my all time favourite films. I remember cowering behind the sofa as a child when this film came on television late in the evening. It all centres around a robber who has hidden $10,000 somewhere. His jailbird pal ""Powell"" (Robert Mitchum) is out, masquerading as a puritanical preacher, and determined to befriend the man's family and to scoop the loot. Shelley Winters is the naive, now widow, ""Willa"" who falls hook, line and sinker for the wiles and charms of this shrewd and duplicitous man - and that does not go at all well for her! Soon the children ""John"" (Billy Chapin) and his sister ""Pearl"" (Sally Jane Bruce) are in mortal peril. Can they escape his clutches? Where is the cash? Is there any cash? For me, this is easily the best effort on screen from Mitchum, he just oozes a malevolence that is palpable. The two kids, too, are on great form - managing to deliver performances that stay on the right side of petrified hysteria as we all begin to appreciate the accumulating sense of menace. A big screen on a rainy night with a drop of red wine and this is as good as cinema gets. The pacing of the story is accomplished, the audio editing is effective, the use of a gently potent script and a cast that enthral make it all captivating. It wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.

Yawn!

Wesley Snipes performance is as good as one can expect of Wesley Snipes which of course does not help elevate the movie above mediocrity. The one character which stands above the rest is the master terrorist played by Bruce Payne. I quite liked his cool, insane style of portraying his character.

There are a few semi-decent action scenes splattered around the movie which helps keeping the interest just above the I’ll-read-a-book-instead level. Otherwise the movie is an easily forgettable one. It is quite acceptable as 85 minutes of light entertainment but I would say that its relatively short length is one of its positive traits. || Wesley Snipes vs The Rane Of Terror. Or should that be our Pain at the Terror?

Of all the Die Hard clones there have been, and there have been many! Passenger 57 may just be the worst. The story follows Wesley Snipes' airline security expert John Cutter, who whilst undertaking a flight to L.A. gets embroiled in a hostage takeover led by evil bad man with a troubled childhood, Charles Rane. Cue quips, kicks and death defying tricks as Cutter strikes one for the good guys. Kevin Hooks' film works well enough on a very basic actioner level, due in the main to Snipes. Snipes was six years away from his signature role in Blade, and for sure he is a bona fide action star. As evidenced here, he has the charisma and body motions to carry the film thru its turgid script. It's a script that smacks of the writers sitting round a table and suggesting they put Snipes in a number of tricky situations and used that as an excuse for him to beat the crappola out of everyone. Oh and lets not forget the forced love story waiting to happen as well.

Ultimately it's just a lazy film that is the cash in that many realised it was upon its release. Bruce Payne manfully tries to make the unbalanced Charles Rane truly evil, but doesn't succeed. Liz Hurley, goddess of womanhood that she is, looks uncomfortable holding a gun, while leading lady Alex Datcher is hopelessly out of her depth. While the youthful looking Tom Sizemore and Bruce Greenwood also appear - but both are throwaway characters that you end up wishing we had had more of. Stanley Clarke's score is abysmal, it's the sort of score one expects to hear in a soft core porno movie - you know the kind where the protagonists are making love but they still have their underwear on! Yes that kind. Poor plotting, poor scripting and just about poor in technical execution.

Pakula,"infidelity, based on novel or book, loss of loved one, female lover, investigation, murder, lawyer, detroit, michigan, courtroom, courtroom drama, legal thriller","Love - it's a killer.

Presumed Innocent is directed by Alan J. Pakula, who also co-adapts for the screen with Frank Pierson from the Scott Turow novel. It stars Harrison Ford, Brian Dennehy, Bonnie Bedelia, Raúl Juliá, Paul Winfield, John Spencer and Greta Scacchi. Music is scored by John Williams and Richard Wolf, and cinematography is by Gordon Willis.

Prosecuting attorney Rusty Sabich (Ford) suddenly finds himself a murder suspect after his one time lover, Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi), is found raped and murdered in her home. As the evidence piles up against him, and his marriage comes under further strain, Rusty hires top lawyer Sandy Stern (Juliá) to represent him when the case goes to trial. Battling the system that he knows inside out, Rusty finds that there's a big can of worms about to be opened.

A tip top court room mystery drama that we could do with seeing more of these days. Expertly strung together by the director of All the Presidents Men and Sophie's Choice, Presumed Innocent isn't just a by the numbers legal who done it? The makers get in deep with the political machinations of a district attorney's office, the intricate steps of a police investigation, and of course the legal eagle operations of a court room. In to the mix is an horrendous crime, of which a lawyer himself is charged with committing, he may or may not be guilty of the crime, but wonderfully we are never sure until the astonishing finale plays out. The air of mystery hangs heavy throughout, nagging away like an itch you can't scratch, with Pakula neatly unfolding the drama in a collage of flashbacks, side-plots and present time intricacies. Mood is heightened by the photography of Gordon Willis, who along with Pakula's looming camera work, manages to convey a claustrophobic feel in keeping with an unstable marriage and a court room itself.

A great cast is assembled for the picture. Ford expertly plays it low key, brooding intently, he makes us unsure as to his guilt or innocence, and that's a testament to how good his performance is. Bedelia is excellent as the stoic wife, holding it together as the marital cracks begin to appear, and Juliá dominates the second half of the picture as we shift to the court room. Dennehy does a nice line in morally compromised smarm, and Scacchi wonderfully exudes a femme fatale sexuality.

I was warned not to eat chocolate before I saw this, and towards the end of this bizarre depiction of cruelty, depravity and exploitation it became quite clear why - and I'd reiterate that here. There is something profoundly desperate about the film. It has nothing even vaguely redeeming about it. Is it allegorical?

Perhaps the illustration of mankind at it's more obscene offers us his perspective on just what humanity had become by the mid 1970s?

You can't escape the fact that this movie pushes the limits of disturbing art! Many will call it sick.

In the beginning stages of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, a reconnaissance patrol is sent ahead in the Ardennes forest on the border of France and Germany where they encounter some German soldiers. Who will survive to celebrate Christmas? 

“A Midnight Clear” (1992) is an obscure artistic WW2 movie focusing on a patrol in the wintery sylvan landscapes of the Battle of the Bulge. It’s more realistic than the surreal “Castle Keep” (1969), but it reminds me a little of that arty flick. 

While a couple of scenes could’ve been more convincingly executed and some elements of the story are unlikely or weird, it’s almost an exact recounting of author William Wharton’s actual experiences (he wrote the 1982 novel the script was based on). Director/scriptwriter Keith Gordon desperately wanted to plainly state “This is a true story” at the beginning, but the lawyers wouldn’t allow it. As such, the supposed disclaimer during the end credits is vaguely worded for legal reasons.

Speaking of Keith, you may remember him as the protagonist in “Jaws 2” (1978) and, especially, “Christine” (1982).

In any case, I appreciated the wintery war ambiance in the woods with cast members from “Platoon” (Kevin Dillon and John C. McGinley), “Dead Poets Society” (Ethan Hawke) and “Forrest Gump” (Gary Sinise). I also liked the inventive approach, the music, and the depiction of this handful of young men united in a struggle of life and death. While the middle starts to get a little tedious and questionable there is a turning point and, from there, the film is quite compelling.

The film closes with a haunting rendition of ""It Came upon a Midnight Clear"" by Sam Phillips as the credits scroll. I felt moved and reflected.

The movie runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in the Park City area of north-central Utah.

Silverado is directed by Lawrence Kasdan and Lawrence co-writes with his brother Mark. It stars Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, Kevin Costner, Brian Dennehy, Jeff Goldblum Linda Hunt and Rosanna Arquette. Music is by Bruce Broughton and cinematography by John Bailey.

As a big Western fan it's most interesting revisiting Silverado some 30 odd years after its release. In context of the time it first came out, when the genre was a dead duck, it was a bold and beautiful romp. How wonderful to find that with one or two 1980s irks aside, it is still a fine Western beast beating a true genre heart.

Ok, it's hardly pulling up trees thematically, in the main because it embraces what it homages, every cliche in scene and writing is respectful to its predecessors, the Kasdan's achieving everything they set out to do - entertain like minded film lovers.

Cast are on fine form, clearly enjoying the material and setting of such. The locations are outstanding, the vistas gorgeous, with production design to match. Broughton's musical score is rambunctious and lifts the spirit, even if much of it feels 1980s as opposed to the era of films setting. Action scenes are expertly staged, the improbable irrelevant for joyous rewards, and stunt work high end as well.

Themes such as prostitution and racism are only given small acknowledgements, but character building is evident at every turn to fully involve audience from first reel to last. Heroes and anti-heroes, psychos, thieves and power hungry villains, no stone left unturned here.  This isn't for those after the grim textures of something like Unforgiven and latterly Hostiles, this is more in keeping with something like Tombstone, or even the much divisive Lone Ranger.

Saddle up and enjoy if you haven't already done so! 8/10 || **Fun, rip-Roaring Western with too many characters in a complicated story**

Released in 1985, ""Silverado"" is a Western about two brothers (Scott Glenn & Kevin Costner) and two other gents (Kevin Kline & Danny Glover) who become friends and ultimately team-up to take on the corrupt sheriff of the New Mexican town Silverado.

The first time I watched ""Silverado"" was in the mid-90s and I was turned off by the implausibility of the prison break scene in the first act, not to mention the nigh goofiness of Costner's character. There's an unrealistic vibe, almost verging on Indiana Jones territory, which is easy to explain since writer/director Lawrence Kasdan also wrote ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). So it's necessary to accept the implausible heroics to glean from (and enjoy) the meat of the picture, which is essentially a serious story running the gamut of the human condition (e.g. injustice, action, drama, comedy, conflict, etc.).

I only bring this up so that viewers who favor realism in their Westerns, like ""Shane"" (1953), ""True Grit"" (1969/2010), ""The Long Riders"" (1980), ""Unforgiven"" (1992) or ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994), will make the necessary mental adjustments before attempting to digest the film. ""Silverado"" is a rip-roaring, rollicking Western in the truest sense. There are a few moral ambiguities (e.g. Jeff Goldblum's character and Paden's conundrum in the story) but, for the most part, the heroes are heroes and the villains drip with evil.

One aspect of ""Silverado"" I like, which most post-50s Westerns lack, is the palpable spirit of life, liberty and joy that the heroes & their friends possess. Despite the various evils they experience (which we can all relate to one way or another) they maintain a certain joy of living, the jubilance of life and freedom itself. As such, the film isn't a downer; it's somehow uplifting.

Stories like this need a good villain and Brian Dennehy more than fills the bill. He's almost horrifying as the swaggering corrupt sheriff of Silverado. Remember his part as the sheriff in ""First Blood"" (1982)? This is essentially the same role, just exponentially WORSE.

The main hero is Kline as Paden. Kline is effective at playing the perfect, likable everyman. Glenn is a quintessential Westerner as Emmett while Costner plays his younger gung-ho brother, Jake. The latter is notably different here than in his other Western roles, ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) ""Wyatt Earp"" and ""Open Range"" (2003). Here he's young & spunky, full of mirth, yet also an expert and deadly gunslinger.

After the contrivances and goofiness of the first act, ""Silverado"" finds its footing and I was absorbed & even thrilled by the story up until around the 70-75-minute mark. Unfortunately, from there the story gets convoluted, although it ends with a long, rousing gunfight in the town. It's just that there are so many characters that you tend to lose track and it seems like some expositional scenes were left on the cutting room floor in order to keep the runtime at just over two hours (133 minutes). The subplots concerning Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Goldblum and Linda Hunt are good examples. However, the positive thing about a story like this is that it's not superficial; hence, the movie's worthy of repeat viewings since you're not likely gonna digest it all in just one or two viewings. Yet an intricate story like this needs at least 2.5 hours of runtime in order to breath and be effective. It demands the length of ""Dances with Wolves"" and so I'd be interested in seeing a Director's Cut.

Speaking of subplots, I enjoyed certain ones like Kline's love for the midget saloon bartender (Linda Hunt), love in a son/mother sense, that is, but their relationship isn't developed enough. You have to read in between the lines. I also appreciated the love and loyalty of the four protagonists; the fact that Glover is a black man is of no issue. Love in its purest sense is spiritual in nature and transcends blood, skin color or raw lust. You never know who you'll meet in life and form a strong love-bond with. It's amazing.

So why not a higher rating? I didn't find the story all that captivating like, say, Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"" (1991). I'm talking about the last hour where I had to struggle a bit to keep attentive, not to mention keep track of all the characters and what's going on. Then there's the nonsensical editing, obvious missing scenes and a few idiotic implausibilities. Beyond these negatives, ""Silverado"" has most everything you'd ever want in a Western: gunfights, quick-draw showdowns, smoke-filled saloons, saloon girls, homesteaders, wagon trains, outlaws, posses, jailbreaks, stampedes, box canyons, glorious Western locations, and more. Actually, it verges on overkill. About the only thing it doesn't have are Native Americans and an uncomplicated story. The latter explains why you DON'T see ""Silverado"" cited on many Best Westerns lists.

The film was shot entirely in New Mexico.

GRADE: C+ || Written (along with his brother) and directed by Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Wyatt Earp), Silverado is one Western that remounts to the golden age of westerns - when I had put the movie on my to watch list, I surely thought it was some lost western from the 70´s.

But alas, no it was a mid-80's to 90's transition movie what gave me some concerns, that proved wrong otherwise. The director doesn't have so many hits in his career other that RotLA, but it is simple in screenplay but not naive as most of the 50-60's westerns with some greater tone on violence and blood.

It tells the story of 4 cowboys, two of them brothers, united by their own reasons, they being played by Kevin Kline and Kevin Costner, a black man with a vow of vengeance Danny Glover (that points the story around the 1870-80) and the lone wolf Scott Glenn that saves the first one that lead to encounters with the others..

The way off all 4 points to the city of Silverado, on which an ex-""friend"" of Scott is the ruthless and abusive sheriff (Brian Dennehy, one of the best roles on the movie along with the saloon owner Linda Hunt - another great star on the movie, with just 1,45cm height that you have seen and heard many times in your live I assure you).

The movie for sure have its share of action and relations betweens characters, and a degree of violence that differentiate it of older westerns. 

I gave to the movie a 7,5 out of 10,0 score / B + . If you like Westerns it sure worths your time - being on Criterion collection it can shows that it is worth it."

This was actually Fox’s first theatrical film, made BEFORE the mega-successful “Back to the Future” but released afterward. By comparison it’s a decidedly small movie, but enjoyable for what it is (an 80’s teen flick). The second act takes a turn that I wasn’t expecting. No spoilers, but the movie poster tells all.

It's Funny, silly & crazy, I like everyone in it, it's got a nice ending that suits the Movie well, Nicholas Cage is his typical self in this Movie, at times a bit overacting, but I like him and most of his Movies.

This is a great example of ""weird"" acting by people you may recognize as great, or at least famous, actors.

Jon Lovitz hasn't changed much, but Dana Carvey certainly plays his role goofy for comedy's sake, but I have no idea what Nicholas Cage is doing in this one.

He starts pretty sane, and then kicks off like he just re-discovered cocaine, and then just when you think he's going to even out, he wildly bounces back and forth between personalities.

The actual over-complicated story of these guys robbing a small town bank and being at the mercy of those they robbed, confronted with the moral implications of their theft versus their own personal adversities is pretty interesting, but the palatable depth of the story is overriden by a lot of comedy, some of which doesn't land, and some of which is weighed down by the situations.

Jim Henson has provided some suitably grizzly effects and the supporting cast - especially the rather supercilious Bill Paterson as the father of ""Bruno"" help keep the film flow effortlessly for ninety minutes before an ending that might put you off pea soup for quite a long a while.

Once upon a time there was a house where four very nice little sisters lived, whose father had to go to war, and whose mother had to get a job to help maintain the house. This seems like the beginning of a very sound children's story, but it summarizes in one fell swoop the essence of the beginning of the most famous and most acclaimed book by Louisa May Alcott, a 19th century writer who wrote books for women and who did so according to the mentality of the time in which he lived, that is, limiting himself to romantic amenities, flirting, marriage proposals and family dramas of a certain moral nature.

Before talking about the film, allow me a small aside…

In fact, May Alcott's book has currently been criticized for its somewhat conservative stances. But what on earth did they expect from a 19th century book, written by a 19th century woman?? If you have any kind of criticism to make, grab a time machine! This is not an isolated case: a certain propensity for posthumous censorship of books, plays, music and historical figures has taken hold in so-called democratic societies based on the fact that they have done, said or written things that we do not like, but which, in the context and at the time they can understand each other. Personally, I see no difference between criticizing this book for its conservatism and editing Shakespeare's plays by changing terms, words and expressions that could hurt the “immaculate virgins” of the hypersensitive 21st century. From the tearing down of statues of confederate generals and people who had slaves to the censorship of books, we are a short distance from the dictatorships that we once fought with weapons: we are conveying an idea of history that, more serious than being partial and “in black -and-white”, is highly politicized and anachronistic. Leave history to those who can explain it, understand and explain statues instead of tearing them down, understand and accept literary and cultural works instead of wanting to rewrite them!

When the film goes to the cinema, the production has two options: either it is strictly faithful to what is written there, or it makes a nicer version, with some new things, for those who want to enjoy it. This film is not faithful to the book, it changes the sisters' ages and makes a number of small changes. None of this reduces the quality of the film, which is highly recommended and well done. The direction does a remarkable job, the cinematography, with bright and vivid colors, is elegant and magnificent, the sets and costumes are well suited to what is expected of them (they deserved the Oscar for Best Art Direction) and the reconstruction of the period is quite satisfactory. The soundtrack is based on a small set of good songs that are worth listening to.

Perhaps it is in the field of interpretation that this film deserves greater attention, because it is a reunion of magnificent actresses at their highest level: it was incredible to see the talent that already existed in the young Elizabeth Tailor, who steals our attention whenever she is near, and Janet Leigh is not far behind with a courageous interpretation of a character full of strength. Little Margaret O’Brien is totally convincing in her character’s fragility and shyness and June Allyson ends up being the least striking of the four “sisters”. The secondary cast features equally consistent appearances by C. Aubrey Smith and Mary Astor. I also liked Lucille Watson, she is excellent as the vixen. I think the least happy ones ended up being Peter Lawford, very sugary, and Rossano Brazzi, who seems to me like a casting error and a weak heartthrob."

Gambler and dancer John ""Lucky"" Garnett (Fred Astaire) is engaged to Margaret Watson, being of a care free mind, and not a little gullible, John is hopelessly late for the wedding. Margaret's father is furious and demands that John go out into the real world and earn $25,000 to prove he has enough wits about him to do credit to the impending marriage. John and his trusty sidekick Pop Cardetti hit New York City, pretty soon John meets Penny Carroll (Ginger Rogers, after a less than favourable earlier meeting) at a dance school. After the initial hostilities from Penny subside, it's apparent that both John & Penny are a dynamite dance act, it's also obvious that both of them are starting to fall for each other, just what will their respective partners think of that then... 

I sat down to watch Swing Time and within five minutes I had a big smile on my face, that smile was to stay there right to the last second when the picture had finished. Rest assured here, Swing Time is most definitely a film to embrace and cherish. Of the ten musicals that Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers made together, Swing Time arguably leads the way as being the most magical of the bunch. Sure the likes of Top Hat may have more vitality, but Swing Time comes with seamless precision. From the wonderful numbers and routines, to the feeling that this couple were hatched from the very same egg, it really is a marvellous piece of uplifting cinema to witness a pair of performers so completely in tune with each other.

The plot set up is straight forward, and we of course lurch from one amiable plot turn to another, but we know that it's all coming together to entertain us via the presentation of its musical numbers. Music and lyrics come courtesy of Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields, and they be corkers - Pick Yourself Up, The Way You Look Tonight, Waltz In Swing Time, Never Gonna Dance and the brilliant A Fine Romance. Yet the crowning glory is, and a sequence that should rank high on any list of great cinematic moments, is Astaire doing Bojangles Of Harlem, with black face makeup on (no offencive caricature here), the sequence builds to a pinnacle that sees Astaire dancing in triplicate with rear projection versions of himself - utterly fabulous. 

Wonderfully directed by George Stevens, whose real father appears in the film as Margaret's enraged father, and containing two great support performances from Victor Moore as Everett 'Pop' Cardetti & Helen Broderick as Mabel Anderson, Swing Time doesn't so much swing, it actually flows along like a perfectly formed ripple on a sea of joy. I feel sorry for those who have an aversion to musicals because they are sure to miss out, not only because of the wonderful artistry on show here, but also to feast on a film that can in a filmic sequence can lift you up out of your doldrums. 9/10"

In any case, a very interesting adaptation of a musical which deserves to be watched at least once. || Norman Jewison shipped everyone to Israel to help give this adaptation of the Lloyd Webber/Rice hit rock opera as much authenticity as possible for the big screen. Ted Neeley dons the robes for the title role and ably aided by a very much on form Carl Anderson (Judas) and Yvonne Elliman (Mary Magdalene) reimagines the stage performances that take us from modern day through the ages to the lifetime of Christ. Neeley certainly has that established look to him, but I actually found him rather underwhelming (it doesn't help that his are certainly not the best numbers). As the story gathers momentum the other two very much come into their own leading an ensemble cast that mixes historical and contemporary styles of music and dance, language and imagery to try to modernise (1970s style) this provocative story. Josh Mostel turns in quite a fun routine as the slightly camp King Herod, and Barry Dennen likewise as the conflicted governor Pilate but for me the whole thing really belongs to Anderson's traitor. The settings serve it well, Douglas Slocombe knows well how to use the ancient monuments and some modern lighting to deliver that extra layer to differentiate it from the stage performance - which, at times, this all too closely resembles. Groundbreaking it certainly was, but time hasn't been especially kind to it and fifty years on it almost comes across as much of a parody as ""Life of Brian"" (1979). Still, ""I Don't Know How to Love Him"", ""Everything's Alright"", ""Heaven on their Minds"" and the powerful ""Gethsemane"" offer robust lyrics for the unfolding story of the last few days of Jesus. I did enjoy this on stage, but this film not so much..."

The a transfer comes. To Acatraz he must go - and shortly after his arrival, he finds himself under the command of his old antagonist. Shoemaker is no thug, though - he does begin to develop a bit of a grudging respect for ""Stroud"" all while he starts from scratch with his bird business and, as the title suggests, begins to work on a plan even more audacious. Lancaster is super here. He plays the part to perfection with a balance of the violent, the calculating and the delicate that I think is pretty much unmatched in cinema. Malden also serves as an effective foil as the intellectual cat and mouse game becomes more attritional, sophisticated and powerfully portrayed. If there ever was a film about imprisonment offering lack of opportunity and purpose, this is it - and what's clear is that the authorities would have actively encouraged Stroud's gradual decline into cerebral morbidity had he not been astute enough to galvanise his friends on the outside and keep his wits sharp - and that's equally well presented by Guy Trosper's potent screenplay. The supporting cast is also strong with powerful efforts from Whit Bissell, Edmond O'Brien and Neville Brand helping to deliver classic big screen cinema that allows the star to be undeniably that."

This is a characterful drama loaded with emotion and chemistry between an on-form Davis and the understated but effective Brent. The writing provides for some strong dialogue and Edmund Goulding creates a working template for both actors to own the film from start to finish.

When great difficulties arise, Aguirre’s men start to wonder whether their quest will lead them to prosperity or certain death.",A breathtaking journey into the heart of darkness.,"History, Adventure, Drama",95.0,1972-12-29,de,7.5,1151.0,1.6652,"Klaus Kinski, Helena Rojo, Del Negro, Ruy Guerra, Peter Berling","Werner Herzog, Werner Herzog","gold, sentence, peru, insanity, gold rush, amazon rainforest, float, south america, 16th century, conquest, new german cinema, indigenous peoples, amazon river, conquistador, age of discovery","_**Conquistador expedition travels down the Amazon to death and madness**_

After Pizarro’s conquest of the Inca Empire, a megalomaniacal Spanish soldier (Klaus Kinski) leads a group of conquistadores down the Amazon River in early 1561 in search of gold and more conquest.   

Werner Herzog’s “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” (1972) mixes the 1541 expeditions of Gonzalo Pizarro & subordinate Francisco de Orellana with the 1560 expedition of the major characters of the film (Aguirre, Ursúa, Don Fernando, Inez and Flores), which left Peru to search for the fabled El Dorado.  

This influenced superior movies like “Apocalypse Now” (1979) and “Black Robe” (1991), but “Aguirre” still packs a punch for those who can handle its unconventionality and remote jungle bleakness. It’s a polarizing picture with some loving it and others hating it. I’m in the middle. 

I see its greatness: It’s artsy, realistic, haunting and there are potent, unforgettable moments, like the titular character skulking around with a menacing look. But it’s also not as effective as those two future films because it’s rather un-compelling and when the end credits start rolling the viewer is more likely to say “that was different” than be blown away.

The movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Peru.

GRADE: B- || Based (loosely) on fact, Werner Herzog takes us on an escapade through the Amazon jungle looking for the legendary El Dorado. Expedition leader and conqueror Pizarro despatches a forward troop to clear the way and gather some intelligence, and that's led by ""Don Pedro"" (Ruy Guerra) and his rather demonically focussed sidekick ""Aguirre"" (Klaus Kinski). This is an arduous and hazardous journey and the boss soon decides he wants to turn back. ""Aguirre"" is having none of this and so we have a change at the top and they force their way deeper and deeper into this hostile terrain with just about everything - man and beast - lined up against them. Kinski is super here portraying a man whose grasp on reality was at best limited when he started, but after months in the fever-ridden forest with his supplies running out and his men picked off one by one, we have to wonder if he had any hope of finding his city of gold in the first place let along ever making it back to tell! The cinematography is breathtaking - from the opening scenes of the Andes mountains through to the brutality of their trek - on their rickety raft with it's own toilet cabinet - the photography captures in increasing detail the descending madness on the faces of the men and the unforgiving nature of the wilderness. We can almost taste the beads of sweat running down their faces and share their joy when they find fresh water or sense a degree of hope. This imagery tries to convince our brains (and his, too) that maybe, just maybe - around the next bend? It's a film that allows Kinski to shine and offer us a performance with this character that made me shiver at times. I never liked him, he's a brute - but respect? Well, maybe... There is plenty of action to complement their quest, but there's never really any jeopardy - perhaps this is the most object lesson in futility?"

Tom Dunson is a self made cattle baron, he will do what ever it takes to protect the life he has made for himself. The constant fall in the value of livestock means that Tom, and his adopted son Matthew, must drive the gathered herd through the perilous Chisholm Trail, and then hope to get good value for the beef. With their assembled group of hands they head off North, but many problems will come their way, not least, a fallout due to Dunson's tyrannical ways, meaning there could well be mutiny on the range.

Without a shadow of doubt, Red River is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, boasting incredible performances from the cast, directed with sumptuous skill by Howard Hawks and photographed as good as any film in the genre. Based on the novel The Chisholm Trail written by Borden Chase (also co writing duties for the film), Red River is a sweeping spectacle that doesn't have a frame that's wasted. Hawks (this his first Western) frames his wonderfully vivid characters in lush expansive landscapes, fleshing them out amongst the constant stream of drama and action. Though Chase would be annoyed at the changes Hawks made to the story, he surely would have marvelled at the finished product, with Harlan's photography in and around the Arizona's locales capturing a cowboys terrain expertly, while Dimitri Tiomkin's score stirs the blood and pumps the viewer with Cowboy adrenaline.

If anyone doubts John Wayne as an actor of note then they need look no further than his performance here as Dunson. Tough and durable in essence the character is for sure, but Wayne manages to fuse those traits with a believable earthy determination that layers the character perfectly. With Wayne all the way, matching him stride for stride is Montgomery Clift as Matthew Garth, sensitive without being overly so, it's the perfect foil to Wayne's machismo barnstorming. Walter Brennan and John Ireland also shine bright in support, while a special mention has to go to a wonderful turn from Joanne Dru as Tess Millay, for Howard Hawks' CV shows a ream of strong female characters, and here Dru firmly puts herself in amongst the best of them - check out her first appearance alongside Clift, it's precious.

Red River made a fortune upon its release, it was revered by the critics back then, and it's still being revered today. Rightly so, because it is quite simply magic cinema, a case where everything comes together perfectly, it's in short, a film that even none Western fans should be able to marvel at as entertainment. Or? at the very least give credit to the Tech accomplishments on offer. 10/10 || Perhaps not a film you'd expect to work given the stars, but John Wayne and Monty Clift do manage to convey a sense of a repectful, but loving relationship - something I don't recall ever seeing before (or since) in a Wayne film towards another man. Hawks takes us on a dirty, unrelenting cattle drive and we can almost feel the strains and tension build as the younger man rails against the almost brutal control of his father-figure. Walter Brennan, as ever, is superb but in this has a little more nuanced a role treading a fine line between his old friend and their younger protégé. The photography really does demonstrate just how tough the whole enterprise would have been for the real cattle drivers and the denouement is superbly staged. A truly epic example of the Western genre that is as good as it gets."

Stagecoach is directed by John Ford and adapted by Dudley Nichols from a story by Ernest Haycox. It stars Claire Trevor, John Wayne, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell, Andy Devine, Donald Meek and Louise Platt. Director of photography is Bert Glennon and director of music Boris Morros.

6 people on board a stagecoach bound for Lordsburg, each one very different in character, each one with their own issues in life, and some carrying shame as well as dark secrets. The journey is fraught with danger as the Apache are tracking them thru the desert flats, can all the polar opposites come together to form a united front?

It's now written in history that the 1930s was a bad decade for the Western movie. The decade began with expensive flops The Big Trail & Cimarron and from there the big studios pretty much condemned the genre to being nothing more than a B movie production line. Then in 1937 a story called Stage to Lordsburg was published in Collier's magazine, a story written by Ernest Haycox that itself was inspired by a short story called Boule de Suif written by Guy de Maupassant. John Ford liked the story very much and purchased the rights, trusting Dudley Nichols to rework a screenplay into a classic Western narrative. Meeting resistance from some of the head men at the studios, Ford had to fight hard to not only get the film made, but to also have John Wayne playing The Ringo Kid. Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea were wanted instead of Wayne, and Marlene Dietrich was suggested for the role of Dallas, the role eventually went to Claire Trevor. But Ford stuck to his guns, and rightly so, for now Stagecoach can be seen as a wonderful film that not only launched Wayne to stardom, but also as the film that reignited the Western genre and paved the way for some essential classics that followed.

John Ford's first sound Western is rich with character dynamics at play, with the great director exploring what would become a trademark theme of his, that of moral qualities born out of people deemed less pure in society's eyes. True enough Stagecoach is still very traditional in an early Western movie sense, but the study of different characters under duress is magnificently moulded by director and cast alike. It was something that Orson Welles liked about the film, calling it perfect textbook film making, even claiming it to be a film he watched numerous times whilst crafting Citizen Kane. It's easy to believe Welles, we obviously remember the stunning Apache pursuit of the rocketing stagecoach, the stunt work, the breathless energy and the majestic location of Monument Valley, but thematically the film sizzles as well. That Ford is able to marry sharp action with real human drama - intimate drama played out on a massive panoramic landscape - is why Stagecoach continually entertains and influences with each passing year.

From the moment Ford zooms up close on the face of John Wayne, a mega-star was born, but more importantly, from the opening credits to the last second of Stagecoach, the Western movie was reborn. A near masterpiece of the genre. 9/10"

From the opening credits as Danny Kaye sings dressed as a harlequin jester you get the impression that this film will be a joyous romp, and so it is. Perhaps the most talked about film in Kaye's CV (even though it lost close to two million dollars on release), The Court Jester is a perfect vehicle for his blend of madcap showboating and serene warbling. Here he gets to play both the coward and the hero in a delightful dual role that is as energetic as it is mirthful - and thankfully  the supporting cast (Cecil Parker, Angela Lansbury and Basil Rathbone in particular) are clued into the nature of the film to bring about top entertaining results. Though to be fair, it would be ignorant of me to not point out that Glynis Johns' Maid Jean is under formed.

A number of hilarious sequences stand out in the film, from Hubert Hawkins transformation back and forth as Giacomo, to a brilliantly funny knighting ceremony, the film ticks all the boxes for fun family entertainment. Whilst do I need to mention ""the vessel with the pestle, the flagon with the dragon, and the chalice with the palace"" section of film that rightly stands the time for classic status. Great songs, great routines, Kaye on form, with Rathbone as the hissable villain, what more do you need? The Court Jester, a perfect movie for all the family. 8/10 || Really entertaining and all around fun musical parody featuring a charismatic performance from David Kaye and also has Basil Rathbone serviceable as the villain. Also nice having Glynis Johns and Angela Lansbury in there, Johns particularly stunning. **3.75/5** || Oh, this is a gem of celluloid that just keeps giving joy.  An adventure, comedy, romance, musical made for the whole family.

A movie written specifically for one actor (who then agrees to play the central part) doesnt happen often, let alone have that role portrayed with perfection....But Danny Kaye is that special kind of actor.  

A spoof of The Adventures Of Robin Hood that even managed to get its villain, the great Basil Rathbone (and its light-years ahead of Men In Tights).  This is an underrated masterpiece that I watch, laugh at and notice new things regularly.  It is one of those movies that can always lift your mood (or at the very least make you smile).  

The plot starts slowly and simply, becomes intricate, and weaves its medieval tapestry-like threads into a beautiful, neat picture at the end,  tying everything up (as all good musicals should). 

The dialogue is at a level that we miss in modern film.  And the timing of the lines is perfect from the classic chalice from the palace to the: 
“I’d like to get in, get on with it, get it over with, and get out. Get it?
“Got it.”
“Good.”
This film is endlessly quotable (in fact, the quotes page on IMDB is lengthy). 

Perfectly cast, Kaye is supported by Johns and Landsbury who glide across their scenes with grace and beauty, and Rathbone sneers and schemes his way through his limited screen time.

The swordplay in the final fight is glorious - up there with the best (the Princess Bride) in terms of skill and creativity. 

And the small gestures that the actors make through the movie, be they nudges, winks, kicks....the detail and timing here is outstanding and worthy of the greatest comedians in the business. 

What else - the costumes (perfectly completed by Edith Head) and sets are gorgeous. The colouring is stunning in a way that only a few films are.  And the music will keep you humming (and whistling) for ages after.  Hell, they even tried to make the credits interesting as Danny sings about the different roles involved in the making of the movie.  

My issues (and why its not 5 stars) - the pacing (it starts out very slow), the effects (rope swings, etc) and the ""march"" feel dated.  

But, I fell in love with this movie as a child (when my Mother introduced me to it).  It became a regular watch on video.  For me this has just gotten better as I get older, and like any long term loves, the issues fall aside.  One of my top 10 favourites of all time."

With the active support of ""Capt. Bennet"" (Simon Oakland) who increasingly has to run point for the man, he begins an investigation that manages to irritate just about everyone as he realises the case is complex and downright dangerous. It's this left field style of work that this cop excels at, and McQueen is on confident form delivering a persona that's conflicted and determined to get to the truth without selling his soul to Satan. To that latter end, he must rely more and more on girlfriend ""Cathy"" (Jacqueline Bisset) who seems to be his only link with sanity as the maelstrom of events begins to get on top of him. It's famous for the car chase, and some of the scenes at the airport towards the end are directed really quite tensely but I can't pretend I liked the conclusion. After all the interweaving and duplicity, it all rather ran out of steam. The style of the production isn't exactly electric either, and in many ways it reminded me of a great many other similar style vehicles about rogue police officers created for A-list actors whose careers might be considered ""between genres"". That said it's still a good, solid, thriller with a few twists and a Vaughn who always managed to portray the sleazy characters naturally."

The onset of the plague forces her to flee to their plantation and he ends up there too - but with a significant complication. With her normally ordered life all askew, ""Miss Julie"" has to think, perhaps for the first time, not just about herself. I'm afraid, though that this film was just bit too much of a soap for me. Though Davis has loads of beans at the outset, the story rather manoeuvres us into a rather predictably sentimental cul-de-sac that's slightly cluttered up by the rather obnoxiously cocky ""Buck"" (George Brent). Donald Crisp and Spring Byington provide a bit of ballast now and again, but I just found this all rather disappointingly flighty and thin. A frustrated love story, yes - but I just needed much more of our original ""Jezebel"" and less of what her character became. I saw this very recently on a big screen and it is still, despite my reservations, a fine example of thoroughly well presented and opulent cinema with a star who very much owns the screen."

What a truly lavish and gorgeous film this is, thematically it pulls the emotions in different directions, and as a story it's as sharp as a tack. Boasting a quite incredible performance from Charles Laughton as the tragic bell ringer Quasimodo (no nomination Academy, are you flipping sure?), and sets that are simply out of this world, this film to me defines classic cinema.

Into the mix we get a radiant Maureen O'Hara as Esmeralda who lights up the screen in every scene she is in, it's a very special performance in view of it being her first lead US turn. However, really the film's triumph lies with its script, a very aware piece of writing encompassing political goings on and the corruption of the church set around the hunchback's tragic love. The make up of Laughton leaves an indelible image when brought into focus with the great detail of the surroundings, and the score is mightily appropriate.

All in all this film cost 2 Million Dollars for RKO Studios, one of their most expensive outlays, but they were rewarded in spades as the film was a monster success and here in the modern day age of cinema the film still stands up as a benchmark for great movie making. 9/10 || The is a wonderfully evocative version of the timeless Victor Hugo story of love, desire, cruelty and brutality in 1490's Paris. Charles Laughton turns in a tour de force performance as the physically and mentally disabled ""Quasimodo"" who is feared, loathed and ridiculed by the local population. When a wandering gypsy girl ""Esmerelda"" (quite possibly Maureen O'Hara's best ever performance) is found guilty of murder he rescues her and gives her sanctuary in the high bell tower of Notre Dame cathedral. Here she is easy prey for the already infatuated ""Frollo"" - superby depicted by Sir Cedric Hardwicke. What follows is the stuff of great literature adapted with adroit skill and sympathy by Sonya Levein (screenplay) and directed by William Dieterie. The use of light and shadow, Alfred Newman's nimble score and an authentic set (recreated in California) make this by far the best rendering of this story on film."

The pairing of Hudson and Day was an utter joy, producing romantic comedy escapism from the upper echelons of such genre stations. Send Me No Flowers is the last of their collaborations, so how wonderful to find it to be a grand way to bow out.

He puts a gracefulness into what is a tricky role, while his sly comedic timing - both visually and vocally - is top dollar. 

This is a guaranteed bad mood lifter, a pic to blow away the black clouds for a while. The actors are great company to be in, the writing cunning with humorous intent.

I enjoyed the idea but somehow it just didn't quite work. Surely there must be local mythology that could have been better applied here? It reminded me a little of Preminger's ""Carmen Jones"" (1954) in that by simply relocating a classic story to a new and vibrant scenario, you lose quite a lot of what made the original story work in the first place - even if it is a timeless love story that ought, on paper, to be easily transferrable. There's no doubt, though, a cracking chemistry between Mello and Dawn and I did enjoy Olivera's performance too. There is some beautiful and captivating photography of Rio de Janeiro that does illustrate the vibrancy of the place, and it's a beautiful film to watch. The story? Well I'm not so sure it marries so well and there's just too much focus on the environment and not enough on developing the characters."
15927.0,A Passage to India,"Set during the period of growing influence of the Indian independence movement in the British Raj, the story begins with the arrival in India of a British woman, Miss Adela Quested, who is joining her fiancé, a city magistrate named Ronny Heaslop.

Ahmed.","David Lean, the Director of ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", invites you on . .","Drama, Adventure, History",163.0,1984-12-14,en,6.816,305.0,0.9815,"Judy Davis, Victor Banerjee, Peggy Ashcroft, James Fox, Alec Guinness",David Lean,"based on novel or book, cave, hindu, doctor, india, 1920s, mosque, british raj","**Although the film does justice to the colorful and rich Indian universe, it is a missed opportunity given the poor script construction.**

This film is the last of director David Lean's career, a filmmaker who gave us a series of good films, being “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Doctor Zhivago” the best of all, for me. Here, the filmmaker brings us an adaptation of a novel I've never read, but which must be quite good: set in India during the interwar period, the story begins with the arrival of two Englishwomen, one of whom, Miss Quested, is engaged to a local English judge. Over time, they befriend Aziz, a Muslim doctor. Quested already had the will to live something adventurous, to feel the taste of India, but was always disappointed by her compatriots, who labeled Indians and preferred to emulate, in that country, the habits and environments of British society, without any “dangerous” mixture with people of a ""darker race"" and more ""barbaric"" culture. Finally, Quested gets Aziz to prepare an exploration on some distant caves, but the trip goes wrong, something happens, and Quested goes to accuse Aziz of attempted rape.

I think that the film turns out to be a rather weak adaptation: dazzled by the oriental environments, Lean missed the most incisive themes of the plot: the ethnocentric relationship, full of prejudices and mutual mistrust, between the English and Indians; the political issue of Indian independence (which becomes relevant as the plot evolves); the mystery surrounding what really happened between Quested and Aziz, since the novel never clarifies whether her accusation is true. These themes are very poorly aligned by the script: in the film, it is obvious that Aziz is innocent, and Quested is turned into a frivolous, amorphous and unhappy woman, unsure of what she wants from her life and desirous of a strong emotion that social conventions don't allow her; secondly, the script never values the independence issue, turning it into a footnote, merely contextual; thirdly, despite the fact that the film deals quite well with British racist ethnocentrism, it almost does not address the way in which Indians saw the British, and the way in which they felt offended by their excesses. Everything is very relativized.

In addition to the script problems, the film is also excessively long. Everything is stretched to the maximum, and many minutes are lost in magnificent and well done scenes that add nothing to the story. A lot of time is lost, even, in rather frivolous dialogues, while the legal battle, the most interesting part of the film, is secondary. And instead of the film ending right after the final decision, with a few scenes that enclose the fate of the characters, the film still stretches for a barren half hour, until an anticlimactic and uninteresting ending.

The actors do what they can, and we have some good efforts here: Victor Banerjee is the most eminent actor, the most magnetic and charismatic figure, showing us the evolution of his character's ideas, whose opinion of the British gradually degrades with the events. Peggy Ashcroft also made a good effort, but the script sidelined her to the point of becoming an accessory. The same can be said of Sir Alec Guiness, wasted on a marginal work of no particular relevance. James Fox appears more or less in the middle and the plot suggests that the character will walk a certain path, but the ending is not quite as expected. Judy Davis, despite the hard work, has a terrible and extremely unpleasant character, so the actress's effort is not fruitful.

It is in the more technical details that Lean shows his worth, for the rich and elegant cinematography, magnificently colored, which is complemented by the excellent sets, costumes and the careful choice of filming locations, which emphasize the exotic and mysterious side of India. The crowded market scenes, or those erotic ruins, are clear examples of what I mean. We just missed the smells! The worst is even Maurice Jarre's soundtrack. It's perfectly inappropriate and gives the film an unpleasant comedic environment. || Sir David Lean has produced a spectacular piece of cinema in this lengthy adaptation of the E.M. Forster tale of the Raj. ""Mrs. Moore"" (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) is travelling to visit her son in India, accompanied by Judy Davis ""Adela"". They arrive to discover a society riddled with division and bigotry. After spending time at establishment events, they decide to experience a little of the traditional culture. With the help of ""Aziz"" (a superb Victor Banerjee) - a local doctor, they visit the legendary Marabar caves. There, something untoward happens - ""Adela"" rushes back to the city in a dishevelled state and ""Aziz"" finds himself in jail accused of an heinous crime. To be honest, the story isn't one of Forster's best but Lean has assembled a strong supporting cast including Sir Alec Guinness, James Fox with Nigel Havers and Richard Wilson epitomising the ignorance of the occupying power well. I found that the editing (again, done by Lean) missed the sharpness of someone like Anne V. Coates - a few too many scenic cutaways. That said, the major redeeming feature is the spectacular scale of the film; not just the scenery but the crowds and the score from Maurice Jarre. It isn't anywhere near as visceral as ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" nor the characters as good as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is still a stunning film well worth a watch."

In ""Hero"", Zhang Yimou transcends the martial arts genre, transforming physical combat into a language of profound philosophical discourse. What begins as a seemingly simple narrative about an assassin becomes a breathtaking meditation on individual sacrifice and national unity.

Drawing from Kurosawa's multi-perspective storytelling in ""Rashomon"", Zhang creates something entirely his own. Each retelling of the story is not just a different perspective, but a different visual poem - choreographed fights that are less about violence and more about inner emotional landscapes.

The film's fight sequences are revolutionary. They aren't mere action, but abstract ballets where movement, color, and spatial relationships communicate complex philosophical conflicts. A battle in a chess pavilion or a dance of warriors in falling leaves become metaphors for human connection, political ideology, and personal destiny.

Zhang's visual language is extraordinary. Color isn't decoration, but narrative - each sequence bathed in a different chromatic tone that reflects emotional and philosophical states. Red speaks of passion, blue of melancholy, white of purity and sacrifice.

""Hero"" represents an elevation of Zhang's gift for storytelling: a narrative film that is simultaneously a political allegory, a philosophical inquiry, and a visual symphony."

A young doctor in DC (Michael J.

The plot of “Doc Hollywood” (1991) is reminiscent of Northern Exposure and was obviously ripped off by the animated “Cars” (2006). It’s an agreeable Southern town drama with fun touches highlighted by likable Fox as the protagonist. It’s like Mayberry R.F.D. with a lil’ edge.

It’s always a pleasure to see Bridget Fonda, just don’t expect the alluring apparel of “Shag” (1989) and “Jackie Brown” (1997).

Comedy thrillers are tough to get right, you gotta make people laugh and also grip them with drama, thankfully Colin Higgins gets it right in this delightful late 1970s production. He kind of plays safe by literally throwing many of the conventions of the genres into the mix, with weird villains, an odd couple (hello romance), pratfalls, near misses, McGuffin, bonkers situations (both dicey and funny) and etc etc. Boosted by a damn fine cast (Hawn and Chase are fun, charming and sexy together, while the supports excel), some superb Frisco scenery and a toe tapping 70s soundtrack, it rounds out as a breezy effort across the board.

The fight/stunt scenes are naturally the film's major selling point, but I also enjoyed those onscreen and the score - which comes strong at the end and across the subsequent credits.

When a psychic is murdered after picking up the thoughts of a psychotic killer, Marcus Day is the only witness to the crime and sets about trying to figure out who is responsible. But he then finds that the killer is shadowing him and targeting anyone who files in to help his investigation.

Dario Argento’s Deep Red (AKA: Profundo Rosso/The Hatchet Murders) is rightly regarded as one of the leading lights of Giallo. Argento pitches Marcus Day (David Hemmings working from a splinter of Blow Up) into a rousing and visceral world of murder and mystery – and takes the viewers along as well! It doesn’t matter what time of day or night it is, Argento always has a sinister edge pulsing through his movie. The mystery element is also strong, including for first time viewers a cheeky opportunity to solve it very early on.

Painting it all in vivid coloured strokes, Argento unleashes a myriad of stylish sequences, adding in children’s toys and mannequins to further up the creep factor. Musically not all of it works, but the running children’s thematic motif works strikingly well. Negatively the dubbing is often iffy at best and some of the now infamous murder sequences veer close to comedy because the director allows them to be protracted.

Uncompromising, thrilling and striking, some quibbles aside, Deep Red is a very positive experience. 7.5/10 || A remarkable and breathtaking horror work, easily my favourite of a distinguished, exciting run Argento made at the peak of his career. Films like THIS provided stunning proof to people's assertion the world over that he was the Italian Hitchcock. The soundtrack by Goblin is to be treasured. For both horror and thriller aficionados, well worth getting in the very best edition possible, and well worth rewatching. A master craftsman at the pinnacle of his artistry. || Parts of this were pretty slow but the mystery elements were good and I liked the leads even though their romance was really forced and unnecessary (I know those scenes were removed in the Export Version, along with some of the gore).

Thus is the setting for director Henri-Georges Clouzot's brilliant suspenser. The pace is stiflingly perfect, he gently racks up the tension, neatly toying with audience expectation, the sense of dread that hangs in the air is palpable. How refreshing it is to see a suspense film actually build its plot for a good hour? In this day and age the MTV generation would be walking out of this after 30 minutes. Armand Thirard's atmospheric photography accentuates the creeping menace like mood, to the point that when we get to the last 15 minutes, nerves are already frayed and we then of course get what is arguably the greatest bath scene ever, and ""that"" ending...

Grieving the loss of a son, a family of Irish immigrants struggles to make it in an old apartment building in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan. Paddy Considine & Samantha Morton play the parents while Djimon Hounsou plays a loner artist in the complex.

""In America"" (2002) is a decent drama about adapting to life in the grungy Big Apple. Morton’s beauty is notable early on, despite her odd haircut, but most of the movie she’s pregnant. Meanwhile Sarah Bolger is smashing as daughter Christy, who narrates the story. Sarah would grow up to be a ravishing celestial woman.  

You can tell the story is semi-autobiographical by director/writer Jim Sheridan and his daughters, Naomi and Kirsten. A lot of the drama works, but some of it had kinks that needed worked out. This left me with a “Meh” impression. But enough of it works for those interested. One thing’s for sure, life in the Big City isn’t painted as remotely attractive. I’m assuming the father made the radical move to fulfill his dream in acting.  

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Dublin, Ireland, with studio stuff done in Ardmore Studios, and some shots of Manhattan & points nearby.

The battle scenes are stirring and elegantly mounted, but they are less about who wins than about what can be proven by dying. Beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it's an uncommonly thoughtful epic. Its power is compromised only by an ending that sheepishly backs away from what the film is really about.

Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe co-star, as a shabby Civil War veteran and a proud samurai warrior. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a war hero who now drifts and drinks too much, with no purpose in life. He's hired by Americans who are supplying mercenaries to train an army for the Japanese emperor, who wants to move his country into the modern world and is faced with a samurai rebellion.

The role of the samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe) is complex; he is fighting against the emperor's men, but out of loyalty to the tradition the emperor represents, he would sacrifice his life in an instant, he says, if the emperor requested it. But Japan has been seized with a fever to shake off its medieval ways and copy the West, and the West sees money to be made in the transition: Representatives from the Remington arms company are filling big contracts for weapons, and the U.S. Embassy is a clearinghouse for lucrative trade arrangements.

Into this cauldron Algren descends as a cynic. He is told the samurai are ""savages with bows and arrows,"" but sees that the American advisers have done a poor job of training the modernized Japanese army to fight them. Leading his untried troops into battle, he is captured and faces death -- but is spared by a word from Katsumoto, who returns him as a prisoner to the village of his son. || Recommended.

<em>'The Last Samurai'</em> features some very cool and entertaining battle sequences, which are shot excellently. The premise itself is attracting, it's acted out astutely by the noteworthy cast list. It probably lasts too long, but I never truly got a feeling of it dragging out though.

Tom Cruise is fantastic as Capt. Nathan Algren. It's no secret or surprise as we all know that guy can act, he adds a great deal to his character here; especially on the emotional side of things. As for what happens with Algren, it's all good even if the love interest parts are undercooked.

Ken Watanabe is splendid in the role of Katsumoto, while Masato Harada (Omura) and Timothy Spall (Graham) give positive performances. It's also nice to see Billy Connolly (Gant) and Scott Wilson (Swanbeck) appear. Hans Zimmer's score is, as presumed, grand. That would be one of a number of reasons why I'd say you should watch this. || ""Nathan Algren"" (Tom Cruise) is a disenchanted, alcoholic Captain who, post American Civil War, is offered the chance of a fresh, lucrative, start in Japan training some raw recruits to form the basis a standing Imperial Army. He arrives and is presented to the young, forward-looking but somewhat intimidated Meiji Emperor and it subsequently becomes clear that his purpose is primarily to assist Ômura, the Prime Minister, to create a military force capable of defeating the traditionalist, but loyal, Samurai clan of ""Kausumoto"" (Ken Watanabe). The first skirmish doesn't quite go to plan, and ""Algren"" is captured. Over the harsh winter, he befriends his warlord captor and the film begins to introduce us to the honourable and upright values of the man and of his beliefs and fundamental, if at times, ruthless decency. It mixes truth with fiction in a clever, unsentimental manner - Watanabe's performance is considered and engaging as the man on the cusp of a new era which neither he, nor his people, want or understand. Cruise is clearly the man behind the concept and is to be commended for bringing this gloriously good looking story to the screen; he is not, however, especially good in the lead - the part calls for a sophistication that he, as an actor, simply doesn't possess. There is also a curious role for Scots comedian/actor Billy Connolly who originally enlists ""Algren"" to the cause - with an accent that is all over the place. Masato Harada delivers well as the devious Minister who, in his own way, wants his society to adapt and flourish and Shichinosuke Nakamura gives the person of the Meiji emperor a caring, aspirational vulnerability that helps give the whole film a sense of truth and authenticity. The technical standards - especially during the frequently brutal battle scene are consistently high."

One of the first films in the revolution of modern dance flicks, though I know I saw it too late.

Honey is a main character's name played by Jessica Alba. A passionate dance, choreographer, when her dream coming to true that hits a roadblock for some reason followed by other issues. So now she has to come up with a solution to solve all the problems and that's the film tells how she overcomes them all at once.

A simple story, even the choreography was ordinary, but not a bad film. I anticipated Alba to give a show that not to forget for the decades. This is now obviously a decade old flick and disappointed with her character, especially with her dance moves. But young Alba in a sexy pose on the poster, no one can just ignore it from watching.

Overall, I enjoyed it. Since I'm watching it delayed, I should not compare it to the present scenario. Even though it has been only 13 years, in which all the fields rapidly advanced, so the dance. I suggest you just go for it with an empty mind if you want to see it. Soon I'm going to catch up with its sequel, but I know it won't be as decent as this one.

I'm a fan of Matt Damon, but not so much Greg Kinnear, though both are clearly quality actors.  This movie is extremely charming, and very well written and produced.  It is obvious that they knew they had a contentious concept and needed to create something that deals with it carefully and tastefully.

As an idea that, ""oh, they can't get away from each other!"" is funny short term, like if they were glued together on accident (""Family Guy""), but as the sadness of the reality sets in they try to compete with overly ridiculous scenarios that wouldn't happen in real life and try to swing the odd situations as beneficial.  As that becomes obviously untrue, the sadness of it sets back in and is doubled by the idea of being permanently stuck with someone so wildly different that you.

If you can look past reality, then there is a lot of good humor in here, and a really touching love story crossed with a story of ambition versus family.

Other than funny, this movie feels like it tries to be too many things, but that comes from having two wildly different characters each pursuing their own stories.  There's just a lot of overhead.

There are a lot of problems with the movie, but it's uniquely charming, and there just aren't many conjoined twin stories."

Really well done. **4.5/5** || I must admit I did struggle a little to wonder how Ewan McGregor could ever age into Albert Finley, but then as the whole principle of this story is to stretch the truth, then I suppose why not! It’s those very far-fetched sort of scenarios that caused this family’s problems in the first place as the young “Will” (Bully Crudup) has to return home after a three year estrangement from dad “Ed” (Finney) when the latter man is diagnosed with terminal cancer. A sort of uneasy truce breaks out between them as we realise that extent of their issues is more that the young lad actually believed some of the fantastic fables he was being spun by his enthusiastic younger dad (McGregor) and so feels that somehow he has been betrayed and lied to all these years. The most preposterous of those sees an early witchery outing for Helena Bonham Carter as the neighbour whose glass eye will espy the impending death of the startlingly naive young “Will”. The only solution here seems to be that dad acknowledges his failings to his profoundly disappointed son and maybe some form of reconciliation might emerge from these truths. “Edward” isn’t the apologising type, though, and so a bit of a Mexican stand-off seems destined to thwart any possibility of a rapprochement. Then again, could there be some truth to the old man’s stories after all? The inventive use of flashback and two really quite engaging efforts from McGregor and a sparingly used but effective Finney give this a certain poignancy as the ridiculousness of the initial premise of their falling out gives way to more serious and profound issues about truth. What might that actually be, and need it be the same truth for everyone? Maybe, just maybe, the young “Will” needs to take things a little less on face value? As the film progresses, the story becomes increasingly more touching and for that, the equally on-form Crudup can take much credit as this character study advances in the face of one tragedy, certainly, but hopefully not two. The switching around of the timelines works well and allows the production to indulge itself in two totally different eras with all of the creative benefits that offers. It’s quirky, quite funny and well worth a couple of hours."

For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?

Well, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.

And then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.

In particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.

The Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.

And so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.

Character nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.

Jackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire).

But those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.


Verdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.

5/5

- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine || Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out “looks of love” for my tastes.

RELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.        

While I’m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I’ve never read Tokien, likely because I’m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien’s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991) with “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sounds good, then you’ll probably like these movies more than me. 

“The Return of the King” is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It’s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could’ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.   

Like the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there’s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with “The Two Towers,” there’s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        

There are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they’re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. 

Then there are WAY too many “looks of love” between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There’s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one’s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché?    

Another problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There’s Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit’s wife. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did “Conan the Barbarian” and “Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005). It’s not rocket science. 

As noted above, the movie’s needlessly overlong and things could’ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and “looks of love” are tacked on. 

Despite these honest quibbles, “The Return of the King,” and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.                      

THE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  

GRADE: C || Great finale to a great trilogy. The action and battle sequences were amazing and even though I've seen this a few times over the years, still thrilling to the end. I didn't even mind the multiple endings as I had in the past, nice each character got their due. **4.75/5**"

They, and fellow members of the Knapely Womens Institute, will pose in some strategically nude pictures and sell them as a calendar!

Based on a true story, and following on from the roaring success of 1997s The Full Monty, it was a story just begging to be adapted for the big screen. Also boasting a shot in the arm for actresses of a certain age, who sadly are bereft of decent cinematic parts, Calendar Girls may not be a masterpiece of homely cinema values, but it certainly warms the cockles and hits an entertaining spot in spite of the laborious last third. The cast are uniformly excellent, Julie Walters, Helen Mirren (gorgeous), Linda Basset, Annette Crosbie and Geraldine James are particularly memorable in telling this tale of a close-knit village quite unsure on how to deal with a touchy subject. From there the press sensationalism arrives and this shifts the girls (and sadly the film) to another plane.

The picture manages to be that rare old thing of a comedy drama actually impacting heavy on both fronts. The comedy moments are joyous and flow frequently for the first two thirds of the picture, whilst the touching drama, of what is a serious subject at its core after all, really touches a nerve. Sadly as we enter the final third, the makers tag on an unnecessary dissection of friendships and relationships, and it nearly costs the film dear. It does survive, mainly due to the wonderful cast and the integrity laden point of view, making it a film that once viewed is clearly not going to be forgotten. So in the main we should all hail those wonderful Calendar Girls. 7/10 || Another one of those movies I watched decades ago and recently revisited. I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time.

It reminds me of Waking Ned Devine in a way. It contains witty and realistic dialogue and a good percentage of the actors are older. There is a bit more drama in Calendar Girls, but it never submerges into melodrama.

I am glad I watched it a second time. It has aged well and is a classic feel old movie. || Another one of those movies I watched back when it came out and recently watched again. Like the women who pose for the calendar, the movie has aged well. My wife and I watch a lot of British tv (for Americans) so we have seen the actresses in many other excellent performances.

Calendar a Girls reminds me of another great movie, (Waking) Ned Devine. There is humor, a feel good plot, and a fine ensemble cast. There are a perhaps a couple of more serious subplots in this film, such as Alderton’s character’s illness that gives birth to the calendar fundraiser.

The movie is of course based on an actual fundraising calendar undertaken from women aged 45-65. I didn’t research it to see how accurate the plot is as I do in some reality based films, because I just watched it for is entertainment value.  So should you."

Monster is the bleak story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute and one of America's most notorious female serial killers. Based around facts of her life and death, the film primarily focuses on the last year of her freedom. Where after entering into a strange lesbian relationship with Selby Wall, Wuornos, fed up of being a abused by men, starts killing those calling on her services.

Sad and potent is Patty Jenkins' first full length directorial effort. Though perhaps a touch guilty of pandering to Wuornos' own self created ""monster"" image, the film none the less has the right blend of sympathy and revulsion to make it a fascinating, if uneasy, experience. Former model Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation to become Wuornos, so much so she's practically unrecognisable. Bulked up in weight and with beaten down make up withering her face, Theron goes on to give a towering performance as the troubled, on the edge killer. 

Without any thrills or hints of histrionics, Theron is uncompromising throughout the picture. To garner empathy with such an abrasive character is quite a trick, then to switch to monstrosity with conviction seconds later? Well that's almost magical in itself. Theron is backed up well by Christina Ricci as Selby. Selby Wall, an immature young lady oblivious to the dark path she is walking down, is given a great portrayal from Ricci. In light of the powerhouse show from Theron, it's much credit to Ricci that she enhances the film with her own delicate characteristics. Helping to emphasise the strangeness of the union in the process.

It's a tough film for sure, and come the final credits one is left with a feeling of sympathy towards Wuornos and the life she lived. If that be right or wrong is of course up to the individual viewer. Or if that was even Jenkins' intention is probably up for debate. But Monster exists and survives as a bitter character study of a desperate woman, which through the medium of cinema, makes us the viewers privy to something very edgy indeed. 7.5/10 || The movie was alright. It was more of a sadistic type of love story. What they failed to capture is really how nuts she was. Like do less of a love story and more of her psychoness. The bitch was crazy! All the crazy interviews with her and all the outbursts she did in court, where's that?

As Inman makes his perilous journey home, Ada struggles to keep their home intact with the assistance of Ruby, a mysterious drifter sent to help her by a kindly neighbor.",Find your way home.,"War, History, Adventure, Romance",154.0,2003-12-24,en,6.935,1842.0,4.6408,"Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renée Zellweger, Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson",Anthony Minghella,"love of one's life, loss of loved one, desertion, rape attempt, somber, early america, intimate, complicated, empathetic, powerful, sincere","_**Civil War Odyssey**_

A Confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) deserts in late 1864 to return to the mountains of western North Carolina and his one true love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Inman experiences many different people, events and obstacles on his long journey while Ada has her own problems to deal with: death, grief, the ruthless “home guard,” starvation/poverty, and a house & farm she doesn't know how to run, that is, until the practical Ruby (Renée Zellweger) comes along.

Based on the 1997 novel by Charles Frazier, “Cold Mountain” (2003) involves two stories that ultimately intertwine and is reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey. In light of Inman's journey home, the film is episodic but, thankfully, never loses its sense of cohesion. The story shows how the war destroyed or corrupted the South on practically every level, not just the soldiers who went off to fight, die, be maimed, desert or suffer defeat, but everyone left behind as well. Every person Inman meets on his journey is somehow damaged or sullied because of the war.

For example, in the case of the family in the large cabin the husband's friendliness is dubious. All the eligible men have gone to war and those who return are maimed and scarred. Is it any wonder that the women are love-starved and try to lose themselves in drunkenness and casual sex? As for a couple scenes of overt sexuality, the book & film are contrasting drunken carnal lust with intimate committed love.These scenes are adult-oriented, so be forewarned. I should add that the “kitchen table woman” is actress Melora Walters, who played George Costanza’s date in “The Hamptons” episode of Seinfeld. Meanwhile Natalie Portman shows up for another key sequence. 

Then there’s the immoral & looney ""Reverend"" Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who may tempt some to view the film as “anti-Christian,"" but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending. Not to mention likable, but shakey religionists like Veasey exist in real life. 

Not everyone can handle ""Cold Mountain"" because of its hardcore depiction of the horrors of war, madness and immorality, but it's not all death, misery and darkness; these are commendably counterbalanced by the beauty of life, love, loyalty, companionship, poetry and music. “Cold Mountain” is an all-around well-made motion picture that cuts the fat out of the book for a more effective story.

The film runs 2 hours, 33 minutes, and was shot mostly in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania, but with some scenes done in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

GRADE: A || First time seeing this in a long time, probably back in theaters circa 2003/2004. I remembered bits and pieces. Good performances from Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger while Jude Law acquitted himself well enough, however never fully bought into the romance aspects, but the horrors of the Civil War was an interesting element. The direction from Anthony Minghella was solid along with the cinematography and production design. **3.5/5** || ""Ada"" (Nicole Kidman) lives a comfortable life on her farm with her father ""Rev. Moore"" (Donald Sutherland) as the American Civil War comes to a close. That's where she meets and takes a shine to ""Inman"" (Jude Law) who is making his way back to his Confederate troops. When the preacher dies, ""Ada"" finds herself having to throw the fine frills and fancies in a box and struggle to maintain the property as the winter snows set in. Luckily, along comes the savvy ""Ruby"" (Renée Zellweger) who agrees to stick around and help so long as both women chip in and share the load. As the women try to survive, the war concludes and ""Inman"" sets about retracing his steps back to North Carolina. With the conditions treacherous and the territory pretty lawless, both must face the insecurity that prevails, and that is well exemplified by the odious ""Teague"" (Ray Winstone) and his brutal sidekick ""Junior"" (Giovanni Ribisi) who are roaming the territory looking for deserters, or for those who help them out. A violent fate awaits those they meet. Anthony Mingella knits the threads of their respective adventures nicely together here, with a certain inevitability, sure, but nothing too predicable. The brutality of war, the desperation of hunger, cold and depravity as well as the more visceral human needs are all shone a light on as his journey tests both the mettle and the morality of ""Inman"" and of those he meets. It's probably Winstone who takes the plaudits for me here, he really does convey a palpable sense of wickedness and Zellweger also performs well as proof that women can thrive in what is meant to be a man's world. Now it is too long, and it meanders just a little labouring the point as it goes, but the action when it happens and the strongly developed characters compensate enough for that to keep it interesting and watchable."

Martin Henderson plays a nice leading man who is not perfect, I was reminded of Kurt Russell in ""Big Trouble in Little China."" Ice Cube has the best terminal scowl in the business- when he's unhappy, you believe it. Pressly is good as China in a too-small supporting role. Adam Scott is a riot as the unorthodox McPherson. But- some of the action scenes here must be seen to be believed. Other action scenes are beyond belief, even after being seen. The entire film is like one long video game, where all logic is tossed in favor of tons of impossible stunt work and a simplistic story my seven year old son could have dreamed up. It may have helped if I thought the cast and crew were in on a big joke, winking at the audience but there are too many wasted chances, and too many earnest performances, to make me think we are supposed to take all of this lightly. The idiotic product placement could have been played with a la ""Wayne's World 2,"" yet it also seems serious. In the end, ""Torque"" is just as loud and annoying as the motorcycles themselves.

Now this adaptation is an almost literal one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel - and that might have worked were we in a theatre. We are not, though, and what we are presented with here is a wordy and frankly rather sterile and plodding character study. Too much reliance is placed on the aesthetic elements - the costumes, sets, lavishness of the parties; indeed the imagery is gorgeous. It's supposed to be a love story, but the purported relationship between Redford and Farrow just doesn't resonate. I never really understood why she was so acclaimed in the first place - her performances were always rather hit or miss. The narration from Waterston also becomes a little too flat and the contrasting existences of the fabulously wealthy and the subsistence poor is hardly developed at all. My star of the film is Karen Black's ""Myrtle"" - possibly the only persona here that exudes anything like a sense of personality as she juggles her marriage and her affair. This is a nasty story about selfish and thoughtless people, but this iteration simply fails to capture that emotion, or - indeed - any other emotion either.

RELEASED IN 1970-1971 and directed by Delbert Mann, ""Jane Eyre"" adapts Charlotte Brontë’s 1847 novel about the eponymous character (Susannah York) who becomes a governess of a French girl at a huge estate in northern England circa 1800 after an upbringing at a harsh religious orphanage. She slowly gets to know the surly, world-wise master of the estate, Edward Rochester (George C. Scott), and his curious situation. Eventually she meets a devout clergyman, St. John Rivers (Ian Bannen), and his two sisters. Can Jane escape the shackles of a pre-Victorian world ruled by men and legalism to find love?

While this version of the oft-filmed book was released to TV, it has the vibe of a theatrical release with great northern England locations, a superb score by John Williams and quality actors. The book was criticized as “anti-Christian” when it was published, but it’s actually anti-legalism. Mr. Brocklehurst (Jack Hawkins) represents a poisonous form of dead religiosity at the orphanage while the seemingly unbalanced St. John Rivers represents a much more subtle and less extreme form. 

The story’s about Jane navigating the pitfalls of society and religion in a fallen world and, maybe, hopefully, finding freedom and genuine love. The locations/tone/themes are akin to “Sense and Sensibility” (1995), but with an anti-legalism subtext. Jane Austen’s 1811 novel no doubt influenced Brontë’s book. Both movies are worth checking out, but I slightly prefer “Jane Eyre.” It’s the perfect antidote to CGI-laden “blockbuster” drivel.             

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 48 minutes and was shot in North Yorkshire in northern England (Ripley Castle, Ripley; Pateley Bridge; Brimham Rocks; and Grinton). WRITERS: Jack Pulman wrote the screenplay based on Brontë’s novel.

The Wind and the Lion is written and directed by John Milius and stars Sean Connery, Candice Bergen, Brian Keith, John Huston and Geoffrey Lewis. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Billy Williams.

In early twentieth century Morocco, a Berber Sharif kidnaps an American woman and her children, forcing President Theodore Roosevelt to send in forces to conduct a rescue mission. 

On basic terms it was meant to be a sly attack on American colonialism, what we actually get is a wonderful collage of homages to great desert epics of the past - with tongue firmly in cheek. It's funny, thrilling, and is in turn boosted by a soaring Goldsmith score and stunning natural location photography.

However, lets not be swept up in it all to not notice it's a vastly inaccurate observation on US interventions. It is unashamedly a flag waving piece of jingoism, but the myth making gusto of it all, with all its entertainment values, makes it a sort of serial piece of fluff entertainment. Not even Connery's Scottish brogue can detract from the fun of his Berber chief Raisuli - or Bergen turning into Lara Croft at one point...

But with Brian Keith excellent as Teddy Roosevelt, historical truths be damned. Seek out the real story behind the events of the story being told here and just have a good cinematic time. 7.5/10"

Monsieur (Jean-Pierre Zola) has a managerial job at a plastics factory and that’s keeping his slightly snobbish wife (Adrienne Servantie) in the style to which she has already become accustomed. In the nearby city lives her brother “Hulot” (Jacques Tati) whose home barely has plumbing and who is concerned that his young nephew “Gérard” (Alain Bécourt) isn’t living life to the full in his gilded cage of an home. Not unreasonably, his parents conclude that uncle might be a bit of a bad influence on their youngster so devise a cunning plan to put him to work at the factory. A risky strategy, methinks - especially as “Hulot” is very much an independent thinker who could end up wrecking the whole place! Their attack on this affable man’s personality is two pronged. They also assemble a collection of individuals for a party in their perfectly cultivated garden so that perhaps they can set him up with a suitable lady friend. Well, as you can probably imagine, “Hulot” is a fish out of water and though not deliberately rude or unpleasant, well you get the drift… With their conformity magnets definitely working against each other, will it be possible for this family to learn to live and let live? There’s a gentle comedy to this whole film but there is also an only thinly veiled critique offered on the sterilisation of society and community endangered by automated industrialisation. The impact on jobs, careers and the social structure of their town is all at risk as interpersonal skills are sacrificed at the altar of increased productivity, lower costs and a continuing supply that doesn’t stop when the whistle blows at 5pm. The humour comes from an on form Tati’s avuncular persona, but also from the really quite amiable efforts of both Servantie and Zola, with the former of the pairing determined, at all costs, to ensure her lad is way ahead of the Joneses never mind kept up with them. What is also here is just an hint of jeopardy. We really don’t know how it might end, or who might prevail, until the very last gadget in her state of the art kitchen has shown us it’s (largely entirely unnecessary) function.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is directed by Victor Fleming and collectively adapted from the Robert Louis Stevenson story by John Lee Mahin, Percy Heath and Samuel Hoffenstein. It stars Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg.

A remake of the 1931 Rouben Mamoulian/Fredric March version, this follows the same course of action that sees Tracy as the dual title characters. After having developed a potion that will ultimately bring out his evil half – it proves to not be good for anybody really!

It’s the story itself, along with the awesome period setting of a foggy lamplighted Victorian England that stops this from sinking below average – though it does come close in the middle section. It’s just an odd fit, from the daft casting of Tracy and Bergman in the key roles, to the Hollywood Hayes Office compliant smoothness of the material, it becomes almost impossible to take seriously. Then there is a run time of nearly two hours, most of which is to bump up Bergman’s screen time, which while acknowledging her greatness as an actress, it’s just wrong across the board for her here. While alongside her Turner is sadly under written and Tracy’s take on Hyde lacks vim and vigour.

Since a certain Mr. Freud had become in vogue there’s some interesting dream imagery and dissolves sequences, most of which ares bursting with sexual subtext. These moments are superb, but they do not form the backbone of our troubled protagonists, it’s a complete missed opportunity that renders the film as safe and glossy. This is an attempt at horror but without the horror, either visually, thematically or literary, a ripened banana skin of a pic with action missing in action. Yet it is not a desperately bad film, the film making craft on show is top dollar, notably when Ruttenberg is on duty, and it’s a little sensual - though this is kind of tempered by the thought of domestic abuse as a constant threat in our real world.

The 41 version has fans, I’m just not one of them and readily prefer the monstrously potent 31 version. If you haven’t seen it then it’s definitely worth a look, but much of the criticism it has received over the years is in my book very much warranted. 5/10 || The World is yours, my darling, but the moment is mine!

Well I reckon Jacques Tati had a similar frolics in mind when he despatched “M.

Right from the outset in his glorified jalopy you just know that this has comedic disaster written all over it, and true to expectations that is what we get. His unique style of playing tennis raises murmurs and eyebrows and one has to wonder if the perplexed “Martine” (Nathalie Pascaud) really knows what she is letting herself in for. For the most part the jokes are visible from space, but they still work well thanks to an amiably characterful delivery from Tati and an whole host of supporting folk who could all really be locals - with typically local responses to his haplessness. Thought not quite of the circus variety, the sound effects do much of the work here in supplementing - even replacing - a dialogue that is there when needed, but not so much more prevalent than that in an early Chaplin movie. This also benefits from a much more fluid narrative. It’s not just a join-the-dots style of production, but more an overlapping series of sub-stories that don’t all work, but most of them thrive. Again, like his more reserved British counterparts from the later 1940s, Tati seems to be extolling the virtues of cinematic joy here. Fun for the sake of fun - and it’s quite contagious for an calamity-packed couple of hours."

Plot in a nutshell: An American boat captain wages war against the Nazis in Martinique, with some help along the way from his frequently drunk right-hand man, and his clever girlfriend.

Comments: Lauren Bacall is great, and very beautiful, in her debut.  It's the film where Bogie met Bacall, and they're not acting; they're falling in love.  And we have Walter Brennan, as Bogie's tipsy pal, with his constant drunk ramblings.  

Okay script, a bit slow-moving at times.  It's not Bogie's or Hawks' best, but still not bad.  Overall, I'd say it's worth a watch.

But Roy is finding out that this is a different world to the one he left behind, the one before he entered the Big House for his stretch. There are crooks he's not familiar with and women turning his head, hell even a canine has him at odds with his machismo sensibility, but all of it will come crashing together amongst the magnificent High Sierra!

It's a really funny thing now, you buy two DVDs and they both tell you that the respective film from 1941 is the breakout role for Humphrey Bogart. I am of course referring to both this fabulous film and the equally brilliant Maltese Falcon, what a double that is eh! Truth is, is that both films merely showcase what a talent the great man was, and crucially, that he could imbue his characters with terrific pathos and emotive drive. Here as Roy Earle Bogart gives one of his best 40s performances, this on a CV that has many other great turns. Made to look far more aged than he was (well done Perc Westmore), he manages to make Earle a tough and gritty man, yet at the same time he pulls the audience on side with a hardened professionalism that has us admiring the obvious qualities that reside deep within him.

Directed by directing great Raoul Walsh, scripted by one John Huston, and starring Humphrey Bogart, it's obvious that this take on W.R. Burnett's novel is in safe hands. Playing out as one of the gangster genre's last hurrahs, it's clear to me that some future great Western directors were taking notes, for what drives High Sierra to being so gripping throughout is the man out of his time pulse beats, sensitivity seams through the picture without ever cloying the tension and feel of the pic. The best Adult Westerns coming in the next two decades would grab this thematic arc with genre bolstering aplomb.

Backing up Bogart is the top billed Ida Lupinio (as we would come to expect she's strong and perfect foil to her lead man), while the likes of Alan Curtis, Arthur Kennedy, Henry Hull, Cornel Wilde, Henry Travers and Joan Leslie (badly overacting but amazingly not hurting the production) help to put High Sierra firmly in the drawer that holds classic crime pictures from a golden age. Not just content to be a close look at deep and elegiac characters, High Sierra does not lack in the action department either, in fact Walsh does an incredible job of knitting together heart and gusto for dramatic entertainment purpose. 

Come the finale at Mount Whitney (High Sierra a constant looming presence in the film, a key character}, the thrills have more than catered for the inclined seekers of that particular bent, but ultimately as the credits role, Walsh's camera leaves us in no doubt as to what has driven Roy, and High Sierra, to its point of meaning, leaving us with a special and great movie indeed. 9/10"

Wellman,"saloon, horseback riding, nevada, arbitrary law, theft, justice, lynching, posse, lynch mob, cattle rustling, 19th century","There can't be any such thing as civilisation unless people have a conscience.

The Ox-Bow Incident is directed by William A. Wellman and adapted to screenplay by Lomar Trotti from the novel of the same name written by Walter Van Tilburg Clark. It stars Henry Fonda, Henry Morgan, Dana Andrews, Mary Beth Hughes, Anthony Quinn, William Eythe and Jane Darwell. Music is scored by Cyril J. Mockridge and cinematography by Arthur C. Miller.

Gil Carter & Art Croft ride into the town of Bridger's Wells, they hit the local saloon to imbibe after a log hard cattle drive. Whilst there a man runs in and announces that a popular man from the town has been shot by rustlers. The sheriff is out of town and a lynch mob quickly forms to bring what they see as swift justice to the culprits, Gil & Art join the posse so as to make sure they themselves don't get blamed for the shooting. The posse finds three weary workers and convince the majority that these guys are guilty and that instant hanging is the only way to do things. There are, however, one or two dissenting voices......

What a fabulous movie this is, a powerful indictment of how the lynch mob mentality can grip and lead to pain for many. William Wellman directs superbly, with a big ensemble in such a small area (Ox-Bow), he manages to get the right blend of emotive reactions from the leading players. Henry Fonda as Gill Carter is perfectly sedate and compassionate, even though he is far from being a flawless character, Dana Andrews as Donald Martin is heart achingly real, while others like Frank Conroy as Major Tetley are suitably full of ignorant bluster. It's quite an experience to see Wellman pull them all together with so much style. The photography from Miller is excellent, shadowy low tone black and white that is in keeping with the downbeat nature of the film, it infuses the picture with a gritty hard bitten noirish look. While Mockridge scores it suitably as sombre.

Ultimately it's the story that triumphs the most, claustrophobic in nature, it is simple yet tragic as it spins out to tell us how a group of seemingly sane individuals turned out to be a mass of incoherent reasoning. When a letter is read out during the finale, it is devastating in its effect, we see men broken, heads bowed in shame, others heavy in heart, their lives never to be the same. The emotional whack is hard hitting, and rightly so. For this is unashamedly a message movie, and a worthy one at that, so much so its reputation has grown over the years, where both the film and novel have made it into some educational curriculum's. It's very much a landmark Western, by choosing to forgo action for dark characterisations, it opened up the Western genre to being more than just shoot-outs and trail blazing. Had it been made seven or eight years later I think it would have garnered higher critical praise. 

In spite of being one of Fonda's favourite movies that he made, the film didn't make money. The public were not quite ready for such sombre beats (Orson Welles, tellingly I feel, loved it), the critics of the time were irked by Wellman's decision to film the key trial and lynching sequences on the stage. Yet the closeness this gives the narrative serves it well, thrusting the many characters close together so they, and us, can see the whites of everyone's eyes, this is about focusing on the faces of those about to commit a capital crime. The close confines also gives off a pervasive sense of doom, where pessimism seeps through, there is no short changing here, the makers are dealing in bleakness and the right choices are made to produce one of the finest and most upsetting exponents of mob mentality played out on film. 9/10 || When ""Larry Kincaid"" is shot, the townsfolk rise up and decide to pursue the killers. Led by Confederate officer ""Tetley"" (Frank Conroy) they alight on three folks in the wilderness moving some cattle. It seems that these three had recently been with ""Kincaid"" and so a kangaroo court is duly assembled with a view to lynching them. William Wellman now develops one of the most tautly presented half hours of cinema I've ever seen. The posse have no evidence, but will they be persuaded by the protestations of innocence from ""Martin"" (Dana Andrews) and his companions, including Anthony Quinn's ""Martinez""? The tension is palpable as old man ""Davies"" (Harry Davenport) tries to be the voice of reason and ""Art"" (Harry Morgan) and ""Carter"" (Henry Fonda) wrestle, too, with their consciences. It's a shocking indictment of mob justice, and the dialogue and overall look of the film really build well as what seems inevitable edges nearer and nearer. The ending has a twist that provides food for thought for all concerned (including the audience) and has something of the ""Forgive them father..."" about it, too. Fonda takes top billing, but Conroy's performance is probably the most enthralling - brutality in a finely tailored uniform."

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Vincent Parry has been imprisoned in San Quentin for murdering his wife, he escapes at sets about clearing his name. After being picked up, and then hidden by Irene Jansen (who has followed his case closely), Parry gets a tip from a cab driver which leads him to an underground plastic surgeon. After being given a new face, Parry must keep away from the police and find out just who did in fact kill his wife?

OK, so the plot isn't much to write home about, but the star appeal of the leads and a quite simply brilliant supporting performance lifts this noirish thriller way above average. Humphrey Bogart is Vincent Parry and Lauren Bacall is Irene Jansen, so it's with a tinge of sadness that Dark Passage is considered the weakest film of the four collaborations from the special duo. And though in plot and screenplay that may well be true, I maintain that the sexual chemistry here is as electric as it is in The Big Sleep. Has to be said, though, that both Bacall & Bogart are playing second fiddle to a waspish turn from Agnes Moorehead as Madge Rapf, she ups the ante and grabs the attention span when the film drifts close to a stand still.

The clever camera technique of viewing the events from Vincent's eyes works well for the first third of the film (we never see Vincent's face), but heavy with Bogarts' narration, this loses impact once Vincent gets his new face. The mysterious element to the plot doesn't quite get the jolt that it should because sadly we know it's Bogart from the off, So when the reveal comes about it just falls a little flat. Still, the film works as a more than serviceable thriller, with great acting and a very tidy turn of events in the ending make Dark Passage recommended viewing for noirish thriller fans. 7/10 || Humphrey Bogart spends at least half of Dark Passage heard but not seen. When the movie isn’t shot from his point of view – little more than a gimmick in any day and age, though I guess in 1947 it might have had the benefit of novelty; sort of like a first-person shooter long before first-person shooters –, Bogie’s face is either a shadowy silhouette or wrapped in bandages. The latter is the result of a back-alley plastic surgery, which is itself an oddity since this is an extreme that more often than not only true villains will go to – perhaps because only a truly guilty conscience could bear to part with the face in the mirror.

In this case, however, Vincent Parry (Bogart) is a the victim of a Miscarriage of Justice who sets out to Clear My Name. What happens if he does manage to prove his innocence? Will he then undergo further cosmetic surgery and go back to looking like whatever it was he looked like before? Or will he just go through the rest of his life with a surgically rearranged visage? Something tells me ol’ Vince did not think this through; on the other hand, he could have done a lot worse – like, for instance, Peter Lorre in The Face Behind the Mask.

Of course, for all the good his new face does him, he might as well have kept the old one and saved himself the money and the time – and one could say the same of writer/director Delmer Daves; I mean, what’s the point of getting Bogie (who had by then starred in, among others, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, and The Big Sleep) only to have us play peek-a-boo with him for the first half of the film?"

If you have ever wondered why 'film noir' has been considered such a consistently rewarding and enthralling body of cinematic work, like the earlier 'Pre-Code' era, check this one out, and others of its ilk. A sheerly delightful film that holds up well today.

Though I haven't checked its 80's remake out, I'm not too curious about it, other than the slight curiosity from its notoriety of it being the film in which Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan met and eventually decided to marry.

It also had the stench of studio interference with a confusing plot at least early on and not helped by one-dimensional characters and hammy acting, with Brad Pitt seeming to regret taking the role even if it was early in his career. Kim Basinger as Holli Would was fun, to say the least. And Gabriel Byrne just look confused.

The scenes with animation and live action felt unpolished compared to something like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, however some of the real sets definitely had some interesting aesthetics to them. I don't know, this is one that some might appreciate but for myself I doubt I'd ever revisit. **2.5/5**"

Fellini really does know how to let his stars shine here, and the photography - especially of the visually expressive and engaging Masina works really well with this simple but never straightforward drama. She presents us with a portrayal of a woman of character and as the plot thickens, the delivery of her relationship with the very much on-form Quinn becomes quite compelling to watch. Set amidst the debris of post-war Italy it also reminds us of just how society was struggling to get back onto it's feet, and to move on - even if the largely rural communities featured here had little, if any, prospects of seeing any improvements. The circus isn't a way to riches and comfort - it's rudimentary entertainment for a population that needs momentary distraction and it must travel continuously just to keep the proverbial wolf from it's door. That relentlessness provides us with the potent vehicle for an interesting character study that contrasts the strength and brutishness of one with the subtlety of the others and it looks great too."

Probably most brilliant of all is how the total makes the viewer feel claustrophobic. I admit, though, it's a tad dated. || You might have thought that on May 8th, 1945 the population of Poland would have been united in celebrating the defeat of their Nazi invaders. Instead, though, this film quite deftly illustrates a mixture of joy and trepidation as those who had fought together to free their country now found themselves on opposite sides of a new societal order that was going to pit the freedom-loving Poles on one side with those more Soviet-minded Communists on the other. This polarity is epitomised by ""Maciek"" (Zbigniew Cybulski) and ""Andrzej"" (Adam Pawlikowski) who are charged with getting shot - literally - of the communist leader and new minister ""Szczuka"" (Waclaw Zastrzezynski). They manage to screw their assassination attempt up, though, and innocent people are killed - not the first who die as the infighting between the hitherto allies becomes more violent and potent, with even the strongest of family loyalties severely tested. There's still time for a little romance as ""Maciek"" takes a shine to ""Krystyna"" (Ewa Krzyzewska) and as that burgeons, he yearns for a peaceable life in which to live, work and bring up a family. Thing is, can he just stop caring about the politics and settle, or is it too ingrained in him and by staying, might he actually be endangering that which he has come to love? This is one of the more poignant “winning the peace"" kind of post WWII stories, with the characterisations ripe with contradictions and challenges, and the director (Andrzej Wajda) also taking a broader look at the remnants of Polish society as a whole from which rebuilding is not going to be easy. This previously devout nation is much less though. The people are weary, depressed and all too ready to sink their sorrows and ambitions in a large glass of vodka. On that last point, there's space for a little bitter humour and that largely comes thanks to an on-form Stanislaw Milski and his professorial-looking ""Pieniazek"" and we have some devious jostling for position and privilege in the new order to engage us too. The grimness of their situation is well captured by the stylish, almost eerie at times, photography that prevails throughout this authentic looking drama. History tells us what did happen, indeed what was already happening when this was made in 1958 - and that makes this junction box of political and personal choices all the more compelling to watch. It's essentially about people and ideals, and is well worth a look at."

Based on the novel written by James Bond creator Ian Flemming, this delightful fantasy charts the journey into the mysteriously childless world of Vulgaria by Caractacus Potts, his two children, Truly Scrumptious and super car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

I think the main thing that makes this film work so well is that it has a little of everything to make a successful family movie. Catchy tunes at every turn, a fairy tale kingdom awash with colour, bonkers technology, and a little slice of wickedness involving class distinction. Split very much into two halves, Chitty at its core is really about forming a complete family. We are introduced to Caracatus (Dick Van Dyke) who is a single father, who is doing his best to raise his two children with moral fortitude. It's through the children's love of an old rusty car that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is born, and after pretty lady Truly Scrumptious (a gorgeous Sally Ann Howes) comes into their lives, all four of them enter the second half of the movie after having firmly capturing the audience's attention with a firming promise of a family in waiting.

The second half of the picture then whisks us far away into fantasy territory. Vulagaria is ruled by crackers toy obsessive Baron Bomburst (Gert Fröbe in wonderful bacon sandwich mode), he has banned children, and naturally he has his sights set firmly on the magnificence that is Chitty Chitty. Bomburst sends out his child snatcher to nab Caracatus' kids in the hope of bargaining for the special car. The child snatcher played by Robert Helpman is as iconic as he is terrifying, wonky hat and pointy nose he lures children in with promises of sweets and treacle tarts, he thus became the invader of many a childs poor nightmares for sure.

But this is a family film after all, and sure enough this splendid ride speeds to a joyous finale that is cloaked in colour and feel good eccentricity, yep, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still works on repeat viewings. 8/10 || This was never my favourite musical as child, but as I get older I think I appreciate it more. Sure, it has it's cheesy moments, but there is genuine chemistry between the characters on display here and coupled with some superbly catchy - and often poignant - lyrics from the Sherman twins, we are presented with a really quite enjoyable fable. The Potts family live in a dilapidated farmhouse. Grandfather (Lionel Jeffries); the well meaning but hopeless inventor of a father ""Caractacus"" (Dick Van Dyke) and the two children ""Jeremy"" (Adrian Hall) and ""Jemima"" (Heather Ripley). Luckily, one day the youngsters are nearly run over by ""Truly"" (Sally Ann Howes) the daughter of the wealthy confectioner ""Lord Scrumptious"" (James Robertson Justice). She might just be able to help the father make a few quid from her father with his sweets that double up as pan pipes. Meantime, the family manage to rescue an old rust bucket from the local garage, and lo and behold, enter our eponymous vehicle. It can drive, it can become an aeroplane, an hovercraft - indeed it can do just about everything bar make the tea. It's a must-have prize for the megalomaniac child-hater ""Baron Bomburst"" (Gert Fröbe - who really does enter into the spirit of the story), so the family must fight tooth and nail to stop their car, and themselves, falling into his malevolent hands. Ian Fleming demonstrates great imagination with this and Van Dyke shows off his varied skills well and engagingly. Howes over-cooks her singing at times, but the almost 2½ hours this story takes really does fly by. The Oscar winning ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""; the delightful ""Hushabye Mountain""; ""Me Ol' Bamboo"" and Jeffries' enjoyable rendition of ""Posh!"" as he is gradually drowned in his outhouse all add bundles to this colourful and joyous series of well photographed escapades. Maybe it is wasted on youngsters? It certainly was on me!"

The Butterfly Effect - Directors Cut

The Butterfly Effect is directed by Eric Bress and Bress co-writes the screenplay with J. Mackye Gruber. It stars Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz and Ethan Suplee. Music is by Michael Suby and cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti. 


The title refers to the butterfly effect, the chaos theory of a popular hypothetical situation that illustrates how small initial differences may lead to large unforeseen consequences over time. The plot pitches Kutcher as Evan Treborn who suffers blackouts during critical mments in his life. When older he finds that through reading the journals he has written since a child, that he can go back in time to the significant events and change what happens. Unfortunately each time he does it comes at a great cost...

It was mercilessly kicked by the pro critics upon release, not helped by coming at a time when Kucher was something of a kicking post to critics. To compound the misery for the makers, they released a theatrical cut that featured a quite apalling ending. Inspite of these trevails at the time of release, the pic made a pot load of cash at the box office. Once the Directors Cut surfaced, with a key scene added to cement the different - quality - ending, time has seen the stock of the pic rise considerably. So much so that it currently sits at a 7.6 rating on IMDb and a 75% rating on TMDB, wile there are some critics who have come out and admitted they were too quick to judge the first release back in 2004.

What we have is a time travelling corkscrew narrative that is immensely sombre in telling how ones actions can have far-reaching consequences. It's a compelling and often thrilling picture, one that can spark hearty debate about the thematics at work - notably we the audience being forced to contemplate our own actions in life. The pic demands the utmost attention, switching off for a few minutes is a definite no no. Some scenes linger long in the memory as we trawl through the evil that kids and men do, right up to the unforgettable finale.

There's plot and logic holes, that are small irritants, and even though this definitely could have been better cast with more senior actors, none of the youthful cast members hurt the picture. It packs a punch, that is on proviso you only see the directors cut. 7.5/10 || ""Evan"" (Ashton Kutcher) has had a troubled existence thus far in his young life, and is prone to blackouts. These seem to take chunks of his day away from him as he comes back to a consciousness unaware of what has just taken place, or even where he is! He tries to fill in the gaps by writing in his journal what could have happened then miraculously finds himself back at that exact time and place. It's almost as if these memory lapses were just missing pieces of his jigsaw puzzle that he must go and relive, retrospectively, and infill. The thing is, though, he doesn't readily consider the impact that these additional experiences may have on future events. Basically his actions could change the course of history. It's really his beloved ""Kayleigh"" (Amy Smart) he is determined to keep safe - and that's quite a task as their childhood antics have frequently caused quite a few tragic events and his attempts to reverse these merely seem to create others... Can he square the circle? This is quite a cleverly constructed story that allows Kutcher to prove he's not just a pretty lad. His characterisation of ""Evan"" gradually develops from someone lost in a sea of confusion to a man whose realisation of his predicament is becoming a little more enabling. The nature of the story allows the film to adopt a loosely linked portmanteau style to it - with each episode in is life introducing different characters and scenarios which, so long as he can access his journal, he can escape from should the dangers (and there are quite a few) threaten to overwhelm him. It's not an easy watch - there's violence and bullying a-plenty, but it's a quirkily presented look at the domino effects of human behaviour that does merit a watch."

I ended up with a few conflicting thoughts. One, the movie doesn't necessarily hold up well (in terms of writing, acting, pacing, story, etc.) but in many ways that doesn't matter in terms of whether it's worth watching. It's probably a more important film than it gets credit for. It's hard to understate how groundbreaking this film was for the time, offering  onscreen representation and voice to several underrepresented segments and experiences in society. By today's standards, the romance feels a little Hallmark and Lifetime movie-esque, but in the moment, it was unheard of for a movie like this to have the reach it did with the message it had. I recommend this film to anyone interested in gay cinema, independent cinema, and the journey these industries have taken over the past 30 years."

It's a feel good sports movie based around the true story of Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) who had the unenviable task of leading the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team in the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. Where the all conquering Russian squad were waiting.

We follow Brooks as he assembles a youthful squad then pushes them to the limits, mentally and physically, all while facing pressures in his home life as he gives his all on the ice rinks. If you know your sports history then there's obviously no surprise factor here, but there's good insight into squad dynamics, of coaching and toughness involved in the many facets of high level sport. Russell leads his young cast admirably, while the action scenes during the matches have a kinetic energy that's most impressive. 7/10 || I do love a sports drama, which is fortunate as Disney sure do a lot of them!

<em>'Miracle'</em> is very good, as it details the events of the 1980 Winter Olympics between the hockey teams of the US and the USSR. The constant connections to world events can feel a little forced in parts, but I entirely get what they were going for - it doesn't hamper things at all, anyway.

Kurt Russell is superb as Herb Brooks, he's far and away the best and most interesting character/actor onscreen. Russell nails the role. Elsewhere, Noah Emmerich does a solid job, as do those who portray the players - even if none of them stick in my memory much.

The score is strong, as are most things about this film. It probably goes on for a tad too long, they could've cut thirty minutes without losing anything major. It doesn't drag though, to its credit.

In conclusion, this 2004 production is 100% worth a watch."

Until the very end, I'm not sure the ongoing civil disobedience has much to do with this, indeed I thought maybe that was a way of trying to add some intellectual gravitas to a narrative that is often thinly contrived and consists largely of what would have to be described as soft-porn. It's shocking at times, but the characters are completely undercooked with Garell, especially, having little to do except gradually come to resent the burgeoning sexual relationship developing between his sister and the stranger.

It’s one of the first times I remember feeling “seen” in media as a young person that was starting to struggle with mental illness.

It’s not a perfect movie, and I think some of the scenes shouldn’t have really been graphically shown like they were bearing in mind that this is a movie directed at teenagers. However, that is a reality for some people, and I do understand the inclusion.

Overall though, this movie does a great job at depicting what it’s like to develop a mental illness and troubled family dynamics and how a mental illness can develop in a situation like that. Evan Rachel Wood gives such a fantastic performance as Tracy at such a young age.

I first saw this movie when I was about twelve or thirteen, and although it doesn’t hold quite the same amount of relatability for me that it did then, it still holds up for me close to ten years later. I’m glad it exists and depicts a painful reality, but being able to find something to relate to in that painful reality and that makes you feel “seen” can be something that’s helpful. || Jeez! <em>'Thirteen'</em> gets deep!

I picked this one out on a whim on Prime Video, having known absolutely zilch about it... even after I checked a few minor things about it (checking to see if it has a sequel or whatever, as I do for any film I watch) I was expecting a simple, cliché teen story. I did catch a glimpse of one of Prime's images for it and it looked dramatic, but I just imagined it was the character's overreaction to getting dumped or something silly like that. It wasn't!

Even so, across the opening chunk of the movie I was still anticipating the aforementioned. Yet, from just prior to the midway point really, things get deeper by the minute - not long later, I was genuinely hooked. It's a great film. I guess that's why you don't judge a book by its cover and all that, and why I don't read about flicks before watching them - I love being surprised!

The performances are truly excellent, none more so than that of Evan Rachel Wood - superb! Nikki Reed (even though I kept seeing Charisma Carpenter...) gives a strong showing too, as does Holly Hunter (even though I kept hearing Mrs. Incredible...). Wood and Hunter particularly earn their stripes across the second half. Credit to the rest of them too, including Jeremy Sisto. Feature debutant Vanessa Hudgens is squeezed in there too.

If I hadn't had noticed in my checks beforehand that this shared the same director as <em>'Twilight'</em>, I'm pretty sure I would've known instantly with this - a clear style, notably at the beginning, if a tad questionable in minor moments. I'm clearly not the target of either film, yet enjoyed both - what can I say? Forza, Catherine Hardwicke!"

Two women. Catherine marries men for their money, then murders them. The other, Alexandra Barnes is on her tail, getting in close to hopefully expose her crimes...

Rafelson's neo-noir homages the film noir femme fatales of the 40s and 50s with a high degree of success. There's much potency in the screenplay that puts it firmly in the noir universe. Flip flopping the misogyny angles of yesteryear, pic pitches the ultimate femme fatale destroyer of men into a cat and mouse scenario with a sexually repressed opponent - or is she a jealous but secret admirer? The transformation of Winger's dowdy Justice Department Agent into a blossoming lady at Catherine Black Widow's (Russell super sexy and sensuous) side brings in the doppelgänger effect, a good old noir staple. The sexual tension is a constant, particularly when Paul Nuytten (Sami Frey) is brought into proceedings, something which shifts the piece still further into noirville.

There's also other characters straight out of film noir. Be it Alexandra's boss (the always reliable Terry O'Quinn), who's a lech harbouring desires for Alex, or sleazy Private Investigator H Shin (James Hong) who has a needle habit, it's clear that Rafelson and Bass know their noir. Unfortunately most of the play is in daylight, meaning missed opportunities for some psychological shadow play is passed up. Though it should be noted that Hall's photography is slick and tonally in tune, especially when lighting scenes involving Russell as prime focus. It all builds to a splendid finale, the makers pulling us both ways as to where it will lead. Sure, some of the plot devices are weak, but in the main this is sexy, intriguing and tricksy in narrative, whilst tech credits stay at the higher end of the scale. 7/10 || ""Black Widow"" belongs in the category which seems to be attempting to recapture and recreate the classic film noir of the 1940's (this impression is subtly reinforced here by Michael Small's suitably evocative musical score). We first had ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1981) and then this was followed by the explicit - and subsequently divisive - sexuality of ""Body Heat"" (1981), but it is ""Black Widow"" which successfully comes the closest to achieving the incomparable quality to be found in that glorious by-gone cinematic era. It is a wholly compelling and extremely well constructed film which features some beautiful locations (especially those in exqusite Hawaii) that are absolutely breathtaking (replete as they are with even an impressive volcano eruption at one point) and some gorgeously photographed underwater sequences which must surely be every travel agent's ultimate dream."

At the beginning of the 16th century in plague-ridden Western Europe an uncouth band of lawless mercenaries led by the charismatic Martin (Rutger Hauer) kidnap a virgin noblewoman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) as revenge against a double-dealing Lord (Fernando Hilbeck). The tough commoners hole up in a small castle while the Lord’s son, Steven (Tom Burlinson), tries to save his betrothed (Leigh) with his militia.

While the events in ""Flesh+Blood"" (1985) take place just after the medieval period, it could be categorized as a medieval flick. It takes the general setting & color of “The Last Valley” (1971) and mixes-in the music & tone of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) with genius Basil Poledouris scoring both (although this score is nowhere near as notable). The film’s brutal grit and vulgarities influenced “Rob Roy” (1994) and the hole-up-in-a-castle plot was recycled in “Iron Clad” (2011). If you favor any of these movies you’ll probably appreciate ""Flesh+Blood” despite some overdone elements, like Susan Tyrrell’s verging-on-lunatic performance.

There are two conflicting factions: The nobles & their knights and the armed “commoners,” but neither are portrayed as the “good guys” and “bad guys.” Martin, for instance, is a bold and charismatic alpha male, but he’s also kind of scum; sorta the best of the worst. Steven easily stands out as the most gallant individual, but when he doesn’t get his way he pompously threatens retired-knight Hawkwood (Jack Thompson). At the end of the day this is a unique, adult-oriented film about using your natural gifts, including your wit & body, to survive in a barbaric disease-ridden reality. Memorable moments abound.

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot entirely in Spain. The Castilla-La Mancha was also used in El Cid (1961).

GRADE: B || The supporting characters make this a classic.
Most classic films are that way.
This tale of Middle Ages blood and gore and survival is quite epic. Paul Verhoeven directs, so we can expect the ""in your face"" style that he's best at doing. 
There isn't the comic relief that you get in a lot of his movies. This is hard nosed action and blood.
I guess that's why it's ""Flesh+Blood"".
The romantic triangle are aging warrior Martin (Rutger Hauer), the plain blueblood virgin Agnes (Jennifer Leigh, who usually isn't this plain), and the nobleman's son, Steven (Tom Burlinson).
We get hints that Steven is heroic at first, compared to his wicked father who cheats his soldiers and does what he can for money.
Steven is a scholar who we are supposed to care about because he reads. Well, he quickly becomes a monster worse than his father. 
Martin actually works for the cardinal. In the Middle Ages, cardinals had little to do with ""Jesus"", and more to do with the estate of the church. Somehow, this cardinal is on the road, and cardinals were mercantile people, not religious people. They often kept small armies or bodyguards.
This cardinal has some very expert warriors. In fact, the most likable characters in the film are a pair of homosexual soldiers who bring sanity and reason to the antics of Martin and his chief rival of the soldiers, Summer. There is one other soldier, who is older yet than Martin, and is also a very likable character.
The women in the party with the cardinal and his soldiers are all much more gorgeous than Agnes, probably a statement about the blue blood royalty. The hottest girl of the group is also the most emotional, ready to satisfy the lusts of soldiers, and later weeping with the cardinal in remorse for her sins.
They become quarry for Steven when they attack him and his home grown soldiers, who are basically just peons who are enlisted without training. The cardinal has declared Martin their leader by a supernatural decree. Martin kidnaps Agnes, and Agnes pleads for him to be her only lover, and not let Summer touch her.
Martin gets involved with Agnes, who plays both ends against the middle. Steven chases them, with the help of the most interesting character on his team, Hawkwood.
One of the sidebars here is the medical practice of the day. A cleric doctor of the time finds that plague has entered the camp, and his backwards medicine is no match for the plague.
The characters are what make this a classic, as the two forces face off against each other. You'll likely find yourself caring more about the supporting characters like Hawkwood and the two homosexual soldiers and the ""mother"" than the major characters. And that's why this film is so special. || The Lord ""Arnolfini"" (Fernando Hilbeck) makes quite a misjudgement when he promises a fortune to mercenary leader ""Martin"" (Rutger Hauer) if he agrees to help him retake his castle, only to renege on the deal. ""Martin"" and his merry band duly attack a caravan that is carrying his son ""Steven"" (Tom Burlinson) and fiancée ""Agnes"" (Jennifer Jason Leigh). She is brutally raped by the men, with the complicity of their leader who quickly claims her as his own. Their travels take them to a castle which they decide to capture, but what they don't realise is that the army of their former employer is giving chase. If he succeeds in catching up with them, then we might be in for quite a lively siege. This is quite a fun drama with plenty of earthy, even bawdy, action scenes that depict quite plausibly just how a marauding band of 16th century adventurers might have behaved. There's some enjoyable science from the young ""Steven"" who's quite adept at some sophisticated engineering and with explosives, JJL enters into the spirit of things quiet enthusiastically and Hauer is exactly the same as he is in ""Ladyhawke"" - also from this year, as his less is more dialogue delivery is coupled with a screen presence that only he could deliver. It's a bit on the long side, but there's plenty of action once it gets going and loads of frying pan to fire scenarios for everyone to escape from. It's got the look of a spaghetti fantasy to it, and though maybe just a bit too repetitive, I quite enjoyed it."

Lee Thompson,"treasure, based on novel or book, africa, riddle, giant spider, treasure hunt, disappearance, quicksand, archaeologist, archeology, allan quatermain","_**No-holds-barred send-up of Indiana Jones with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone**_

In the early 1900s a beautiful blonde, Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone), hires white hunter/adventurer Allan Quartermain (Richard Chamberlain) to find her father who went missing during his expedition to find the fabled King Solomon’s Mines in southeast Africa. Herbert Lom and John Rhys-Davies are on hand as heavies.   

Many moons ago I saw clips of “King Solomon’s Mines” (1985) and wrote it off as a campy knockoff of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), which of course was hugely successful and inspired several immediate imitations, like “Romancing the Stone” (1984) and “Firewalker” (1986). I thankfully finally decided to give it a chance because, while it IS a knockoff of “Raiders,” it’s the best I’ve seen so far. It’s at least as entertaining as “The Mummy” (1999), albeit not a blockbuster like that film.

Before you check it out, you have to be braced for a Grade B send-up with the corresponding preposterous frolics. Yes, it’s like Indiana Jones, but more over-the-top with a lower budget. If you can get on board, this is a wildly entertaining fun-adventure flick that’s colorful, cartoonish and thrilling with impressive African locations. It bends over backwards to amuse with Victoria Falls, jungle portages, market-place romps, steam-engine escapades, wild animals (lions, crocs, snakes and a colossal spider), threatening cannibals, a hideous witch-queen, deadly swamps, hellish caves and more. I should add that the spider is only a few notches above the ultra-cheese you’d see on Gilligan’s Island.     

On the female front, Stone is stunning before she became famous and I’m not even a fan. The creators don’t fail to display her beauty in a tasteful way as her shorts get shorter and shorter. She has magnificent legs.       

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Zimbabwe.

GRADE: B+ || H. Rider Haggard's ""She"" and ""King Solomon's Mines"" novels have proved the inspiration for loads of action adventures over the years, but I doubt even he would appreciate this derivative effort. In a style that's more akin to ""Carry on Quatermain"", we meet ""Jesse"" (Sharon Stone) who is trying to track down her lost long father. He set off into the jungles of ancient Sheba trying to find the legendary mines full of jewels. She engages the help of the legendary hunter ""Quatermain"" (Richard Chamberlain) and off they set on their quest. Meantime, the megalomanic Bosch colonel ""Bockner"" (Herbert Lom) has engaged the services of the duplicitous ""Dogati"" (John Rhys-Davies) for exactly the same purpose - and so it's a race! To be fair to Chamberlain, though a hero in the style of Stewart Granger, Harrison Ford or Sir Cedric Hardwicke he isn't, he does look like he's enjoying himself here in this mess of film as he chucks his dynamite hither and tither. Lom is also hamming it up as if he were back in his full ""Pink Panther"" pomp, but it's Stone who really let's the side down. She just doesn't seem to enter into the spirit of this romp at all enthusiastically. She's not got the enthusiasm of a Karen Allen nor the slightly aloof dignity of a Deborah Kerr and really contributes very little. JR-D is always in hIs element with these kind of roles and takes to it like a croc to water; a considerably more animated one than the actual ones we see that mix archive ferociousness with real time valerian. It hits the ground running with loads of adventures, but the CGI is pretty obvious before a denouement that's just crying out for a song. It's entertaining, in a perverted sort of fashion, but could never be described as good."

Raw Deal is directed by John Irvin and written by Luciano Vincenzoni, Sergio Donati, Gary DeVore and Norman Wexler. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kathryn Harrold, Sam Wanamaker, Paul Shenar, Robert Davi and Ed Lauter. 

A former FBI agent turned small-town sheriff agrees to help the FBI chief infiltrate the Chicago mafia when the FBI chief's son is killed by them. 

Something of a forgotten Schwarzenegger vehicle, it's for sure one of his lesser lights from his 80s output, but there's enough brawn and bonkers machismo to make it a fun time viewing. Arnie has been scripted with some trade mark phrases and director John Irvin (Hamburger Hill) stages some exciting action set-pieces.

The first 70-90 minutes of <em>'Follow Me, Boys!'</em> is excellent, it's serious yet amusing. I felt connected to the characters and their storyline. Unfortunately, the film then adds on a pointless if solid extra 40-60 minutes. It kinda feels like one of those TV episodes into one film things, which is annoying as it doesn't need to do it.

Fred MacMurray is terrific as Lem, especially across that opening period. It's heartwarming seeing his character help out a community of kids, particularly one - Whitey, who is played impressively by Kurt Russell. All of the other child actors, while not massively memorable, are fine and you really feel for their overall story.

The final portion of this film really hampers it though. It isn't actually anything bad and if it had been a sequel I reckon I would've liked it, but as a continuation/add-on to the earlier premise it doesn't hit the same heartfelt notes at all. So that's disappointing, but it's still just about a good film."

Mr Charles Chipping is a very shy young man, he starts teaching at Brookfield, an all boys English school. His early days at the school don't go very well at all, after coming close to losing his job he goes too far by way of discipline and costs the school dearly by way of a sporting tradition. It seems that all the school is against him, be it the children or his fellow teachers, Mr Chipping can't do right for doing wrong. Whilst taking a holiday in the Austrian Alps, Chipping meets Katherine Ellis, from there his life and general manner will change dramatically - for the better.

Goodbye Mr Chips just oozes classic status, from every single frame you get a wonderful vibe that takes you back to a time when innocence was all we had. I think that Goodbye Mr Chips surely touches most people? Maybe some folk in their make up have no time for such sweet sentimentality? But just maybe those people could do far worse than letting Mr Chips into their lives. It has taken me nigh on 30 years to actually get around to watching this film in its entirety, and having sat through it recently I feel rewarded beyond what I had originally hoped for. From the bumbling fear that Mr Chipping shows in the opening reel, to the closing scene that brings the whole damn film to its wonderful point, Goodbye Mr Chips is a truly beautiful, charming and joyous picture.

Of all the Oscars that have been given over the years, Robert Donat's is one of the most deserved. It's a performance that fuses all the emotional traits required to outlay a character that's finding itself, be it shy and retiring, or a man driven by a willingness to succeed, Robert Donat layers this turn to such a point that it may well be a 30s standard. Greer Garson only has something like 20 minutes of screen time, but as 20 minute performances go - well it leaves a long and special impression. There is a scene as Donat and Garson dance with carefree abandon, this alone makes the film worth watching. Still, a film is only as good as its ending, and it's here that Goodbye Mr Chips delivers the crown to its royal subject, an ending that ties up all the emotional strings that make for a wonderful film. So if you haven't got a warm glow come the final credit? Well there is no hope for you really.

Thank you Mr Starkey and Mr Lowry, this film reminded me of your good teachings many years ago in my primary school years. 9/10 || What a gorgeous, gentle, film about the end of empire and of an era that showed a culture of respect and deference that has now long since vanished. Robert Donat always managed to portray the quintessential Englishman well - if, at times, in a little overly stilted fashion; and with Greer Garson's beautiful representation of a lady of the times this leaves us with a slightly warm feeling. Certainly, it doesn't not promote any equality amongst the sexes, but the ""Blue Danube"" scene has to be amongst the most romantic ever committed to film."

Ultimately this movie is fun: cheap teen girl drama fun, but fun.  Lindsey Lohan has some competent cast to share the load in this, particularly Alison Pill (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Cooties), an under rated actress, and Megan Fox (Jennifer's Body) playing the Rachel McAdams (Meangirls) of the movie.

I understand that location shooting can get expensive, but the movie looks over all well produced, and while the premise is rather annoying, the writing looks fairly solid, if character driven:  not a bad thing, but it usually makes for more interesting tidbits as opposed to an epic a plot line, which was....different depending upon what angle you take.

There are good technical things, great character things, and decent story things here: it's not a bad movie, it's just not one I'm going to tell you to go see over so many other titles. || I actually quite liked it for the first half, but by time the credits arrived I was very much awaiting the end.

<em>'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen'</em> has a few things going in its favour. Lindsay Lohan is very good, she definitely makes her character more interesting than she probably would've been without Lohan. You also have Megan Fox in her first sizeable film role, it's actually kinda odd seeing those two together onscreen for some reason.

Away from them, I enjoyed the editing and cinematography for the most part. I'm not saying it's anything insane or memorable but it's better than I would've predicted. The premise isn't the most clearly defined, at least in terms of its execution; it starts to drag from the midway point. It hits a fair amount of clichés too, though does avoid a few also; Lola (Lohan) doesn't instantly befriend Carla (Fox), for one.

Nothing dreadful, it just got boring as it went on; despite a low run time of 89 minutes. Lohan the star."

Until, that is, you remember that this is a story that has been told several times - not least in the bible, and so actually the language of the dialogue doesn't really matter so much. Once I was over that, I was rather impressed by the standard of production presented here by Mel Gibson. Jim Caviezel has a wonderful vulnerability and potency in his portrayal of the last day spent by Jesus before his crucifixion. The cinematography is very good, as is the glorious attention to detail with the costumes and settings rich and authentic to behold. The last half hour demonstrates a degree of brutality that is very difficult to watch but somehow that, too, enhances the plausibility of this speculative depiction of events. The supporting cast of relatively unknown talent work well to generate a sense of the inevitability of the proceedings and John Debney's score is rousing and effective too. It does play a little bit fast and loose with the text of the bible, and the very graphic nature of the lives (and loves!) of some of the characters - and their flaws - is provocative and challenges the more traditional (i.e. Cecil B. de Mille) interpretations of this ultimate example of man's inhumanity to man. It is far too long, though. It really does take it's time to get going - perhaps expending a little too much effort on scenario development for subjects that most of us already know (regardless of our own personal faith). At times the direction is also a little bit heavy-handed. It forces us to accept the conclusions drawn by the screenplay, rather than allow us much scope to evaluate, even judge, the unfolding events for ourselves. That said, Gibson has not delivered anything elegiac here, he successfully offers us something illustrating the warts and all existence of biblical-time, Roman occupied, Judea and it is well worth a watch. || **_The Suffering of The Christ_**

Helmed by Mel Gibson, “The Passion of the Christ” (2004) details the excruciating last 12 hours of the life of Jesus (Yeshua) Christ as detailed in the Bible, as well as various devotional writings. Jim Caviezel stars in the eponymous role and it’s hard to imagine a more fitting person in the part. Also notable are Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Hristo Naumov Shopov as Pontius Pilate and Jarreth Merz as Simon of Cyrene.

Obviously, this isn’t a fun movie. You have to be braced for it, as it’s shocking in a reverent way. This explains why one critic denounced it as ""a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie."" Nevertheless, it artistically brings to life that particular turning point in history and gives the viewer a great visual of what went down. Christ’s death appeased God’s just wrath in a substitutionary sense and opened the door to immortality and eternal life, as noted in Romans 6:23 and 2 Timothy 1:10.

Research the evidence and decide for yourself whether this is historical fact or just myth.

The film was shot entirely in Italy.

I was expecting a rather tame and boring return to the world of <em>'Dirty Dancing'</em>, though it actually produces a fine dance romance flick. Of course compared to the excellent and far superior original it is a downgrade, but for what it is I had a decent time watching.

Romola Garai and Diego Luna have solid enough chemistry onscreen, while John Slattery offers firm support. Sela Ward is alright, not helped by how the makers chose to portray her character - Jeannie becomes quite irredeemable at one point, with the film's attempts to 'fix' that totally failing to convince. That's about it for cast positives, though it was neat to see a familiar face from the 1987 flick appear.

The dance and Cuban revolution parts of the story don't mesh amazingly, a bit forced perhaps, but all in all I'd say they just narrowly made it work. I will say the dancing numbers and soundtrack aren't as good as they could've/should've been, yet I did still appreciate a few bits of music: the intro piece and the use of Wyclef Jean's <em>'Dance Like This'</em>, I never knew until now that that latter track was the original of Shakira's <em>'Hips Don't Lie'</em> - you learn something new every day!"

Right off the bat the cast list boasts weighty worth, giving us the promise of a dramatic thriller, filmed on location in Frisco, with misty lenses, lamp lights, waterside moods etc, it's set up a treat. As is the premise...

Ashley Judd stars as a newly promoted hot-shot police detective, who in quality noir traditions has a whole heap of problems going on. Her family back story is shattering, she herself is heavily reliant on alcohol and she likes casual sex with strangers, strangers who start turning up dead, the kicker of which sees her basically investigating herself as a the prime suspect! Unfortunately with everything in place the pic never shifts out of first gear. The red herrings stack up, but nothing with any real conviction, and the whole premise starts to get monotonous, worse still the big reveal really isn't a surprise. There was a raft of these type of films in the 80s and 90s that were done much better, and on completion of viewing this effort one hankers for those pics - not to mention for the film noir of old!

Ashley Judd always frustrates, one can see a very good actress in her body of work, but she's more often than not starring in so so thrillers. It can possibly argued that her co-star Andy Garcia is a great actor who hasn't reached the heights he should have, the days of The Untouchables and Godfather III seeming to be fleeting glimpses of talent. Here he gets a thankless role that's poorly written, while both Samuel L. Jackson and David Strathairn add nice touches but aren't asked to extend themselves. Directed by Phillip Kaufman who as with Rising Sun, here also looks out of his comfort zone with the genre. But the presence of Mulholland Dr DOP Peter Deming is noticeable and one of the pics strengths. 5/10"

It also doesn’t shy away from addressing the issues facing a population that had hitherto relied up the state for so much, and that now had to fend for itself in a much more obvious dog-eat-dog fashion. This is especially exemplified when their currency is to be merged with the Deutsch Mark and they can’t find her savings! By creating such ridiculous scenarios, this quite comically shows up the absurdity of dogmatic politics and, to a certain extent, of family too and Bernd Lichtenburg’s sharp script gives just about everyone some powerfully natural dialogue to make us laugh and think.

A different kind of western that takes place in the original timeline of the cowboy culture which is the late 19th century. But the film has only one cowboy, because of where the story sets in. This film came straight after LOTR. Viggo Mortensen was good and his stunts were excellent. The initial parts that commence in America was heartbreaking and I liked the conclusion as well.

Le Corbeau is directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and co-written by Clouzot and Henri Chavance. It stars Pierre Fresnay, Ginette Leclerc, Pierre Larquey and Micheline Francey. Music is by Tony Aubin and cinematography by Nicolas Hayer.

We are in a small French town, the actual name of which is not known and is inconsequential. A series of poison pen letters are being sent out to the town dignitaries, accusing them of all sorts of inappropriate operations. The letters are signed by someone calling themselves Le Corbeau (The Raven), and pretty soon the town starts to implode as suspicion and mistrust runs wild.

Clouzot and Chavance tap into the troubling fallibility of the human race, portraying a town quickly submerged in moral decay.

Shadows feature prominently, even in daylight, canted angles are used to great effect, broken mirrors perfectly imbuing the fractures of the human psyche. A number of scenes are startlingly memorable, a funeral procession and a church service interrupted by one of The Raven's letters are superbly staged, the pursuit of a nurse through the cobbled streets is menacing, and the finale is hauntingly raw.

All in all, a remarkable, fascinating and potent piece of cinema. 9/10 || Made in France slap bang in the middle of WWII, this is a gripping tale of small town mentality and duplicity. Some character called ""The Raven"" is sending some pretty nasty poisoned-pen letters to the folks in the village of 'St. Robin"". It's the local doctor ""Germain"" (Pierre Fresnay) who is bearing the brunt of these accusatory missives - mainly suggesting that he is having an illicit affair with ""Laura"" (Micheline Francey) who is married to the local shrink ""Vorzet"" (Pierre Larquey). As these letters become more and more widespread, and toxic, a tragedy ensues that focusses everyone's attention on tracking down the culprit - and that process exposes all sorts of crimes and misdemeanours. Principal amongst the suspects is the ailing (or hypochondriac) ""Denise"" (Ginatte leclerc) who does rather steal the show as her machinations seem to make her the obvious candidate. Is she though? Fresnay is also on great form here as the slightly aloof doctor and we gradually realise that just about nobody in this village is whom they purport to be. Henri-Georges Clouzot cleverly manipulates the cast of characters - and the audience - for ninety minutes of an intrigue that thinly disguises a degree of political commentary of Vichy France tempered with a good old-fashioned mystery that would have challenged ""Sherlock Holmes"". The denoument is all a wee bit rushed and slightly abrupt, but the build up is internecine and engaging and this is well worth a watch."

Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train. What he doesn't realise is that Candy is carrying top secret microfilm, microfilm that is of high interest to many many organisations.

Director Samuel Fuller has crafted an exceptional drama set amongst the seedy underworld of New York City. Communist spies and shady government operatives all blend together to make Pickup On South Street a riveting viewing from first minute to the last. Based around a Dwight Taylor story called ""Blaze Of Glory"", Fuller infused this adaptation with a heavy set political agenda, something that many at the time felt was over done, but to only focus on the anti communist leanings is doing it a big disservice.

Digging a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as any that Fuller has directed. The main protagonist for one is the hero of the piece, a crook and a shallow human being, his heroics are not born out of love for his country, they are born out of his sheer stubborn streak. It's quite an achievement that Fuller has crafted one of the best anti heroes of the 1950s, and I'm sure he was most grateful to the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy. Widmark is all grin and icy cold heart, his interplay with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent and is the film's heart. However, it is the Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter who takes the acting honours, her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired warmth to her that Ritter conveys majestically.

It's a ""B"" movie in texture but an ""A"" film in execution, Pickup On South Street is a real classy and entertaining film that is one of the best from its most intriguing director. 9/10 || Richard Widmark is quite effective in this quickly paced espionage thriller. He's a petty thief whom we see lifting something from a woman's purse on a busy subway train. He's not the only one watching her, though, and as he makes his exit he narrowly avoids capture the police. Why are others watching this woman? Well it turns out that she is suspected of passing secrets to the communists and that the police reckon the purse purse contains evidence. Of course, ""Skip"" (Widmark) knows nothing of this but is soon working with the authorities to find ""Candy"" (Jean Peters), trace her compatriots and thwart the deceit. Thelma Ritter always adds value - if perhaps not versatility - and it features a tightly knit supporting cast as Samuel Fuller keeps the dialogue focussed and the pace deft before quite an exciting ending. It does play a little to cold war politics and paranoia, but it's still a superior cat and mouse thriller well worth a watch."

""Alma"" (Bibi Andersson) arrives and soon comes to believe that the silence of her charge is her choice. She simply doesn't want to talk! Devoid of visitors, ""Alma"" constantly chatters to ""Elisabeth"" and a bond starts to develop between the two, outwardly profoundly different, women that challenges both of their preconceived ideas of the other. The latter is keen to emulate the former, the former is ultimately keen to prevent her new friend from doing precisely that. Why? What might have caused ""Elisabeth"" to take such an impenetrable refuge? Essentially this two hander is a monologue; there is precious little by way of contribution from anyone else as the characterisations intensify and the story becomes one of attrition, to an extent, but of cruelty - and of evaluating the sources and causes of cruelty, as well as providing us with a poignantly sensitive look at intimacy and maybe even optimism. I'm certain that there are other depths and allegorical aspects to this that I didn't necessarily appreciate, but unlike with many of this director's films, I found the personas represented here to have more relevance and humanity that in many of his previous works. Coupled with the condensed nature of the storytelling, a strongly complementary score and some effective outdoor cinematography this makes for a compelling film to watch."

I always like the 80s films, because that's the time the teen films were revolutionised. I did not know this film's existence, also not knew 'She's the Man' was its remake. Very enjoyable comedy flick. It was not a flawless film, but they were minimised. This is the story of Terry, a senior high school girl who after failed to get her desired summer job at a local press, she decides to reapply for the internship disguised as a boy with the help of her little brother. The rest follows what she's going to achieve from her new getup.

I really don't know any of these actors, but I liked them all, especially the lead actress. As I have seen many similar films, I don't think it failed to get my attention. So 80s, I mean very impressive like usual with slow and steady narration. You should not compare it to the present teen films. It was not just a different era film, but smartly highlighted the trend among the high school kids of the 80s. Particularly like the relationship and sexually perspectives, though not that strong contents.

I don't think everybody would like it, especially the todays youngsters, but surely the 80s and the 90s guys would enjoy it. I was not even born when it came out, though I feel my generation was very close to it than the present. If you have not seen many films like this theme, you should try it, but watch out for the slow story progression. That's the only thing that might disappoint the viewers, but if you are okay with that, then it is a better film than you would have anticipated.

_7/10_ || ***A popular girl masquerades as a new male student and it naturally presents amusing problems*** 

Terry, a teenager in Phoenix (Joyce Hyser), feels she has no choice but to become a male student in order to compete in a journalistic contest at her high school. Clayton Rohner plays her new best friend (Rick) once she’s a “guy” while Billy Jayne plays her annoyingly superficial brother (Buddy). William Zabka (Greg) appears as the antagonist (you might remember him in the same role a year earlier in “The Karate Kid”). Toni Hudson (Denise) and Sherilyn Fenn (Sandy) are also on hand.

“Just One of the Guys” (1985) is a fun 80’s teen flick that’s superior to overrated crap like “The Breakfast Club” (1985) but not great like “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” (1982) or “The Karate Kid” (1984). I’d put it on par with “Can’t Buy Me Love” (1987); both have a glaring campy side (unlike those other three) and were shot in Arizona.

Hyser was great for the role because she looks stunning in a bikini, but also passes well for a dude when made-up appropriately. This is no small feat when you consider how filmmakers failed to do this is the serious Western “The Ballad of Little Jo” (1993).  

The film runs 1 hour and 40 minutes and was shot in Arizona: Phoenix (Terry & Buddy's House and the caves), Scottsdale (school) Tempe (Big Surf).

It's actually a film that shows both the good and bad sides of Johnny Depp and Stephen King adaptations to film form.

Depp plays a writer who whilst going through a divorce and living out in the country in isolation, is suddenly menaced by John Turturo, who claims he is the victim of plagiarism perpetrated by Depp. Mysteries and murky shenanigans to follow...

That the film, in spite of its flimsy heart, is watchable, is down to the two stars, both are filing in for eccentricities and spooky menace respectively. Yet it's a bit of a one trick pony and difficult to take seriously, while it's also surprisingly bloodless, negating the interest of the potential Stephen King blood-lust crowd. The reveal is something of a cheat given what has gone before, belief of suspension is so stretched to breaking point, you literally should be wondering just what all other characters were doing in the film?!

Still, Johnny and John, resplendent with weird hats and hairdo's, give good camera time and save David Koepp's movie from stinker damnation. 6/10 || **A successful writer who accused of plagiarism.**

It was based on the novel, though the original title makes more sense than this film. Maybe they wanted to avert the spoiler. But I don't think it would have affected much, because the twist comes at the final segment. The tale of a writer who is in the middle of divorce and now living alone is the lake house got threatened by a stranger, because according to him he stole his story. Followed by many unpleasant events, how he gets out of the trouble told in the next half.

Feels just an okay kind. Though Johnny Depp was good. The suspense was good, particularly in the first half, but later it comes falling down. The second half was average, the twist was not interesting enough. After some point, you might predict it, but the point is it was too familiar. I especially did not like the finale, it was like not in detail. Still a watchable film, because of the actor and for decently made. So I think worth a watch if you keep a low expectation.

_6/10_ || Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

This is a great mystery / psychological thriller, but most of what makes it interesting is a spoiler.

They do a great job of creating the tension, or Johnny Depp does, as he's alone on screen for about half the movie.  The rest of the cast is excellent and gives exactly what is needed to bring the movie, and the audience, to a natural conclusion."

You must've heard the priest say something about life and death.

George Romero fans feared the worst, another one of his sacred original zombie trilogy films was being remade, this even though the remake of Night of the Living Dead didn't disgrace itself. As it happened, the fears were unfounded, for Zack Snyder and his team crafted one of the best horror remakes going.

The premise follows Romero's wonderful version, a mysterious epidemic is causing the populace to turn into undead zombies, the bite of which transfers the illness to another. A small group of survivors make it to the Crossroads Mall and hole up there whilst trying to keep at bay the zombie hordes, but inner fighting threatens the group whilst they know they can't stay there for ever.

Right from the off the film grabs you around the throat, it's a blistering and terrifying opening which brings heartbreak and terror in equal measure. It also announces to us that these zombies are different to Romero's, these suckers can run, and run fast. After some chaos and blood, the introductions to our survivors is set up and the pic settles into a superb group dynamic situation, where machismo and brains meet dumb and dumber, all while little devilish moments trickle away in the background.

It's the focus on the survivors that really lifts it to greater heights, how they variously react to their plight, there's good thought gone into the screenplay (James Gunn). The natural progression of this type of film calls for horror moments, and Snyder deftly slots them in when the pic needs them, which again brings about scenes of terror and genuine heartbreaking moments. Some neat cameos will be cheered by fans of Romero's work, while the cast are superb here, with Sarah Polley the standout fulfilling the believable promise of the character as written.

A remake that is its own beast yet still pays homage to what inspired it, and good at both! Now that's a rare thing in horror! 8/10 || Great watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend.

Granted, if you're not a zombie fan, you're probably not even considering this one.  Then you have the great argument about infection vectors (this is pretty classic, bite infection transfer), and slow vs fast (this movie is fast) zombies.  I'm basically just pointing out why we can't have nice things, people argue about it.

This has a great cast: Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley and Jake Weber in particular.  The production value was definitely present, and not just in renting a mall to trash, or even just the zombie practical effects.

The large scale scenes look amazing, and the details on the various infections are fascinating to watch.  And sure, there is lots of quality gunfire (foley is good) and shooting zombies for people you are just in it for the action.  While it's actually got some good (if dark at times) humor to it, it's not ""Warm Bodies"".

Of course the presence of zombies / apocalyptic situation / lack of central authority gives us great philosophical opportunity to discuss what life means and see how people behave, but this leans more towards survival strategy aspects.

If anything, I think that is where the ""flaw"" is in this movie: (most of) the characters are relatively competent so it detours some from typical movie formula relying on the characters to make mistakes to progress the story, but more of there is just a hopeless unending storm of bad things happening to them, it's honestly a little refreshing.

This is probably one of my favorite zombie movies, and I don't even like running zombies. || Awesome awesome movie. Loved this movie since the first time I ever seen it. Lots of zombies, and a lot of killing. One of the best zombies movies ever made in my opinion."

A man (Jim Carrey) discovers that his babe (Kate Winslet) had her memory of their relationship removed via the medical procedures of an innovative company. He decides to get the surgery as well, but as the technicians (Mark Ruffalo & Elijah Wood) conduct the procedure he changes his mind! Can he escape with his memory intact and possibly save the relationship? Tom Wilkinson plays the doctor and Kirsten Dunst the secretary.    

“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (2004) is a drama/sci-fi/romance hybrid that’s so confusing during its first half that it fails to captivate (and is even annoying) but, if you persevere, everything starts making sense by the midpoint, ushering in an entertaining and insightful second half. The movie’s depth naturally makes it improve on repeat viewings wherein it’s more understandable as you put the pieces together.  

Viewers who complain that a certain person is too dramatic, selfish and high maintenance to put up with for more than a month didn’t get the closing moral, which is both true and profound: Couples can (and should) realize the flaws of their mate, which they genuinely don't like, but it's ""Okay."" That's true love.

There are also unexpected peripheral gems on unethical behavior in a supposedly professional environment, secret relationships, discarding unwanted skeletons, and more. Lastly, curvy, vivacious Winslet shines and it’s nice to see Carrey in a serious role.

The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in the New York City area (Yonkers, Montauk, Mount Vernon, Manhattan and Brooklyn).

What really wrecks this for me in the constant use of expletives. The original story is simple, slapstick even, with subtly paced humour that allows the story to develop in a gently menacing fashion. This is just a charm-free, in-your-face, frontal attack on your senses that rarely raises a smile, has nothing even remotely touching about it and even the old lady isn't averse to a little bit of angry behaviour that would have had Katie Johnson spinning in her grave. These original films are a crucial piece of the jigsaw puzzle that depicts the evolution of cinema comedy, and this is just a shockingly poor travesty of an adaptation."

This story offers us nothing at all new, indeed the DMX character is pretty odious from the get-go - especially when he decides to get his independently minded girlfriend hooked on heroin because she won't move in with him. It is gritty; there is a distinct plausibility about the way he lived his life; thoughtless and selfish, ruthless and devious. In parallel, we also feature a storyline about ""Michael"" (a competent Michael Ealy) who is making sure he avenges the killing even though he is a much more decent individual. Plenty of musicians have tried to cross to cinema and most can't hack it. Despite a reasonable effort with some dialogue that is nowhere near as banal as I'd expected, DMX relies too much on his own persona and charisma - of which he has plenty - rather than trying to imbue anything into his character, about whom I really couldn't have cared less.

The Mystery Inc team take on several monsters from their past adventures brought to life by an evil masked figure. 

As with the first film, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini shine as Shaggy and Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. is good as Fred while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne doesn't quite fit the role, although she's likable and serviceable. I'm sure she got the part because of her popularity at the time. Seth Green and Peter Boyle have significant peripheral roles, as does Alicia Silverstone, who's a highlight but unfortunately underused. 

Whereas the first movie was shot on the east coast of Australia this sequel changes the locale to the Vancouver area of British Columbia. Of course, it's location is Coolsville in the story, wherever that's supposed to be. In any case, the extreme switch in locale changes the dynamics a bit. 

There's also more emphasis on action and paying homage to the cartoon. Plus it emphasizes that Velma is sexier than Daphne, at least with Cardellini as Velma and Gellar as Daphne. There are some worthwhile morals as well, like simply being yourself and not trying to be someone else.

Unfortunately, it's too goofy and busy for its own good. Sure, it's based on a cartoon from 1969-70, but that show somehow kept things closer to reality and interesting whereas this movie goes over-the-top to the point of overkill. Instead of one monster to track down, there are eight-to-ten. It's too much and I found my mind wandering. Less is more. 

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes.

GRADE: C"
553.0,Dogville,"When beautiful young Grace arrives in the isolated township of Dogville, the small community agrees to hide her from a gang of ruthless gangsters, and, in return, Grace agrees to do odd jobs for the townspeople.",A quiet little town not far from here.,"Crime, Drama, Thriller",178.0,2003-05-21,en,7.8,2519.0,3.3381,"Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, John Hurt, Stellan Skarsgård, Philip Baker Hall","Lars von Trier, Lars von Trier","friendship, bondage, rape, police, gangster, village life, refugee, blackmail, mountain, american dream, bank robber, last judgment, mountain village, exploitation, rocky mountains, woman martyr, physical work, wanted poster, forced labour, slavery, recession, art house, hoodlum, experimental film, avant garde film, art house film","Rapists and murders may be the victims according to you, but I, I call them dogs. And if they're lapping up their own vomit, the only way to stop them is with a lash. 

A sparse soundstage is stylishly utilized to create a minimalist small-town setting in which a mysterious woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) hides from the criminals who pursue her. The town locals at first decide to shield Grace, and in return she openly works labour tasks for them to work off her gratitude. It's not long, however, before the residents of Dogville begin to show their true teeth...

One thing is an absolute, Lars Von Trier knows how to push the buttons of critics and movie lovers alike. Dogville proved to be a case in point, a film that saw some high profile film critics renounce the director as anti American - even anti human, while others lauded the ""Great Dane"" as a visionary and a director of bravura panache. The point is, and it's a fact, there is no guarantee that Dogville will hit the spot of every first time viewer venturing in for the challenge.

As it happens, I'm very much in the plus camp here, to me it's not only brave in style of production, but also it's narratively as caustic as anything so called ""anti human"" directors like Kubrick, Godard etc ever produced. The bareness of the sound stage setting, where we can see the workings of all residents of Dogville going about their respective business, very much shows there is no hiding place, all the bile strewn movements/ignorance is laid bare for all to see, we are all complicit.

There's an outstanding cast assembled, fronted by Kidman (never more beautiful and never better as an actress), with support coming from Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgård, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Philip Baker Hall and others who give their all for their director. It's often charged that Trier is a misogynist, personally I don't see it that way, more so as Dogville reaches its crushing climax. This easily could have been shaved of 20 minutes from the run time, but it has to be said that Von Trier doesn't waste a single frame here.

Roll your dice and take your chance, you will either love it or hate it, or admire or admonish, what isn't in doubt is that you will never ever forget watching Dogville. 9/10 || I reckon this is my favourite Lars Von Trier film. Set amidst some eerily basic staging purporting to be an hick American town, we see the arrival of ""Grace"" (Nicole Kidman). Now she is attired in furs and lace and is clearly on the run from something, or someone. Shortly after, some hoods turn up in the town and leave a card in case she ever shows up... The townsfolk are ostensibly nice enough - if rather an eclectic mix, and local ""Tom"" (Paul Bettany) takes a bit of a shine to her. Can she stay? Initially they can find nothing for her to do, but gradually they seem to embrace her and she becomes an integral - almost enthralled - member of their society. Some rather odd manipulation from the young ""Jason"" (Miles Purinton) causes things to start to take a darker turn, though, and she and her as yet unfulfilled beau decide that it might be time for her to go. Will she be permitted? This story is darkly brutal at times, the harshness of her increasingly inhumane treatment is exemplified by the presence of a cast that features an almost menacing Lauren Bacall, as well as effective contributions from Blair Brown, Ben Gazzara and Philip Baker Hall who all demonstrate clearly just how fake the facade in this town is. Kidman is superb, probably the best I have seen her on screen. She has a potent chemistry with the on-form Bettany and the stage lighting, paucity of settings and the overall simplicity of the production works really well before an ending that I feared might not deliver as I wanted - but boy, it does! This is well worth a watch. It illustrates the best and worst in human nature - but with the emphasis very much more on the latter! || SPOILERS

On my second watch of this film, I am now convinced that Von Trier is the Ingmar Bergman of the 20th century. No other director today digs so profoundly into the human soul, or in such a creative way. And no other director has been so daring with visual translation.

On this watching of Dogville, it finally hit me that this story is the life story of a woman in an abusive relationship. Maybe inspired in part by Polly's ""Seeräuberjenny"" from Threepenny Opera, or not. Nonetheless, the film script is the same as what might be experienced by a woman drawn into a relationship by a seemingly enchanting man(town). Eventually, as it turns exploitive and finally abusive, she becomes numb and resigned. Some women never escape that stage. Some women are able to escape and most of those are murdered by the abuser. And a few actually murder the abuser. Perhaps the latter is the only way out."

Ned Kelly is directed by Gregor Jordan and written by John Michael McDonagh (based on “Our Sunshine” written by Robert Drewe). It stars Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush and Joel Edgerton. Music is by Klaus Badelt and cinematography by Oliver Stapleton.

The Australian Robin Hood? Well not quite, but Ned Kelly’s name and exploits live on for ever more. As is often the case with film’s of this type, such as Braveheart, it’s best to approach them as interpretations of real events and people, than actual historical facts. The core basis of Ned Kelly the man is here, and the picture built around him is handsomely mounted. Also ripe with strong character portrayals by the key actors (fluctuating accents and dodgy beards aside) and shot through with enough lyrical smarts by Jordan, it’s a film big on atmosphere and authentic feel.

However, obviously hamstrung by budget and running time etc, much of the story feels incomplete. There’s also the problem of under using Geoffrey Rush, who although playing a key character in the Kelly legend, is only on the periphery of things. Still, the evident problems can’t stop it from being an engaging piece of entertainment. It’s consistently beautiful to look at, Badelt’s mournful musical score is an absolute cracker and the action is well staged by the passionate Jordan.

We are still waiting for the definitive Ned Kelly Gang movie, because although this is made with care of the source stories, it only scratches the surface of this most interesting period of Australian history. 7/10 || It's always tough with a subject that suffers from Titanic Syndrome - there can be no jeopardy about the final outcome so it really does boil down to the quality of the writing and the acting as to whether or not we are going to bother to sit through it... Heath Ledger isn't bad at all in the title role, an Australian from Irish (and criminal) stock who falls foul once too often of the frequently corrupt police, takes matters into his own hands and with his brother Dan (Laurence Kinlan) and Orlando Bloom (Joseph Byrne), amongst others, turns into an Antipodean version of Robin Hood - determined to redress the pretty in-your-face imbalances of society in Victoria and New South Wales. Bloom's accent is straight out of ""Finian's Rainbow"" but Naomi Watts is good as Julia as is Kris McQuade as his mother Ellen. Geoffrey Rush is drafted in by the government to lead the chasing constabulary, but his usually dominant presence doesn't quite work here - he doesn't really have enough to do/say. Those really observant amongst us might spot Charles Tingwell (think ""Inspector Craddock"") towards the end, too. It's violent but not brutal - we are shown a side of Kelly that has been driven to the course of action and although he doesn't exactly hate it; he has scruples. The detail is good; we get a sense of the relative squalor in which they lived, and the writing and direction are taut and well paced. From what little I know of the man, and his gang, this isn't the most accurate depiction of his brief moment in the limelight, but on balance, it is worth sitting through..."

Luckily, their plan is interrupted by intrepid commandos under the leadership of scientist “Broom” (John Hurt) who not only thwarts this nefarious plan but also manages to rescue what was emerging from the devilish abyss and return with it to his lab where the half-horned “Hellboy” fits perfectly with his collection of other beings living in the officially denied “Bureau of Paranormal Research”. The thing is, “Broom” is getting on a bit and is concerned that without his steadfast leadership, his beloved subjects will fall under the aegis of the military, so he recruits the enthusiastic young “Myers” (Rupert Evans) to take the reins as the occupants of his museum must faced a reenergised Nazis under their vengeful Russian mystic and equipped with their new, multi-faceted “Sammael” who can replicate, Hydra-style, every time it dies - only it’s not just heads it regrows. With battle lines increasingly drawn, it falls to the pesky “Hellboy” (Ron Perlman), his mind-reading amphibian colleague “Abe” (Doug Jones) and his hitherto unrequited love interest “Liz” (Selma Blair) to get on with the old ridding the world of evil thing. The visual effects here work well, but rather than just let them do all the work, Guillermo del Toro also makes sure there is plenty of characterful dialogue and loads of action to keep this rollicking along for two hours. Perlman looks like he is enjoying himself and that’s contagious as this mixes fantasy and sorcery with some good old fashioned prejudice; just an hint of decency from an on-form Hurt and Myers all topped off by a dose of theatrical ham from Roden doing his best Christopher Lee. Of course, the combination of Satan and the Swastika takes some beating in the realms of evil and though I don’t suppose the conclusion is in much doubt, there is plenty of ebbing and flowing going on and nobody is safe as the action hots up."

Our hero comes back from being away for quite a while and finds the bad guys are in control. A pretty classical story which have been used since the first movies were made (and even before that). The movie can easily be said to be a modern day Western movie as far as the story goes.

Our hero, Dwayne Johnson, is doing a decent job of being a hero. The actions scenes, which is really why you are watching this movie after all, are reasonably well done. Of course they are more of TV-movie quality than anything else but good enough in the context of this movie.

The movie plays out more or less exactly as you would expect.

The traditional western saloon is replaced by a casino and the whisky and cattle is replaced with crooked gambling and some modern drug dealing.

Its variance from the legend may make cinema purists uncomfortable, but I have read a lot about the Alamo over the past 40 years and don't feel threatened by it. History, after all, is written by the winners. I think the last scene with Davy Crockett is based on a book by a Mexican soldier, but I am not 100% sure. Some historians suggest the battle was begun while everyone slept and was over in minutes. The first best selling biography of David Crockett (his descendants say he never went by Davy, that that was a Walt Disney concept) may have made up some of the legend now accepted as nearly factual.

I like the line Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett gives about the burden of being Crockett, the legendary Crockett, that is, rather than the private Crockett he is not allowed to be. It is just as well that the battle turned out to be such a rallying cry for Sam Houston's army, because it doesn't feel like it accomplished much else.

<em>'The Alamo'</em>, to me at least, is an incredibly slow-paced and rather boring 137 minutes. Not even the free-for-all action sequences bring any true entertainment, due to the chaotic filming nature of them; I get there's supposed to be pandemonium, but the camera work is a mess.

Another negative to note is the score, which is one of the poorest I've heard. It's so soppy and full of itself at times it makes it almost unwatchable, though in fairness isn't helped by the direction. I get they were attempting to show the lives of the people involved, but two-second dialogues and dramatic music doesn't attach you to characters.

The cast don't do anything majorly wrong, but I couldn't find a connection with any of them. Billy Bob Thornton is probably the best in this, as he portrays Davy Crockett. Dennis Quaid doesn't get enough to work with as Sam Houston, while none of the others standout - not even Emilio Echevarría as Santa Anna.

This should be edge-of-your-seat stuff, it isn't - at least for me. || Unfortunately, you have to compare this with the John Wayne version from 1960, and it doesn't really hold up very favourably. Patrick Wilson is Colonel Travis trying to command a garrison of Texan freedom fighters holed up in an old Catholic Mission against the overwhelming forces of Mexican General Santa Anna. His task is made the harder by the fact that he is a bit inept, and has some very strong characters to try to lead - not least Davy Crockett (Tommy Lee Jones) and Jim Bowie (Jason Patric). Unlike the earlier version, this story takes us beyond the well told story of the siege, and as such better completes the story of the birth of Texas as an independent state. Better, but as to the acting - well that is all pretty mediocre, sterile even. The dialogue is wordy and lacking in much humour and these undoubted characters are underplayed by all concerned. The production is of an high standard - it looks good, but all told it comes across as a television movie frequently peppered with large scale re-enactments that would not be out of place supporting a country fair."

Queen Nefretiri: 'Bring it back to me, stained with his blood!'

Pharoah Rameses: 'I will... to mingle with your own!'


Inspired by the Book of Exodus, this Cecil B. DeMille-directed, Academy Award-winning biblical epic, the seventh most successful film of all-time, needs no further analysis.

Among the undisputed, where exceptionally classic one-liners are concerned, The Ten Commandments is a timeless generational masterpiece, and a National Film Registry-honored landmark of the Hollywood cinema industry ... Period.

Five out of five glittering stars. || His God ""is"" God!

The Ten Commandments is at the top end of Hollywood historical epics. It was to be Cecil B. DeMille's last ever directing assignment and he bows out with a gargantuan epic that to this day stands as a testament to his brilliant talent as one of the masters of epic film making.

The story cribs from a number of biblical sources, some of which are hokum and not to be taken as a religio lesson, but basically it tells the tale of Moses (Charlton Heston) and how he came to lead the Israelites to their exodus from Egypt - culminating in his delivering of God's own Ten Commandments to the people.

No expense is spared, with a top line ensemble cast being joined by over 25,000 extras. The wide-screen special effects work dazzles the eyes, the direction of ginormous crowd sequences impressive, and an ebullient spectacle is never far away in what is a picture running at three hours thirty minutes (add ten for the glory of an intermission).

It would have been easy for the cast to get lost amongst such a large scale production, but the principals shine bright and make telling characteristic marks. Heston was born for the Moses role, Yul Brynner absolutely excels as Moses' silky and sulky nemesis - Rameses, Anne Baxter gives Nefretiri a beauteous and villainous twin arc, which in turn is counterpointed by Yvonne De Carlo's sultry yet homely Sephora (wife of Moses).

Elsewhere we get Debra Paget filling out a trio of gorgeous lady stars, where as Lilia she does determined and heartfelt oomph as a woman yearning to be freed from male dominance. Edward G. Robinson (Dathan) and Vincent Price (Baka) camp it up and have a good time, while Cedric Hardwicke (Sethi) turns in a heartfelt old Pharaoh and John Derek as Joshua, Moses' underling, does surprisingly well given the enormity of the character trajectory.

As the music (Elmer Bernstein) swirls and thunders we are treated to Loyal Griggs' colour photography that pings out the screen and brings to life expert costuming. John Fulton's special effects work won him the Academy Award, and even though a couple look creaky these days, they all still today hold great entertaining spectacle worth. While the sheer gusto of the performances overcomes some less than stellar dialogue.

Lavish yet vulgar, hokey yet magnificent, this maty not be the greatest historical epic ever made, but it booms loud and proud and is an utter joy for like minded fans of the genre's output. 9/10 || As good today as in 1956

This film consists of an all star cast and is an amazing movie. The special effects are incredible especially for 1956. The acting is clearly amazing in this account of Moses and the Ten Commandments. 9-10"

This and 'Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom', from about the same time frame, would make one of the best double-bills ever on the evils of consumerism gone rampant... || Romero’s imaginative and thrilling zombie sequel 

A decade after the excellent “Night of the Living Dead” (1968), writer/director George Romero offers up this exceptional sequel. The plague of reanimated corpses with a hunger for warm flesh is now global and society is increasingly breaking down. A television exec (Gaylen Ross), her helicopter-reporter beau (David Emge) and two SWAT officers (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) take refuge in a suburban mall. Unfortunately for them, a veritable army of biker-raiders wants the mall for their own.

One of the main reasons this film is so iconic is because Romero seriously considered what it would be like after a ‘zombie apocalypse’ and came up with an inspired story. While the bleakness of the situation is addressed there’s also a sense of adventurous freedom; for instance, the protagonists having an entire mall to themselves.

The movie’s disturbing, ghastly and gory, but also action-packed and sometimes humorous. The zombies make for good bullet fodder while, at the same time, satirizing consumer society. The creative score is varied and I’m sure it was cutting edge at the time, but it’s very dated today, although you’ll probably find yourself acclimating to it. The no-name cast is convincing with the towering Foree standing out while Emge comes across as a poor man’s Donald Sutherland.

The movie runs 2 hours, 7 minutes with the longer version running 2 hours, 19 minutes (the one I watched). It was shot in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, and nearby Pittsburgh.

GRADE: A- || Been a while since I last watched this one, but with the new 4K UHD out, decided to give it another watch going with the Extended Cut. Still very well made with some great zombie effects and really liked the characters, Peter (Ken Foree), especially.

RELEASED IN 2004 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" completes the story of 2003's ""Vol. 1"" and fills in the holes. Former assassin, The Bride (Uma Thurmon), seeks vengeance after the murder of her fiancé & friends at a wedding rehearsal in El Paso. She takes on formidable thugs Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hannah) to finally get to ringleader Bill (David Carradine). Gordon Liu plays master martial artist Pai Mei while Michael Parks is on hand as Esteban Vihaio.

This part of the duology is more dialogue-driven than ""Vol. 1,” fleshing-out the characters and answering many questions. Such as: How is The Bride such an unconquerable fighter? How did Elle lose her right eye? Why did Bill conduct the wedding massacre? How does Budd spend his retirement? The problem is that the characters are all cartoony caricatures, and merciless assassins to boot. It's impossible to give criminal scum ""more depth,"" at least as far as caring for them goes. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Moreover, the story is too shallow to warrant such epic treatment and would've been more effective if both films were condensed into a 2.5 hour flick, cutting out the fat.

Still, the movie's so offbeat that it's entertaining in the manner of 1996's ""Mojave Moon,"" but better. It's an interesting combo of spaghetti Westerns, 70's martial arts flicks, Bond-isms and all-around Tarantino quirkiness. But suggesting that the ""Kill Bill"" flicks are cinematic masterpieces of auteurism is overdoing it. Take, for instance, the ridiculous closing credits, which run well over 12 minutes: The plot and characters are unworthy of such pretentious veneration. If you want masterworks by Tarantino, see “Django Unchained” (2012) and “Pulp Fiction” (1994); or even “Inglourious Basterds” (2009) and “Jackie Brown” (1997).

Still, the movie's strangely amusing, the cast is good (especially Carradine) and Bill's Superman analysis is insightful. The Bride’s training with Pai Mei is arguably the best bit.

THE MOVIE RUNS 137 minutes and was shot in Southern California; Beijing, China; and Mexico.

GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10) || This is so much better than volume one. The ""Bride"" (Uma Thurman) is continuing her quest to avenge herself on the killer of her fiancée and unborn child, but unlike with the first outing we do not face more endless ensemble fight scenes. This is much more focussed and individual. Her encounter with ""Sidewinder"" (Michael Madsen) tests her mettle - and her panic control in a frighteningly claustrophobic manner - before the eyepatch sporting Daryl Hannah (""Elle"") offers probably her finest on-screen performance as together they manage to demolish a motor home using samurai swords and their body weight. We learn more about how she learned her ninja skills under the guise of the curmudgeonly swordsmith and master of all things cerebral ""Hattori Hanzo"" (Sonny Chiba) and all of this builds up to a quirky denouement with her nemesis - the eponymous ""Bill"" (David Carradine) who reminded me throughout of his days as ""Grasshopper"" in ""Kung Fu"". It flies along, this film, with bags of one-to-one action, humour, a decent soundtrack and some interesting historical and cultural undertones that help ground the film more effectively. In my view it is easily the best role Thurman has had to play, and this second outing gives her far more scope to shine as an actor. The writing isn't great - especially towards the end, but that doesn't matter as the escapades, action and strong characters more than compensate for that. My favourite Tarantino film - easily."

Jon Bernthal might have been the perfect actor to play the Punisher, but Thomas Jane was a close second. Rather than getting all wrapped up in the comic universe, The Punisher (2004) keeps its story contained in a more realistic world and focuses on the transformation of Frank Castle into the Punisher. The cast of this movie is filled with exceptional talent, and the plot is a carefully crafted revenge that unfolds as the film progresses, with an excellent payoff at the end. Some parts are cheesy and larger than life, but overall, the movie stays true to The Punisher's dark and grounded roots.

13 Going On 30 is a fun fish out of water tale with a fantastic lead and some entertaining moments. Jennifer Garner's performance as giddy Jenna Rink nails the excitement of a 13-year-old living with all the resources, freedom, responsibilities, and relationships of a 30-year-old. Jenna's young idealism and optimism inspire her jaded career-focused friends and peers (as well as the audience) to return to the hope and enthusiasm of their youth. 13 Going On 30 has plenty of laughs but also a lot of sincerity. With an ending that will make you want to hug your significant other tight, 13 Going On 30 is a great rom-com that will leave a smile on your face and a little more joy in your soul. || ""13 Going on 30"" is a romantic comedy film directed by Gary Winick and released in 2004. The movie tells the story of Jenna Rink, a 13-year-old girl who wishes to become 30 years old overnight and wakes up the next day in her 30-year-old body, played by Jennifer Garner.

The movie is a classic example of a coming-of-age story, where Jenna, who was an awkward teenager, discovers the importance of friendship, love, and self-discovery. The film is set in the 1980s and has an upbeat and nostalgic tone that captures the spirit of the era. The movie features a stellar cast that includes Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, and Judy Greer.

One of the most significant strengths of the movie is the performance of Jennifer Garner. She captures the essence of a 13-year-old girl trapped in a 30-year-old body, and her portrayal of the character is genuine and heartfelt. Her transformation from a bratty teenager to a mature woman is well portrayed, and she delivers an excellent performance.

The chemistry between Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, who plays her childhood friend, is another highlight of the movie. Their friendship and love story are charming and heartwarming, and their performances complement each other well.

The supporting cast, including Judy Greer, who plays Jenna's frenemy, and Andy Serkis, who plays her boss, also deliver solid performances and add depth to the movie's narrative.

The movie's soundtrack is another strong point, featuring popular hits from the 80s that add to the film's nostalgic feel. The costumes and production design are also impressive, transporting the audience back in time.

One of the drawbacks of the movie is its predictability. The plot is formulaic, and the audience can see the ending coming from a mile away. However, this is a common issue in romantic comedies, and the strong performances and charming characters make up for this flaw.

Overall, ""13 Going on 30"" is an enjoyable and heartwarming romantic comedy that captures the essence of the 80s and delivers a great performance by Jennifer Garner. Despite its predictable plot, the movie's strengths in acting, music, and production design make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. I rate it 6 out of 10.

Quinnell and “The Punisher” was based on the Marvel Comics’ character, they’re both about men who suffer great tragedy and enact merciless strategies to take out the criminals responsible. They’re about on par, but I give this one the edge as it has more dramatic depth and flashier filmmaking by director Tony Scott (which some may find annoying). But neither is as supremely effective as the later “Taken” (2008).

Some complain that the movie’s “schizophrenic” because it’s like two movies stitched together, but don’t all revenge stories have a set-up for the oncoming revenge part? This one just has a longer and more satisfying set-up.  

The film runs 2 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot mostly in Mexico City.

GRADE: B || _""Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.""_

Denzel is always amazing in any movie. Most of this movies are just top tier as is, but this one really sticks out to me now that I am a parent. I would have this kind of fire in me if anything happened to my kid. The colors, editing, acting, even the violence is perfect in this."

It being critically lauded by some male cinephiles I trust didn't hurt matters, either.

It was full of laughs and subtly got across its points about 21st-century American society and of the growing pains for young women in its high school shenanigans. 'Mean Girls' is definitely worth the trouble to find and to give a try yourself. It left me enthusiastically wishing Ms. Lohan can sort out her personal troubles and get back to acting, where she belongs. || _Mean Girls_ has absolutely no business being as phenomenal as it is. None at all. If you've read many enough my reviews to get any sort of indication as to the sort of cinema I am in to, then you could be forgiven for assuming I wouldn't be a fan. After all, _Mean Girls_ is about as far away from my wheelhouse as a movie could conceivably be. But I fucking **love** it. And I honestly can't tell you why. Every single piece of _Mean Girls_ examined in isolation, is something I despise. Every trope, formula, format, cliche, device and style choice is something I have ragged on a hundred times before in different reviews, but for whatever reason, I cannot put _Mean Girls_ down. I don't think a single year has gone by since I first saw it in the late '00s that I haven't rewatched it. Usually, multiple times a year. Inexplicable, but there it is.

_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._ || Surprisingly a lot of fun!

I wouldn't have predicted me liking <em>'Mean Girls'</em>, but I actually thoroughly enjoyed it. The first half is stronger than what follows and it does wrap up a bit too harmoniously, though all in all it has good intentions and is unexpectedly consistently amusing.

Lindsay Lohan appears in a similar role to what I've seen elsewhere from her across this era, nevertheless she does put in a very good performance. Rachel McAdams is excellent, strangely likeable despite playing an unlikeable character. The rest of the cast are pleasant as well, e.g. Lizzy Caplan, Tina Fey and Tim Meadows.

Interested to see how the sequel and remake turned out. As for this one, it's entertaining!"

Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's ""The Mummy,"" he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel ""The Mummy Returns,"" a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and ""exciting"" things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's ""Van Helsing,"" although not as bad.

THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies, etc.

It won't take long for the viewer to perceive that ""Van Helsing"" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic Universal monster movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) with the over-the-top thrills of Indiana Jones and the flair of classic monster parodies like “The Vampire Happening” (1971) or ""Young Frankenstein” (1974) and you'd have a good approximation.

The film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves. Others look quite good, like the flying vampire brides and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with ""The Mummy Returns"" the film is strangely tedious despite all the manic happenings. Thankfully, there are worthy hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna. I wish there was more.

Speaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (speaking as someone who’s not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran and Elena Anaya are also striking as two of Dracula's wives, Marishka and Aleera. Needless to say, excellent job on the female front. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role. Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), David Wenham (Carl), Kevin J. O'Connor (Igor) and Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein’s monster) are all entertaining or effective.  

At the end of the day, though, ""Van Helsing"" barely rises above the limitations of what it is: a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Considering the $160 million thrown into it, it shoulda/coulda been better. The story needed time to breathe and less constant mania. The movie’s also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes. Still, it's better than ""The Mummy Returns"" and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.

THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Czech Republic, Rome and Paris with studio work done in Southern Cal and Orlando, Florida.

GRADE: B-/C+ || Absinthe Actioner!

Van Helsing is written and directed by Stephen Sommers. It stars Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham, Shuler Hensley, Elena Anaya, Will Kemp, Kevin J. O'Connor and Alun Armstrong. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Allen Daviau.

Famed monster hunter Van Helsing (Jackman) is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula's (Roxburgh) fiendish plan involving the Frankenstein Monster and the Wolf Man.

Well it was universally savaged by the pro critics and is considered a flop. Yet whilst understanding those things, it does for a reason hold above average ratings on the big internet movie sites. It did find a market (and continues to do so), it's like one big long MTV video, a sort of chaotic monster fun frolic in rock opera style. 

It's effects laden, which is no great thing since they are shoddy, and the dialogue is often as cringe worthy as some of the accents are. Yet it's still a thrilling ride, a strap yourself in and run with it job, to be in the company of sexy lead actors in Gothic garb and devilish period surrounds.

Loud and boisterous for sure, and tacky at times, but exhilarating all the same for those after some pure escapist carnage. 5/10 || **Van Helsing doesn't deserve its early grave and should be resurrected for more fun adventures.**

Why do people love to hate such an enjoyable movie? Van Helsing falls much more in the adventure genre than horror but still has a little of the edge of a scary movie. Stephen Sommers' influence can be felt throughout with a lot of the same charm that made The Mummy (1999) so great. Van Helsing showcases many of the Universal classic monsters while building a shared universe that should have been explored more than once. With big names like Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale, blockbuster effects, goofy fun moments, and all the adventure one could hope for. Van Helsing deserves way more love and a lot less disdain. Sure it isn't a perfect movie, but it was a much better attempt at a shared Monsterverse than Tom Cruise's The Mummy (2017) and was entitled to more."

If Homer's mythical epic ""The Iliad"" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic ""Troy."" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because ""Troy"" is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.

More than that, ""Troy"" is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Ulysses,"" ""The Viking Queen,"" “Conan the Barbarian,” ""Braveheart,"" ""Attila,"" ""The Odyssey,"" ""Gladiator,"" etc. -- ""Troy"" is superior. At the very least it’s as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like ""Ben-Hur,"" and far edges out ""Spartacus"" and ""Samson and Delilah."" As for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator,"" ""Troy"" blows 'em out of the water. 

Roger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of ""Troy"" is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film: He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film ""Ulysses,"" but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in ""Troy."" His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homer's myth is based. (Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).

Regarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldn’t care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from ""Hulk"") is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword & sandal duel ever filmed.

What's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and I couldn't decide for whom to root. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out... and it never ends, as Achilles states. An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.

As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: Diane Kruger plays Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I’m not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.

I should point out that ""Troy"" was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, ""Troy"" is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the Rome & Coliseum scenes in ""Gladiator."" 

Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and ""Everything's beautiful because we're doomed."" Thankfully, there's not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.

James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack of ""The Passion of the Christ"" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.

Interestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting. Fitting, no? 

FINAL WORD: If you're in the mood for a sword & sandal epic, ""Troy"" more than fills the bill. The story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.

GRADE: A+ || It's yours, take it. 

Trojan prince Paris is not only having an affair with Spartan Menelaus' woman, Helen. He also lures her away to live with him in Troy. Thus giving the global domination obsessed King Agamenon the launch pad to war with Troy. Which in turn brings into conflict Spartan hero Achilles and Hector of Troy, two of the greatest warriors that ever lived.

Troy, budgeted at $175 million, and given to director Wolfgang Petersen with orders to craft a swordplay epic based on Homer's Illiad, is not the truly great picture it really should have been. It is, however, a spectacle of sorts, that by way of the extended directors cut, becomes a fine enough addition to the genre it so clearly wanted to crown.

The problems are evident from the off. The casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles always looked to have been based purely on looks. Nicely toned body and brooding close ups do not a warrior make, and thus, as good an actor as Pitt definitely is, this is a role (and genre) too far. Diane Kruger as Helen is under written, which since at the time was a poor actress yet to bloom turns out to be a bonus here, and Orlando Bloom playing the wimp like Lothario Paris the way he should do - still gets out acted and swamped by all around him. The other main problem is how uneven the story telling is. Petersen looks confused as how to condense the Trojan war in the running time, whilst also juggling the emphasis of the two great warriors at its core. That Eric Bana's excellent portrayal of Hector comes through the jumble is a testament to Bana's ability and nothing else.

The good is, well, rather good though. Agamemnon, courtesy of a nasty turn from Brian Cox, is well formed. It gives the picture a reason for being outside of it being a war about some bloke stealing a woman from another bloke. Imperial cravings and a genuine thirst for blood helps lift Troy out of the rocky waters it had found itself in. Peter O'Toole, Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do fine work with what little they have got, and the production values on offer are hugely impressive. The fight sequences impact and are full of gusto. The fight off between Hector and Achilles is superbly choreographed (fought out to a score that James Horner has lifted from the one Danny Elfman used for Planet Of The Apes three years earlier) and the battle between the armies outside the walls of troy sits with the best in the genre. CGI is often called the bane of cinema, but when used so well as it is here (see the ships approaching Troy for instance) it proves to be an effective and entertaining tool.

Troy has problems, of that there is no doubt. But come the end one knows that it has been entertained, one knows that this was a time of heroes. So with that, and the knowledge that the film made a profit of just over £320 million worldwide, Petersen can smugly sit in his chair musing it was job done. 7/10 || A long watch, but just about a worthwhile one.

I enjoyed <em>'Troy'</em>, in short. A film, interestingly given his recent exploits, written by a certain David Benioff. It definitely has more than a few pacing issues, but they only affect the enjoyment factor minorly - at least to me. The score is a little lacklustre, mind.

The casting is outstanding, even if I don't think all the performances are anything to truly shout about. I found Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, although entertaining, a bit wooden in parts.

Elsewhere, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean are arguably underused from an acting viewpoint - though their characters play huge parts, of course. You also have a load of other familiar faces, from Peter O'Toole to Brendan Gleeson to Rose Byrne to Diane Kruger. The definition of an ensemble.

The action helps keep things moving, the battle sequences are very nicely done. The film takes an age to reach the event that everyone knows about, but when it finally does it's excellent.

The cast and the action are my big takeaways from this. I couldn't comment on its accuracy on the original work. As a film, for me, it's very good."

So struck by the tragedy, he is coerced into signing up for a rehab programme at a remote asylum facility, but soon it becomes clear that the serial killer is still in his midst.

Famously delayed from being released for quite some time, D-Tox is like an itch on Stallone's CV that he will never be able to scratch. In truth it's quite serviceable as a formulaic thriller, but it's so derivative and, yes, dumb, it's hard to recommend with any sort of confidence.

Any number of thriller films you have probably seen will spring to mind when viewing this, but in short it's like a ""10 Little Indians"" meets ""The Thing"", with a side order of ""Seven"" thrown in for good measure. The first half is actually well built by the makers, establishing Stallone's emotional chaos, his dive into the bottle, and then setting him up in an institution that is frighteningly monolithic in a grey and steely way. His co-patients are all troubled coppers in search of a dry run, and this also sets things up neatly for some rich characterisations, unfortunately it all descends into cliché hell and wastes what is a rather superb cast - while Stallone unfortunately shifts from a believable tortured soul into a muscle head with a gun. Cest la vie!

Good moody atmosphere and some heart jolting deaths keeps the pic on the boil, but ultimately the pandering of the norm renders a promising thriller to being distinctly average. 5/10 || An FBI agent ""Molloy"" (Sylvester Stallone) has been on the trail of a serial cop-killer for two years and nine murders later, still can't pin him down.

A fellow detective enrols him in a detox programme in a very remote centre that specialises in dealing with alcoholic cops but before he gets much chance to get better, he discovers that his nemesis has also managed to check-in and we've got a menacing cat and mouse game that sees carnage ensue... It's all a bit predictable, though perhaps Stallone has a bit more depth to his character than in many of his more testosterone driven efforts. There are a few brief scenes with Kris Kristofferson as the head of the facility trying to assist; and quite a decent cast of likely culprits all keep the pace moving along, but the dialogue is dreadful and it's very formulaic in terms of story progression - it's quite easy to guess who the criminal actually is...

They separate and both find themselves leading lives that neither would have sought or really want - but yet they cannot go back; don't want to go back - even though one life takes on new positive meaning, whilst the other hits the skids. It's beautifully shot with director Wong Kar-Wai making full use of the grand scenery offered by the Argentine, but somehow I think that grandeur subsumed the story.

And the British agent convinces ""Lee"" to take part in a renowned martial arts competition on Han's exclusive island, that he (""Lee"") might be helpful in collecting sufficient evidence that will corroborate the British government's suspicions of Han. The offer is one that ""Lee"" certainly can't refuse, what considering that Han's bodyguard, Mr. O'Hara, is the same who murdered ""Lee""'s sister.

From there, the plot unfolds to reveal one of the most excitingly suspenseful and action-packed film works of the Martial Arts genre to date. Indeed, its gifted director Robert Clouse would be innovated by the great visionaries who had preceded his classic epic, Enter the Dragon, with their own cinematic contributions. I speak in particular of The Shaw Brothers (Shaw Brothers Studio), who produced a stream of cult cinema classics, including: One-Armed Swordsman, The New One-Armed Swordsman, 1978's Five Deadly Venoms (the inspiration behind Tarantino's ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" of the Kill Bill volumes), Come Drink With Me, etc.

Enter the supporting cast: John Saxon as Roper, a gambling addict with a debt owed to Han; Jim Kelly, in his unforgettable performance as Mr. Williams - Roper's fellow Vietnam war veteran; and Mei Ling, who also co-stars as Betty Chung, an undercover operative in the investigation of Han: It is at the martial arts competition where ""Lee"" meets Roper, Williams, and Chung.

Set in both the United States and Hong Kong, Enter the Dragon is an on-the-edge-of-your-seat, timeless cult action thriller with both flawless direction and performances. The fight choreography and stunts are quite definitive, and the sound effects of each Bruce Lee blow will have your body jerking and your face grimacing in reaction. Truly a badass ass-kicker, if there ever was one.

(Laughs) ...

A phenomenal work of motion picture fiction is the Robert Crouse-directed Enter the Dragon. I found it to be a feature tremendously enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the great Martial Arts genre.

As it may be of interest, this film is English-dubbed. Its script was originally shot in the languages of Mandarin and Cantonese, respectively. || In British-administered Hong Kong, ""Braithwaite"" (Geoffrey Weeks) seeks to engage the services of renowned martial arts expert ""Lee"" (Bruce Lee) to help the authorities thwart the heroine running activities of local, gloved, kingpin ""Han"" (Kien Shih) - who looks like a man straight out of ""Dr. No"" (1962). Luckily, this villain is organising a tournament on his island and that might provide for an excellent opportunity to bring the man down. ""Han"" is no fool, though, and has his own henchman ""Oharra"" (Robert Wall) and John Saxon's accomplished fighter ""Roper"" and his pal ""Williams"" (Jim Kelly) are also there to be contended with. Now, it isn't really fair to judge this too harshly fifty years on. It was groundbreaking at the time, offering an unique look at a culture which Hollywood had done little to engage with. Now, though, it's actually quite annoying to watch. The editing is a shambles, as is the continuity and the direction isn't much to write home about either. The dialogue is stilted and though nimble as any ninja, Bruce Lee is just not an actor. To be fair to him, the rest of the acting talent isn't really up to much nor is the rather un-oriental Lalo Schifrin score - so it's all left to the acrobatics. They are grand scale, impressive at times, and showcase the undoubted skills of the star, but the whole production reminded me of an hybrid from ""Fu Manchu"" meets ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"". Maybe it is sacrilegious to say so, but I found it vaguely amusing in it's earnestness and well past it's use by date. || Really fun martial arts action-thriller with Bruce Lee doing great work as usual in his final film.

This is one of those films that promises a lot when we read the synopsis, but ends up being disappointing: in its attempt to please different audiences, from sci-fi to drama and also action, it fails to satisfy anyone and I believe it was this feeling, more or less general, that led it straight to the oblivion bin where I found it.

Released in the golden age of sci-fi, when the genre experienced a very notable development and popularity, the film has a relatively warm story and begins with a war between humans and a reptilian alien species called “drac”. We follow the combat between two spaceships in a remote part of the universe until they both crash on the same planet. From here on, in order to survive, both will have to collaborate with each other, which opens the door to dialogue and mutual understanding.

I can understand what makes some people appreciate this film or want to see it: it has some good quality action that Wolfgang Petersen's solid direction emphasizes and enhances, and a script with a flowery and progressive message about prejudice and the importance of having a frank and open dialogue. That is, the film still comes in the aftermath of those ideas of peace and love from the 70s, where it seemed that all wars could end if there was a willingness to talk and understand whoever was on the opposite side.

However, neither the script nor the director are flawless: the film is excessively slow and has a variable and inconstant rhythm, we feel that it wastes time with a sentimentality worthy of a soap opera and injects a lot of melodrama without any advantage, like those people who stay for ten minutes talking before getting to what matters. With all this, the action, although good, is scarce and does not justify the film for fans of a good space fight. And the message of peace underlying the script forgets that all wars begin due to conflicts of interest, not exactly due to a lack of dialogue and mutual prejudices: I can understand my enemy very well and think that war is horrible, but decide to fight anyway if consider that I have a good chance of winning and, thus, have access to an advantage or gain that I would not be able to obtain otherwise.

Despite Dennis Quaid's sound and fame, the best actor in the film is Louis Gossett Jr., in an alien costume. The actor is not brilliant, he is average, but he manages to be incredible in the role, especially when he has an immature and charisma-free scoundrel like Quaid at his side. I've seen a few movies with him, and what he does here is essentially overact it and look stupid. Brion James deserves an honorable mention for the skillful villain he brought to life, but he adds little to the film.

Technically, it fits into the broad spectrum of mid-budget sci-fi films from the 80s: we have decent enough cinematography and some creatively invented aliens, to which must be added some good special effects. The general appearance is old: it is a visually very dated film and the sets and costumes, although effective, are unable to appear realistic. The sound isn't bad, but the soundtrack doesn't do much for the overall work."

The Three Faces of Eve is directed by Nunally Johnson who also adapts the screenplay from a book written by Corbett Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley. It stars Joanne Woodward, Lee J. Cobb, David Wayne and Edwin Jerome. A CinemaScope production, music is by Robert Emmett Dolan and cinematography by Stanley Cortez.

Doctor Curtis Luther (Cobb) treats Eve White (Woodward) for Multiple Personality Disorder...

Christine, Strawberry Girl.

It has become one of those films that is stuck in some sort of Hollywood purgatory. Its impact back on release in 1957, where Hollywood was still struggling to come to terms with putting mental illness on celluloid, should not be understated, and it's that time frame where one might have to transport yourself to get the benefits of the production. 

Looking at it today, it is rife with simplistic ideals, where it often feels like Hollywood believes there is this magical cure for mental illness, a world where some amiable doctor can chat the chat, snap his fingers and bang! What joy, it's all good really, and sorry we played some of the film for laughs...

The reason why it is in Hollywood no man's land is because in spite of the near crassness of the piece, it still stands up as a film of importance, a picture that brought out the topic at hand into the mainstream. As an interim movie in the trajectory of big screen forays into matters of the mind, it advanced awareness and built a bridge that the likes of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Girl Interrupted"" would later traverse with some distinction.

It also boasts a brilliant Oscar winning performance from Woodward, a real tour de force that engages the viewer emotionally to the point where sadness, anger, hope and understanding merge into one blurry cinematic achievement. Though away from ""Eve's"" interactions with Doctor Luther (Cobb perfectly restrained for a change), the rest of the film kind of feels like filler, Johnson not quite comfortable enough as a director to expand the dramatic thematics out of the Doc's office.

Based on the real life case of Chris Costner Sizemore, the story only scratches the surface of what the poor lady went through. The psychiatric resolution here on film is very disappointing, this even if there's undoubtedly some exhilaration to be had as cinema Eve comes through the dark tunnel to find daylight. So in that respect, it's another blot on Nunally Johnson's landscape. But again, it put the case in the public conscious, where even today it should at least make people consider reading up on the real ""Eve's"" story.

Uneven for sure, where rewards and annoyances await, but Woodward and the film's mark in subject matter history lift it way above average. 7.5/10 || I was not expecting this film to be this good! Didn’t know anything about the film before I started watching it and what a pleasant surprise it was!

The film, which tells the true story of a young woman with multiple personality disorder, is way ahead of its time in my opinion. Coupled with good acting and a storyline that never bores you, it’s one of the best films I watched that is from the 1950s.

Would I watch it again? Absolutely. Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely. || Joanne Woodward is superb in this complex and intricate drama of ""Mrs. White"". Now here is a woman married to ""Ralph"" (David Wayne) who reaches the end of his tether when she goes on a spending spree. She denies it, she attacks their child then she ends up in a psychiatric hospital remembering nothing, where ""Dr. Luther"" (Lee J. Cobb) starts to think that she is ill. Further conversations, and some assistance from his colleague ""Dr. Day"" (Edwin Jerome) soon leads them both to believe that this lady has a split personality. One, a benign and gentle creature, the other a more assertive one. They share the body on a symbiotic basis that is seeing a gradually changing dynamic between the occupants. Things complicate further when a third persona appears - and that leaves the doctors scratching their heads, but still determined to try to help this woman before she succumbs to the pressures of her toxically confusing and upsetting character. Is it something buried deep in her past; a trauma or tragedy? Woodward moves from one iteration to the other with consummate skill; her scenes with both Wayne and an on form, considered, Cobb really do enthral. This exposé of the elementary science of psychiatric medicine is well delivered by Nunally Johnson using Robert Dolan's score cleverly to assist us as the eponymous faces of ""Eve"" come and go. It's a difficult topic to reflect well, but this really does offer us strong, solid, efforts and some food for thought, too."

I'm not saying that _100 Girls_ could never have worked (although for some viewers I'm sure that will be the case), I'm just saying it doesn't. || Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I like the mystery aspect of this romantic comedy, while it is somewhat unrealistic, it's somewhat refreshing to have a legitimately ""good"" guy concept.  Legitimately getting to know 100 girls is quite the effort, and while the actual mystery isn't so complex, it definitely lends to a lot of character work during his sleuthing.

Jonathan Tucker looks like a poor man's Joseph Gordon Levitt, meant a complimentary as possible, but does really well leading the movie without carrying it.

Cast is good, the writing is solid, the delivery is charming, but the concept lends to a lot of throw away material.  This is probably true of most mysteries, but there is little one clue leads to the next in this: it's mostly 99 dead ends.

They do some cute work at the end of the movie to alleviate some of that, but by then, the actual story is over, and even I checked out.

Great little rom com, they let the jerk guy be a side character this time, and I think it is very much worth the watch. || Not really that great of a movie but it's reall funny. I was laughing a lot in this movie. It's worth a watch."

""You Only Live Twice"" (1967) takes agent 007 to Japan where he seeks the secret SPECTRE installation responsible for literally stealing space capsules and threatening war between the USA and USSR.

This 5th installment in the franchise upped the ante with the action & spy-stuff and is more dynamic than the previous ones. Speaking of the spy aspects, they're often over-the-top here to the point of being cartoonish. Another reviewer criticized the film in this regard -- pointing out that it was this film more than any other that gave the Austin Powers movies the most material to spoof -- and he was right. One scene, for instance, brought to memory that Gilligan's Island episode where Gilligan had a dream of being Agent 014 (remember the soup spoon?). No wonder the franchise got goofier in the 70s -- it was the next logical step.

Disregarding the ""Yeah, right"" spy shenanigans, ""You Only Live Twice"" has everything you'd want in a Bond picture -- the action, intrigue, gadgets, beautiful women, spectacular locations and larger-than-life villains. The story is interesting enough that it keeps you absorbed and even builds suspense as the film goes from one action scene to another, culminating in the explosive climax. It was understandably a huge hit in 1967.

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot mostly in Japan, but also England, Spain and Gibraltar.

GRADE: A- || Yeah... forgotten isn't it?

Maybe it's forgotten because they try and turn Sean Connery into a Japanese man to hide him and he just ends up looking like a harry chested Leonard Nimoy.

Or maybe it's forgotten because little choppers are more Roger Moore than Sean Connery.

Whatever the case, it starts off pretty strong and then falls apart at the end. The first half of the movie is Connery Bond, and in places it's almost surreal in it's imagery.... but it ends up with 007 Leonard Nimoy, and that is just a shame.

I can't really hate on the movie, because parts of it are seriously good. I just can't get disguised as a Japanese man 007 Leonard Nimoy with a harry chest out of my head, and that is really the memory that stays with you decades after watching this film.

But, if you can get beyond that, it's still a pretty darn decent 007 film. || This is in the hay day of 007 films.
Made when 007 was exciting and entertaining.
That gets a lot of hate from people with Generation Xenophobe ideology.
But it's totally exciting.
Here, we get almost all the venues. We even get outer space. We get super beautiful scenery that pretty much make this one of the great Bond films, secure at number 5 in my opinion.
Most of this is set in Japan, and much of it is filmed there.
While Thunderball inspired the most in Austin Powers, this is probably second place in inspiration for Austin, and that's a good thing. Let us face the fact that the modern day 21st century Bond movies couldn't inspire Nolan Ryan to throw a baseball.
This was made in the era when piranha were considered dangerous, and that plays a big part in the film. ""Blowhard"" (my name for Number 1) likes to feed his piranha. And you can guess what he feeds them.
Lots of action, lots of scenery, lots of beautiful women, lots of wit, lots of gadgets. It has everything, which is probably why so many critics are so jealous of it."

Forget the dour, bland rubbish of the Daniel Craig era - Octopussy is how a James Bond film should be!  **FUN!** The franchise has always been over the top ever since we saw _Sean Connery's James Bond wearing a strap on plastic seagull hat in the classic Goldfinger_ and Octopussy continues that absurdity only this time with Roger Moore.

So anyway, here 007 is on the trail of a smuggling ring whilst also trying to stop a crazed Russian general (Steven Berkoff in an amazing performance) from starting WWIII.

Beautiful looking film makes the most of the India. Some great stunt work - including a finale on top of a plane, John Barry providing a lush score, lashings of humour and a fair amount of tension - Bond disarming a nuclear weapon in a circus tent is very effective. A very _violent_ film - here, we can see Roger Moore's 007 shooting a young Russian soldier through the forehead.

_Positively shocking_! 

You probably get the general idea by now that I like this one a lot. Great Bond film.



- Potential Kermode || _**Roger Moore, Indiana Jones, India, Germany, Circuses, Russians, Trains, Time Bombs and Babes**_  

Roger Moore's stint as James Bond lasted a whopping 12 years from 1973 to 1985. Moore started as Bond when he was 45 years old and ended when he was 57. The seven films he did are as follows:

LIVE AND LET DIE (1973), THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1974), THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977), MOONRAKER (1979), FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981), OCTOPUSSY (1983) and A VIEW TO A KILL (1985).

All seven were hugely popular at the box office, which explains why they kept making 'em every two years.

Many Bond fans curiously look down on Moore's stint, no doubt because there was a little too much silly humor in his films but, to me, the Moore entrees are the most consistently entertaining. There's not a dud in the bunch; even the heavily maligned “Moonraker” is phenomenal. The Connery films were a little more serious, with the exception of “Diamonds are Forever,” and Sean is the quintessential Bond figure because he expertly established the role, but I ENJOY Roger Moore's stint more than any of the others. His movies have the most re-watch merit for me.

Some argue that by the time of “Octopussy” Moore was too ""long in the tooth,"" but I don't see that. He may have been 54 years-old when “Octopussy” was shot and 56 in “A View to a Kill,” but it didn't matter. Moore ALWAYS looked perfectly convincing as James Bond, whatever his age.

As to the story, is it really necessary to go into detail about the convoluted plot of “Octopussy”? Every Bond film features a main villain and a few accomplices/subordinates who want to cause great havoc; Bond defies death at every turn and runs into numerous beautiful women as he moves from one exotic locale to another trying to figure out the villains' scheme and stop it.

“Octopussy” was filmed on location in India, East Germany & England, with the closing aerial scenes shot in Utah; these settings are fabulous as usual. We also get circuses, clowns, trains, mad Russian militarists and bombs-about-to-explode.

One thing that distinguishes “Octopussy” is that it has more of an Indiana Jones appeal than any other installment, which stands to reason since Indiana Jones was hugely popular at the time (“Raiders of the Lost Ark” came out two years earlier while “The Temple of Doom” would come out the year after “Octopussy”).

The ""Bond women"" featured in “Octopussy” are Sweden's own Maud Adams (who previously appeared in “The Man with the Golden Gun”) and Kristina Wayborn. I personally never found towering Maud very appealing, but Kristina has an exotic charm, although she needs to gain like 10 pounds. There are numerous other peripheral women in the film like Midge, the short brunette with full hair, and the East Indian beauty that aids Bond during the opening teaser, not to mention several circus babes.

You either like James Bond films or you don't. You either like Roger Moore as James Bond or you don't. Although, their plots will often make your head spin, these movies are nothing deep. You won't derive many nuggets of wisdom. They're essentially mindless adventure flicks with political intrigue highlighted by exotic locales and beautiful women. Their express purpose is to entertain, not enlighten. It's escapist fantasy/adventure, pure and simple.

“The Spy Who Loved Me” is usually cited as the best Moore-era Bond picture, and I agree that it’s a great Bond flick, but “Octopussy” ranks pretty high as well and is arguably the top one. As with most of Moore's Bond films, “Octopussy” throws in a bit o' goofy humor, but it's basically a serious story. It has a little Indiana Jones flare and features India, Germany, scheming Russian militarists & Afghan princes, gorgeous women, incredible action sequences, circuses, clowns, time bombs and trains. What moore could you want in a Bond pic?

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes.

GRADE: A- || I don't mind Moore as Bond, he's certainly not my favorite, I'm not the biggest fan of the silliness, but he has some 007 films that would make my top 10 list and...

... this is NOT one of them.

In the only thing I want to write in this review is ""It is so unbelievably bad."" And not like Moonraker way to over-the-top even for a 007 film bad, but just absolutely horrible bad.

And Moore was clearly a bit too old to play 007 at this point. So he kind of looked like Grandpa 007. And that doesn't work too well for stunts (ask Liam Neeson), it sort of makes it unbelievable.

And then there is the plot that was a little too.... done before to be really good. It took elements from several other 007 films, strung them all together, and hoped no one would notice.

And by Octopussy, the Moore era silliness was starting to wear thin, especially after films like The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only, that underplayed that aspect enough to make truly great installments to the franchise."

Leonard,based on novel or book,"Though doubtless the emphasis of this film must be on the two leading stars, I found that an huge degree of the richness of this Jane Austen story came from the wonderfully characterful supporting cast: Mary Boland as the mother, constantly and brazenly seeking advantageous marriages for the ""Bennet"" brood, with Edmund Gwenn as her husband; Melville Cooper (""Mr. Collins), EE Clive (""Sir William) and the redoubtable Edna May Oliver as ""Lady Catherine"" all contributing splendidly to this otherwise rather loosely adapted story of ""Elizabeth"" (Greer Garson) and her rather complicated on/off courtship with ""Mr. Darcy"" (Laurence Olivier). This is certainly one of the latter's more engaging performances. Though still in ultra-ham mode, he does actually manage to convey the humour of his part, as well as his (largely self-inflicted) struggles to woo, rather well. Garson always was somewhat underrated. I feel she'd have made for a wonderful silent movie star - she had the eyes and the mannerisms that convey what a thousand words could not - and she holds the attention well here as the lively, independently-minded ""Elizabeth"". The other sisters get more of a look in too - Ann Rutherford (""Lydia"") and Maureen O'Sullivan (""Jane) deliver well as they seek out their own beaus. This adaption, led by Aldous Huxley, cuts some of Austen's ever-present wordiness and helps focus the story better, if perhaps less potently and stingingly than the writer intended. I am not really a fan of this genre, nor of this author - but this is entertaining and well made with strong performances, sumptuous settings and quite a bit of charm. Easily the best version of this story to make it onto the silver screen, in my view. || **A first adaptation of Jane Austen's greatest work, which is riddled with problems, but is competent, pragmatic and very elegant. Thought of as a comedy, it was thought of the wrong way.**

At this point, I believe that even those who have never read a Jane Austen novel will surely agree that the writer is, quite simply, one of the most distinguished in the classical pantheon of the English language. “Pride and Prejudice” is a novel that has been adapted to film and TV several times, and each production had its pros and cons. One cannot ignore this production, however, because it was truly the first to transport romance from paper to celluloid. Its impact, at the time, was enormous, it was a great success and even helped to make the original book better known and popular outside England.

I won't waste my time explaining the plot, which is well known to everyone who has seen at least one of the most recent adaptations of the book. What I can say is that this film, with its short duration, ends up not being able to do justice to the original material, which is largely hidden. It couldn't be otherwise, anyway, but director Robert Z. Leonard even cut out passages that were quite important for the general understanding of the plot!

Another problem with this film is how the production simply didn't care about choosing actors who fit the characters. Concerned with attracting the public and making the film work, the producers chose famous, recognizable actors, even if they are clearly older than the characters they embodied. “Safe bets”, as I sometimes call them, because they combined popularity with assured talent: it's no wonder that, each in their own way, they managed to give us good performances. I particularly liked Greer Garson, who I feel made a genuine effort to look younger and more rebellious, as her character demanded. Also, Edna May Oliver deserves praise for the way she gave life to the imposing and arrogant Lady Catherine. Maureen O'Sullivan, Edmund Gwenn and Edward Ashley do an equally good job, and despite not liking the overly pompous and arrogant ways, Lawrence Olivier was competent as Darcy.

Technically, the film has no major flaws or demerits worth mentioning. Filmed in black and white when originally planned to use color (due to allegedly running out of celluloid due to the production of “Gone With The Wind”), the film has very good cinematography and was elegantly shot. The soundtrack is not bad, being within what we expect to find in a film from the early Forties. However, I cannot fail to criticize, on the negative side, the option of temporally placing the action thirty years after the period in which everything takes place in the book, even though I understand the convenience, for the entire production, of being able to recycle part of the costumes used in “Gone With The Wind”."

As James Bond (Sean Connery) returns to field action with MI6, SPECTRE steals two warheads and 007 traces them to wealthy SPECTRE agent Maximillian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer), but he has to deal with femme fatale Fatima (Barbara Carrera) to accomplish his mission as he globetrots from the London area to the Bahamas to the French Riviera to North Africa to an underground facility on the Ethiopian coast. Kim Basinger plays Largo’s girlfriend while Bernie Casey is a highlight as Agent Leiter.    

Despite the return of Connery, ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983) is an ‘unofficial’ James Bond film in that it wasn’t produced by Eon. As such, the recognizable Bond theme is missing, as is the opening gun barrel sequence and the familiar MI6 office cast. Other than these factors, it’s a 007 film through and through. While it made a respectable profit at the box office, it didn’t do as well as “Octopussy” with Roger Moore, released four months earlier.

It’s a competent enough James Bond film it just pales in comparison to the dynamic “Octopussy,” which is arguably the most adventuresome, action-packed 007 flick. While Connery was three years younger than Moore, he looked older. It's also not as good as the movie it remakes, ""Thunderball"" (1965). Speaking of which, why try to remake such a great Bond flick anyway? Connery already did this story 18 years earlier and very effectively; producers should've given him an entirely new tale for his final stab at 007.

Some of the highlights include a knock-down-drag-out scrap between Bond and a big lug at the clinic; a clash with a couple of sharks in the waters of the Bahamas; a wild motorcycle/car chase in Nice, France; an escape from an old fortress in North Africa; and an exciting shootout at an archeological site.

Super-sharp Barbara Carrera stands out on the feminine front while Basinger is winsome enough, but she never interested me. Prunella Gee is striking as Patricia, a professional at the English clinic. Saskia Cohen Tanugi plays an MI6 agent, Nicole, while Lucy Hornak has a small role as a cute nurse.   
  
The film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in England; Nassau, Bahamas; the French Riviera; Almería, Andalucía, Spain; Malta; and Silver Springs, Florida.

GRADE: B- || What were they thinking?
This stood for a while as the worst of the 007 series, although it's been outdone since then.
It's just too boring to be as Hollywood depressing as it tries to be.
Plot? You'll lose interest in the attempt to show a plot. It's a grand scheme to threaten the world, and Bond is there to save the day.
There's nothing wrong with Connery. It's the script. It's the direction. It's the monotony. It's the totally predictable Hollywood ideology.
It's a more ""Hollywood"" rendering of Thunderball. Here, we have it made for women. This is a chick flick 007 movie, with the heroine being the pale ""plain Jane"" that all women identify with. 
There is nothing memorable about this movie. You'll see that for yourself, if you watch it.
What were they thinking? || Apparently Sean Connery was paid Elizabeth Taylor money to return as ""007"" but I doubt he was overly proud of the end product. This is a pretty straightforward rehash of ""Thunderball"" (1965) only it's Klaus Maria Brandauer who takes one the role of the S.P.E.C.T.R.E agent ""Largo"". He masterminds a plan to steal two nuclear missiles from the RAF then hold the world to ransom. The old ""00"" programme had been disbanded, but ""M"" (Edward Fox) realises the danger so he puts his best man on the job. His investigations introduce him to ""Domino"" (Kim Basinger) and soon he is slumming it in the Bahamas trying to track down the bombs, get the gal and maybe even avenge himself on his arch nemesis ""Blofeld"" (Max von Sydow). Braundauer was usually quite good as the megalomaniac - his Nero in ""Quo Vadis"" (1985) being a good example, and von Sydow never lets down as a baddie, but the rest of this is as clunky as it is cheesy and the efforts from Basinger and the even more wooden Barbara Carrera (""Fatima Blush"") do nothing at all to lift this above the level of torrid and innuendo-strewn drivel. It also takes for ever to get going, and at just shy of 2¼ hours it struggles to sustain much interest as the dialogue lumbers along and the action remains thin on the ground and on the water. It's worth watching only to remind us all of just how good some of the there ""Bond"" films were, but otherwise it's a real disappointment."

Le Samouraï, one of the most highly praised French films of the 1960s, and justifiably so. Having only just caught it for the first time, I'm not sure what more I can say about a film that has been discussed, dissected, praised and pored over for nearly five decades now. 

Plot is simplicity, hit-man Jef Costello (Alain Delon) enacts a hit but he is witnessed fleeing the scene and spends the rest of the film trying to make sure his alibi holds up. His employers want him erased so as to avoid detection themselves, the head detective on the case knows Jef did it but can't quite close the noose around his neck, and Jef is mysteriously drawn to a sultry piano player who happens to be the chief witness against him! 

Sparse of dialogue, this is a masterstroke decision by director Jean-Pierre Melville, because what chat there is makes us hang on every word being spoken. It also re-enforces the loneliness essence of the hit-man's life. Jef's apartment is so bland and devoid of personality, the only thing of beauty there is a bird in a cage, the metaphor of such is hard to ignore. Jef himself is beautiful, he also is perpetually in an emotionally frozen cage. 

Attired in trenchcoat and fedora hat (or is it a trilby?), it's obvious that Delon and Melville are homaging with great respect the American film noir classic cycle. It's also quite amazing that although the film is technically filmed in colour, it still feels like one of those black and white noirs of the 40s and 50s. There's a coldness to Henri Decaë's (Ascenseur pour l'échafaud/Elevator to the Gallows) photography that so befits the story, the interiors are stripped of life, the exteriors almost always gloomy. And with the brilliant Delon as cool as an Eskimo's wedding tackle, icy veneers are all the rage here. 

Hugely influential, Le Samouraï deserves every plaudit that has come its way. Best thing about it is that it actually gets better on a repeat viewing, because the surreal edge disappears the next time and in its place is an awareness of what the director is doing, and with that comes an appreciation of great film noir film making. Hell! Even the finale is pure noir of heart. 9/10 || Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 film <i>Le Samouraï</i> is the story of a hired assassin who slips up on a hit and his race against time to set things right. Jef Costello (Alain Delon) is given a contract to kill a nightclub owner, but on the way out he is seen by the club's pianist (Cathy Rosier) and then gets himself picked up in a police sweep. He finds himself pursued by both a cunning detective (François Périer) and by his disappointed employers. As the film progresses, Costello manages to elude both threats while remaining true to his bushido-like code of honour.

The strongest aspect of <i>Le Samouraï</i>, I feel, is Alain Delon's performance. Beginning with an utterly stoic mien and confidence, Costello gradually loses his cool over the course of the film, and Delon skillfully depicts this subtle collapse. Melville's direction is remarkable for its ability to sustain suspense (even across multiple viewings, when one already knows how it will go down), and it's curious how the audience is led to sympathy for this man who is basically a cold-blooded murderer. We are even denied a back story that might serve as an apology for his profession. Instead, Costello is just a robotic killing machine, but the film makes us feel concern for him nonetheless. There is also memorable soundtrack by François de Roubaix, an early example of electronic music.

Some aspects of the policework are presented in a clunky or unbelievable fashion (the detective has memorized every building in Paris, seriously?), so I cannot rate this as a flawless masterpiece. But still, it's a good film, and part of the basic education of a cinephile: <i>Le Samouraï</i> has proved vastly influential in the decades since its release, and those who have seen more recent films like Jim Jarmusch's <i>Ghost Dog</i> or Michael Mann's <i>Collateral</i> will recognize various aspects of those to be hommages to Melville's classic. <i>Le Samouraï</i>, in turn, looks back like many French films of this time to American film noir, as well as to the then-recent French New Wave. || Amazing movie! Withstood the test of times. Was watching it with a great interest unlike many movies of this era. Delon is magnifique! Unexpected plot and ending, but the title should have prepared me for it."

I must admit to struggling to stay with this slow burner, probably due to my impatient teenage angst. But stay with it I did and I have to say it was well worth the journey!

Yes, it had a relatively graphic but erotic lesbian love scene, but the film is more than that, not least for the great character study of the two protagonists, and a rather uplifting conclusion.

I have seen many lesbian-love story films since then, not least ""Below her Mouth"" and ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" - both of them exceptionally well done. But for me, ""Desert Hearts"" still stands out as an emotive and well handled love story that will stay with me until my dying days."

Body Double is directed by Brian De Palma, he also co-writes the screenplay with Robert J. Avrech. It stars Craig Wasson, Melanie Griffith, Gregg Henry, Deborah Shelton, Guy Boyd and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Stephen H. Burum.

Brian De Palma continued his crusade to push buttons of the sensitive whilst homaging his hero Alfred Hitchcock, with this cheeky, garish, sleazy thriller. Even when moving away from Hitch like movies, he created a storm with Scarface (1983), so the critics of 1984 wondered if a return to suspense thriller territory would put the director back on an even cinematic keel? Not a bit of it! The reaction to Body Double was ridiculously over the top, apparently a misogynistic homage to the porn industry, with exploitation gore thrown in for good (bad) measure, Body Double was the devil's spawn in the eyes of critics. The public? Not so much, film was a sure fire hit at the box office.

Of course today it seems all very tame, where not even a simulated drilling killing can raise the temperature of the audience, or that frank sexual language and bare bodies no longer makes cinema goers blush. On reflection now it's easy to view De Palma's movie as a visionary piece of work, a film gently poking the ribs of Hollywood and the MPAA, and as was always the case with his 70s and 80s work, he was a director who easily elicited a response from his audience. And with his box of cinematic tricks still impressive before he became over reliant on them, Body Double is a fascinatingly lurid viewing experience.

That it's Vertigo and Rear Window spliced together is a given, but that doesn't make it a bad film, besides which it bears the De Palma stamp as well, undeniably so. Plot finds Jake Scully (Wasson), a struggling actor with claustrophobia, thrust into a world of murder, obsession, deceit and paranoia, for when he house sits for a newly acquired friend, he spies a sexy lady through the telescope apparently being stalked by an odd looking Native American. To reveal more would spoil the fun of anyone watching for the first time, but suffice to say that Jake has entered the realm where neo-noir protagonists wander around wondering how and why they are in this mess.

It's pulpy and pappy, but in the best ways possible, and unlike many other films made by directors who ventured into similar territory, it's never boring (hello Sliver). Cast are appropriately cartoonish or animated, the twists fun if not hard to see coming, and with De Palma's visual panache cosying up nicely with Donaggio's musical score, Body Double is fine entertainment brought to us by a director with a glint in his eye. 8/10 || Body Double infiltrates the vehemence of adult entertainment through inspired Hitchcockian thrills. De Palma was at the height of his success during the eighties. Implementing his technical flourishes within sub-genres that we’re not necessarily accessible for the average audience member. Erotic thrillers, whilst some may describe as distasteful and misogynistic, accentuated sexualisation to further enhance the lust of man. Body Double is no different. Much like the pornographic industry that is portrayed, it certainly has a sub-par screenplay that persuades you to fast-forward to the “act” in question, yet manages to lure you into the sleazy allurement of De Palma’s technically adept direction.

After waltzing in on his partner cheating on him, a novice actor is recruited by a friend to house-sit a luxury abode, conveniently positioned adjacently to another property hosting a sumptuous succubus of temptation. Naturally, downbeat and fuelled by anger, he resorts to peeping and spying as she provocatively dances in front of the window before proceeding to creepily follow her the next day.

As the main man himself stated, this is inspired by Hitchcock’s two greatest thrillers: ‘Rear Window’ and ‘Vertigo’. The added eroticism granting De Palma’s feature a differing (if unpleasantly salty...) flavour that uniquely defines its narrative qualities. Initially, the first act kicked off with a mundane imitation of Hitchcock’s aforementioned ‘Rear Window’, opening itself up to comparative criticisms. The introductory setup, outlining Wasson’s Jake Scully as a claustrophobic unconfident mess, sent the plot down a one-way route that, upon first thought, had minimal opportunities for a U-turn. The convenience of the telescope as Scully unashamedly invades the privacy of his new temporary neighbour and his dreadful tailing techniques complementing his mediocre onscreen acting portrayals, sent my own thoughts down the predictable avenue. Was Scully a perverted mess, or was he being set up? I thought I knew. But then De Palma trapped me.

Through ornate neo-noir aesthetics and a vapid insight into the world of adult entertainment, he precariously planted a sufficient amount of false breadcrumbs to force me to second guess myself. And that I did. The mystery slowly unraveling, accompanied by a smooth monosyllabic score and Frankie Goes To Hollywood’s legendary gay anthem “Relax”, unlocking the intentions of all characters involved. Heightening the glossy lifestyle of adult performers, De Palma‘s directorial flair, mostly consisting of extended takes and distant shots, invited audiences into a tainted environment plagued by primitive regression. Tantalising voyeurism and dangerous obsession. Even hints of Argento’s influence of the giallo sub-genre.

Various techniques, especially the continuous panoramic 360 revolving as Wasson and Shelton questionably embraced each other, resembled dated homages that failed to match the noir aesthetics that De Palma meticulously crafted. The conclusive ten minutes unfortunately unwrapped certain revelations in an underwhelming manner, by having the story abruptly cut with no substantial resolution. This left myself viewing the proceeding credits montage with an overbearing feeling of unsatisfactory bewilderment.

Undoubtedly, Body Double is rough around the edges. Occasionally bypassing substantial development for evocative voyeuristic tendencies. But that does not deter from De Palma’s intrinsic cinematic approach, where the night life of Hollywood truly becomes illuminated."

The scenes at the start when an opportunity was there to illustrate to us how his workhouse upbringing instilled the ethic that was to drive him all his life - we skip through them all too superficially (though maybe that's because there was no role for Downey?). The political emphasis on the McCarthy witch-hunts is interesting, and the general FBI conspiracy elements are developed well, but for me this is much less about the man than it is about the myth and that's a shame. The supporting cast deliver well enough - John Thaw as his discoverer ""Karno"" and Dan Aykroyd strong amongst them, and to be fair it does rather fly by for almost 2½ hours.

Honestly, if they spent more than two hundred quid on this thing, then I can't see where the money went. I kind-of liked it though, in a bizarre way.

So what's it all about then? Hm. Fecked if I know, to be truthful. We're informed early on that there are apparently 666 portals to ""the other side"" on Earth, all hidden from man. Our story takes place in the ""Forest of Resurrection"" in Japan, the 444th portal. We open with a medieval Japanese warrior, in said forest, surrounded by what appears to be similar Japanese warriors, but undead ones. Anyway, no sooner has our man cut down these ghoulies with a swish and a slash, than he himself is cut in half by what appears to be some sorcerer/warrior fellow, who in turn is already (I think) facing off against some other mean-looking samurai-type. Then, title card, then, um, a pair of modern-day escaped prisoners running through what I suppose must be the same forest, en route to a rendezvous with a bunch of Yakuza hoodlums sent to... what? help them? Not sure, since the meeting degenerates quickly into a stand-off between the Yakuza and the prisoners (along with a girl the Yakuza had captive in their car), which turns into a chase through the woods, but not before a prisoner and a Yakuza are killed and reanimated as zombies. Off go the girl and the other prisoner (finding our prisoner fellow some sexy leather duds on some previously-slaughtered poor sod; the place is choc-full of dead/UNdead Japanese criminals, by the looks of things) and off go the remaining Yakuza in hot pursuit, needing to recapture them before ""He"" shows up. ""He""? Who? Erm, the Yakuza bossman I think, Except that as soon as ""He"" shows up, his gang (along with a few more members who were just hiding in the trees) mutiny, and shoot him to pieces. Except he stands straight back up and attacks them. And he ISN'T a zombie. He's... what? Immortal? Hang on, isn't he that sorcerer-y fellow from the first scene? Oh, he's just bitten someone's neck. So, he's a vampire? And who are these cop types who've shown up and keep bickering? Um...

Oh, sod it. Here are the tweets I took to posting when I probably should've been paying attention:

-Currently watching a Japanese film called Versus. Looks like it was made out in the woods for a tenner. And it is utterly demented.

-I went for a poo for ten minutes near the start of it and I can't pick up the thread of what's going on. It's just mad craziness.

-It's just a rabid succession of people who may or may not be alive, immortal, dead or undead, fighting, in a forest. I think.

-NOW what's happening?!? Why's everyone suddenly dressed like feudal Samurai? Are they different people to the other people? Where am I?

-Unh? WTF? Where did those power rangers go? Everyone's dressed modern again. Why's that woman tied to a tree?

-Why's that bellend screaming about ""gates"" and ""power""? Isn't he that Samurai guy? No? Yes? Is that a zombie up that tree there?

-Why's that zombie doing a lizard/jaguar impression? He looks like a ****... who are these, now? Where's that bloke's hand gone?

-Is it a comedy? A screwball comedy? Oh, he's just blown up that zombie doing the lizard face and scratchy hands. Good. Knob, he was.

-It's a big sword-off now between the two leather-jackety guys. Were they the main good/bad guys all the way through, then?

-Oh, his head's off. That other fella's off on his motorbike. So, where were those samurai types then? What was that all about?

-""99 years later""? Eh? Who are those baldies? Isn't that yer man who's head fell off? What's that silly bitch moaning about?

-Oh, it's finished. Ha! I definitely need to watch that again, I've never been so lost. Made Eraserhead look like Gavin & Stacey.

So there you have it. If two hours of ceaseless kicky-slashy fighting between alive/dead/undead/immortal Japanese types, in a forest, set to an arcade game-standard techno-rock soundtrack appeals, then this is the film for you. I can't rate it very highly at this point - I'm just too overwhelmed, really - but I'm tempted to look at it again. As I said, I kind-of liked it, for all its mentalness. 6/10."

The cruel civil war between Royalists and Parliamentarians that is ravaging the country causes an era of chaos and legal arbitrariness that allows unscrupulous men to profit by exploiting the absurd superstitions of the peasants; like Matthew Hopkins, a monster disguised as a man who wanders from town to town offering his services as a witch hunter.","He'll hang, burn, and mutilate you. He's the… Witchfinder General","Drama, History, Horror",87.0,1968-05-17,en,6.481,243.0,0.7922,"Vincent Price, Ian Ogilvy, Robert Russell, Nicky Henson, Hilary Dwyer",Michael Reeves,"rape, based on novel or book, witch burning, false accusations, religious fundamentalism, sadistic torture, witch hunt, english civil war, 17th century, folk horror, suffolk, england, forced sex","An undeniably brilliant swan song for the ill-fated directorial prodigy Reeves, with remarkable vision, and a ghastly sadistic performance by Vincent Price. Hard to like the film because it gets under your skin with its brutality and just stays there, eating you from within. A very fine work that stays with you, hauntingly. || _**Cinema's account of the infamous Matthew Hopkins**_

The infamous witch-finding exploits of Matthew Hopkins in Eastern England circa 1646 are chronicled based on Ronald Bassett’s 1966 novel. Hopkins (Vincent Price) and his colleague John Stearne travel from village to village brutally torturing ""confessions"" out of suspected witches and charging the local magistrates for the ""work"" they carry out.

""Witchfinder General"" (1968) is a Tigon production, a minor rival of Hammer Films, retitled ""Conqueror Worm"" in America with the addition of opening/closing quotes from the Poe poem by Price merely to link the movie to Corman’s Poe-inspired flicks and, theoretically, sell more tickets.

Some call this ""the original torture porn"" and I suppose the torture scenes were pretty radical in 1968, but the film always struck as a British Western with a simple rape/murder/vengeance plot: A soldier's beautiful fiancé is raped and her uncle tortured & murdered for supposedly being a witch. When the soldier (Ian Ogilvy) finds out, he vows revenge.

In short, it’s like a Western transplanted to 17th century England more so than a torture/horror film, although there is that element. The one death that I found particularly unsettling was where a woman is burned to death by being lowered into a bonfire. It definitely has a lasting impact.

The writer/director was Michael Reeves, a promising young filmmaker. Unfortunately he died of an accidental barbiturate overdose less than nine months after the film was released at the premature age of 25. The dosage was too marginal to suggest suicide; besides, he was already busy working on another film project.

Reeves and star Vincent Price reportedly didn't get along. The director was banking on Donald Pleasence for the title role but, when AIP got involved, they forced Price on him and he had to revise the script accordingly with his cowriter. Reeves mainly objected to Price's somewhat hammy acting style and did everything he could to get Price to play it straight. He would say things like, ""Please, Vincent, try to say it without rolling your eyes."" At one point Price pointed out to Reeves, ""I've made 87 films, what have you done?"" The director responded, ""Made three good ones.”

After viewing the finished product, Vincent admitted that he saw what Reeves was trying to do and wrote him a 10-page letter praising the movie. After Reeves’ death Price stated: ""I (finally) realized what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. Had I known what he wanted I would have cooperated.""

The film is only partially accurate as far as history goes, although the gist is true. The real Matthew Hopkins was in his mid-20s when he committed his atrocities, not almost 60 as was the case with Price. Also, Hopkins & Stearne were reportedly accompanied by female assistants. As far as Hopkins' death goes, tradition tells us that disgruntled villagers caught him and subjected him to his own ""swimming test,"" but there's no actual evidence to support this; most historians believe he died of tuberculosis at home shortly after his torturous escapades in 1647, only 27 years-old.

One of the film's highlights for me is Hilary Dwyer, who plays the soldier's fiancé/wife. She's just a uniquely beautiful woman and a pleasure to behold.

Another strong point is the ending which a man mad with rage hacking someone to death while a just-tortured woman screams and screams. The evil inflicted upon them has brought them to this point of maniacal frenzy. They were venting and it smacks of reality. Despite the downbeat climax I've always viewed it as somehow uplifting for obvious reasons. There's no reason we shouldn't assume that they moved on to live a happy life.

While ""Witchfinder General"" is not a Hammer film, it is a British movie made at the time when Hammer was in its prime; it therefore has that Hammer vibe, which is why some mistake it for a Hammer picture. Needless to say, if you like Hammer you'll appreciate this. Yet ""Witchfinder General"" stands apart; it has its own uniqueness, no doubt due to Reeves’ burgeoning genius. As such, the flick is special. Some of the photography is hauntingly beautiful; the protagonists — the noble soldier and winsome Sara — are exceptional; the villains dastardly; and the ending innovative.

So why not a higher rating? Because, as special as this movie is, it's not the most compelling saga, despite lots of action. Artistically, it's gets an 'A' as a low-budget cult flick from that era but, story-wise, there’s room for improvement.

The film runs a short-but-sweet 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot in Suffolk & Norfolk, England, both a 1-2 hour drive northeast of London.

GRADE: B+ || Vincent Price is superb in this depiction of the tyrannical, evil ""Matthew Hopkins"", tasked amidst the English Civil War to bring fear and terror to the population. Playing to just about every phobia and superstition, he travels the land seeking out and punishing those who worship or serve the devil... There is a magnificent scene in which he divines that a man dropped into the river with stones tied about him will be a witch if he floats, innocent if he sinks (and drowns!)... Sums up the science, really - and the really quite perturbing attitudes that prevailed, even amongst those deemed educated or sophisticated. Ian Ogilvy is ""Richard Marshall"", a man determined to stop these atrocities and at risk to himself and his family - and we have now watch a battle royal between the two men as worthy as any fought in the war. It's, at times, quite gruesome to watch - and the whole look of the film adds oodles to the sense of menace evoked by this truly malevolent man. Again, based on the vivid imagination of Edgar Allan Poe, this film is a cracker for late on a winter's night with a glass of red wine and a rogue branch tapping on the window."

After the success of the initial film, it was difficult that there wasn't a follow-up that would somehow try to extract some more money for the benefit of the studios. And as is often the case, the quality of this film is not as good as the original film.

In this film, Mollie and James, now married, are expecting a second child, who will be a girl, who they call Julie, and who is born by cesarean section. The film follows the beginning of the relationship between the two brothers, Julie and Mikey, with all the natural conflicts between the two. At the same time, we accompany the adult couple in the midst of a relationship crisis, caused in part by James' bad relationship with his in-laws and by the need to increase the family income, now that there are two babies at home. As in any romantic comedy, everything is bound to end well, between several twists where the comedy, by the way, is predictable and much of what we saw in the first film is recycled and returns, without the initial glow.

This is not to say that the film is totally bad. In fact, it's a satisfying comedy that gives us enough to not give up our time for wasted. It's the comparison with what we saw earlier, in the original film, that knocks her down. The humor is still present, and it is not a tiresome film (the proof is in the fact that, thirty years later, it is still present on the TV channel grid, occasionally). And there's no doubt that it's an enjoyable movie to watch as a family.

The cast can once again count on the pleasant and well-executed appearances of John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. They also don't seem as committed as they did in the first film, Alley in particular, but they give a pretty satisfying performance. Bruce Willis and Roseane Barr give voice to the two babies and do it in a fun and believable way.

Technically, it's as bland and uninteresting as the first film: the cinematography doesn't bring anything new or particularly notable, and the sets and costumes are pretty much what we'd expect to find. The soundtrack is good enough."

A major fire breaks out at a nearby oil drilling facility and the manager needs a brave/foolhardy gang to drive two truckloads of ultra-sensitive nitro-glycerin along some poorly maintained roads and across some treacherous terrain to the site so they can extinguish the fires. It's a pretty international convoy that sets off with their two travelling time bombs safe in the knowledge that the slightest vibration could blow them all to kingdom come. Of course, the sweltering heat and their fraying nerves all contribute to what now ensues - an almost perfectly paced drama that gradually raises the tension so that we almost share their perilous journey with them. ""Mario"" (Yves Montant) is a non-nonsense Corsican who pairs with,""Jo"" (Charles Vanel) who is a bit of French thuggery. Luigi (Folco Lulli) just wants to get on with the job and he drives with the slightly enigmatic German ""Bimba"" (Peter van Eyck). There's not really another world for this film, despite it being filmed outdoors, in dense jungle. It's claustrophobic. Their world is reduced to two tiny cabs with danger around every corner, insects that would cheerily suck their blood and all for $2,000 each! The journey affects their characters too - the brash and confident ""Jo"" gradually succumbing to his fears whilst his partner steps up - and an inter-dependency of sorts develops that does rather surprise. Henri-George Clouzot creates a film here that really does have you caring for these men in the end - even if, at the start, you have little interest in or sympathy for them. He manages to convey to an audience the absolute sense of anguish and the sheer determination of these men as tragedy ensues and their priorities and perspectives take a jolt that would readily set off their cargo. I thought Vanel probably has the best character to portray here, but the increasingly effective dynamic with Montand works really well to create a must-see tale of survival."

The Delta Force is directed by Menahem Golam and Golam co-writes the screenplay with James Bruner. It stars Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin, Joey Bishop, Robert Forster, George Kennedy, Robert Vaughn and Shelley Winters. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by David Gurfinkel.

Film is a very loose working of the real life TWA Athens hijacking in 1985, done in a pure fantastical Hollywood style. It would prove to be the final movie of hard man actor Lee Marvin who would sadly pass away a year later, unfortunately this didn't prove to be a fitting swansong for him. All the elements were there, a star name cast fronted by one of the 1980s action movie stars and a hot topic story ripe for serious drama and thrills. Sadly the pic doesn't deliver on its promise of something substantial.

However, if you are an action movie fan who isn't the kind to get in a twist about political correctness, sloganeering and overt flag waving, then there's lots of fun to be had. Stripped back from the political aspects (rah rah rah) it's a Norris cartooner, while Marv gets one final decent pay day. The action is well put together, all bonkers, gloriously so, none more so than when Norris is at the forefront. Be it hand to hand butt kicking or indulging in motor cycle mayhem (rocket launchers, oh my!) , it's excessively joyous.

Yep! There's cheese aplenty, especially once the human drama of the first hour gives way to macho marauding, whilst Silvestri's musical score is irritating and irritatingly catchy - sounds more like it should have been in an 80s Brat Pack movie - and you can't help but be annoyed that pretty much all the big names in the supporting cast are badly wasted! Also sad to see a frail Marvin in this, ravaged by years of nicotine and alcohol this is not how we want to remember him and therefore we are duty bound not to.

Still, forgive it its failings and embrace the thrilling corn, for there's still a good time to be had here. That is on proviso you happen to have a bent for such movies in the first place! 6/10 || Lots of stunts in this. Lots of wheelies. Very nice feature of rope on shoulders as an accessory as well as rope with knots in it to get into hard to reach areas. That's the best stunt. It does seem like the wheelies are just for show and not even all that good. My buddy growing up could wheelie about that good. He was really good at wheelies though.

The way people act, it's funny to imagine them in the military at times. Those people running in the water do not seem professional let alone elite. It is charming in its earnestness. They really believed in this project. A little long.

Our story tracks her determination to get past this obsession in the face of her growing suspicion that ""Oliver"" is seeking solace elsewhere - and that they are planning on having her committed - in a tense and eerie way. The dialogue is quite stilted and the theatricality of the performances rob the film of much of it's pace - but it is still a good horror thriller."

The Postman Always Rings Twice has one of the most famous character introductions in the history of film. 

John Garfield, playing the drifter Frank, arrives at a roadside diner on a hot summer day and orders a burger. The owner of the diner, Nick, runs out to pump some gas leaving Frank alone in the diner. Suddenly a lipstick roll across the floor towards him. Frank (and the camera) looks back to see where it came from. All you see is a bare set of woman's legs. The camera cuts back to Frank who literally looks like the breath has been knocked out of him. Then there's a full shot of the leg's owner - Lana Turner. She all dressed in white and looks like a million dollars. She teases and flirts with Frank but at the same time pretends like she has no interest in him. Moments later you see Frank outside putting a “Man Wanted” sign into a fire. The sign clearly has a double meaning at this point - it's both an ad for help wanted and ""man"" wanted. When he finds out that the woman is Nick's wife he quickly retrieves it. But one more glance at Cora (Turner) in the diner changes his mind again and he puts the sign back into the fire. 



Those few moments begin the twisted tale of infidelity and murder told in The Postman Always Rings Twice. Although I think it's a great film, the rest of the movie could not live up to the opening. I won't go into the film's plot in detail because I assume most have seen it. If you haven't - stop reading and watch it! 

The sexual chemistry and star power of the two actors were undeniable and those first few minutes are unforgettable. 

Lana Turner began her film career in 1937 but that one scene almost ten years later made her a huge star. MGM made the film (surprising to me. Up until I started to write this review I assumed it was a Warner Bros. production) and they weren't known for making crime or suspense films. But they were star makers and they had a plan to make Turner the next Jean Harlow. Unfortunately, studios couldn't make the kind of films they made in the early 1930s due to censorship so they had to rely on the suggestion of sex rather than have characters talk about it or even show it. Turner with her platinum blond hair and perfect figure was up to the task. Unfortunately, she was maybe too ""perfect"" looking for the part. She comes across too glamorous for most of the film. Jessica Lange, who played the part again years later in the boring 1980s remake, could play sexy but trashy much better. 


Garfield – who was borrowed from WB – was already a veteran of these type of films. In fact, his casting is pretty much a no-brainer. Who else but Garfield could play the rebellious Frank better than him? Like Turner, Garfield - who could play scruffy - was here a little too clean cut for the part. An unofficial film version of the story (based on the novel by James M. Cain)from three years earlier, Ossessione,had equally handsome Massimo Girotti play the male lead. But Girotti wore a worn out suit and shoes with holes in them. When Garfield arrives at the diner (driven there but the always-in-the-way district attorney) he's clean shaved, wearing a black suit and a crisp white shirt. He looks like George Clooney when he gets out of prison in Ocean's 11. He doesn't look like a bum who just jumped off the back of a truck like Girotti. 

Also, watching it again I found some big problems with the script. The story flaws were no doubt in an attempt to keep the censors happy but they still bothered me. 

Some spoilers: 

The district attorney (Leon Ames) was aways around – from driving Frank to the diner all the way to the two deaths at the end. Wasn't he a little too personally involved in the case? Why was he so suspicious of Frank when Nick first goes to the hospital? Why was he called to the hospital in the first place? (When Frank and the D.A. give each other sideways glances at the hospital I had to laugh) 

Cara pleads to manslaughter and gets probation? I'm not a lawyer but I would assume she'd get some jail time. 

Even if Frank is considered a suspect in Nick's death clearly the death of Cara is an accident and they wouldn't have a case against him. 

End of spoilers 
My re-watch did remind me of some of the things I'd forgotten about and enjoyed. The two lawyers, Ames and Hume Cronyn (who almost steals the whole film), battling it out to a point where they forget about right and wrong is smart and well written regardless of the questionable legal mumbo jumbo. Also, Garfield recites the line “With my brains and your looks we could go places.” The line is even more clever when you realize that Frank Chambers is a dope and Cora has pretty much tricked him in to doing everything. He's so “whipped” at the end he talks to a priest and wonders if Cora still loves him! 

The roadside killing of Nick is also fantastic. Seeing poor Nick singing away when Frank raises the bottle to kill him is great. (Ossessione, by the way, doesn't show the killing! What's the old movie rule? “Show it don't tell it.”) 

The middle of Postman sags quite a bit after the suspenseful killing. Even the appearance of Audrey Totter doesn't liven it up much. Ossessione handles the middle parts and end much better. 

But, even with my nitpicking, I have to say The Postman Always Rings Twice is still one of my favorite films thanks to the famous first few minutes that are burned into my memory. || The _Postman Always Rings Twice_—a classic tale of passion, crime, and, most importantly, reliable delivery etiquette. Amazon drivers could learn a thing or two instead of stealth-dropping the package and running away."

Now following his near miss last time, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston) has become even more fixated on exposing the Queen (Geraldine Chaplin) and her British lover Buckingham (Simon Ward) and so has commissioned ""Rochefort"" (Christopher Lee) and the menacing ""Lady De Winter"" (Faye Dunaway) to get the secrets from dressmaker ""Constance"" (Raquel Welch). Meantime, the loved-up ""D'Artagnan"" - the particularly scrawny Michael York - is also on her trail, aided by his three colleagues ""Porthos"" (Frank Finlay), ""Aramis"" (Richard Chamberlain) and ""Athos"" (Oliver Reed) and adventures ensue as they have to thwart the evil Cardinal's machinations and save poor ""Constance"" from the malevolent ""Milady"". It's colourful and action packed, with more from the others - especially the clearly in his element Reed who must have been swilling real vin rouge. Roy Kinnear rolls his eyes in disbelief with comic aplomb and we have quite a fun game of cricket that's far more explosive than any I've ever seen at Lords! Dunaway is great as the manipulatrix and Welch likewise as the naive young seamstress only just fitting into one of her own frocks. Heston features a little too sparingly to make much of an impact, but Christopher Lee delivers well too - his firing squad ""perhaps I'll die of old age"" did make me smile - as this enjoyable costume drama heads to it's rather fitting, but slightly disappointing, denouement. These are a good pair of films for fans of action comedies, and still bear watching fifty years later."

The 'film within a film', <em>'Mant!'</em>, is great though - it actually amused me a fair bit, which was a stark contrast to what the real comedy (or lack thereof) achieved. I appreciate what it was going for, but I just didn't dig the vast majority of it unfortunately."
