Burt Lancaster portrays his popular XO who ought, originally, to have had that command but has been passed over; and the film depicts the evolution of their taut and mistrusting relationship. Gable is on good form as his character treads a very thin line between reason and obsession and Lancaster works hard to keep himself and the crew under control. The direction is tense and the chemistry between these two men works really well. This is more than a post-war grandstanding picture; it does touch on the psychology of command and of grief, and is well worth an hour and a half of your time."

I saw this film in the theater when I was in high school and couldn't get enough of the cheesy horror flick, sci-fi, and all that was in-between, and ""Swamp Thing"" was just the right kind of movie I needed to see at the right time to enjoy it as I did.  **Adrienne Barbeau** had the right assets for a high school boy, and to this day I love any movie or TV show with **Ray Wise**.  

The effects were pretty cool for that time, though not too sophisticated as they really didn't need do be. As long as you had some dry ice, food coloring, water, beakers and such, and a green rubber suit that looked a bit like a walking bean stalk, this was the movie to make following in the tradition of bringing the comics we read and collected to life on the big screen. Sure, I had Swamp Thing comic books (DC) (I guess they're called 'Graphic Novels' now). A few more prosthetics and **Wes Craven** writing and directing and you have ""Swamp Thing"" the motion picture. 

Rent it, buy it, stream it, just watch it, and grab a bag of popcorn if you love these movies like I do. In other words, just enjoy! || Meh. I found Swamp Thing to be rather bleak. Just really some lady falls in love with a scientist turned swamp monster. They just kind of kiss and then “hey, look we are in love” and then he turns into a dreadfully awful looking ideration of the Swamp Thing and she’s scared of it until she figures out it’s him. Really cool to see this was filmed in my state of residence, South Carolina, though. || _**Live-action version of the DC character is too, um, comic booky**_

RELEASED IN 1982 and directed/written by Wes Craven, “Swamp Thing” is a live action movie version of the DC Comics’ character. The plot revolves around a scientist (Ray Wise) working on a top-secret bioengineering project deep in the swamps of the American South who falls prey to his own formula and becomes a bog monster. Adrienne Barbeau plays a government worker at the lab while Louis Jourdan plays an evil genius who wants the formula for his own designs.

I own the original Swamp Thing comics by Len Wein & Bernie Wrightson from the early 70s and this movie doesn’t capture their mature, moody essence. It’s just too comic booky, too kiddie-oriented despite a couple surprising risqué scenes involving female nudity. Adrienne Barbeau was 36 during shooting and has a nice, fit body, but her permed hairdo is pretty hideous. I suppose if you’re not familiar with the original comic, you might be more receptive of this cinematic rendition. Siskel & Ebert, amazingly, gave it a hearty thumbs-up. Go figure. 

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot at Cypress Gardens in Charleston, South Carolina, and nearby Johns Island, but some scenes look like that were shot in Southern Cal.

18158.0,Earth vs. the Flying Saucers,"Test space rockets exploding at liftoff and increased reporting of UFO sightings culminate in a direct attempt by alien survivors of a dead, extra-galactic civilization to invade Earth from impervious flying saucers, using ray-weapons of mass destruction.",The terrifying truth about flying saucers!,"Action, Science Fiction",83,1956-07-04,en,6.035,170,0.8645,"Hugh Marlowe, Joan Taylor, Donald Curtis, Morris Ankrum, Thomas Browne Henry",Fred F.

Reports of flying saucers start coming in thick and fast until sure enough alien invaders begin to attack the Earth. Focal point of their attack is the U.S. Space Programe, can hero in waiting Russel Marvin conjure up a defence weapon to save the day?

Obviously a template for many an alien invader film since its release, Earth Vs The Flying Saucers never quite reaches the heights that perhaps it should have. Bogged down by maudlin scripting and restricted by its budget, it often hints at what a great picture it could have been. The lead cast are poor and this hurts the film even more, Hugh Marlowe as Russell Marvin bores us with the scientific speak when really he should be fascinating us, whilst scream queen duties fall to poor Joan Greenwood who forgets that she is actually supposed to emit some sort of terror when the alien hordes attack! However, on the plus side the aliens themselves are certainly creepy enough to grab your notice, Ray Harryhausen's flying saucers animation is of course top dollar for its time, whilst the final battle across Washington DC is classic gold, an all buzzing assault with splurges of death rays at every turn.

An important film in the pantheon of the genre for sure, but it's just a tad too restrained for its own good. 6/10 || This is another enjoyable little 1950s sci-fi movie with scientist Hugh Marlowe (""Dr.Marvin"") and Joan Taylor, his wife ""Carol"", having to use all their wits guile to save the planet from an alien race who want to invade the Earth and enslave us all. Despite their vastly superior technology our resourceful team work frantically to come up with a very effectively portable, if almost as destructive, solution. The visual effects are quite remarkable for the time, with some input from Ray Harryhausen, and the action is well shot and paced. The end is never in doubt (we are all still here!) but it's a fun ride for eighty minutes of ray guns and competent acting."

Shame that it's also mired by terrible dialogue, B-movie plotting, and a cheap looking production. Blending elements of Dark City and The Matrix though never achieving the greatness of either of those magnificent works of sci-fi, I would still recommend The Thirteenth Floor for what it sets out to do. It's also cool to see the younger versions of Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Dennis Haysbert. || It's kind of like The Matrix, It is kind of like eXistenZ...only it is also kind of neo noir, and it is far more mystery/thriller...and it...wait, not it's actually a completely different film.

Let me start again...

It's kind of like Dark City and it's kind of like The Matrix and....no, that really doesn't fit either.

It's kind of like a lot of elements in other movies that are kind of like this one. So people are going to see similarities...but it is also going to throw them for a loop and be a lot different than the movies that you can compare it to

It's not original, it's just combined enough to be kind of completely original.

In fact, forget it, just sit down and watch it yourself, it will entertain you and that was the point of making it. || ""Fuller"" (Armin Mueller-Stahl) needs to share the news of his ground-breaking discovery with his partner 'Hall"" (Craig Bierko) but is wary that he isn't safe. He decides that the best precaution might be to leave a letter for him and deposit it in their computer-generated alter-world. This place wouldn't have looked out of place in a Fritz Lang movie, and when his colleague is, indeed, slain, it falls to ""Hall"" - now the prime suspect for the crime - to piece together the clues left by his friend and try to identify the true culprit whilst rescuing the innovation from it's simulated home. What I quite enjoyed about this drams is the simplicity with which it juggles it's timelines. We don't have to struggle or concentrate trying to follow the changing environments coming at us from all angles of the screen overpowering what is essentially quite an intriguing crime thriller. Nobody on the screen really stands out, but the ensemble approach along with some quite potent comment on just how dependent we are becoming on technology in our lives is quite effective at keeping the story tight and interesting. The denouement is also a little left field, and all told this is a surprisingly decent attempt at an early multi-verse experience that works quite well."

12117.0,Instinct,"In a prison for the criminally insane, deranged anthropologist Ethan Powell is set to be examined by a bright young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder. Driven by ambition and a hunger for the truth, Caulder will eventually risk everything—even put his very life on the line—in a harrowing attempt to understand the bizarre actions of this madman.",Nothing is more savage than civilization.,"Drama, Thriller",124,1999-06-04,en,6.495,628,1.8514,"Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Sutherland, Maura Tierney, George Dzundza",Jon Turteltaub,"prison, research, gorilla, instinct, murder, mute, jungle, psychologist, anthropologist, prison break, 인스팅트, 스릴러, 살인","How free are you really? Are you a liberator or a controller?  

What is the main purpose of a movie? To entertain and amuse in one way or another, right? In other words, captivate your attention for the span of the movie's runtime. Great movies do this PLUS something else: They inspire you and make you think; maybe even enlighten. That's the power of the art of film. ""Instinct"" (1999) does this, which explains my high rating.

THE PLOT: Anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) goes missing in Africa for a couple of years; when he is found living with gorillas in the wild he kills a couple of rangers and injures others. After a year in prison in Africa, where he refuses to speak, he is extradited to a Florida prison and put in the mental ward. A young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is assigned his case to see if he can get him to speak and learn what really happened in Africa. Meanwhile Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney) anticipates reconciling with her father; IF Theo can get through to him.

There are some peripheral characters (Donald Sutherland), but that's the gist of the story. Some people criticize the film as a mix of ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" with a little “The Silence of the Lambs” thrown in for good measure, but this only valid on a surface level. ""Instinct"" stands on its own; in fact, it's quite unique, which is a sign of greatness. The movie stands or falls on Hopkins and Cuba Jr. making their characters and their story come alive and seem real to the viewer. They succeeded for my wife and me. Within 20-30 minutes we found ourselves absorbed into the story and the characters; the film really picks up steam around the midpoint.

Some people, like Roger Ebert, criticize that the film tackles too many topics or messages, but I never got this impression, nor did my wife. There are the main themes: the limitations of freedom in conventional modern society and the abuse of controllers (or ""takers""); and there are a few subthemes, like the flaws of our prisons and mental institutions, as well as getting into the mind of someone else to understand their point of view (including non-humans). All of these are linked. The film never confused us or gave the impression that it cut off more than it could chew. If you appreciate films like ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) you'll probably value ""Instinct.""

Some criticize one aspect of the climax, but it happens. There are documented examples in the USA and all over the world. Also, keep in mind that Powell was imprisoned in the mental ward of the prison, not the maximum security area.

Is the story contrived to some degree? Of course it is; all movies are. Filmmakers have to tell a story and make their points within a limited timeframe, usually around two hours, and so there are always contrived elements, coincidences, etc. The trick is to pull it off without seeming too phony or forced, which is sometimes hard to do and it takes good actors. Thankfully, ""Instinct"" does a respectable job on this front, perhaps mainly because it has a few great actors, although some viewers may roll their eyes here or there. Regardless, it's in the area of ideas that ""Instinct"" towers above most movies.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Instinct"" is a psychological drama/thriller that entertains but also makes you reflect and ponder: How free are we REALLY in society? Are you a giver or a taker? A blesser or an abuser? A liberator or a controller? How can you be freer? How can you escape the manipulations and shackles of others, of society, of ""government""? How can you walk free of ""the game""? And so much more, like the ""doctor"" learning from the patient and the humility it takes to learn from someone who's ""under"" you.

The film runs 126 minutes and was shot in central Florida, Uganda and Jamaica.

After a great success with the first film, the sequel became quite easy to predict. It was obvious that they were going to try to make a second movie that continued the story, and tried to raise some more money from the box office. I'm not a fan of this kind of humor, too scatological and sexual, but I think this movie was frankly worse than its immediate predecessor.

The biggest problem with this film is not even the dirty, stupid jokes and zero sense of humor, but a poorly written script, without original ideas and quite tiring. The film's story is very simple to summarize: Austin Powers, single and free again, finally realizes that Dr. Evil, years before, used a time machine to steal his manhood while he was frozen. For a man as perverted and quinky as Powers, being without what he calls a “mojo” is simply catastrophic. So he has to use another time machine, go back to the 60s and try to stop Dr. Evil in order to regain his masculinity. Sound really stupid? Maybe because it is! And I prefer not to mention the ending, where we have two versions of the main agent, and we came to the conclusion that it was never really necessary to recover his virility. In addition to being stupid, the movie is also pointless.

Myers continues to assure the main characters of the film, that is, the protagonist, the great villain and a deformed criminal who is nothing more than a bunch of Scottish lard (do Scots feel offended by such a caricature?). He is a good actor, I have no doubt that he is committed to his work. However, the rest of the cast is uninteresting, tiresome and doesn't seem to have any ideas or even try to add anything else to the production that can increase its quality. Heather Graham is beautiful, but not very good as an actress, and the film saved her from spending the rest of her career making adult films. Seth Green also tries to do something witty and interesting, but he's short on time and quality material. Finally, a note of praise for Verne Troyer and Mindy Sterling.

Technically, the film is quite weak. It plays a lot with the colorful and flashy look of the 60's, and that's the most beautiful and elegant aspect of the whole movie. I liked the costumes, the sets and the characterization, in particular Myers, chameleonic and skilled in the various characters he plays (in fact, the film was nominated for an Oscar in the Characterization category). The cinematography also seeks to take advantage of and emphasize the visual beauty that exists here, while the editing sought to give the film a rhythm that was not tiring. I can't say that the efforts were in vain, the film would be unbearable if it were slower. || In my opinion this is the only good one out of the entire series. I was cracking up throughout the whole movie. The other 2 sucked compared to this one."

That quickly changes when nomadic club singer Donna de Angelo and her troubled teen-age daughter enter Joe’s life. Both mother and daughter fall for Joe, increasing the friction between them.

A handyman in an isolated coastal town of Southeast Alaska (David Strathairn) meets a singer (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) while considering getting back to the ocean as a fisherman. He takes the woman and her daughter (Vanessa Martinez) on a boat trip up the coast where things don’t go as planned. 

Written/directed by John Sayles, ""Limbo"" (1999) is a drama that becomes a gritty adventure and character study. After the dramatic set-up, the milieu is similar to “Out of Control” (1984) and “The Edge” (1997), just way more mundane and realistic. “Nightmare at Bittercreek” (1988) and ""Anything to Survive"" (1990) are good comparisons, although this is far superior to the latter. ""Courage"" (2009) ripped it off a decade later for a far lesser movie hampered by eye-rolling dramatics and hammy acting.

The ending may understandably turn-off some viewers, but Sayles respects the intelligence of the viewer to put the pieces together. The answers are there for those who care.

The movie runs 2 hours, 6 minutes, and was shot in Juneau, Alaska.

Linz, Rosie O'Donnell","Chris Buck, Kevin Lima","baby, africa, gorilla, adoption, cartoon, villain, feral child, tarzan, nest, anthropomorphism, jungle, camp, orphan","Tarzan swings through the iridescent jungle swiftly, ending Disney’s Renaissance era with wild exuberance. Two worlds, one family. An innocent little boy, approximately four-years old, was escorted for the first time to a cinema complex. Politely requesting a bucket of sweet polystyrene popcorn, he walked into the dimly lit auditorium scavenging for an appropriate seat that would maximise his film experience. The trailers initiated, suppressing the inner excitement of the full feature that was yet to commence. Then, it happened. The Disney logo emerged. It was time. A family surviving a shipwreck, colonising an uncharted jungle whilst the emphatic voice of Phil Collins powered the narrative. A leopard savaging a baby gorilla, then brutally slaying the English couple, leaving only their infant son crying. His sorrowful echoes reverberating through the rainforest, until a female gorilla acquires him. Adopting a human child. Tarzan. The four-year old, naive to the cruelty of nature, was transfixed by the colourful animation. The plethora of emotions. That pure Disney magic. It was the commencement of a new-founding love for cinema. An adoration he could never shake off again. Yes, that four-year old, was me.

Subjectively speaking, Tarzan is more than just another Disney classic from their animated library. Even more than just an adaptation of Burroughs’ epic. It was a trigger. A sweeping adventure that upheld every emotional resonance possible. The brooding romance between explorer Jane and fully-adolescent Tarzan. Thematically presenting ostracism through two interconnected species, conveying the “Two Worlds, One Family” conflict within Tarzan. Who we are raised to be and who we are truly meant to become. Comedic buoyancy through the supporting characters of Terk and Tantor, supplied with their own catchy rhythms. Dark antagonisms through Clayton’s treacherous hunting techniques, viewing gorillas as merchantable assets. An exploration into the vivacious rainforests of Africa. All culminating to form a wonderfully effervescent coming-of-age tale. One of Disney’s most overlooked, for sure.

The art direction is the strongest of the Renaissance period, combining traditional hand-drawn animation with pioneering three-dimensional backgrounds. Often incorporating visual montages to steer the narrative into the intended direction. Watercolour backdrops to enhance the naturalistic environment. Bright character designs to contrast the darkened background. Sublimely directed by Lima and Buck. Then, Phil Collins just being the legendary musician that he is, providing the tale with apathy and soul. The “Two Worlds” anthem, “You’ll be in my Heart” and “Strangers Like Me”. Mancina’s score actively preventing the characters from singing and turning into another unnecessary musical. As I said, subjectively I refuse to liken Tarzan to just another animation from the “House of Mouse”. It was my first cinema endeavour after all.

However, objectively, there are narrative stumbles. It’s the breeziest story, condensing an epic plot into less than ninety minutes. The most noticeable consequence of this, is the rushed editing on certain segments. The introductory two minutes is a whirlwind of emotional storytelling that, unfortunately, holds minimal foundations. The montages of Tarzan growing up also lacked narrative heft, providing nothing more than visual delights. Goldwyn, Close and O’Donnell had insufficient power within their voice roles. Although Driver and Blessed were delightful. And, as much as I adore the song, the repetitious reprises of “Two Worlds” throughout minimised lyrical diversity.

The entire story is told faster than a shotgun firing, but I refuse to shake my undying adoration for this feature. Tarzan was the film that made me the cinephile that I am today. If I hadn’t received that euphoric pleasure from the cinema back in ‘99, well, these amateur reviews probably would never have been written. Ever. So for that, Tarzan and Disney have my eternal gratitude. || <em>'Tarzan'</em> is one of those films that I had always assumed I had seen, though evidently I hadn't and this was my first time watching. It's a cracker!

Phil Collins' music is tremendous, it truly adds a lot to the film - ""Son of Man"", which I already knew about, is a great song which works very well with the montage. Some of the editing is rather sharp, while the animation is pleasing on the eye.

Tony Goldwyn (Tarzan) and Minnie Driver (Jane) suit their respective roles nicely, as do Glenn Close (Kala) and Brian Blessed (Clayton). Rosie O'Donnell is the one I enjoyed most, as she portrays Terk - which isn't really a massive character, yet O'Donnell makes her memorable.

It does feature things you've seen from earlier jungle based films, like 1967's <em>'The Jungle Book'</em> and, as expected yet still amusingly, 1997's <em>'George of the Jungle'</em>. The early scenes in-particular, which rely firmly on Collins' music - from the midway point it's more level, whilst also taking its own route with this type of story.

I'm interested to find out where the two follow-up films go. || **A Disney production that promised much more than it delivered.**

Like any child born in the last few decades, I lived with Disney movies as a child. However, for some reason I don't remember, I was never attracted to this movie and I ended up never seeing it until today. Having seen it, I am really unimpressed.

The biggest problem I felt in this film is the poverty and lack of inspiration of the script, which is a loose adaptation of the original story, written by Edgar Rice Burrough. The characters aren't the best designed, there are a lot of annoying characters around here (Jane's father, the gorillas, and particularly Terk and Tantor, a very unhappy side character duo) and even Tarzan is poorly designed and uninteresting. The prevailing feeling is that the writing team didn't know what to do with the task at hand and improvised something.

To make matters worse, there are a lot of logic problems in this movie. For example, there is no exact notion of time that passes, so we are left with the idea that Tarzan learned the first human words in an almost instantaneous way. Another thing that doesn't make a lot of sense is the way Tarzan himself doesn't recognize the physical differences between himself and the gorillas he lives with, as well as the immediate similarities between himself and Jane. At some point, he will have seen his own reflection, will he not? I don't mean to say that the film is bad… but the truth is that I feel that Disney has already given us much better and more interesting work.

Overall, I think the voice cast didn't do a bad job, with everyone involved doing their best and doing everything that was asked to the best of their ability. Personally, I didn't really like some of the options. Tony Goldwin, for example, voiced the film's central character in a relatively mediocre way, but his voice has nothing particular or charismatic about it (well, the character has been stripped of any charisma). For me, it was Glenn Close who stood out the most, but with very little to say, and Rosie O'Donnell is the one who pissed me off the most, with a very unpleasant voice.

The strong point of the film is the elaborate visuals and the animation, very well executed thanks to the high quality CGI. I'm not sure, but perhaps this was one of the first films by the studio to use computer animation on a more regular basis. What is certain is that the look of the film is exquisite, it is a little different when compared to the older films of the mid-decade. And if it is a fact that Disney films have, in general, a very particular attention to the soundtrack and the songs, this film maintains that characteristic, having hired Phil Collins to write and sing several songs. Unfortunately, and even though the film won the Oscar for Best Song for “You'll be in my Heart”, I didn't really like any of them and I find the film's sound particularly bad."

It's also quite a fun observation on just how frustrating tiny amounts of time can be when you are in a rush. This is well exemplified by the security guard at her dad's bank, but also by the traffic and the pedestrians and other obstructions that a few seconds of patience would easily (and probably just as quickly) overcome.

His night of the visitors - when he must jig from room to room adopting a differing persona each time is really quite good fun to watch - and quite plausible too. The problem here is the rest of the ensemble. It's one of these sum of the parts scenarios. The big names are there, but the characters aren't. Moore really doesn't exude the Machiavellian nastiness I wanted from her and there's only so many times I can watch Blanchett do that thing with her eyes that is meant to suggest a myriad of emotions. Northam was only ever really adequate and here he fares no better, despite having a strong character to work with. I still think Wilde works best on the stage - there's a spontaneity there that makes his works sing. Here, it really only sort of murmurs with the odd potent spluttering of humour now and again. Looks splendid, though."

When a photographer is bitten and killed by a spider in the Venezuelan jungle, his body is shipped back to his home town of Canaima in California. Unfortunately something has hitched a ride in his coffin...

Mixing ""B"" movie conventions with a modern day fun sensibility, Arachnophobia sees Frank Marshall direct and Jeff Daniels, Julian Sands, John Goodman and Harley Jane Kozak line up in the cast. Though horror and comedy on the surface doesn't seem to be a that hard to blend together, it's actually surprising over the years just how few horror comedy movies can claim to be successful, and crucially, have been able to to win over a like minded audience. In fact, if we move away from the likes of ""Sean Of The Dead"", the ""B"" movie creature feature, especially in modern times, has few offerings of worth. We can certainly mention the awesome (and best of the modern bunch) ""Tremors"", which turned a small Worldwide profit, and then we turn to ""Lake Placid"" and ""Arachnophobia"". Both of the latter made considerable amounts of cash (for the genre) and are propelled by a degree of star wattage. 

What was in Arachnophobia's favour was that spiders strike the fear of god into many people, thus, as director Marshall said himself on the publicity junket, ""People like to be scared but still laughing at the same time"".  Arachnophobia achieves this in spades, mixing real spiders (the Avondale breed) with model and magnet work, where the effect achieved is full on nervy giggles coupled with some creepy goose flesh also putting in an appearance.

The cast work hard to make it work. OK, Sands remains as wooden as he always is, but in this case his pompous bug professor actually calls for it. Daniels as the modern doctor hoping to start a new life in the country, is an excellent lead, a fine actor who's no show on the ""A"" list of Hollywood remains an utter mystery. However, it's with the big jolly blunderbuss that is John Goodman where the pic gets its frothy ""B"" movie fun. His inept, half witted but knowing pest controller, Delbert, engages in that small town Americana way. He is an innocent to the terrors of the world and that makes for a nice play off with the Arachnophobic Dr. Ross Jennings (Daniels). 

Nicely shot around Cambria, California, to fully realise the small town under arachnid siege, Arachnaphobia is the perfect comedy creeper for all the family to enjoy. So squirm and giggle together and watch out for any creepy crawlies in the corners of your home...  7/10"

You don't want to do anything about it? 

Summer of Sam is directed by Spike Lee and Lee co-writes the screenplay with Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli. It stars John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody, Mira Sorvino, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Rispoli, Saverio Guerra, Brian Tarantina, Al Palagonia, Ken Garito, Bebe Neuwirth and Michael Badalucco. Music is by Terence Blanchard and cinematography by Ellen Duras.

It was met with some indifference upon release, for many film fans went into it expecting another ""Se7en"" type serial killer thriller. What we get is Spike Lee doing a clinical character piece of how the residents in a South Bronx neighbourhood react to having a serial killer in their midst. It's 1977 and it's the time of the ""Son of Sam"" murders in New York City, mistrust and vile character traits start to come to the fore...

Lets face it, Spike Lee is often about as subtle as a sledgehammer over the head, but when it comes to characterisations - particularly when it comes to New York - he's one of the best around. He positively revels in dropping a group of unsound characters into a pressure cooker atmosphere and let them play out their respective human fallibilities. Who else could run a concurrent strand of a serial killer with a serial adulterer and produce such edgy and sly rewards?.

The musical backdrop to the plotting gives us the move from disco into the punk explosion, with the juxtaposition between good friends - Leguizamo's disco dancing philanderer and Brody's (excellent) punk rocker turning gay tricks to pay for his musical aspirations - proving to be more pivotal than ""Son of Sam"" (Badalucco off the chain) himself. All while the ""hood"" lowlifes gather themselves as an army to seek out the serial killer themselves, which unfortunately means anyone remotely not in their circle of friends is a suspect!.

It's no Lee masterpiece, for it's a touch too long and could have been trimmed by 15 minutes of pointless sexual exposition, while it sometimes feels like Lee is stuck between blaxploitation verve and mainstream appeasing ticket selling. Yet it's a bold piece of film making, with some genuinely jaw dropping sequences within. Prepare for a film that's big on characters during the reign of a serial killer and you might just appreciate Summer of Sam much more. 8/10"

Barry Sonnenfeld's Wild Wild West is a film that I have avoided for over 15 years. I have no frame of reference with the source materials, but even though I'm a big Westerns fan, it wasn't this, or the critical pounding it got on release, that kept me away. It was the original trailers for it, it just looked like a garbled over budgeted mess - which it kinda is. 

However, that's not to say there isn't fun to be had, because for all its many failings (poor effects, poor script, waste of a strong cast, superficiality), there is some verve and swagger, excitement, Will Smith's likability and some splendid gadgets. Having very low expectations no doubt helped me out, but I would hardly call this a 1/10 type of film. I say chill out with a beer, turn the home cinema speakers up and just roll with it, because thinking about it too deeply could possibly make you angry... 5/10 || I felt entertained by this.

It is a very bonkers film, though it actually works stupidly well in my opinion - the steampunk theme helps it of course. Will Smith and Kevin Kline are a good pairing as West and Gordon. Kenneth Branagh (Arliss) is amusing, I rate his character's design too.

I will say the effects around Smith and Kline haven't aged gracefully, but for everything else around them it still looks quite nice. I enjoyed the train shenanigans in particular. Salma Hayek (Rita) is kinda pointless in this, she's basically just there for gratuitous sexual reasons.

The film does also try to cram in an (obviously positive) message regarding racists and the such, which doesn't really fit and isn't as developed as could've been. <em>'Wild Wild West'</em> is at its best when it's being amusing.

A brainless watch. I'd, personally, recommend it - though a lot of people would evidently disagree with me. || THE GOOD:
1) It's funny

It's a movie that makes you think.**

Stanley Kubrick is one of those filmmakers who didn't make a lot of films. Over the course of his forty-year career, he only made thirteen feature films. Very little... However, if we look closely, almost all of them are familiar and immediately entered the pantheon of cinema. They are not perfect films, nor was Kubrick perfect no matter how methodical he was, and there are films of his that are unpalatable (I've already written that in some of them). But each of them, for its reasons, is its own, a very different work. In this film, he makes a case study around desire, sexuality and how we, individually or as a couple, deal with it.

The script follows a doctor and his wife. An apparently happy couple who, after a party where they both flirted with other people (without consequences), have a fight where she, perhaps to take away his self-confidence, confesses that she wanted to have another man, some time ago. The revelation leaves the doctor speechless. That night, he doesn't seem to know what he wants: he desires other women, but refuses their advances. But when a pianist friend tells him about a strange party, full of beauties, where he has to play blindfolded, he wants to see it up close. Yes, the party was a gigantic chic orgy, with touches of unholy religious ritual to accentuate the sense of sin and lust. Of course, the unwary guy ends up being discovered and unmasked… and from there, the film becomes denser, with the character increasingly afraid of what might happen to him.

The film makes us think a lot about sexuality, monogamy, the importance we give to marital fidelity. I don't know what it was like in 1999, but today it's common to see couples in open relationships, or relatively discreet saunas and swing clubs that throw liberal parties with some regularity. There is still a universe apart – private parties, organized by social networks and for guests only – and it is true that the rich and famous are much more demanding with the reservation of their intimacy, especially when they do naughty things. But what the film proposes to us is, not so much the refusal of monogamy, but that we think about the way we give up all other sexual partners when we really fall in love. The notion of personal sacrifice runs through the entire film (a woman who gives up an erotic fantasy for love, another who proposes to die in order to save an innocent, a man who refuses sex because he is married) and indicates that the best bonds we create in life involve choices and sacrifices in exchange for something greater. In fact, to be happy in a marriage, you need to keep your eyes wide shut to temptations.

With a very good and well written story, the film develops the characters very well and allows us to get to know them. For that, the film doesn't mind taking a slower pace that can leave some audiences exasperated. Decisive was the choice of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman for the main roles. At the time, they were Hollywood's pretty couple, and there's no doubt that Kubrick knew how to exploit their enormous personal and intimate chemistry, transporting it to the characters and the film. In fact, this may not be Kubrick's best film (that's relative!) but, for me, it's Cruise's best film so far.

Technically, the film has many positives. Kubrick gave an almost maniacal attention to detail and took his time filming. And we can see how each scene was shot in a detailed way, with the camera moving precisely, cuts surgically made, very long and very well edited scenes, taking advantage of the excellent cinematography and sets (where, of course, the mansion of the party stands out). Even more important is the way the director was able to work with the environment and the tension, growing and almost palpable. There is a lot of nudity in this film, including frontal nudity (Kidman herself did scenes where she is practically naked) and some sex scenes that, if not explicit, are very visual. Even so, the film is not, surprisingly, very erotic. I think the director didn't want sex to distract us or cut that tension he was looking for. As for the sound and soundtrack, I think it does its job well, but I didn't find it particularly remarkable."

There's a gigantic crocodile loose in the waters of Maine. A number of local hicks and big city eccentrics converge to try and stop the beast...

Wonderful! A modern day homage to the creature feature movies of lore. It's not a spoof, it's a fun packed tongue in cheek thriller, hell it may even have some literary worth as regards ecological concerns, while the cultural clashes that thrive are written with knowing skill.

Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda and Brendan Gleeson are superbly underplaying things, but they all get usurped when at the 20 minute mark Oliver Platt flies in on his helicopter and promptly owns the film from that point on. 

The script crackles with choice wit and sarcasm (the Gleeson/Platt on going feud an absolute joy), while Stan Winston provides beastly graphics that are blended with genuine suspense courtesy of director Steve Miner. Oh and ""Golden Girl"" star Betty White turns in a support slot - with a potty mouth!

Double view it with something like ""Tremors"", movies that know exactly what they want to homage. 8/10 || Not bad for a giant-gator Creature Feature, but Goddamn listening the dialogue in the first act is aggravating as sin.

I like a crocodile movie, they don't even have to be giant-sized, they make really good ""monsters"", and the reality of their danger sits in the back of your head.

The cast was great in this, though Bridget Fonda screams a lot, and I can't say it's very endearing.

They do sort of a ""unlikely crew"" trope with this, but most of the movie is dedicated to trying to find the thing in one capacity or the other.

I just feel they did a good job on everything all round, and while it's not phenomenal, part of me REALLY wants a re-make of this one."

A trio of misfit parapsychologists set up business as Ghostbusters. Ideal really because although slow at first, their business starts to boom as New York comes under threat from a supernatural force. 

Dan Aykroyd had this idea about space Ghostbusters in the future and the plan was to have himself and fellow Blues Brother, John Belushi, star in it. Pitching it to producer and director Ivan Reitman saw the basic concept retained but eventually it became what we now know as Ghostbusters. Co-written with Harold Ramis (also a co-star), Aykroyd's genesis turned not only into a ""monster"" smash hit at the box office, but also into a pop-cultural ""phenomenon"". In fact it actually is nice to re-visit the film these days without the public euphoria that swamped the movie for what seemed like a decade. T-shirts with the Ghostbusters logo on were everywhere, a telephone number if you rang it would have the Busters on answer phone, whilst the title song from Ray Parker Jr could be heard on the hour every hour on the radio. Even the catch phrase of ""who ya gonna call?"" was being used by the young, the old and the restless. Marketing genius or cynical tactics covering a sub-standard film? 

Well ultimately the film is really rather ace, it has some problems for sure (the effects were bad back then, never mind now and Ernie Hudson is a token addition to the team) but it's razor sharp with its wit and has a mass appeal to people of all ages. It's a basic odd ball's to the rescue plot, but the differing characterisations and comedy lift it considerably higher than similarly themed films that had come prior to it. That it boasts a bigger budget and Bill Murray of course helps the cause. Murray was brought in after Belushi had left the mortal coil, and promptly owns the film. His Dr. Venkman is a fusion of sarcasm, biting one liners and sees science as a way of getting girls. All of which blends mirthfully with the polar opposites that are Aykroyd's Stanz and Ramis' Spengler. Sigourney Weaver lights up the screen as the soon to be possessed, and chased by Venkmen, Dana Barrett and Rick Moranis does meek goof-ball supreme as Louis Tully. There's also value to be found in the script courtesy of some political nudging as the mayor is aware of vote power, while the human element badness and cynicism comes from William Atherton's (suitably weasel like) stiff suit Walter Peck. 

Given its success (it made a worldwide profit of almost $262 million) a sequel was inevitable. Amiable enough as it was, it was a pale shadow of the first film and even recycled the ending. So stick with this bad boy then, a fun film for all that serves as a reminder of when the world went Ghostbusters barmy. 8/10 || It was luck that I had this film and the sequel on my NowTV. 
I watched this in the afternoon and it brings me back fond memories. Not too scary but suitable for the spooky month.

Who ya gonna call?! || Like my review of Footloose, this is a classic, everyone has seen it, everyone loves it. It's one of those movies that came from your childhood and lasts well into the adult manboy years.

So, we're going to do a comparison with the remake.

For starters..the Ghostbusters plays it straight. The comedy is presented like a drama and that is usually the absolute best way to do comedy...straight.

And conversely the remake is just sort of over the top. And when comedies try that hard to be comedies, they stop being funny.

Another part would be scene length. And again, playing it straight, the opening of 1984 is short and honestly kind of scary...

...when the remake drags on and deals with characters that honestly have nothing else to do with the film but introduce it. You lose interest sort of fast.

And this can be seen again with the humor. The introduction of the car in the remake is prime example. Pulls up with a hearse, someone makes a joke about checking to see if there is a body in there....

...the scene SHOULD stop when they look at the hearse and cut away to a different scene. But the remake drags on and the joke loses momentum and falls flat when it COULD have been an easy laugh.

Conversely in 1984 you have jokes like the Twinkie that ends with ""tell him about the Twinkie"" and it is funny because it doesn't drag on in an effort to be funny. The same can be said about testing the proton packs, the joke ends fast enough for it to actually be funny.

And then there is the script and direction, the 1984 version stuck to it and made sure everything was tight, even when it was improvised, it wasn't allowed to get out of control.

But the remake the actors took control and the improvisation went on too long, even with scenes being cut.

So what you have is a tight and fast film that is a comedy played straight like it should be...and one that everyone knows and loves because of it."

It got panned because it couldn't live up to the first Ghostbusters. Well, what could? The first one was so original, so enormously popular than any sequel was bound to fail as far as matching it.

This second Ghostbusters was just fine, very entertaining and it was nice to see all the main characters back. It had a little nicer feel to it and was more family-friendly language-wise, so it even had some things going for it the first one didn't have.

The other major different in this sequel was watching Peter MacNichol, who reprized his ""Renfield""-type character from Mel Brooks' ""Dead: And Loving It"" comedy with Leslie Nielsen. Here, MacNichol plays ""Janosz Poha,"" another wacko with a thick Eastern European accent. He is hilarious, and elevates the enjoyment of this film. Otherwise, the rest of the cast plays and acts just as they did in the first film, which means you'll get a lot of laughs out of them The story just isn't as intense, that's all. No, it can't equal the original, but.....

The bottom line is this: Don't try to compare the two films. If you enjoyed the first, you'll like this.....period. || Who you gonna snore?

Ghostbusters II Is directed by Ivan Reitman and stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis & Ernie Hudson. Ramis & Aykroyd c-wrote the screenplay and it's a sequel to the hugely successful Ghostbusters from 1984. Plot follows on from the first film but five years later and sees the Ghostbusters disbanded after being derided as frauds and handed a bill for the damages incurred as they saved the world! However, a new supernatural threat is bubbling down in the sewers of New York and now more than ever the Ghostbusters are back in vogue.

It was probably asking too much for this sequel to be as sparkling as the first film. More so when one considers that there was a 5 year gap in between and a new decade was soon to arrive that firmly had no place for 80s nostalgia. Oh Ghostbusters 2 was a success, very much so, but after the rush of fans wanting some more from the kooky parapsychologists had died down, the feedback was very mixed from fans and critics alike. Understandably so since everything about this sequel is tired. The characters look bored and lack the expresso timing that was once evident, especially Murray who is badly underused here, and more troubling is that his Venkman, the best thing about the original film, is reduced to being a normal type bloke. That's criminal, because the spirited stuff falls to Aykroyd and co and tho they be solid pros, they ain't got Murray's wit and mannerisms.

The story too is weak. Featuring a seventeenth century tyrant and the inevitable rise of spooks unbound. Thankfully, tho, the effects are at least of the high and gloopy standard set first time around. And there's some tight gags in there for the knowing Ghostbuster ear. But repetition hangs heavy throughout, Ramis & Aykroyd seemingly not grasping that what worked in 84 will not totally transfer well to a new crowd who are now older and wiser. There's also the distinct feeling that this film is more about a cast get together to make some easy cash than enticing in a whole new audience. Peter MacNicol is a welcome introduction to proceedings as Janosz Poha, while more of ""slimer"" (who is now real cool) is never a bad thing. But the magic is gone and Ghostbusters 2 just comes off as shallow and dangerously close to soiling our love of the first picture. 4/10 || 'They're back!'

I have never watched that so I couldn't judge it in those terms, but as a film I enjoyed it I won't lie.

<em>'Inspector Gadget'</em> is very silly but self-aware, in a similar vein to <em>'Looney Tunes: Back in Action'</em> and <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em>. I enjoyed those two films and, while this isn't as good as those, I liked this enough. I probably wont ever rewatch, but I can see younger audiences finding enjoyment with it.

There aren't, admittedly, any super noteworthy performances here, but that's not to say Matthew Broderick & Co. are bad in this - they give what's necessary. There's a few interesting cameos in there, too.

There are a couple of fairly amusing moments, but it's the dumbness that I think they do well - it's stupid and they know it. Like those other films I mentioned earlier, you're gonna annoy a lot of people by doing that so I can see why this gets hate - I don't think 44% is fair though, but each to their own of course. || **A film that entertains without marveling, and that can frustrate fans of the cartoon.**

Inspector Gadget was an amazing cartoon, but it had a brief stint on Portuguese television. I remember him, and I really enjoyed seeing him, but I don't remember seeing him much longer than four or five years. Despite this, it was one of the cartoons that I was most interested in as a child. The live-action movie we have here, however, doesn't do it justice... which doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. Plain and simple, the film is what it is: a piece of entertainment full of weaknesses.

Designed to appeal to children and teenagers, I have serious doubts about the film's ability to appeal to adults, particularly fans of the original cartoon. It's not a bad movie, it's minimally funny and has some effective comic material, but most of the time it fails to make you laugh. Also, the film has bad dialogue and the script is quite poor and poorly written. So poorly written that I'm afraid of spoiling it if I say too much, so I'll limit myself to saying that the film follows the creation of Inspector Gadget and the birth of his archenemy, Claw.

The cast is one of the most redeeming qualities of this film. Even with a basic story and very weak material on hand, each actor did the best they could, and I'm pretty sure they all tried to put in the effort and be professional. However, some did better than others. Rupert Everett, for example, makes the most of his charisma and steals our attention whenever he appears, with well-placed, sarcastic humour. Matthew Broderick doesn't do poorly in this job either, but he seems to find much more difficulties with his character. Joely Fisher is attractive but has little to do. Mike Hagerty and Michelle Trachtenberg are relegated to the shadows most of the time.

Disney invested some money in the film, and it shows in the quantity and quality of the visual effects and CGI used. Gadget is very similar to the original, with the same clothes and the most striking gadgets from the cartoon, as well as the problems, confusions and breakdowns that have always characterized the character. The sets and filming locations help and do their part, as does the soundtrack, which contains a new version of the old cartoon theme song."

This is probably my favorite shark movie.  I know ""Jaws"" did a thing back when, but I like this better.  It doesn't mean it's a better movie, the same way that more people like pizza than salad even though salad is a better food.

The biggest part of why I like it so much better is that it's a survivalist situation, in an isolationist setting, and the sharks are ""intelligent"" so they're actively hunting the humans so it becomes a killer creature feature too.

The cast is really good, and you should probably recognize about half the faces, whether or not they've been in Marvel movies.

The split story lines bother me a bit, and more when they're voluntary, but it works.  And when someone gets eaten by a shark, everyone else greedily makes an opportunity of it in a good survivor's fashion.

This is a movie fueled by adversity instead of stupidity, as is a soft requirement for some movies.  I guess the ""stupidity"" is creating the situation in the first place

As I've had occasion to say in other reviews I've written, I'm not particularly fond of romantic comedies, although I believe I can appreciate quality and value when they're there. During the pandemic, when we were all shut up at home against our will (I handled it well, but I had friends on the verge of a nervous breakdown), a friend of mine spoke to me about this film and said he didn't like it at all, because it gave viewers a negative message, trivializing the act of leaving someone at the altar. At the time, I thought it was strange, but I ended up not seeing the movie. I saw it now, and I tend not to agree with my esteemed friend.

The script begins with a disagreement between a woman from a small town and a writer and journalist from the big city, when the latter writes, in his newspaper column, about her and the succession of fiancés she has already abandoned at the altar. Obviously offended, she responds to the article, causing him to lose his position at the newspaper. Of course, he doesn't give up: he goes to that city and decides to investigate her. The rapprochement between the two will eventually lead them to an unlikely romance.

In fact, I think my friend took the film too seriously. Anyone with intelligence understands the difference between a joke and something serious, so I don't think anyone will take the movie seriously. Also, the movie was released in 1999, and we are in 2022… in the present times, who is the couple that thinks about getting married? There are, of course, but they are few in a world where jobs, homes and romantic relationships are less planned to last a lifetime (it's one of the problems of the modern world, in my opinion, but it's the truth).

The film relies heavily on the performances of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, who we've already seen together in great shape in “Pretty Woman”. Personally, I liked ""Pretty Woman"" a lot more, as the characters were much more palatable. Here, we essentially have a duel of egos between two stubborn people who will eventually see the good in each other. There is also a very high degree of predictability in the story told, but this is one of the recurring problems in romantic comedies, where characters almost invariably end up at the altar. Despite all this, the work of Gere and Roberts is quite satisfying and will be able to please the fans of the genre.

On a technical level, the film doesn't stand out or bet particularly, preferring to play it safe and keep a very conventional aesthetic and look. It's almost like the dish of the day in that cafeteria where we have lunch every day, after work: made to be cheap and to please most customers. So we have sets, costumes and filming locations that are simply regular, standard cinematography and a bland soundtrack. The film stretches the script, there are pacing problems and moments when the film falls asleep due to sheer lack of subject matter. Much better is the design of the dialogues, quite witty and well-written."

The second feature film directed by future critical darling Stanley Kubrick, Killer's Kiss isn't a particularly good film. With its very basic ""B"" film noir plot, choppy editing, post-dubbing and ""interesting"" acting from the unknown cast, the film should really be a chore to get through. However, it represents a worthwhile investment of our time for two main reasons. One is of course to witness the early work of a most revered and talented director. The other is because of some indelible images that exist within the piece, images crafted around authentic New York locations.

The plot revolves around Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith), a 29 year old New York boxer at the end of his career, and his relationship with a dancer and her violent employer. Love, violence and revenge all crammed into one sweaty New York weekend. Kubrick co-wrote the screenplay with Howard Sackler, he also edited, co-produced and photographed the picture himself. All financed by cash generated from friends and family of the novice director.

While there is nothing to write home about in the writing, certainly there is no hint of the creative writing flair Kubrick would show later in his career, it's with the visuals - and to a lesser extent - the sound work, that this shows that the powerful director was quick out of the traps. The whole film comes across as some feverish fairy-tale, one which at frequent moments shifts to some sort of surrealistic nightmare. The effects are aided by the use of negative film stock and the tilting blend of opposing character scenes. Sexual aggression segues with a brutal boxing match, and a ballerina dancing sequence takes one away from the hustle and bustle of the loud streets. Streets where bizarre fez wearing musicians prance about gaily and where shadowy figures follow men down alleyways to enact a brutal crime. All distorting, memorable stuff, capped off by an axe fight in a mannequin factory, the dismembered parts used not only a weapons, but also as a point of reference to the weird thematics laid down by Kubrick.

With stark black and white imagery augmented by the harsh music, and Kubrick dallying with close ups and low angle camera shots, Killer's Kiss is never less than engrossing from a technical viewpoint. Think of it like that weird dream you had when you had taken too much cough syrup that one time, and you will then be half way there... 6/10"
247.0,The Killing,"Career criminal Johnny Clay recruits a sharpshooter, a crooked police officer, a bartender and a betting teller named George, among others, for one last job before he goes straight and gets married. But when George tells his restless wife about the scheme to steal millions from the racetrack where he works, she hatches a plot of her own.",In all its fury and violence...,"Crime, Thriller",85,1956-06-06,en,7.7,1594,1.955,"Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, Vince Edwards, Jay C.

The Killing is directed by Stanley Kubrick who co-adapts to screenplay with Jim Thompson from the novel Clean Break written by Lionel White. It stars Sterling Hayden, Marie Windsor, Elisha Cook Jr, Vince Edwards, Jay C. Flippen and Coleen Gray. Music is by Gerald Fried and cinematography by Lucien Ballard. 

Ex-con Johnny Clay (Hayden) has a plan to make a killing at the racetrack, with some special inside help he plots to nab $2 million in an intricate robbery. It looks a good thing, the right people are in place, but there's a potential spanner in the works in the shapely form of Sherry Peatty (Windsor), the unfaithful and devious wife of one of the robbers. 

Cheaply made by Kubrick and his producer partner James B. Harris, The Killing is a lean and mean mid 50's film noir. Poorly received at the box office and met with indifference by critics upon release, it's a film that has come to be noted as hugely influential - more so as Kubrick's reputation has grown over the passing years. Clocking in at under 85 minutes, film is told in a fractured narrative structure that at the time was viewed as an oddity. Story is constructed around crosscut flashbacks as the robbery is planned and then executed, with Kubrick's direction as meticulous as the actual robbery itself. It's not hard to understand why confusion was an issue back upon its release, but this is something that now comes off as something of a masterstroke, and this even if Kubrick was forced to tinker with the final product where it was decided to add in a voice-over to aid those troubled by the nonlinear narrative (which the director despised). 

In spite of some problems, such as the cheapo sets and some stiff performances from secondary characters, The Killing is quintessential film noir. Kubrick thrives on filming his characters in cramped surroundings, the use of angles very effective, and Ballard photographs superbly for the low-key interiors, thus the mood is perfectly set. Story is filled out with hapless characters, where destinies are defined by greed, betrayal and the devils trump card - that of bad luck. As is normally the case with the best film noir, it's a dame who holds the key to the misery here. Sherry Peatty (Windsor excellent) is cold and utterly bitch like. She has a hold over her cuckolded husband George (Cook Junior never better) that would be easy to detest, that is were it not for the fact George is so pitifully weak! From that coupling bursts a doom and bleakness that underpins the story, rendering the film with a fatalistic sheen. 

The Killing does have a dated feel to it, but only slightly (and not remotely irritatingly) so. While there's no denying that the budgetary restrictions - the voice-over and some less than good performances - stop this being the masterpiece of the crime genre some of us want it to be. However, it's a damn fine film, that's tense, exciting and very compelling, and it does deserve to warrant a place on a favourite list of any self respecting film noir fan. 8/10 || Though it's Sterling Hayden who takes top billing here, it's actually Marie Windsor who steals the show as ""Sherry"". She is the rather money-grabbing, bullying, wife of ""George"" (Elisha Cook Jr). Now he works in the cashier's office at the local racetrack where ""Mike"" (Joe Sawyer) works behind the bar. These two are to be lynch pins in a daring plan to rob the place of two million dollars as it's feature race brings in the punters. Ex-con ""Johnny"" (Hayden) is the brains behind the scheme that also includes a bent cop ""Randy"" (Ted de Corsia), marksman ""Nikki"" (Timothy Carey) and financier ""Unger"" (the familiar face of Jay C. Flippen). Meticulous planning is required, diversions are created and it all looks set fair. Except, that is, for the blabbermouth ""George"" who tells his wife - in a bid to retain her love for him (and money) - who proceeds to tell her lover ""Val"" (Vince Edwards) and so a bit of double-play is soon on the cards too. It's constructed almost like a jigsaw puzzle, this film. We do a little bit of work on one aspect of the story, then move timelines and/or locations to another, or to another character before it all gradually comes together delivering a really effective eighty minutes of crime drama. Although I thought the ending just a little bit of a let down, there are strong performances across this tautly directed and effectively scored story. There's quite a lively bit of action from strongman Kola Kwariani in here too that's quite entertaining. Well worth a watch."
967.0,Spartacus,"The rebellious Thracian Spartacus, born and raised a slave, is sold to Gladiator trainer Batiatus. After weeks of being trained to kill for the arena, Spartacus turns on his owners and leads the other slaves in rebellion. As the rebels move from town to town, their numbers swell as escaped slaves join their ranks. Under the leadership of Spartacus, they make their way to southern Italy, where they will cross the sea and return to their homes.",They trained him to kill for their pleasure ... but they trained him a little too well,"History, War, Drama, Adventure",197,1960-10-13,en,7.541,2240,6.02,"Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov",Stanley Kubrick,"epic, gladiator, roman empire, gladiator fight, slavery, insurgence, ancient rome, historical fiction, torture, ancient world, slave, technicolor, escaped slave, 1st century","The sword and sandal epic that has everything.

Spartacus is the Thracian slave who refused to be a Roman plaything, breaking out of their clutches he led the slave revolt that panicked the Roman Rebublic in circa BC 73, this film is based on that period in history.

Spartacus got off to a troubled start, original director Anthony Mann was fired by leading man Kirk Douglas (Spartacus) after a falling out, some of Mann's work does remain in the final picture, though, notably some of the early scenes in the desert are thought to be at Mann's direction. In came then director for hire Stanley Kubrick, who along with Douglas crafted arguably the greatest sword and sandal epic to have ever been made. One that holds up today as the one any prospective new viewers to the genre should seek out. Adapted by Dalton Trumbo from Howard Fast's novel (whilst also tapping from Arthur Koestler's novel, The Gladiators), Spartacus is a stirring experience highlighting the power of unity when faced in opposition to a tyrannical force. It's also boasting a number of intelligent and firmly engaging strands that are a credit to the excellent writing from the once blacklisted Trumbo. Politics figure prominently, whilst the story has a pulsing romantic heart beating amongst the blood and power struggles that are unfolding. Brotherhood bonds within the slave army are firmly established, and the love story axis between Spartacus and Varinia is very fully formed. We are in short set up perfectly for when the film shifts the emphasis in the second half.

So many great sequences are in this picture, the gladiator training school as Spartacus and his fellow slaves find that they have dignity within themselves - forced through a tough regime designed to set them up for blood sport entertainment to the watching republic hierarchy. The break out itself is tremendous for its potency, but even that is playing second fiddle to the main battle sequence that Kubrick excellently puts together. The Roman legions forming in military precision is memorable in the extreme (this before CGI, with Kubrick's directing of all those extras being worthy of extra praise from us). Then with the battle itself raging one can only say it's breath taking and definitely a genre high point. Then of course there is the sentimental aspects of Spartacus. Kubrick of course was never known for his warmness, but with the aid of Douglas they get it right and manage to pull the heart strings whilst simultaneously stirring the blood via the action, right up to the incredibly poignant and classical ending that stands the test of time as being cinematic gold. The cast are wonderfully put together, Douglas is fabulous as Spartacus, big, lean and brooding with emotion, very much a career highlight as far as I'm concerned. Laurence Olivier takes up chief bad guy villainy duties as Marcus Crassus, just about the right amount of sneering camp required for such a dislikable character. Peter Ustinov (Best Supporting Actor Winner) is in his pomp as Batiatus, Jean Simmons (perfectly bone structured face) plays off Douglas expertly as Varinia, with Tony Curtis (Antoninus), John Gavin (Julius Caesar) and Charles Laughton (Graccus) adding impetus to this wonderful picture.

Spartacus also won Academy Awards for Best Colour Cinematography, Best Art and Set Direction and Best Costume Design, with nominations rightly going to Alex North for his score and Robert Lawrence for his editing. It's a special film is Spartacus, excellently put together and thematically dynamite. Which while also being technically adroit, it's ultimately with the story itself that it truly wins out. Even allowing for some standard Hollywood additions to the real story (Spartacus most certainly didn't meet his maker the way the film says), it's emotionally charged and as inspiring as it is as sadly tragic. 10/10 || This historical/epic drama was one of those 50-60's movies that lasted for 3 and a half hours. It isn't perfect despite the production have being great in some points.

The main issue is that it isn't historical based (and who knows the history to the full extend?), but it was based on a Roward Fast novel of 1951 with lots of romanticized and non historical events.

Some things are history: like the basis of the dispute of the senate member involved in the rebellion, like Crassus (the main opositor), Grassus (the roman senator that was more a patrician than a warrior) and young Julius Cesar.

Played by Kirk Douglas, Spartacus was a Thracian man enslaved to work on the sulfur mines of Etna (that seems to be the same place that Barravas was filmed). Due to his rough and tempestuous humor, the is set to die by starvation - but his fierceness attracts a roman busniness man that trains gladiators. He start and training, getting better and better at this. 

Eventually he is introduced to the Britannia woman Varinia that the slavemaster gives to his gladiators' and starts to fell in love with her. After a visit of Crassus his wife (that just vanish from the movie after that) wants a dispute between 4 gladiators, just for entertainments - at the time they weren't cheap. They took years of training and investment, and historically they seldom fighted to the death, they usually were just killing machines for spectacles at the areas or killing of prisoners.

While his friend wins a fight and kills the opponent, spartacus fights bravely but loses to an Ethiopian gladiator named Draba that doesn't tries to kill after winning and jump for the spectators. This changes Spartacus views for everything.

He plans a scape with other slaves and just using kitchen tools they made a escape overriding the romans soldiers at the place and stealing their weapons, starting a slave revolt that rise moree and more though the villages and cities they pass by, till they camp at the side of the Vesuvius.

At this point the situation is a vexation to Rome's senate, that have a lesser guarnition of soldiers, with the majority in campaign on the east (india) and west (Iberia). Evry try to contain the rebellion fails.

Spartacus doesn't plan to take Rome or anything he just want freedom for him and his companions - so he bribe a circician pirate (Circicia was a place in modern day anatolian peninsula, at Turkey) to bring 5 ships to all be left from a port in the south of Italy.

Learing of this plans Grassus that was a fierce opponent of Crassus at the senate bribe the pirate to undone the deal, and tries to convince young senator Julius Cesar to attack Spartacus. He by his turn doesn't like this sort of low move and tells Crassus about the plans.

By this time the Iberian regiment is back and Spartacus doesnt much what to do other than fight to his life and try to do a rebellion at the capital, so a major battle is set to occur.

The movie has several weak points - instead of basing of what history told us and try to do an alternative historic end, in the romance of Roward Fast of 1951 he puts inconsistences of time, and characters that doesn't exists. The book was transformed in a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo (blacklisted by Hollywood by be part of the communist party in the Cold War Era).

The direction of the movie was to be by Anthony Mann that quitted seeing the scope and difficulty of the movie, thn it handled down to the young Kubrick that already filmed ""Paths of Glory"". Kubrick talent was recognized as well as his excenties and ways of working especially on the takes. This time he had budget of $12 million (equivalent to about $120 million in today's funds - and a return of 17 million) and a cast of 10,500 extras to work with.

For instance the had troubles with the veteran cinematographer Russell Metty, because Kubrick wanted the use of a 35-mm Super 70 Technirama format blown up to 70 mm film, since Kubrick preferred using the standard spherical format, that allowed him to achieve ultra-high definition and to capture large panoramic scenes. 

Kubrick also had wanted to shoot the picture in Rome with cheap extras and resources, but Edward Muhl, president of Universal Pictures, wanted to make an example of the film and prove that a successful epic could be made in Hollywood itself - this made the scenes at Rome and other to look cheap with the painted background. 

But the open scenes was another thing: just no short of espetacular due to the vastness of scenarios and number of extras. For example the battle used around Madrid 9,000 Spain infantry men to make the roman empire legions at move, filmed though a tower. The cries of ""Hail, Crassus!"" and "" I'm Spartacus!"" were recorded at a Stadium in a game with 76,000 expectators. No doubt this influenced ""I'm Sparta!"" from ""300"" on the 90´s.

The final battle scene is notoriously the best part of the movie that had for the most tedious parts and dialogues, not helped with the stylish 50-60´s orchestral Hollywood leitmotif technique by Alex North that even used ancient instruments o make the musics. At least for me the music were common place among all others of the era.

On the final battle (there were three battles in this revolt), most of the scenes had to be cut due to a negative reaction on a test screening due to the violence - scenes like the disremembering of an arm with gushing blood shows what we may had missed.

In the end, the movie tries to reach epic proportions hard to be reachable with the weak screenplay and producers (Edward Lewis). With the right producer and a better screenplay and music it could have been an true epic (as he just glimpsed what Kubrick could do if he had the command of the project).

To this day I still a true rendition of Spartacus and not a series for TV. At least the movie inspired Ridley Scott to make one of my favorite movies on the genre to this day, ""Gladiator"". But one scene that is maked in my mind on this one is before the fatidical last battle Spartacus walking thought the slaves camp seeing couples, families fiends and a old couple braced together, knowing of their fate and feeling the weight of his task ahead (juts a not: nobody knows the whereabouts of the real Spartacus he was never identified on the battlefield and nobody know what happened to him).

In the end the film won four Academy Awards (Best Supporting Actor for Ustinov, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design) from six nominations, and was a success (the standards for revenue return were different at that time)

I gave half an extra star and a favorite for Kubrick's courage on this movie, that would be way better. My score for it is 7,0 out of 10,0 a B.

Version watched: Criterion 2015 4K restoration based on 91s restauration of the original movie. || Kirk Douglas had the vision to back the previously black-listed Dalton Trumbo with his excellent screenplay for this epic tale of slavery and the struggle for freedom. He also led a cast with some of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen. Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov, Curtis and a wonderfully tender Jean Simmons who all lift this tale of a slave who rebelled against the tyrannical rule of his Roman masters and inspired thousands to follow him as they strove to escape, then defeat the armies of Rome. The cinematography, colour, costumes are all the stuff of artists and Alex North creates a score that carries the intimate and the grand scenes in equal measure. The principles of struggle against oppression and of brotherly loyalty ring true even now, and this film is so much more than a sword-and-sandals melodrama."
802.0,Lolita,"Humbert Humbert is a middle-aged British novelist who is both appalled by and attracted to the vulgarity of American culture. When he comes to stay at the boarding house run by Charlotte Haze, he soon becomes obsessed with Lolita, the woman's teenaged daughter.",How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?,"Drama, Comedy, Romance",154,1962-06-13,en,7.3,2133,4.3028,"James Mason, Shelley Winters, Sue Lyon, Gary Cockrell, Jerry Stovin",Stanley Kubrick,"hotel, depression, lolita, small town, secret love, based on novel or book, sexual obsession, summer camp, midlife crisis, loss of loved one, literature professor, widow, flirt, eroticism, youngster, motel, diary, seduction, provocation, fascination, one-sided love, forbidden love, adoptive father, older man younger woman relationship, sex with a minor","**_An attractive 14 years-old girl knows the power over males she has… and wields it_**

A middle-aged professor of French literature (James Mason) spends the summer in New Hampshire where he becomes infatuated by a 14 years-old girl (Sue Lyon), the daughter of the woman who rents him a room (Shelley Winters). Nothing good will come from this attraction if he cannot keep it in check.  

Helmed by Stanley Kubrick based on the book by Vladimir Nabokov, ""Lolita"" (1962) is a B&W black comedy and psychological drama that was controversial in its day (and still is) so the physical intimacy of the adult-minor relationship is only hinted at. Sue Lyon turned 15 during shooting and is surprisingly a good actress at such a young age. Don’t expect much exploitation of her beauty, though, beyond an early scene of her in a two-piece bathing suit.  

The character of Quilty has less of a role in the book and is believable. He’s basically a dark shadow of Humbert, mirroring Humbert's carnal qualities. Unfortunately, Kubrick allowed Peters Sellers to get out-of-control in the part, which spoils it (and the movie). Don’t get me wrong, Peter Sellers has great charisma, even here, but too many of his Quilty scenes are nonsensical or implausible.

The two worst examples are: When he shows up at that hotel and has that eye-rolling (ad-libbed) conversation on the porch while looking in the opposite direction of Humbert. Later he shows up at Humbert’s abode masquerading as a school psychiatrist threatening to have a group of therapists come over to observe Lolita's homelife, unless she can be in his play. Why Sure! It doesn’t help that Humbert curiously goes along with both without question.

While overlong by at least half an hour, the cast is a highlight and the drama is fairly compelling and sometimes amusing despite the quaint datedness of the production and the eye-rolling Quilty scenes. 

The film runs 2 hours, 32 minutes, and was shot in both America and England.

First thing that is patently obvious is that as a visual piece of work the film has few peers, from stunning shots of rolling hills to the lavish period detail, it quite literally is breath taking. The attention to detail by director Stanley Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott is admirable, whilst the costumes are of the highest order. I have never read the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray so have no frame of reference as regards the portrayals we witness unfolding. I have read that many find the film lacking in the humorous wit that is rife in Thackeray's page turner, yet Kubrick's take is full of satire surrounding the social standing that is the core beat of the story - well it certainly had me smiling anyways.

The film is pretty downbeat, thus, for a three hour movie it can bog down many a viewers patience. Which puts this into the movie for mood scenario bracket - because I personally wouldn't want to watch it if I was having a particularly blue day, so that is something newcomers to the film might want to bear in mind. There seems to be much division as regards Ryan O'Neal's performance in the film, and again having not read the novel I couldn't tell you if he nailed it. What I do know is that he seems perfect for the tone of the movie, and that really shouldn't be seen as a negative in my opinion. My only gripe really with it is that as a story it really doesn't engage me, I really didn't care about what happened to our title character or the assorted people close in his rapidly annoying world. Is that Kubrick's fault? Well he did his job with much style, the story just doesn't warrant a three hour epic, even when it's dressed up as splendidly as this most assuredly is. 8/10"

But that was from the rage he felt when realizing that while (in the 1980's) he might be able to elude multinational greed, he can't escape human avarice. O the tragedy of humans"

When Nang sees social worker Chandler Jarrell on television discussing his ability to find missing children, she solicits his expertise, despite his skepticism over being ""chosen.""",Eddie Murphy is the chosen one.,"Action, Adventure, Comedy",94,1986-12-12,en,5.913,1108,2.8016,"Eddie Murphy, Charles Dance, Charlotte Lewis, J.L.

Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey - one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa.

Is The Golden Child a product of its time? By that I mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to late 1980s audiences? For I can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, while the box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986. Yet since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but upon revisiting the film you find Murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best! 

Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and templated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain (Charles Dance so splendidly British), vibrant colour photography (Donald E. Thorin), and a cute kid with mystical powers. The film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. 

Ok! so now the CGI demon looks creaky, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really this isn't meant to be taken seriously. Watch as Murphy does a scratch number on a sacred pillar, note his visual comedy when he gets an answer to his question that he can't believe, or enjoy his lines to Charles Dance and to a silhouetted dragon woman - prime Murphy on show. A jolly good show and something of a bad mood lifter when required. 7/10"

Puberty is over! Onward and upward! 

Brighton Beach Memoirs is directed by Gene Saks and adapted to the screen from his own play by Neil Simon. It stars Jonathan Silverman, Blythe Danner, Judith Ivey, Bob Dishy, Stacey Glick, Lisa Waltz and Brian Dillinger. Music is by Michael Small and cinematography by John Bailey.

This is the first of what would become a trilogy of films detailing the adventures and learnings of Neil Simon's life trajectory. His alias in the three productions comes in the guise of Eugene Morris Jerome, here played by Silverman, and by Matthew Broderick in Biloxi Blues (1988) and Corey Parker in Broadway Bound (1992). This is set in 1937 Brooklyn, New York, and finds Eugene, a Polish-Jewish American youngster experiencing sexual awakening in a family home packed to the rafters.

Having never seen a Neil Simon play before I have no frame of reference, either here or with Biloxi Blues, the latter of which is a personal favourite. So taking it on its filmic terms only, it delivers much of the requisite razor sharp humour that was a trait of the hugely talented writer. The young version of Eugene here has sporting dreams as well as that of being a professional writer, his literary bent evident in his vocal discourse with his family and us on the fourth wall. He's the family gofer, a slave to his adoring but firm handed mother, as if battling the on-set of puberty wasn't taxing enough! 

Though primarily humourous in narrative drive, the serious side of family values is always a strong current within. Gambling addiction also features, so to does vivid sibling rivalry later in life, while the dangling thread of Polish family members trying to exit their homeland for a better life in New York strikes a poignant chord. I can't vouch for accents or adherence to natural race standards, but the sense of the period and areas (real location filming of course) is impressive - the cast uniformly tight to the material's various themes.

Obviously not for everyone, but for those not bothered by closeness to the play, and those who love the sort of zingy dialogue found in other Simon film adaptations, then this hits the spot for sure. 8/10"

However, despite them, Glover does carry the role, and Spielberg realized that this was a film adapted from a play.

A doctor in Los Angeles (David Allen Brooks) is instructed by his dying mother, a revolutionary geneticist, to destroy her work at the family homestead. So, he leads a team up there, but their stay is interrupted by some… thing.

""The Kindred"" (1987) is similar in spirit to “The Boogens” from six years prior and the soon-to-come “Slugs.” It mixes HP Lovecraft with horror bits from “Halloween,” “Alien” and “Jaws.” For instance, there’s an aged doctor in the periphery who’s reminiscent of Donald Pleasence’s Dr. Loomis, just less noble (Rod Steiger). It’s okay, but seems off somehow and therefore is the least of these, which explains its obscurity. 

The female cast is decent with Talia Balsam (Sharon), Amanda Pays (Melissa) and Julia Montgomery (Cindy), but the director evidently didn’t know how to shoot women.

While it won’t strike you at first, the movie ends up being a cabin-in-the-woods flick. It delivers the goods just enough if you’re in the mood for such a film but, like I said, it’s not exactly great or even really good. It needed another rewrite to flush out more entertainment.

It runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot at Laird International Studio in Culver City, but also nearby Los Angeles (the hospital) and Mentryville (Amanda’s house), which is an hour’s drive northwest of the city, just west of Santa Clarita.

Back when this was released I’m sure the black humor was almost scandalous (e.g. Seymour feeding body parts to the ravenous plant), but Corman got away with it because it’s such an inane, quirky comedy. A lot of the humor didn’t work for me and I personally don’t like black & white. But there are enough amusing elements to make it worth checking out and Jackie possesses a winsome sweetness that’s a pleasure to behold.

Directed by Gary Nelson, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold re-teams Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone from J. Lee Thomson's 1985 version of King Solomon's Mines, with equally bad results. Based on the creations of H. Rider Haggard, the emergence of Allan Quatermain onto the screen again was a desperate attempt to grab the coat tails of one Indiana Jones' success. Given how bad King Solomon's Mines (1985) was, you would be forgiven for wondering how on earth a sequel was given the go ahead, but this is explained by the fact both films were filmed back to back. More's the pity. 

Plot has Quartermain and his lady Jesse Huston off on some adventure to find Quartermain's lost brother at the fabled Lost City of Gold. Along for the ride are Umslopogaas (James Earl Jones) an axe wielding warrior, Swarma (Robert Donner) a nutty spiritual guru, and some other no mark plebians. What they find is a whole bunch of trouble via creatures and a despotic high priest (Henry Silva). 

Action is badly staged, effects work poor, while acting and dialogue is woefully inept (Chamberlain cheese sandwich/Stone shrill/Silva and Donner embarrassing). The best ""Z"" grade movies have fans and entertain because they know what they are, unfortunately this doesn't, it genuinely thinks it's a great adventure movie. Even the musical score is insulting, credited to Michael Linn, he basically just hacks into Jerry Goldsmith's score for ""Mines"", and produces a piece that is just two chords away from John Barry's iconic Indiana Jones music. As for the racist undertones... 

Bad film making. Period. 2/10 || _**Fun sequel with a great cast doesn’t have the same magic**_

Quatermain & Jesse (Richard Chamberlain & Sharon Stone) are about to travel to America to get married when Allan learns that his brother is missing after an expedition. They team-up with a powerful warrior (James Earl Jones) and a spiritual con (Richard Donner) to journey to remote east Africa where they find a lost city of gold. Henry Silva shows up as a malevolent priest while Cassandra Peterson (aka Elivra) plays a dark queen.

""Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold"" (1986) is the sequel to “King Solomon’s Mines” (1985), both knock-offs of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), but it lacks the magic that made “King Solomon’s Mines” an exhilarating ‘B’ adventure. It has the same fun tone, Chamberlain & Stone, excellent locations and colorful or cheesy props/effects/sets, but it has a different director and cowriter. It’s just nowhere near as compelling and is sometimes tedious.  

But the notable cast looks like they had fun and you can’t go wrong with the magnificent Cassandra Peterson, who has no lines; she just stands around looking great, albeit angry and mean. Stunning blonde Aileen Marson is also on hand in her one-and-only role. 

The film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Oudtshoorn, South Africa; Zimbabwe (Victoria Falls); and Laird International Studio, Culver City, California (e.g. river-cave scenes).

GRADE: C || It's Henry Silva who steals the scenes here as the maniacal High Priest ""Agon"" who meets gold-hunting explorers ""Quatermain"" (Richard Chamberlain) and ""Jesse"" (Sharon Stone) who are looking for someone. This time, it's his long long brother who has gone awol after reading the script and deciding that deepest Africa was probably best instead. Determined not to share the blame alone, the others head off on a search that introduces them to the axe-wielding ""Umslopogaas"" (James Earl Jones) and sees them having to deal with the perils of the wilderness. Now to be fair, at least they made an attempt to liven it up by heading to Zimbabwe for the filming, and that photography showcases this beautiful terrain and it's wildlife to full effect. Stone also has a go, here, and could never be accused of underplaying her part, but the rest of the cast deliver something that really reminded me of one of the Johnny Weissmuller ""Tarzan"" films that had a far-fetched, stereotype-riddled, plot. Indeed, it might have worked slightly better had it been in black and white - at least that might have helped out illustrating some of cultural and superstitious elements of this whilst making it slightly harder to see the wires holding the star as he engages in one too many set-piece action scenes that the editing doesn't exactly help. It's a film that out of it's time, this one, and is probably best this stays as lost as they city they are seeking."

Directed by Bob Clark and starring Judd Nelson (Weathers), Elizabeth Perkins, John Hurt and Darren McGavin, From The Hip is a quintessentially 1980s picture. Oozing a yuppie law firm vibe and with Brat Packer Nelson leading the way, it's no great shock to proclaim it as such really. That's not to say it deserves to stay back in that decade though, for although it hasn't aged well in context to our evolving societies, and as implausible as ""Stormy's"" legal shenanigans are, the piece serves up a nice blend of satire and legal ethic conundrums. 

It's also decidedly funny, that is until John Hurt arrives as a pompous suspected murderer and not only steals the film, but also swerves it to a far darker place. Perhaps it's a blend too far since the film is poorly rated by many? Maybe Hurt's preening, borderline psychotic peacock performance only serves to bring to light the deficiencies of the other cast members? What I do know is that my recent revisit to the film still brought many a chuckle as ""Stormy"" pulls his bag of tricks in the court room, and yes I was still on the edge of my seat during the gripping finale as Hurt's Douglas Benoit is called to the witness box. 7/10"

However, you could argue Woody Allen is tastefully romanticising such things as the family unit being central to daily life too much. After all, were families ever this much chaotic fun? Was life ever lived this way? Was there ever this degree of togetherness? And if so, then how was it ever lost? And, more importantly, can it ever be regained? In any case, Allen weaves his delightfully entertaining narrative thread through all aspects of radio in his life and the results are absolutely charming and spellbinding and they showcase Allen at his best. || “Joe” (Seth Green) is reminiscing about his childhood in a New York where he lived with his mum and dad and her extended family in some basic and cramped accommodation - it’s a bit like the “Bucket” household from the world of Roald Dahl, replete with cabbage soup, too. This family, and their neighbours, live their lives according to a pattern of routines. From day to day and week to week, they gossip, eavesdrop, work, sleep and chatter but there is one thing that’s a constant. They all listen to the radio. Music, drama, news, comedy and quizzes. Each of them has their favourite as it facilitates their imaginations in a society where even 15c for a secret ring was beyond their economic means. Woody Allen quite engagingly crafts this drama to pair up the characters on the screen with aspects of the radio broadcasts that provided not just factual realities of life as WWII gradually expanded to include the USA but to the more fanciful lives of those stars whom they enviously saw on the big screen. As he looks back on this time, “Joe” finds his memories themselves have started to fade but that the mnemonics provided by his association with the radio at this formative time of his life still provide a template for his, admittedly somewhat rose-tinted, memories. It’s the usual assembly of Woody Allen cast here, but this time his writing carves them out quite quirkily unique roles, like an human jigsaw puzzle that looks improbable until you realise that thanks to the conduit of the wireless, they can all fit together - though it’s not always that tight a fit! Of course there’s the usual slice of Jewish neuroticism included, but here the diverse range of characters and the humour derived from the medium upon which we are reflecting really does either tug at the nostalgia strings you do remember, or maybe at ones you don’t but would like to. Dianne Wiest possibly takes the acting plaudits as the unlucky-in-love “Aunt Bea” but essentially there isn’t an individual star, more a community of family and friends that those of us who grew up in tenements anywhere in the world whilst the radio exercised it’s potent convening powers can associate with.

Deadtime Stories walks the like, it isn't exactly adult and it isn't exactly child friendly either, but so went most of the movies from the 80s, I mean Robocop was a huge hit with kids back then, they even made toys and cartoons and by today's standards CPS will take your kids away if you watch it.

But back then, sticks and stones broke bones, now words, and kids where less sensitive, tougher, less influenced, and more able to separate reality from entertainment... that or we just Molly Coddle too much these days

The problem here though isn't so much the content as it is the humor.  It needed to choose if they were going to make the jokes more geared for adults or more geared for kids for them to really land.  The mixture between the two is a little weird and off-putting and, though it is entertaining and has it's funny moments, it clearly couldn't decide which it wanted to appeal more towards.

But in the end, however, it doesn't matter, it's still a cheap fun movie to watch, and is all it was ever supposed to be."

It's the 1950s and young Hogarth Hughes happens upon a visitor from space ..... in the form of a giant iron man.

Delightful animation adaptation of Ted Hughes' much beloved 1968 novel ""The Iron Man"". Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran through many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being ""because we don't understand it, lets destroy it"" is something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10

His mother (""Annie"") is having nothing to do with this, especially after one of his candidates manages to just about wreck the diner where she works and turn scrap man ""Dean"" into ""Deana"" in the process. Dejected at home alone, he hears some strange noises and armed with his pop gun and a torch, sets off into the forest to find the source. When he discovers that the fisherman's tale wasn't so long after all, the pair begin to bond and the story takes on a familiar look. It does have shades of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" as it shows clearly the typical reaction to something strange, new and big - the government and the army are soon in hot pursuit with little intent on diplomacy but with plenty of tanks, missiles and ultimately the ""bomb"" - just as destructive to them as to the ""monster"". It's really the characterisations that help this stand out. The style of animation is simple yet potent, the creature positively emanates a degree of decency and charisma and the relationship with the young boy that manifests itself to us is one that amiably resonates whether that be with a real friend, an imaginary one - or one from outer space who doesn't much like guns and has an almost infantile approach to life. Proof that when you have a solid story and tell it well, the gadgets, gismos (and there are a few, here) and visual effects don't matter so much as the soul of the thing."

Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe takes on the case of a deeply troubled boy named Cole Sear. At first Cole is reluctant to be helped, but as Malcolm gets closer to the boy, Malcolm learns the root of Cole's fears, he claims he sees ghosts.

The Sixth Sense was a monster hit back in 1999, a deftly crafted ghost story with a kicker that was talked about by all and sundry, the box office bulged and the critics did rave. Nowadays you will find hundreds of people proclaiming that the film is boringly formulaic, that they worked out the film's premise easily in the first quarter of the film, or that the film is a mere cliché, funny how I don't remember it like that back in 1999! The box office bulged because many went to see the film more than once, they went (myself included) back to see just how director M. Night Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Director) managed to bluff us and pull the rug from under our feet. I remember vividly both times I saw it in the cinema, the crucial turning point of the piece bringing a collective audible gasp from the viewers sunken in their respective seats, that's the sort of impact that carries a film's reputation far and wide, and that's the reason why I will never rate the film lower than 10/10.

Repeat viewings of The Sixth Sense obviously dim its star appeal because we know the tricks of the directors trade, but the film still ranks to me as one of the best of its type for so many other reasons rarely mentioned. The writing from Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Screenplay) is surprisingly complex, the piece masquerading as a horror picture is emotionally charged, linking children with the paranormal through loss and a need for understanding, the need for closure of unresolved differences, but chiefly and crucial to the film's heart is the message of connection before it's too late.

The performances are incredible, Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is perfectly understated, all the pointers for the denouement are there for us to see, but such is the actors performance, and we now know he is cutely having to play his cards close to his chest, are hidden from us until the revisit of the picture reveals it all. Hayley Joel Osment (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actor) is wonderful, for a child performance in a film of this type to not be over sentimental, is quite an achievement. Sympathetic Cole may be, but Osment never lets it become less than the accepted level of child vulnerability. Rounding out the great trio of leads is Toni Collette (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actress) as Cole's mother, Lynn, fabulous in portraying the love and confusion in Cole's troubled world, this story arc between the two is expertly realised. The direction from Shyamalan is very restrained, forgoing out and out shock value for periods of disquiet, he uses sounds to make the audience sense the unease unfolding in this creepy tale, while his camera work, full of draw ins and pull outs-and subtle side shifts, is adroitly in tone with the narrative. The score from James Newton Howard flits beautifully between the uneasy periods and the sustained moments of query, while Tak Fujimoto's cinematography puts a gorgeous funereal texture over this part of Philadelphia.

If you haven't seen it then don't believe the naysayers, because The Sixth Sense deserved every penny/cent it made, its a wonderful, creepy, and yes, at times, a beautiful picture. A film that still ranks as one of the best ghost stories ever crafted. 10/10 || _**Bruce Willis stars in Shyamalan’s supernatural drama/mystery**_

A child psychologist (Bruce Willis) tries to help a boy (Haley Joel Osment) who has a unique problem (or gift) and is called a “freak” by his peers. Olivia Williams plays the wife of the therapist and Toni Collette the mother of the boy.

Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan, ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) was his breakout film. It’s a slow-burn drama with paranormal elements. When my wife & I first saw it we didn’t know anything about the story except everyone was raving about it; and the ending really does elicit a ‘Wow’ response. 

Seeing it again, I was wondering if the movie works if you know the big reveal and it does. While the drama’s a little tedious, it’s refreshing compared to modern blockbusters with their idiotic explosions every five minutes. Furthermore, the film is aesthetically pleasing, which is helped by the unique locations (Philadelphia & areas nearby). Lastly, it is interesting to view the flick to see how Shyamalan was able to successfully hide the twist.

The movie runs 1 hour, 47 minutes.

GRADE: B || It is the final and greatest plottwist that puts a smile on your face, as all the puzzle pieces fit at last.

In the title role, he is a millionaire who presents an outward image of a man who has everything, but privately is meticulously planning and executing a bank robbery that nets him over $2 million. When the insurers bring in their best investigator - the glamorous and sassy Faye Dunaway, she quickly susses out what's what and we have a cunning game of cat and mouse tinged with some unsentimental romance. The Michel Legrand score is superb; the dialogue taut, occasionally witty and Norman Jewison's direction is subtle and attractive leading to the scene at the end that you could never forget. Great stuff. || They don't make 'em like this anymore, and that might be a good thing. McQueen is millionaire Thomas Crown, who hires a bunch of D.B. Cooper look-alikes to knock over a bank and give the money to him. He jets to Geneva with cash in tow, and opens a secret account that he uses to pay off his gang in installments. Fine. Jack Weston plays Erwin, one of the crooks who you just know is going to screw everything up. The Boston police are stumped, led by the lead stumped detective Eddie Malone (Paul Burke). There are no prints, no one seems to be able to give an accurate description of the gang, and the cops are at a dead end. Enter, almost thirty six minutes into this, Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway). Vicki is stylish, comes off as kind of dumb, and the perfect insurance investigator. She and Malone spend about three minutes deducing Crown is behind the robbery. Vicki is in it for the money, she gets ten percent of the more than two million dollars stolen as her salary. Vicki goes to the extraordinary means of kidnapping Erwin's child in order for him to get a large amount of money and prove he had something to do with the robbery. Vicki also makes herself available to Crown, under the watchful eye of Malone's cronies. Crown and Vicki fall in love, or is Vicki taking this investigation into some questionable territory? She lays all her cards on the table, telling Crown she is on to him, and literally ON him. Most of the rest of the film consists of this battle of twits, as one tries to outsmart the other. Finally, Crown comes up with the ultimate test for the unflappable Vicki, offering to rob the bank again and see if she will turn him in or not.

This film premiered in 1968, and was the basis for the 1999 superior-in-every-way remake starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. I, too, premiered in 1968, and felt ancient while witnessing what the fashion and interior design worlds were forcing onto my young mod parents. McQueen is cool and confident, Dunaway is cool and confident, and the film is cold and aloof. The viewer does not care one iota for these people, and I think the director senses this. Jewison pulls out every cinematic trick available- thank God as a nation we were able to reject the split-screen process and recognize it for what it was- stupid. The investment made in these two characters is so minimal, I knew every move they would make. Watching this is like watching an episode of ""Columbo."" The crime occurs, we know who did it, and we are supposed to be entertained by the process of detecting. In this film, the sexual byplay and tension is supposed to be the entertainment, and it is not. The chess scene is cutesy, the long kiss does not seem that long, and is concluded with another of Jewison's tricks. ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" is one of the worst Best Song Academy Award winners ever. It sounded like it was written in a recording studio bathroom while the singer cleared his throat and the orchestra tuned their instruments. Michel Legrand cannot decide if this film is a Hollywood romance from twenty years earlier, or a modern film defying those old conventions. He is all over the map. In the end, Crown's motive for all of this is that he is bored- I know how he feels. As Dunaway chokes back a sob at the end, and shows the only emotion in ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" I choked back my popcorn and motioned for the STOP button on the remote."

I really wanted to like this movie. What could go wrong with Pierce Brosnan as the lead and John McTiernan at the helm of a sophisticated heist film? Sadly, it wasn’t what I had hoped. The Thomas Crown Affair was more of a romance movie with some art robbery mixed in. The film’s musical score reminded me of cheap elevator music that distracted much more than enhanced. The movie also threw some rather long, awkward sex scenes and nudity that were completely unnecessary. Those scenes are always unnecessary to me, but these were extra cringe.

Two carefree teenage girls are jailed in Thailand for allegedly smuggling Heroin while on vacation.

It has become the stuff of reality nightmares, seemingly every year there is the reports of foreigners abroad caught smuggling drugs. Quite often the innocence is starkly protested, claims of being duped or threatened into being drug mules through customs borders. Brokedown Palace is an interpretation of one such instance.

There's a viable complaint about the film that it condenses the harsh realities of the surroundings, this ""Brokedown Palace"" is not portrayed as the dirty hell holes they so often are in reality. This initially gives the film a sort of false feel, that we are being fed a watered down Hollywood production of something very serious.

However, looking deeper into the picture as a character piece, Jonathan Kaplan's film beats a mighty heart and has brain staying power as well. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale (both superb) are the two friends at the centre of this mystery. Story is more concerned with how their friendship copes under the trying circumstances. Through the initial shock of their situation, to the faux trial, the interactions with others and the relationship they have with their American lawyer, Hank the Yank (Bill Pullman). There's also the not small matter that one of the girls might actually be guilty as charged? Which really gives the piece an intriguing kick.

Unfortunately it falls down in other areas. How come the girls are perfectly coiffured? Quite often splendidly attired in cosmetics? As Kaplan strains for authenticity in human interactions, he loses credibility elsewhere because these two girls look like actors who have had a ""don't make me look ugly"" clause inserted into their contracts. Ultimately when the story is dialled into the two girls and their friendship, Brokedown Palace hits the heights required, elsewhere it's a disappointment and it's not hard to understand why the two lead actresses practically disowned the film shortly after their publicity commitments were over. 6/10"

In 1978, four teenagers from Cleveland plan to go to a KISS concert in Detroit and have many misadventures reaching their goal. The four are played by Edward Furlong, Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello and Sam Huntington.

“Detroit Rock City” (1999) features great rock/metal from the 70s by KISS, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult, Van Halen, Sweet, Thin Lizzy, Nazareth, Styx, David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Black Sabbath, Ted Nugent, the Ramones, etc. There are some fun moments, but the tone is too over-the-top for its own good and the story isn’t very compelling. Couple this with some odious bathroom non-humor, a lack of attractive women beyond Natasha Lyonne and the negative one-dimensional depiction of the protagonists and you have a curiously disappointing teen flick.

The focus on pot-obsessed dudes is disingenuous since Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons were never into the drug culture; their idea of a party was working hard creating music, performing, touring, making money and celebrating gorgeous women. Unsurprisingly, mind-blowingly beautiful females were always attracted to KISS and frequented their concerts; so were dynamic, talented males. I’m not saying pot-worshipping, denim-clad waifs weren’t an element of their fan base, but KISS devotees always involved WAY more than this.

No wonder Paul Stanley lamented: ""To call it a KISS movie does it a disservice, because it does a disservice to the KISS fans, which is what it's really about.""

We open with a beach approach to the Medina castle, a big monolithic structure hulking on a cliff edge - naturally accompanied by a misty shroud - we know from this moment on that unease is about to become our middle name. Once inside the castle it's evident that it is a major player in our story, roaring fireplaces and secret chambers all excellently framed by Corman and his team. A story of madness, deceit and sadistic ancestry then plays out to the full to make The Pit And The Pendulum one of the Poe adaptations leading lights.

Enlisting the brilliant Richard Matheson to flesh out and extend the Poe short story, he's the perfect man to bring about a Gothic classic. Corman again uses Vincent Price as his leading man and he's rewarded with a quite delicious performance from the big man, where camp and burgeoning madness go hand in hand like they were always meant to be a team. The rest of the cast are naturally trailing in the shadow of Price's greatness, but a noteworthy mention must also go to the good work from Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. Floyd Crosby is again on board for cinematography duties, beautifully realising the lush colour and the doom laden feel of the Medina castle. Then there's Corman himself, who puts in some of his best work here, his use of the camera really adding to the burgeoning sense of dread that flows throughout the piece - the high point a stunning POV victim sequence of the pendulum of the title that is just one of the many technical highlights on show. 8/10 || The colorful flashbacks, the beautiful settings, the delicious revenge, and  you got Vincent Price as well. Directed by Roger Corman and Matheson doing the screenplay. And of course, let's not forget this is a Poe story.

This is so good especially as the ending comes. Reminds me of <I>House on Haunted Hill (1959)</I> and if you remember that ending then you know what I am talking about.

Definitely worth seeing as it checks off so many like boxes in my book. || _**Haunted chateau, cobwebs, rats, grisly cadavers, adultery, murder and a torture chamber**_

In 1546, a man from London (John Kerr) visits an ominous castle on the coast of Spain to find out the mysterious events surrounding his sister’s sudden death (Barbara Steele). Vincent Price plays the lord of the manor, Luana Anders his sister and Antony Carbone his doctor.

""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (1961) was the second in Roger Corman’s “Poe cycle” of eight movies from 1960-1964, plus other Poe-like flicks, like “The Terror” (1963).

Like practically all of the Poe adoptions of the 60s, including those done by other directors, e.g. the “The Oblong Box” (1969), this film was simply inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and is far from a faithful adaption. Yet it was the most successful at the box office and Richard Matheson did a great job of fleshing out an entertaining story, especially considering the one-dimensional proceedings. What I mean is that the entire story takes place in the forbidding castle, except for a couple coastal shots. 

From the 70s to the present horror flicks have resorted to increasing gore to shock audiences while filmmakers in the 60s had to focus more on spooky atmosphere, melodrama and creepy innuendo mixed with ghastly shocks, albeit relatively bloodless. This is a colorful eerie flick for the Fall season (or any season) if you’re in the mood for dark castles, haunted hallways, horrific chambers, cobwebs, Medieval décor, gallantry, sinful secrets and the threat of ghastly death. 

Both Luana Anders and Barbara Steele were only 22 during shooting and attractive.

AIP was basically the American version of Hammer in England, so devotees of Hammer horror should eat this up.

The movie runs 1 hour, 20 minutes, and was shot at Raleigh Studios, Hollywood, with the coastal shots done at Palos Verdes, which is about 20 miles south on the seaside.

Visually appealing and trippy in its telling, The Masque of the Red Death is a very acquired taste. Directed by Roger Corman, the film stars Vincent Price as the diabolical Prince Prospero who holds fear over a plague infested peasantry while jollying it up in his castle. The screenplay by Charles Beaumont and R. Wright Campbell is based upon a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe, while part of the film contains a story arc based on another Poe tale titled Hop-Frog. It's the 7th of 8 Corman film adaptations of Poe's works.

Sinister yet beautiful (Nicolas Roeg genius like on photography), ""Red Death"" has proved to be the most divisive of all the Corman/Poe adaptations. Choosing to forgo blood in favour of black magic dalliance and general diabolism, the film is arguably the most ambitious of all Corman's love affairs with Poe's literary works. With Price gleefully putting gravitas of meanness into Prospero, the film also greatly benefits from the intelligent input to the script from Beaumont (many Twilight Zone credits). This is, strangely, an intellectual type of horror film, offering up observations on the indiscrimination of death and proclaiming that cruelty is but merely a way of life. 

God, Satan and a battle of faith, are all luridly dealt with as the story reaches its intriguing and memorable closure. It's a very tough film to recommend with confidence, and certainly it's not a film one wishes to revisit too often (myself having viewed it only twice in 30 years!). However, the one thing that is a cast iron certainty is that it's unlike most horror film's from the 60s. It's also one of Price's best performances. Gone is the camp and pomposity that lingered on many of his other horror characterisations, in its place is pure menace of being. A devil dealer shuffling his pack for all his sadistic worth. 

You may feel afterwards that you must have eaten some weird mushrooms, or that the last glass of wine was one too many? You are however unlikely to forget ""The Masque of the Red Death"" in a hurry. 7/10 || ***Castles, peasants, diabolical princes, plague, death and Vincent Price*** 

During what appears to be the late Medieval era in (presumably) Britain, pompous Prince Prospero tyrannically reigns, terrorizing the serfs, while holding up in his castle with other “royals” during the plague of the Red Death. Hazel Court plays his seasoned nefarious babe in the castle whereas Jane Asher appears as his new interest, a virginal, God-fearing peasant girl.        

Produced & directed by Roger Corman for American International, “The Masque of the Red Death” (1964) is Gothic horror with a huge rep based on the Poe yarn from 1842. It has a good Gothic mood (similar to Hammer horror of the period) and a heavy subtext, but I found the story relatively dull. I prefer Corman's ""The Terror,"" which came out the year before and was considerably cheaper. The sets & costumes are colorful and the cast is noteworthy, but the sets sometimes look artificial. “Conqueror Worm,” aka “Witchfinder General” (1968), has a more authentic feel while “Cry of the Banshee” (1970), also from American International, rehashes similar territory and is pretty much on par.

The overt satanism might be surprising for a film shot in 1963, but this can be observed in comparable contemporary movies, like “Devils of Darkness,” shot in 1964. Neither film paints satanism in a positive light, but Anton LaVey capitalized on this new interest and sprung his “church” of satan in 1966.  

The alluring young redhead, Jane Asher, was Paul McCartney's girlfriend in the 60s. During production in December, 1963, she brought Paul to the set for lunch wherein he met Corman. This was the latter’s first film in England and he didn’t know who McCartney was. The Beatles’ first significant gig in nearby London was that night and Roger wished Paul well. The next day Corman read the gushing (and deserved) praise for the Beatles & their performance in the newspaper; it was the beginning of Beatlemania.  

The movie seems to be set in the Middle Ages, perhaps the mid-late 1300s when the Black Death reigned. But there is no actual indication in Poe's tale that the story has to happen before 1500 or even 1600, 1700 or 1800. The “Red Death” is an imaginary plague and therefore the story does not HAVE to occur in the 1300s when the Bubonic Plague swept Europe. The events could even take place in the future.

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot on sets left over from Becket (1964) at Associated British Elstree Studios, Shenley Road, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England, just northwest of London.

It lacks the unique sense of despair and menace of one's own child perhaps being the Antichrist, and the suspense is neither as taut nor as skillfully handled, but there are some great death scene set-pieces here, and it's not as bad as horror fans would let you think it is. I have a special place in my heart for the religious thriller, so perhaps I'm a tad more lenient than I should be in my grading, but I could very well say that the devil made me do it, or at the very least, his spawn. Jerry Goldsmith does another fine soundtrack, albeit not with the two Oscar nominations and one win this time around, while William Holden and Lee Grant do a credible job of replacing stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, whom Damien had no qualms dispensing with in the first film. The original is essential viewing for anyone, while the first two sequels are fine fare for any contemporary cinematic (by that, I mean of films since 1970) horror or religious thriller aficionado. || Actually not half bad and kind of enjoyed this one a bit more than the first film.

I think the problem with this follow up is that having already been exposed to the style of horror this offers: the sharp violin music, tight facial close ups, and the use of an animal (in this case it is a crow) as his implement of choice, there is very little by way of a shock factor. Holden is way past his best as an actor, the dialogue adds little to the rather lacklustre sense of menace and the ending is completely devoid of any real jeopardy.

The Final Conflict is directed by Graham Baker and written by David Seltzer and Andrew Birkin. It stars Sam Neill, Rossano Brazzi, Don Gordon, Lisa Harrow, Barnaby Holm and Mason Adams. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Phil Meheux and Robert Paynter.

The third and final part of ""The Omen Trilogy"" sees adult Antichrist Damien Thorn (Neill) now as a massive mover in industry and about to shift towards politics. As he surges towards the top, with a biblical prophecy about to come true, the second coming of Christ and a religious order look to be the only hope for mankind. 

Although it's undeniably the weakest of the trilogy, this does however close things down without utter embarrassment. Bringing to attention Sam Neill as an actor to note, where he is splendidly sinister, we are however burdened with a too long running for what is a surprisingly bloodless affair.

The dark shades in the narrative are strong enough to keep us hooked in (yikes, infanticide), but there's too many unanswered questions and ignorance of continuity requirements from the previous two films. While it ends on a hopelessly twee religious Christmas card crescendo.

Ultimately it's more a case of being one for fans of the series only, where the story reaches the conclusion for those who began the journey back in 1976. For casual observers, though, the lethargic nature of this particular beast is likely to bore and grate. 6/10 || Sam Neill was great, even with some of the cheesier dialogue, as Damien. Feels a bit of an underwhelming conclusion to a trilogy but still was entertaining in a shocking way, going places not many films go... **3.0/5** || I am not much of a fan of Sam Neill at the best of times, and he really did not possess the skills to be menacing at all here. Still, this is way better than the second in the trilogy. Now running his huge ""Thorn"" conglomerate, ""Damien"" sets out to thwart the newly born Nazarine baby whom, together with the sacred daggers, could still stop him becoming ruler of the world. In true Herodian style, he tries to make sure all boys born between midnight and 6 am on the fateful day die; but when he discovers that the true bairn lives much closer to home, he must get his own hands dirty. It's very much a hybrid of the first one this and it's too long, but it's nice to see Rossano Brazzi (""Barefoot Contessa"" (1954) and ""Italian Job"" (1969) on screen again, and it does move along reasonably quickly to an ending that given it's called ""The Final Conflict"" really doesn't leave too much to our imagination. It's not great, but it's not rubbish either..."

Lloyd Bridges is entertaining as the air traffic controller as is Robert Stack as the man trying to to talk down the stressed wartime pilot whom he used to command. The visual jokes are occasionally a bit too slapstick, but it's the writing that makes this funny - it is a pun writer's wet dream with plenty of risqué double entendres and literal interpretation of language that creates ample enjoyable ambiguity and humour. Clearance Clarence and Roger, Roger - it's quickly paced and unlike so many comedies from the 1970s really does raise a smile 40-odd years later when political correctness would probably throttle this at birth.

Can he stop it from crashing into the moon-base and thereby really irking William Shatner's ""Murdock""? Most of the cast from the first outing have stuck with this, and there are quite a few entertaining parodies for the likes of Burr, Shatner, Chuck Connors, Bono and Rip Torn but the comedy ship had already sailed. This is a feeble imitation that struggles right from the start to find that sweet spot; the humour is more crass and vulgar delivering more emphasis on the disjointed box office cameos rather than providing us with a decent plot. It's watchable but quite forgettable. || **A sequel that should never have been made because the first film did everything there was to be done.**

After the success of “Airplane”, there was an immediate desire to make a sequel. However, the creators of the first film had serious doubts about this because they felt that they had run out of jokes about airplanes, that the film had done almost everything it could do and that there wasn't really a logical continuation for that work. And I think that feeling had a strong impact on the way this film was imagined: we are no longer on a plane, but on a space shuttle heading to a human colony on the Moon, somewhere in a future where the technologies and clothes are the same as from the period in which the film was made.

It is Ken Finkleman who directs and scripts, due to the refusal of the original creators to embark on this new project. New direction, new creatives, new team, but the “recipe” used was virtually the same as the previous film: situational comedy, sometimes quite mischievous, in a succession of jokes that may or may not work well and resemble a kind of collage of humorous sketches united by a common thread. The film's humor is reasonably good and I think there was a substantive effort to match the quality of the initial film. However, I believe that the directors/writers of the first film were right when they said that the basic premise was tired, and that it would not be a good idea to make a new film that was too identical.

In fact, the film's atmosphere is very warm, the ideas surrounding space travel are very far-fetched, the dialogues are excessively identical to those of the first film and even some of the best jokes are recycled and reused, in an effort to copy and paste that demonstrates a certain mental laziness. The pacing is decent enough, but the film, in general, doesn't give us an experience that could be said to be satisfactory. In addition to all this, I felt that the film also reuses part of the environments and settings from the first film. That is, if the story is set in the future and inside a lunar shuttle, why on earth does it continue to resemble the interior of a common plane? Once again, laziness, lack of investment in the project and, perhaps, lack of a decent budget.

The cast is, to a large extent, the same as what we saw in “Airplane” with the same characters and saying the same jokes, in the same situations. I can't say that the actors didn't try to make an effort and give us a job well done, but I'm sure they received bad material and were part of a project that should never have gotten off the ground. One of the most obvious absences is Leslie Nielsen, an actor veteran enough to have certainly realized that it would be a bad idea to take part in this new film. Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty are back, but they are not that interesting and the work they do is very weak. William Shatner is one of the few actors who deserves a positive rating, and who manages the job well enough."

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo do return and are as they were before. The most interesting bits in regards to the cast, for me anyway, are the appearances of Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle. The running gag with the latter actor is probably the best part of this movie, to be honest.

The former is a bit of a loner being raised by his rather puritanical Pentecostal father. He absconds into the care of Anglican ""Stratton"" (Tom Wilkinson) who arranges for him to obtain an university education. Thing is, this brightly red haired lad doesn't really fit in, and is soon far more focussed on his rather effective system of gambling. Meantime, the latter, an Australian, has inherited a substantial fortune and invested it in a glass making factory (glass still being a bit of a luxury in 1850s Australia). When the two meet on a boat they realise that their isolation from society at large (and their fondness for a turn at the cards) gives them plenty in common and their relationship burgeons. When the two come up with a fairly outrageous wager between them - that they can build a church entirely of glass and ship it up-country to the remote town inhabited by preacher ""Hassett"" (Ciarán Hinds) the adventure elements hot up a little. The problem for me here, is that though the film looks lovely - and plenty of attention to detail has been payed to the costumes and general aesthetic, the story is really pretty weak. It tries to tackle issues of lonesomeness, religious bigotry and of the somewhat un-emancipated role of women in both Britain and Australia at the time, but somehow the thing never quite catches fire. It is paced very gently, and there are just too many characters to try to keep track of - the focus meanders a little too much, and the ending didn't make too much sense to me.

RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Alan J. Pakula from John Grisham’s novel, ""The Pelican Brief” is a political drama/thriller about a law student (Julia Roberts) who researches the murders of two supreme court justices and shares her theory with her college professor (Sam Shepard) who, in turn, gives it to an FBI friend on a lark. The brief hits a nerve because people start dying one-by-one. Denzel Washington plays a DC reporter who teams-up with the student while Robert Culp appears as the president. 

While I prefer “The Firm” (1993), which was also written by Grisham, this one is along the same lines, albeit with a totally different story (naturally). “Pelican” has more action, but the plot/characters aren’t quite as interesting IMHO. Still, if you liked one, you’ll probably appreciate the other.    

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 21 minutes and was shot in New Orleans and Washington DC/Maryland. ADDITIONAL CAST: John Heard plays an FBI agent, Stanley Tucci a hitman and John Lithgow an editor.

We just watched it again and I teasingly pointed out small plot or action gaffes here or there. But for me it is my all time favorite Christmas movie.

Partly I suppose because it feeds into my memories of growing up in a snowy, cold small town, though this predates my childhood by several years. And rarely do I feel like an ensemble cast made up of both adult and child actors do so well together. The Parkers, husband and wife, have their duel over the “major award,” and at times their sensibilities reside on different planets: his love of sports and her submersion into the details of raising children, but they are a unit and comically in love.

And I even think part of the charm for me is the voice of the narrator. Adult Ralphie is of course Jean Shepherd, one of the screenwriters and the author of the source book “In God we Trust; All Others Pay Cash, a book I once owned in paperback. For years I listened to his radio show, late at night, my ears glued to a small transistor radio. He spoke in a hushed, dramatic voice about his childhood and other stories. I remember once he intoned about a magic place called “Maine,” where his father hunted or wanted to hunt. Of course I lived in Maine so it was a sort of revelation to hear it was a special place. (And it is.)

So A Christmas Story ticks all of the boxes for me in nostalgia and humor and covers the major elements of Christmas for kids, all achieved without the Christmas miracle a lot of holiday films trot out at the end. || **Without no doubt, a good film, where things work very well in a very simple way.**

When we talk about Christmas-themed films, the choice is so huge that the difficult part has been showing things that are substantially different or original. What this film does is simply tell us a good story… and it works like that! It's not a film that enchants us, and I, personally, hardly see myself seeing it again. But the fact is that it manages to be much better than a lot of the rubbish that appears around Christmas.

The script is simple and so direct that it can be summed up in one sentence: it is a description of a child's Christmas and the way in which he, through various means, tries to get the gift he most wants to receive, and which his parents seem disinclined to give. give him: an air pressure gun. And this leads me to talk about the first point that really surprised me about this film: the fact that a child is offered a gun.

I'm not from the USA, I'm Portuguese, and when I was a child I had toy shotguns and pistols, but they didn't shoot, they were made of plastic. An air rifle, in my understanding, is still a weapon. Therefore, I was shocked by the idea of seeing an air gun for sale as a toy, among other toys. However, it is well known that we, in Europe, do not have the almost emotional relationship with weapons that North Americans have, and the laws that regulate them here are much tougher than the laws in the USA. Therefore, I know that my strangeness is due to cultural differences, but I still felt it with great intensity in this film.

Aside from this, I honestly don't have any major criticisms to point out: the dialogues are good, and the situations created are quite believable, even those that seem more crazy (such as the dogs that eat the turkey). There are many beautiful moments that move us, whether because of the affectionate relationship of that family, or because of the evocation of the best memories of each person's childhood: when watching the film, we remember our own past with a tear in our eyes, the people who no longer live close to us or are no longer present in this world. I felt old watching this film, I thought a lot about what I experienced, about the speed at which life takes turns and about the dreams I had at that boy's age (many of them I fulfilled and many were left behind)... But I'm not here to talk about me!

The film seems simple, it even seems cheap to make, if we consider the simplicity of the effects, the effectiveness and modesty of the sets, the very unpretentious way in which everything is presented to us, from the costumes to the cinematography itself, which is nothing special, but which works. efficiently. I would particularly highlight the exquisite way in which the production managed to recreate the family atmosphere experienced at the end of the 1940s, right in the aftermath of the Second World War. The cast also doesn't have big names, at least for me: young Peter Billingsley does an excellent job and is elegantly supported by Darren McGavin and Melinda Dilon. I dare say that this was the best of each of these actors."

Three students get more than they bargained for when a theft of a test results paper leads to a deadly battle of wills with their kidnapped teacher, Mrs. Tingle.

It seems to me that director and writer, Kevin Wiliamson, got confused as to which direction the film should go in. At times it's jaunty when the scene appears to call for menace, and at others just plain boring if the scene was meant to be actually funny (in that sarcastic, almost satirical way). The film could have worked at either being a comedy or a thriller, but the fusion of the two just doesn't work, and this failing has to fall at Williamson's door, it's as if Scream was all a fluke after all? The cast struggle with the meanderingly dull screenplay, only the stoic (and sexy) Helen Mirren salvaging any sort of dignity by realising early on that the core of the film calls for deft nastiness instead of outright villainy.

The whole movie experience was pretty much like every time you think you got it all figured out, you learn something new and turn out to be all wrong. I loved all those twists and turns and the is-it-real-or-not feeling like, is it really REALLY happening? Is it really acting for her job as a actress, or is it all just a trick of the mind... || Perfect Blue perfectly blends psychologically disturbed fantasy with grounded reality. Mima Kirigoe. A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima’s abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version.

The late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as “anime”, is cited as “childish”. “Anime is for losers” tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai’s narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form.

The complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female’s world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from.

Kon’s intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series ‘Double Bind’ essentially replicating Mima’s regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima’s mental instability. He doesn’t stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It’s not just a psychological thriller. It’s horror.

Kon’s signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of “Me-Mania”, only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi’s audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent.

The reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon’s trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words “perfection”, it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating. Quite possibly the best anime feature to ever be released. || I caught this in High School and it instantly took me as an eerie Alfred Hitchcock show that did an outstanding job of feeding on pure paranoia.

It was unsettling, it was scary, and at the time it seemed as realistic as it could be for an anime movie.

As I rode through it, I started doubting what was real and what wasn't and that is a hallmark of a great movie, that ability to keep the viewer on their toes."

A biochemist from a pharmaceutical company in New York (Bracco) goes deep into the rain forest of the Amazon to locate researcher Robert Campbell (Connery) and determine if his work is still worth funding.

“Medicine Man” (1992) is a jungle drama in the mold of ""The Emerald Forest"" (1985). There’s a little bit of adventure and, unsurprisingly, romance. Right off the bat the relationship between the two is characterized by amusing bickering, which isn’t exactly realistic. If you can roll with that, there’s a lot to appreciate along with some eye-rolling bits. 

As far as the latter goes, if the missing ingredient for the cancer cure is as glaring to the viewer, then I’m pretty sure it would be obvious to Nobel-winning scientists working in the field. Also, the Amazon rain forest is the size of a huge country and lightly populated, is it very likely that the road being built would go directly into where the much-needed ingredient exists, not to mention the tribe?

Still, there are entertaining elements and, sometimes, a palpable sense of wonder. Bracco has her feminine appeal and is amusing as Rae Crane, albeit annoying to some tastes (like Connery’s character isn’t?).

The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Southern Mexico, the area of Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico (producers learned from money pits such as ""The Emerald Forest"" that shoots in the actual Amazon Basin just cost too much).

The story of ""The 13th Warrior"" (1999) comes from Michael Crichton's novel ""The Eaters of the Dead"" which combines the legend of Beowulf with a historical account of an Arab diplomat who meets and dwells with the Vikings after being banished from his homeland due to an adulterous liaison.

Antonio Banderas stars as the Arab while the hulking Vladimir Kulich heads the Viking cast in the Beowulf role of Buliwyf (pronounced in the film BULL-vie). Speaking of Kulich, he would've made for an excellent Mighty Thor back in the day!

The plot of the film is great: Once Banderas meets up with the Vikings, they run afoul of a mysterious brutal tribe from the deep woods. Banderas is selected as the lone non-Viking to assist the 12 Norsemen in ridding the communities of the threat, hence ""the 13th warrior."" The cast, characters, story, locations (Campbell River, Vancouver Island), sets, costumes, score (Jerry Goldsmith), and cinematography are all of the highest order.

At a little over an hour and a half the film moves along briskly with a lot of action. Make no mistake, ""The 13th Warrior"" is a Class A film, but some story elements seem to be underdeveloped. This is probably due to the conflict Michael Crichton had with director John McTiernan. Crichton insisted on reshoots and cut at least 30 minutes of McTiernan's work, reportedly important character-developing scenes.

We see this in the very prologue of the film: The story of Banderas' banishment from his homeland due to his indiscretions is literally relayed in a matter of a couple minutes. And at the 8 minute mark we are introduced to the Vikings with very little mystery and zero suspense build-up. The contrast of the sophisticated Arab culture with the coarse, rugged Norsemen is great, but I would have enjoyed seeing these characters fleshed-out a bit more. After all, the more we know the individuals, the more we care about what ultimately happens to them.

Which brings us to the final 30 minutes of the film involving Banderas and the Vikings infiltrating the malevolent tribe's stronghold and a final attack on a Viking village. The visuals of these scenes are awe-inspiring but they fly by so quickly that the viewer is left disoriented and strangely uninvolved, not to mention unmoved by the story's outcome.

All this reveals that ""The 13th Warrior"" COULD have been an outstanding 140-minute Viking epic, along the lines of ""Troy"" (2004); instead we are left with a brisk, action-oriented, near-throwaway Viking popcorn flick. I would love to see a Director's Cut some day but Vladimir Kulich opines that it will unfortunately never happen.

Nonetheless, I appreciate the film as is. It's a good Viking adventure flick that's professionally done, despite the post-production problems. It's one of those films that gets better with each viewing, probably because everything flies by so quickly on initial plays.

Despite it's flaws, ""The 13th Warrior"" isn't too far from rivaling Kirk Douglas' brilliant 1958 ""The Vikings"" as one of the greatest Viking films ever made. A Director's Cut could possibly even topple ""The Vikings"" from its lofty, coveted perch.

The film was shot in British Columbia: Campbell River on Vancouver Island, Williams Lake and Pemberton, British Columbia.

GRADE: B-/B. || **Overall: Ignore the reviews. The 13th Warrior is the best Viking epic of all time!**

The greatest historical Viking battle epic you never heard of. Just like Jurassic Park and Westworld, The 13th Warrior is based on a Michael Crichton book and boasts an incredible action director, John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator), Antonio Banderas as the leading man at the top of his career, excellent practical effects and beautiful sets and costumes. Yet, critics obliterated the film, and it failed at the box office, becoming one of the biggest box office flops of all time. I have no idea how this happened or why the reviews are so bad because this is an EXCELLENT movie. The battle scenes in The 13th Warrior are in league with other action epics like Braveheart, The Last Samurai, or Kingdom of Heaven. The story is similar to 300, where a small band of warriors face impossible odds and mixes a little horror with fantastic action and great character development. I’m not sure how The 13th Warrior ended up in the garbage can, but it belongs on the top shelf with the best action epics. || This is my kind of film, and so despite that rather dodgy casting of Antonio Banderas - indeed, the pretty ropey casting throughout - I still rather enjoyed it. Banderas is a gentle poet whose eye wanders at the court of the Caliph. That earns him a new job as ambassador to the Northmen and so off he rides, with his sagely friend ""Melchisadek"" (a few scenes from Omar Sharif). His arrival at their camp is greeted with indifference until a messenger arrives regaling them with horror stories of a terror back home. Their soothsayer advises that thirteen men must return home to combat this evil - but the last of this warlike baker's dozen must not be of their race. Oops - wrong place, wrong time for Antonio and off he sets into an enjoyably paced series of set-piece action scenarios with a Norse theme to them. Luckily, he befriends the charismatic ""Herger"" (an enthusiastic but pretty hopeless Dennis Storhøi) and intrigues the new king ""Buliwyf"" (Vladimir Kulich) with his ability to ""speak sounds"" (write!) and together they gradually bond in the face of their menacing enemy. It's not a great film, no - the dialogue is poor and the acting really isn't up to much ether but there is loads of swordplay, flaming arrows and the whole thing is generally quite light-hearted and good-humoured. This mythology always lends itself well to a good story and the (underplayed) clashes of culture between the rough and ready warriors and their more refined guest adds a little richness to the plot. You won't remember it afterwards, and I bet Banderas probably doesn't want to - but it doesn't hang around and kills an hour and an half easily enough."

“George of the Jungle” was an interesting and entertaining film that showed the funnier side of Brendan Fraser and gave us a good Tarzan parody. This film, however, totally fails because, at its core, it is a poorly conceived and uninteresting copy of “George”.

For this purpose, the production sought a forgotten classic cartoon of a character who is part of the famous Canadian Mounted Police. I doubt that this prestigious corporation took too kindly to the unwanted publicity, but these considerations aside, and that slight sense of arrogant US superiority over its northern neighbor, the film is simply not funny.

The best that this film has to give us is the quality of the actors, starting with Brendan Fraser. The actor commits himself, does what he can, but doesn't have decent material to work with. Sara Jessica Parker also does an enjoyable job playing the idiotic hero's dorky girlfriend, and Alfred Molina is just as good. The problem is that the actors, regardless of the effort and individual commitment, received miserable material from the screenwriter, who instead of giving a competent script, delivered a miserable and amateur sketch.

If we exclude the good quality of the actors and their enormous effort to work, the film is a total disgrace. The dialogue is miserable, and the jokes rely on pure cheap slapstick or high school scatological humor. The technical aspects aren't brilliant either, and the film looks very cheap."

Stir of Echoes is written and directed by David Koepp who adapts from the novel of the same name written by Richard Matheson. It stars Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Zachary David Cope, Illena Douglas, Jennifer Morrison, Kevin Dunn and Conor O'Farrell. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Fred Murphy.

Chicago phone engineer Tom Witzky (Bacon) submits to being hypnotised by his sister-in-law and finds that his young son's imaginary friend is not imagined after all...

Undeniably lost in the slip-stream of the similar themed ""The Sixth Sense"", Stir of Echoes screams out to be seen by more fans of supernatural mysteries. It's a near faultless production, with Koepp getting all the key ingredients right on both the page and in transfer to the screen. Pacing is often the problem with films of a similar ilk, but Koepp deftly structures it in three engrossing sections.

First third establishes the main characters and the supernatural set-up, but the bonus here is that character reactions are believable, especially with Erbe's confused wife. Koepp has a great sense of atmosphere whilst ensuring we are fully immersed in Tom Wizky's new world of disorientation by way of terrifying visions and red light shocks. Second third brings the chills and the odd boo-jump, again the director is aware that too many jumps can overkill the plot, so they are nicely spaced out and accompanied by a palpable fear of the unknown. Then the last third unravels in a whirl of Roy Neary like obsessions and ghosts of the past denouements. It's a standard formula, yet it's amazing just how often film makers get it wrong, especially in horror. Not a problem here. 

Film is further boosted by Newton Howard's score that blends the ethereal with rising thunder and Murphy's colour photography, the latter of which helps to paint a harmonious Chicago neighbourhood, soon to be turned upside down, literally at one end of the street. The acting is super, which in Bacon's case is a given to anyone who has followed his career, and Koepp shows some nice and creepy visual filming techniques to further enhance the great Richard Matheson's story. There's the odd little misstep, such as a thread involving a secret organisation that has the ""gift"" of being ""open"" to the supernatural, that feels like filler to over state Tom's torment. While the post reaction to a suicide attempt isn't given nearly enough screen time to really add impetus to the unfolding mystery. But small complaints only, for Stir of Echoes (great title) remains a truly involving and entertaining supernatural mystery. 8.5/10"

A hedonistic hair stylist in Pittsburgh (Patricia Arquette) experiences stigmata, the manifestations of the various wounds of Christ, which compels the Vatican to send an investigator (Gabriel Byrne).

“Stigmata” (1999) is Christian-oriented mystery/horror, coming across as a meshing of the tone of “Eye of the Beholder” (1998) and the themes of “The Seventh Sign” (1988). But also brings to mind the contemporaneous “End of Days” (1999), albeit more rooted in drama than overblown action thrills. “The Mothman Prophecies” (2002) is another reference point, but the brilliance of the eerie “Mothman” was its confidence in understatement whereas “Stigmata” overdoes it in some sequences, I guess to appeal to those with ADHD.

Nevertheless, director Rupert Wainwright knows how to make a flashy, good-looking flick. The simple-yet-profound moral at the end makes it even better and I agree with it wholeheartedly.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes.

Geoff Carter is the head of a small run down air freight company in Barranca, one of his best pilots (and friend) is killed, but this is merely only one of the problems he has to deal with as ex flames, potential new sweethearts, and dissension in the camp, all fuse together to test him to the limit.

Howard Hawks was the perfect man for this film because of his aviation background, the result is a very well crafted character study set in a very small locale. Looking at it from the outside you would think that the film was lining up to be a soft soap romantic fable, but here the emotion is channelled into a sort of character bravado that is flawed - yet something that makes for a viewing experience that draws you in deep with the finely etched characters. 

The cast are on fine form. Cary Grant gets to flex his non comedic muscles with great results as Carter, the film relies on Grant to glue the story together which he does with great aplomb. Jean Arthur & Rita Hayworth are the girls in amongst this strongly male orientated story, and it's a testament to both of the ladies ability that they don't get bogged down by all the macho heroism pouring out in the plot. Smart camera work and exciting aerial sequences further up the quality that is dotted within the piece, and were it not for some terribly twee dialogue, Only Angels Have Wings would surely be ranked as a classic of the 1930s. As it is, it's a wonderfully involving film that shows Hawks at his most humane. 8/10 || Holy Smokes.

And they do smoke a lot in this film.

Geoff as the prototypical ""man's man"" who runs a struggling air freight company near a difficult to pass mountain. I don't want to give too much away, but between a handful of airplane crashes and a new beau and ex lover showing up there is a lot going on.

I can't remember the last time I teared up from pure joy from a film. But this movie has about a perfect an ending I've ever seen. || Jean Arthur gets off to a flying start here as the no-nonsense ""Bonnie"" who arrives in a remote village in South America. It's a small but lively location where ""Carter"" (Cary Grant) runs an air-freight business from a runway with more holes and puddles than actual ground upon which to land! The business is being backed by the engaging bar owner ""Dutchy"" (Sig Ruman) and they are approaching the critical point of their trial period with the mail service - a contract that they need to keep if they are to stay in the air. Problems, like buses, do tend to come along at once and quite quickly ""Carter"" finds himself employing a new pilot ""Bat"" (Richard Bathelmess) who comes with a great deal of baggage, a baggage that irks his best pal ""Kid"" (Thomas Mitchell) who doesn't have his own issues to seek - his eyesight isn't what it was. Their delivery route takes them through a perilous canyon that is prone to bad weather, so with their available number of planes and pilots steadily dwindling, what chance they can keep their business going? This isn't really one of Grant's more stand-out roles - he does just about enough but we can all enjoy the rapport he develops with an on-form Arthur. The story does go for a bit of a wander, though, when his ex ""Judy"" (Rita Hayworth) turns up, just happening to be married to their newly acquired pariah to boot. Mercifully, though, Howard Hawks keeps this from turning into too much of a romantic mess, it's more of a foggy airborne adventure with the romance kept to a minimum. This film also serves as an interesting reminder of just how perilous some of these early air missions could be, with planes made of little more substantial than balsa wood at the mercy of climatic conditions that could turn hostile in the blink of an eye. It's a solid story with an equally solid cast and I enjoyed it."

I Saw What You Did is directed by William Castle and written by William P. McGivern. It stars John Ireland, Joan Crawford, Leif Erickson, Andi Garrett, Sara Lane and Sharyl Locke. Music is by Van Alexander (Joseph Gershenson supervising) and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc. 

When two teenagers on babysitting duties decide to have fun making prank phone calls, their evening turns sinister when they call up a man who has just murdered his wife… 

William Castle was of course better known for his gimmicks than for his ability as a film maker, I Saw What You Did shows the best and worst of the great entertainer. Castle produces and directs this one so is accountable for getting the mix completely wrong. At times the picture is genuinely suspenseful, the premise at the core superb, but at others it feels like it wants to be a comedy, further compounded by Alexander’s awful musical score. It’s a score that belongs in something like Bewitched or The Munsters, and quite often takes you out of the thriller zone. 

Castle unsurprisingly borrows off of some films that influenced his career, but aided by McGivern’s screenplay he manages to put some different spins on the twisty plot developments. It also helps having Biroc (The Killer that Stalked New York/Cry Danger/The Garment Jungle) on photography duty, he’s able to make Castle’s fog scenes appear icy cold, to blend the shadows into the story like foreboding prowlers. 

Cast wise the elder cast members aren’t stretching themselves here, with Crawford working for food and Ireland on auto-pilot, but the younger actors are great fun and really nail that naivety of youth thing to the max. All told it’s a fun film, if not always for the right reasons. With some Castle invention (eyelet vision?!) and steals – and Biroc on form, there’s more than enough here to compensate for the confusing mix of genres. 6/10"

What is your purpose in life? The film teaches that there is such great beauty in the small things in life and that sometimes you need to take a step back to allow yourself to take in the unfiltered beauty in the small things like a plastic bag dancing in the wind, playing with the leaves. The film tells it's audience that the beauty in the small details is much greater than society's typical image of beauty. The prominent rose in the film is a symbol of false, surface beauty; the expensive and romantic flower is amongst almost every single shot in the film reminding us that we need to look beyond the surface beauty of an entity and see the beauty within. This message surrounding beauty is empathised with the inclusion of the rose on the films poster and the tagline, 'look closer' indicating that to see real beauty one must 'look closer', a task that typically requires more thoughtfulness and less immediate facial value judgements that make up the typical image of beauty. || I first saw this film in my teen years.

It's a film of their concert - constructed from performances over three nights in a small Hollywood theatre, and that setting lends itself excellently to their showcase. The depth and height of the stage allows the band to arrive on set song by song, and for the camera work to get down and dirty with the band members amidst the most sparing of sets as they churn out some of the repertoire in an inimitable style that cleverly marries the intense with the entertaining, the comedic and the slightly fantastic. The audio is of an astonishingly strong quality, and the closeness and intensity of the photography makes the film really quite enthralling to watch.

Like so many who become alive on stage, there are huge amounts of nerves and a sense of uncertainly about his abilities and popularity - especially when he begins to become idolised and goes solo. There are plenty of opportunities to get into his songs here, and those of the Big Bopper and Eddie Cochran and the film not only serves to illustrate just how pioneering Holly was, but also just how influential he was within a group of musicians who were changing the scene for ever. The supporting roles are rather undercooked, and that can impact a little on the study of his character, but Busey really does own this part and director Steve Rash knew enough to let us watch and judge by ourselves.

Viewing this for the first time in 20 years really put a smile on my face, now I know that for after having just watched a horror film that may not be the best guideline you will ever read, but the film has it's tongue firmly in cheek and it doesn't come up short on the thrill factor.

You will read other reviews stating that the film is a little cheesy and a little dated, and sure, in this day and age of gorno and ultimate slash kill death murder movies, the film can be judged as tame alongside the big box office ghoul movies. But from a personal point of view I got such a kick out of watching a good honest genre piece that shows love, care, and entertainment rolled into one movie. Perhaps I'm the old fart who is so desensitised to blood horror these days? Perhaps I live in the past too much? So what? It matters not because as long as there are delightful genre pieces like this to remind me that the 80s horror crowd had some knowing style, then I'm a happy bunny.

Cute teens embroiled in Vampire next door plot is about the make up of the film. No one believes the central guy of the piece (William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster), but he convinces TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) to join his quest to rid the neighbourhood of the murdering menace living next door. The film has the love interest in peril (Amanda Bearse), it has the grossly annoying best friend (Stephen Geoffreys) - and boy is he annoying! And it has all the homages to the horror classics gone by you could wish to have.

Such guts and gusto went into making this film I felt like clapping at the end. It's aware of the horror competition when you catch some of the dialogue, so it should never be allowed to become a perceived cheesy relic, because this is 1985 and it rocks for those that remember when horror had a glint in its eye instead of a sabre through its head. 8/10 || 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I read the book eons ago, probably 1988, for a first-year university class back when I was earning my first degree. Not a Burt Reynolds fan, and having only seen two other works by Boorman (the great 'Point Blank' and the not-so-great 'Exorcist II: The Heretic'), I wasn't in a huge hurry to rush out and see the film. BIG mistake on my part, to be frank.

Probably the gifted 83-year-old, Surrey native and five-time Oscar nominee's best work--and easily the finest work ever done by Reynolds, shortly before he simply rested on his laurels and became nothing but a caricature. THIS at the very least was proof that he at one time actually had chops and could act.

The scariest aspect of all is that this goes on all the time and we just don't know about it. Hundreds of people go 'missing' every day. And, as a Canadian, it's people like the culprits in this film that are responsible for America now having the worst Presidential candidate of all time actually having a chance of being the head of the most powerful country in the world. Now THAT's scary. || Brutal, Beautiful and Brilliant.

Four Atlanta friends - Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (John Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty), and Drew (Ronny Cox) – decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River out in the Georgia wilderness. They see it as a test of manliness whilst also wanting to experience this part of nature before the whole valley is flooded over to make way for the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. But the perils of nature are not the only dangerous things in their midst, unfriendly wood folk are about to bring another dimension in terror.

Deliverance is one of those films that sometimes suffers by way of reputation. Much like Straw Dogs and 70s films of that type, the hype and promise of unremitting hell often isn't delivered to an expectant modern audience. Which is a shame since Deliverance is one of the finest, glummest, brutalistic and beautiful films of the 1970s.

Adapting from James Dickey's novel (screenplay duties here also), British director John Boorman crafts a tough and powerful film of men out of their environment, thus out of their league. As each man sets off initially, it's a test of manhood, but each guy is forced to deconstruct their worth, and it soon becomes more about survival as this deadly adventure proceeds. Boorman, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, has painted a raw and treacherous landscape, unconquered by city slickers but dwelt in by inbreds who don't take kindly to the city folk showing up with their machismo attitudes. From the first point of contact with the strange locals, where Drew goes ""duelling banjos"" with an odd looking child, the film doesn't let up, much like the locals themselves, the film also is remorseless. Some critics over the years have proclaimed that Deliverance is too pretty, mistaking lush physicality as something detracting from the dark thematics at work. Not so, the Chattooga River sequences are electrifying, the rapids scenes (brilliantly filmed with Voight and Reynolds doing real work, and getting real injuries) are merely setting up the unmanning of our ""macho"" guys just around the corner. It's a fabulous and potent piece of ""beauty"". With the four cast leaders absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. In fact there are few better casting decisions ever than that of Reynolds as Lewis, one can only lament that he didn't have more hard edged serious roles in his career.

Minor itches exist, metaphors are heavy (Vietnam a 70s staple it seems) while ecological concerns are hinted at without being as prominent as they are in the novel. Surveying the landscape during the opening of the piece, Lewis reflects that man is going to rape this land, rape it, it's stuff like that that is not totally formed, given way to abject horror and survival, Lewis again noting that survival is the name of the game. A game of life and death, where man's primal being means violence may indeed beget violence. Boorman clearly agreed. 10/10 || The Banjo scene still haunts me today!

Never mind the New Beaty scene.

Foretold by a wizard. Found by a king.,"Adventure, Fantasy",141,1981-04-10,en,7.0,1052,3.2018,"Nigel Terry, Nicol Williamson, Helen Mirren, Nicholas Clay, Paul Geoffrey",John Boorman,"witch, adultery, holy grail, love triangle, england, magic, prophecy, fog, mythology, castle, vision, knight, king arthur, tournament, duel, battle, mist, excalibur, wizard, lancelot, sword and sorcery","***Eccentric depiction of the medieval myths surrounding King Arthur*** 

In the late 400s Merlin the sorcerer of Britain takes advantage of the lust of King Uther (Gabriel Byrne) for a Duke’s wife, Ingrayne (Katrine Boorman), to grant him a boy who becomes King Arthur of Camelot (Nigel Terry) when he pulls Excalibur from the stone, a magical sword. Arthur marries Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi), but when Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) joins the Knights of the Round Table the two experience a profound affinity for each other. Meanwhile, Arthur’s half-sister, Morgana (Helen Mirren) is intent on incestuous deception to produce a son, Mordred.

The script to this acclaimed 1981 film by John Boorman was adapted from Sir Thomas Malory's “Le Morte d'Arthur” (“The Death of Arthur”), published in 1485. The Arthurian folklores are used as an allegory of the succession of birth, life, decline, and renewal. The resulting film is reminiscent of works of mythography and is therefore episodic in nature. For instance, the sequence where the concept of the Round Table is established comes and goes in an awkward way. Another example is at the 95-minute mark where the story switches to the Knights’ search for the Holy Grail, which focuses on a heretofore unknown knight.

Needless to say, the story’s not consistently compelling because the movie’s too segmented. The middle part detailing the romance between Guenevere and Lancelot, and the ramifications thereof, is the best part as far as that goes. The first half hour is a little convoluted, story-wise, and I suggest using the subtitles to discern accented dialogue and to keep track of the odd names. The search for the Holy Grail in the last 45 minutes breaks the film’s momentum because it feels tacked on.

Nevertheless, if you can roll with the hammy acting, the melodrama and the episodic framework, there are a lot of positives to enjoy. Some good examples include: the beautiful sylvan locations, the fairy tale-like castles & sets, the imaginative costumes (e.g. the armor), the lovely ladies and the lush colors. Also, the soundtrack/score, which greatly utilizes “O Fortuna” by Carl Orff and a few pieces by Richard Wagner, is notable. Meanwhile, watch out for a young Liam Neeson as the knight Gawain.  

The big flaw here is that the story lacks steady thrust. For that, check out the more reality-oriented “First Knight” (1995) and “King Arthur” (2004).      

The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes and was shot entirely in Ireland.

Directed by Jon Amiel, Sommersby is adapted from the historical account of 16th Century French peasant Martin Guerre. It was previously filmed as The Return of Martin Guerre in 1982. It stars Richard Gere, Jodie Foster and Bill Pullman. Music is by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot. 

In simple terms the film is about a man (Jack Sommersby) who went off to war and was presumed dead by his wife (Laurel) and the village folk of the village where he lived. Some 9 years later he returns a changed man, back in the marital bed and a hero to the village. But then questions start to crop up and it becomes a possibility that this man may not after all be who he claims to be. Sounds bizarre for sure, yet it's a true story, and a fascinating one at that.

For this American version we get top line production values across the board, with the film propelled with grace and skill by Gere and Foster in the lead roles of Jack and Laurel Sommersby. Director Amiel rightly uses the slow burn approach, a consideration to the art of story telling. This draws the viewer firmly into the post Civil War period and lets us get to know the principal players and their surroundings.

The core narrative thrust is a moving romance, one consistently under pressure of a mystery to be proved or disproved. But there's also economic issues to hand, very much so, and the vile stench of racism still hangs in the air. There's a lot going on in Sommersby and it never sags because of it. Also refreshing that in spite of some critical grumblings in some quarters, the ending is potent and not very Hollywood at all. 

It's not flawless and although it's based on a true story, some suspension of disbelief is needed as regards physical appearance of Jack and his means and motives. Yet this is a lovely film, simple in story telling structure, beautifully photographed and performed, it very much feels and plays like a classic era period piece. 8/10"

Almost everything past the premise of this movie is confusing and ridiculous, starting with the spelling, ""ThumbElina""?  It should be ""ThumbAlina"", that's a nit pick, but it honestly made the movie harder to find.

I love the premise of a tiny person ""birthed"" to a wanting mother, but after that, the problems set in.  Let's start with ""birthed"": she didn't magically appear out of the air, she wasn't born, she crawled out of a flower as a tiny adult, wearing a dress, and able to talk.  This is some fey granted wish nonsense if I ever saw one.

I understand using the name Thumbelina to describe her size, as ""Fingerling"" would probably be inappropriate, but she is perilously tiny: able to be crushed without notice, any big animal (duck, goose, cow, horse) will eat her without noticing, she should have drowned in the first act, twice I think,  the wind alone would sweep her away, though she doesn't have to worry about falling to her death.  This girl is short to Tinkerbell, who is at least 6 inches, and Thumbelina is about 2 inches (and a half, maybe), so she's only coming up to Tink's booty.  The movie never clearly demonstrates this and morphs her body size anywhere up to a foot based on the needs of the scene.

Bugs that wear clothes, with human eyes and teeth don't bother me, I get that because they don't have faces that translate, but amphibians and birds with very human teeth and tongues (geese have their own teeth) is disturbing, and that swallow was downright horrifying.  It is a BIRD, the pinnacle of aerodynamic nature in, not only, boots, shirt, and a hat, but GLOVES, it may be the most distracting thing I've ever seen.  Even when you anthropomorphize a bird to use their wings as hands, gloves don't make any sense if they fly.  It was honestly worst than frog breasts, which I can't stand just as much, they just weren't as frequent.

Then there are lots of (horny) bugs, but then there are bumble bees that act like dogs, but should be loyal to their queen, not a fairy.  We can blame fey magic, but since he has his own wings, he shouldn't RIDE it.

Now, the actual story: it makes sense to split up the nature dynamics into ""nationalities"", and the world is crafted in some detail, but why did they chose these details.  We basically have a Spanish prince, a beetle pimp, a french...hobo(?) swallow, a mole that is a wealthy business man, and then the fairy kingdom which makes the most sense, other than they fail to have nature gradually deliver winter (why they're in charge, I don't know) and suddenly murder anyone who hasn't sheltered.

This movie has a problematic feminist story: she's born looking for companionship.  She gets desperate for anyone, then wants a prince, so she doesn't even necessarily want the only guy she's ever seen, until she knows he's the prince and he promises her all this stuff.  Then she's kidnapped, force on stage for entertainment (strips), led poorly by the hobo swallow, and pressured to marry the mole, but then marries the guy that sort of looks like her, and then he changes her to be just like him.

Just watch ""Fern Gully"" or any of the Disney fairy stuff instead, please."

Flashback tells us that her first husband (Robert Powell) was a gallant flier during the second world war who didn't make it through, and so born on VE Day, the young baby might have been forgiven for thinking that all the flags and fanfare was for him! The kid wasn't born like this, but a trauma somewhere along the line appears to have short-circuited his brain, and so now he doesn't see, speak or hear. Despite their best efforts - and those of a few rather curious family ""friends"" he remains steadfastly in his own world until a pinball game. He's an ace at the thing and soon the fortunes of his family see his mother rolling around in diamonds on a white carpet or attending gala night at the opera. ""Nora"" gets a bit frustrated one evening with her now grown up son (Roger Daltrey) and an altercation ensues that brings him, once more, to life - and a life in which he recalls the drama that sent him silent in the first place. Mirrors are quite central to the plot here, and it's one of them that convinces ""Tommy"" he has an almost Messianic role in life - and so the family start to enjoy an evangelical life that would put ""Elmer Gantry"" to shame. Wealth, fame, acclaim - but ""Tommy"" still needs one more thing - fulfilment! Fat chance, here, but what Ken Russell does do is offer us a roller-coaster of a ride as the characters that touch his life range from benign to perverse. Tina Turner is great as the slightly deranged ""Acid Queen"" and Elton John's ""Pinball Wizard"" is probably the highlight of this whole rock opera that leaves no aspects of this man's life untouched. Along the way, we also takes great swipes at the sentimentality and venality of life - and Reed takes up that cudgel with a natural aplomb. The star? Well that's got to be Ann-Margret who quite literally throws herself in to part, holding a note and a dance with the best of them. I didn't love the last twenty minutes, but I suppose however this ended was never going to be entirely satisfactory and I never really appreciated Daltrey as a sex-symbol before, but as this gathers pace and he loses his shirt, it's not hard to see why he shone here - physically and metaphorically. It's eclectic, a little hedonistic and meandering at times, but none the worse for that. Turn it up and let it loose."

Four pledges at a Southern Cal university have to spend the night at an infamous deserted mansion. As the other students try to scare them they learn that the horrific legends about the house might be real. Peter Barton and Vincent Van Patten play the male protagonists.

“Hell Night” (1981) plays like ""Friday the 13th"" in a gothic manor. People who like ""The Funhouse"" (1981), ""The Prowler"" (1981), ""Zombie High"" (1987) and ""Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil"" (1991) should appreciate it, although ""The Funhouse,"" ""Prom Night IV"" and ""Friday the 13th"" (any of them) are all-around more entertaining.

Aside from Ms. Blair, Suki Goodwin and Jenny Neumann stand out on the female front. Their beauty is displayed without getting too raunchy.  

This is a good ‘scary movie’ for the Halloween season as all the staples are present and it’s not painful & unpalatable like some horror flicks. There’s a little too much filler though and it needed cut down by 10-12 minutes. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Kimberly Crest Estate, Redlands (Garth Manor), University of Redlands and Redlands, California, with party interiors done in South Pasadena and studio work done in Hollywood.

The last couple of years when we did that we frequently got a DVD as a “bonus” with it and this is one of those. According to my movie collection database we have had it since 2008 and last evening we finally got around watching it.

This is a quite okay movie. It will not blow your socks off but it is fairly okay and worth watching. It is a nice thriller/fugitive style movie to watch on a middle-of-the-week evening. I would probably not have been impressed had I gone to a theater to watch it but watching it as a TV-movie it was quite enjoyable. There are the usual silly moments that tend to be in these kinds of movies of course, starting with the stupid wife who just has to pick up the bloody knife just before the police arrives. Why do all (most) script writers have to put that crap into every movie?

I do generally like Tommy Lee Jones even though he tends to look and act pretty much the same no matter which movie he is in. I guess I like stability. The plot is okay. It is a fairly conventional husband frames wife, wife goes after husband kind of story and does not really provide any surprises.

One thing that caught my attention was that the car dealer apparently could do a credit check on a woman that was, as was found out later in the movie, dead since three years. I think someone missed the QA-checking of the script in terms of credibility there but then, as I said, the movie will not blow your socks of and the plot is fairly standard Hollywood fare with the usual silly stuff in it. || Weak and from a legal standpoint complete wrong (despite a former lawyer turned murderer and former law professor saying so). Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones are good and Bruce Greenwood plays smarmy well but this isn't a very good thriller. **2.75/5** || Pretty good movie. I wouldn't want to do time for a murder I didn't commit. If I was set up like this movie, I'd probably do the same thing she did."

Carlyle never did repeat his performance in ""Trainspotting"" (1996) for me, ever since he has delivered some pretty undercooked efforts, and here is no different. Miller is on quite good form though, Tyler plays her part with gusto and there are a few engaging cameos from the suitably powdered-up Alan Cumming (""Lord Rochester"") that sit atop a supporting cast of hit and miss British comedy talent that many will have seen on television over the years. That comedy, it has to be said, is a bit on the bawdy side - and it is not always very funny; but generally speaking there is enough chemistry and pace on the screen to keep this at the fair-to-middling end of the entertainment scale. The costumes look good, the music is quirky - not always of the period, and it's just about worth 100 minutes of your time. Not that you will recall much about it a day or two afterwards."

Alvarez Kelly is directed by Edward Dmytryk and stars William Holden & Richard Widmark. It's written by Elliott Arnold & Franklin Coen (Dan Taradash uncredited for tidying it up), the locations for the shoot are Baton Rouge & Clinton, Louisiana, with Joseph MacDonald on photography (Panavision). Story is apparently based on a true US Civil War incident in 1864, it sees Alvarez Kelly (Holden) kidnapped by Confederate's led by Tom Rossiter (Widmark) and forced to drive a herd of Union owned cattle to the hungry Reb troops in Richmond.

Slow moving and blighted by a tepid script, Alvarez Kelly relies on its stars and photography to keep it out the trough. Evidently the makers were going for a social conscious piece based around an historical incident. All that is achieved is an overly talky piece, with periods of inane conversations; that is only briefly lit up by its action packed finale. And even then it can be argued that the ""battle for the bridge"" and the subsequent ""stampede"" isn't worth waiting 90 minutes for. The acting is solid, where Holden plays a role he could do in his sleep, and Widmark, sporting an eye patch, convinces as a rough and ready Colonel. Most pleasing is MacDonald's photography, not just for capturing the essence of the barren South in Baton Rouge, but also his choice of lenses for the top notch costuming (take a bow Seth Banks) afforded the ladies of the piece (Janice Rule & Victoria Shaw). There's a lovely print for this film, where in High Definition the colours positively ping from the screen.

Dmytryk (Broken Lance/Warlock), Holden (The Horse Soldiers/The Wild Bunch) & Widmark (The Last Wagon/Cheyenne Autumn) owe Western fans nothing, but this is one from the three guys that's easily forgotten once the end credit rolls. 5/10 || _**Confederate and Union troops fighting over a herd of cattle**_

During the partial siege of Richmond–Petersburg in September 1864 a troop of Confederates mean to acquire 3000 cattle from Mexico meant for consumption by the Union Army. William Holden plays the livestock businessman while Richard Widmark and Patrick O’Neal play opposing Confederate/Union officers. Roger C. Carmel is on hand as the Captain of a blockade runner.     

""Alvarez Kelly"" (1966) is a Civil War Western based around the real-life Beefsteak Raid. It’s similar to “The Horse Soldiers” (1959), also co-starring Holden, mixed with “Major Dundee” (1965). While it’s the least of these, with “Horse Soldiers” easily being the best, it’s still worth checking out for those interested, just don’t expect a conventional Western or Civil War yarn.

Critics complain that it’s too talky with not enough action, which I suppose is true, but I appreciated the settings and the authentic scruffiness of the Rebs, not to mention the wartime intrigue and a thrilling stampede in the last act. 

My top qualm would be how easy it seemed the cattleman is secretly taken into Richmond. Yet this can be overlooked on the grounds that it wasn’t a classic military siege wherein a city is fully surrounded and all supply lines cut off. You could still enter Richmond from the west.

The flick scores well on the feminine front with stunning Southern belles Janice Rule, Victoria Shaw and Stephanie Hill, plus peripherals.

The two stars became best buds during shooting. Widmark remarked how the four months of being constantly together during shooting was the equivalent of 10-15 years of friendship. Meanwhile Steve McQueen happened to be filming “Nevada Smith” in the same area and the three ran into each other one day wherein McQueen and Holden ended up drinking together for the rest of the evening.

The movie runs about 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in Louisiana (the vicinity of Baton Rouge), with the opening sequence done in the Southwest.

It would be the next year, in April of 1979, that we (only my mother and me that time) would finally see Phantasm. And it's scary as hell, I tell ya. Scary as hell. Oh, and as I'd also learned, the kid, whose window it was that the Tall Man stood outside of in the trailer, is named Mike. Scary as hell, I tell ya.

Be prepared, if you'll be a first time watcher of this cult horror, to scream and jump and feel chills as you're absorbing it. It is just that creepy. And I do believe that Clive Barker (God love him) would later borrow more than a few of the elements from Phantasm for his own cult masterpiece, ""Hellraiser"". I reckon that I'll always believe that to be the truth. Phantasm is sheer and ultimate terror. They just don't make 'em like this anymore.

Watch this one with the lights on, folks. || PHANTASM is an uneven work, too fantastic to be genuinely scary but ferociously unique and fascinating on numerous levels.

I think at the forefront there was a desire here to create a warped and entirely original Universe where nothing is as it seems and anything can - and probably will - happen. Logic is quickly cast aside and indeed has no place in the crooked landscape that PHANTASM paints. Into this bizarre, surreal.......even Dali-like twisted cosmos, are thrust a group of characters who - perhaps even by virtue of their acting inadequacies - seem somehow as much a part of the fabric of that Universe, even in their struggles to survive and make sense of it.

For me, PHANTASM has a hypnotic effect for all those reasons. Flying sphere drills, a gender bending alien cemetery keeper, hooded shrunken corpses refined for slave labour in some parallel Universe, a severed finger that morphs into a grotesque (if admittedly comical) fly and countless other wild fantasies are all episodic nightmares that work their way into my head and stay there - however well or not they may be executed. They are indeed, the essence of all the darkest, unfathomable episodes that invade our deepest sleep.

Also, the film's tendency to bounce us in and out of reality - if indeed there is a reality present at all - without warning, keeps us permanently on unstable ground. Dreams are very prominent and indeed prevalent in PHANTASM. So much so, that by the end there seems no dividing line between that which was real and which was not. In this sense, the film explored the territory that NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET would later make it's own but somehow achieves a dream-like quality that even Craven's classic would not surpass. Only Dario Argento's similarly bizarre INFERNO comes to mind as a rival to PHANTASM for the closest we might get to a dream realised on film.

PHANTASM is a unique, mind bending vision of quaint, small town America, infused with hellish fantasies of death, loss and isolation, unleashed from the subconscious mind - perhaps even in the end, from that of it's young, insecure and lonely adolescent protagonist.

Poe said ""Is all that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?""

PHANTASM presents a case.

I urge those who are not impressed, to watch it again with these notions in mind."

But mother's off her rocker again.,"Horror, Mystery, Thriller",93,1986-04-02,en,5.643,401,1.3148,"Anthony Perkins, Diana Scarwid, Jeff Fahey, Roberta Maxwell, Hugh Gillin",Anthony Perkins,"depression, prostitute, schizophrenia, nun, psychopath, gore, sequel, murder, cross dressing, slasher, corpse, mental illness","Retreads the original, but with interesting additions

A month after the events of “Psycho II” (1983), a grief-stricken former nun (Diana Scarwid), a wannabe rock star (Jeff Fahey), a meddling reporter (Roberta Maxwell) and a bunch of football fans converge on the Bates Motel and the crazy world of Norman Bates (Anthony Hopkins).

Like the previous installment, “Psycho III” (1986) is a quality continuation of the iconic 1960 film, but more of a retread, which is why some call it a spiritual remake. I like it a little better than the prior sequel because it omits the contrived and confusing twists & turns of the second half. (But, if you seriously reflect on “Psycho II,” everything makes sense after the climatic reveal; you just have to put the pieces of the puzzle together).

Besides Scarwid, the film scores pretty well in the female department with comely redhead Juliette Cummins from “Friday the 13th Part V” (1985) and brunette Katt Shea. The film effectively contrasts lust and love. In addition, Fahey makes for an entertaining character and I like the addition of the celebratory football fanatics. There’s some atmospheric cinematography as well, directed by Perkins. 

What’s great about the Psycho franchise is that it has its own story and Norman is a sympathetic character. It’s really a tragedy and not like the formulaic slasher where the killer is a zombie-like machine and all its victims are mostly partying teenagers.

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and, like the other two films, was shot at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California.

GRADE: B"

Is he really cured, or will he kill again?","It's 22 years later, and Norman Bates is coming home.","Horror, Mystery, Thriller",113,1983-06-03,en,6.48,669,1.807,"Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Meg Tilly, Robert Loggia, Dennis Franz","Richard Franklin, Tom Holland","psychopath, insanity, motel, sequel, revenge, murder, mental illness, framed for murder, voyeur, mother son relationship, admiring","We all go a little sequel crazy sometimes.

22 years after the murderous and maniacal events at Bates Motel, Norman Bates, freshly released from a mental institution, is back home; and the spectre of ”Mother” is waiting to greet him.

We could say it was a cynical attempt at latching onto the coat tails of the 1980s slasher boom, but in spite of having the unenviable task of being a sequel to a masterpiece, Psycho II is a rather nifty sequel.

Director Richard Franklin is helped by having Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles heading up the cast list, this gives the film instant credibility, and while the mighty spectre of Hitchcock looms large, Franklin doesn’t copy the maestro and brings his own visual smarts to the piece.

Tom Holland’s screenplay doesn’t mimic either, expanding the Bates story with a series of quality twists whilst keeping the mystery element strong and the gripping factor on the high heat. Dean Cundey (cinematography) and Jerry Goldsmith (music) round out the strong points of the film’s tech credits.

Not to be dismissed as a lazy cash in, this is well worth a look. Great ending as well! 7/10 || When phantoms of the past won’t let you live in peace

After 22 years at an asylum, Norman Bates (Anthony Hopkins) is declared sane and released, which is radically opposed by Lila Loomis, AKA Lila Crane from the original movie (Vera Miles). Norman goes back to his deceased mother’s house & motel where he befriends a compassionate local waitress (Meg Tilly). Unfortunately, some unforgiving locals won’t let him live in peace.

The first half of “Psycho II” (1983) is a compelling continuation of the classic 1960 film whereupon there’s an unexpected plot development around the mid-point (which is great, by the way).

From there, the events tend to bog down inside the creepy house with somewhat contrived twists & turns as the creators try to keep you confused as to who’s killing who. Thankfully, everything is sort of explained at the end with another revelation and what happened makes sense if you think about it. I say “sort of” because the truth isn’t fully spelled out. I appreciate that the film respects the intelligence of the viewer, but they should’ve made it a little clearer IMHO.

In any case, “Psycho II” includes several elements of the original while expanding on the story.

What’s great about the Psycho franchise is that it has its own story and Norman is a sympathetic character. It’s really a tragedy and not like the typical slasher where the antagonist is a zombie-like killing machine and its victims are mostly partying teenagers.

The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and, like the first film, was shot at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California.

GRADE: B

EXPLANATION ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don’t read further unless you’ve seen the film)

Miss Spool killed Toomey, the boy and Lila. Mary’s killing of Dr. Raymond was unintentional. Lila was a vindictive biyatch, but she wasn’t a killer. The only time Norman kills anyone is Miss Spool at the end. As far as her being Norman’s real mother or not, see “Psycho III” (1986). || Good movie!"

The plot interveaves a story of local politics nicely with a lust for power, and a coming of age for many of the locals who are in awe of their warrior leader. Takako Irie is quite interesting as the wife of the arrested Chamberlain; she looks every inch the prim and proper Japanese wife, but is frequently (and to Mifune's chagrin, on occasion) the character delivering some quite insightful and learned comment; she seems to have the measure of the Samurai! I found Mifune's performance to be engaging and charming - he deals with his men as a teacher might his pupils, sometimes with humour, other times with discipline - but always with care; and that speaks more to the way Kurosawa develops the characterisations - with integrity and class. It's still got it's fair share of action and there are loads of sword-fights to keep the plot moving along until it all comes to an head.

It's one of those films that any film lover has to see to judge for themselves. A critical darling and an award winner, it's a film of undoubted emotional power. It is based on the tragic case of Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) who was raped and murdered in 1993, it would become one of the significant cases of hate crime in American history.

From the off Kimberly Peirce's film sets out its stall that we are in bleak territory, and so it proves. It dangles little shards of light, but constantly it proves uncompromising and unpleasant. There's a nagging irk that main characters are very thinly drawn, where motives are given short shrift, and this is bizarre given that the pic runs for nearly two hours. However, the performances of both Swank and Chloë Sevigny are outstanding, and Peirce handles the darkest scenes in the movie with a grace and tact that deserves applause. 

A tale that needed to be told, even in truncated form, Boys Don't Cry is fine cinema making. 8/10 || The atmosphere completely different from that nowadays. This was probably the first time for man to express his own feelings and sexual identity in public. So, it was something like a Big Bang for people who experienced fact that some of their kith are ""such a weirdos"".
If you compare understanding of people today and only about 2 decades ago you can see that struggle for freedom and equality always exists, but they're a bit different. I may say the sexual revolution has just started and, if you compare some movie from 2000th, 2020th and (probably) 2040th, you will see people are starting to be more aware of changing in global sexual situation and, what is more important, it won't be taboo topic in the future.


Kimberly Pierce made Teena Brandon being born-girl, living-boy. Teena was a very brave person, worth living more than ""boys from gangs"" without any drop of emotion and understanding others, in themselves.

Person is changing during his life. People are changing during universal time. This is part of so called evolution. Not necessary revolution!

Be who you are :)

THE BLUEST EYES IN TEXAS

The lonesome Texas sun was setting low
And in the rear view mirror I watched it go
I can still see the wind in her golden hair
I close my eyes for a moment, I'm still here

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill
The midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
(Where did I go wrong)
Did I wait too long
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

Another town, another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely way before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill
The midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
(Where did I go wrong)
Did I wait too long
Or can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

For every heart you break
You pay a price
But I can't forget the tears
In her blue eyes

The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill
The midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
(Where did I go wrong)
Did I wait too long
How can I make it right
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight

“Risky Business” (1983) stars Tom Cruise as a preppy teen from the Chicago suburbs. When his parents leave for a trip, he has the house to himself and enlists the services of a call girl (Rebecca De Mornay), which leads to serious and amusing problems.

This is the film with the iconic sequence of Cruise lip-syncing in private to Bob Seger’s ""Old Time Rock and Roll."" We’ve all done it. In any case, “Risky Business” is similar to “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” (1986), but with the artiness of “Less than Zero” (1987) minus the melancholy.

As far as all-around entertainment goes, this is an easy 7/10, but I have to lower my grade due to the glorification of prostitution. Yes, I realize it’s a teen comedy and you have to roll with it to enjoy it, which I did and did.

But the portrayal of prostitution & prostitutes is strictly fantasyland and I find it disingenuous and irresponsible.  Would all these guys seriously be so hot for these women who have sex with several strangers every work day? Am I the only one who finds this gross? Wouldn’t at least some of them be concerned about STDs? Wouldn’t the loose lifestyle of prostitution negatively affect the women, psychologically and spiritually? Wouldn’t there be signs of “wear and tear”? Of course none of these types of realities are addressed.

The film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Highland Park, Illinois, & the Chicago area.

All the practical effects, exquisite violence & nudity and provocative sci-fi themes you've come to expect from this sort of thing, but twists and turns that start just five minutes in and keep running all the way through to the end. _Total Recall_ is a must-see.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || Verhoeven bonkers adaptation of a P. K. Dick story. 

Doug Quaid keeps getting recurring dreams about a visit to Mars. In spite of his friends warnings, he decides to have a memory implanted Mars holiday. But during the implantation he remembers being a secret agent who is fighting evil Mars boss Vilos Cohaagen. Things are about to go very intergalactic bonkers indeed.

Total Recall finds director Paul Verhoeven on particularly OTT form, with the often maligned director cranking up the action and violence to the max. So then, who better to play out the carnage than the big Austrian oak himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger? It was actually Schwarzenegger who brought Verhoeven into the picture. The idea for the film had been kicking around for years, a number of director's came and went, David Cronenberg famously worked on a screenplay for a year only to have it jettisoned for being too close to the P. K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"". The makers wanted a high energy sci-fi blockbuster, a star vehicle for Schwarzenegger, and Verhoeven was only too happy to oblige. 

Total Recall is a fascinating concept as we find ourselves wondering what in fact is reality? Quaid himself is never quite sure as the film takes a delicious twist at the midpoint to further compound the confusion, but in true Verhoeven style, it all comes crashing together in a giant ball of bangs, crashes and explosions. It should be noted that the film is far removed from the cerebral essence of Dick's story, and really when one saw that Schwarzenegger was to star in a Verhoeven directed adaptation, one really should be prepared for the high octane brain dumb down that Total Recall is. Something which was beyond some highbrow critics who are still baffled by the gargantuan financial success of the film (it made over $260 million worldwide).

Fleshing out the cast are a stoic reliable bunch. Rachael Ticotin, Ronny Cox, Sharon Stone & Michael Ironside deliver the expected tongue in cheek professionalism. While the effects prove to be a mixture of the poor and the decent; tho it's nice to see the often lost art of model work being of a pretty high standard. All of which leaves me personally with a film that I find to be a hugely enjoyable piece of uber violent popcorn fodder. 8/10 || Aside from maybe ""Predator"" (1987) this is probably my favourite outing from Arnold Schwarzenegger. He (""Quaid"") goes off to have an harmless implant of memories from an holiday on Mars (that he hasn't had) only to find that his life starts to unwind very quickly afterwards. Even his girlfriend ""Lori"" (Sharon Stone) becomes a would-be assassin and he is soon under attack from just about every other quarter too. Why? Well, that's what we now explore as he decides that he - helped by a video iteration of himself - must travel back to the red planet and get to the bottom of things. My flaw - well Ronny Cox is just dreadful as ""Cohaagen"" which does prove important towards the end of the film, but for the main part it is an action packed and well directed vehicle for a very much on-form star. It's one of the first films I recall that started messing about with timelines. We are not quite sure what happened when or if, indeed, at all - and Paul Verhoeven keeps that tempo running well right from the start of the film. Arnie has a chance to deliver some quite fun one-liners and the visual effects enhance, sparingly, the production rather than impose themselves on it. It has dated a little, some of the sets do look a bit static, but thirty-odd years on, it's still standing up well and is well worth seeing."

Warning: Spoilers
 
Body Heat is written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan and stars William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Richard Crenna, Ted Danson, J.A. Preston and Mickey Rourke. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Richard H. Cline. Plot sees Hurt as small time Florida lawyer Ned Racine who falls in love and lust with smouldering babe Matty Walker (Turner). Trouble is is that she is married, and as the affair grows more torrid, the pair begin to hatch plans to kill the husband (Crenna) so as to be together and get very rich in the process...

Well some can chide it for its debt to Double Indemnity, or even glance scornfully at Kasdan for using sex to sell his reinvention of amoral noirs of the 40s and 50s, but it stands tall and proud in my book of best neo-noirs produced. Causing quite a stir upon its release, Body Heat under Kasdan's watchful eye has most things right for a nod to the glory days of film noir. Male protagonist caught in a lusty web of deceit and murder, femme fatale so smouldering her skin literally does burn, twists and turns in the narrative, photography keeping it down low on light but expanding the colours for extra lurid effect, and a score that fuses seedy like jazz with low Bondian base strains that suddenly get attacked by a shrill to outline the hapless Racine's imploding panic. The dialogue, too, is devilish, especially when delivered so sensually by Turner's crafty honey, a lady bridging the gap between Lauren Bacall and Jessica Rabbit. Yep! Body Heat has it all going on.

That was her special gift, she was relentless.

Basically Kasdan has brought to life the suggestion involved of something like Double Indemnity, and set it in a sweltering modern day Florida. Free of any code restrictions, he unleashes the sex between the two principals and wraps his biting story around it. It's never sordid or done for the sake of selling tickets, it expertly realises the passion, trickery, and even genuine love? That's going on between Matty and Ned. Helps, too, that Turner and Hurt are terrific in performance and chemistry, while the support cast, courtesy of well thought out writing, really flesh out the plot. There's a problem for genre fans that stop it being a masterpiece all told, that of there being no shock factor come the finale reveal, but the slow boil to the outcome is positively gripping. While the visual views we get of Matty in the final frames leave a question tantalisingly hanging in the air...

Slick and sexy, tricky and teetering, Body Heat stokes the fires of noir conventions of old with some style. 9/10"

A lone gunman with no name and seemingly with no past, rides into the dusky town of Lago. The residents of Lago at first view the stranger with suspicion, but when news that some outlaws that are out for blood are on their way to town, they ask the stranger for his help. 

This is Clint Eastwood's first Western film that he directed, and it's clear and evident that the guy not only loves the genre that made his name, he also knows what makes it work. Obviously having worked for Sergio Leone, Eastwood was making notes because High Plains Drifter oozes the mythical aura of many of Leone's finest genre offerings. To which, with thanks, the result is one of the best offerings in the 70s for the Oater enthusiast. 

The film opens with our mysterious drifter slowly coming out of the beautiful sprawling haze and into Lago, it's ethereal, then there's just the sound of the horse breathing and the clop of its hooves that can be heard (the sound mix here is incredible), it's a gloriously mysterious opening that sets the tone perfectly. Yet Eastwood is just toying with us though, for a quick jolt of sex and violence snaps us out of the beatific warmth and into a quite hauntingly cold and morally challenged place. From here on in the stranger will demand all manner of odd things from the residents of Lago, he seems to be toying with them and revelling in their discomfort, with Lago quickly resembling an arid hellhole. You see, Lago has a dark secret, and our mysterious stranger has a purpose, and it's this purpose that makes High Plains Drifter an intriguing and gripping experience. 

A well known fact now is that the great man of the genre, John Wayne, wrote Eastwood to strongly complain about his harsh vision of the West, one can only think the Duke failed to grasp the post Vietnam feel of a 70s made Western. It's a great directorial effort from Eastwood, more so when you marry up his acting performance to his directorial duties. Very much the perfect role, it lets Eastwood accentuate his rugged Western leanings. Eastwood would direct the similarly themed Pale Rider in the 80s and then the genre crown topper Unforgiven in the 90s. A Western great in each decade? Well that will always be debatable, but what we do know is that the Western genre was considerably lucky to have had such a man to keep the genre going for the newer interested wanderers into the Wild West. 

Beautifully photographed (Bruce Surtees) on the shores of Mono Lake, California, it's a film pungent with sex, sadism, retribution and risks. High Plains Drifter is mystical and magnificent and essential Western fare. 9/10 || I don't have much to say about <em>'High Plains Drifter'</em>. It didn't thrill me or anything, but it did keep my attention from start-to-finish so it's evidently a good film.

Clint Eastwood is the only cast member worth talking about, he gives a commanding performance in the lead role. Geoffrey Lewis, a frequent castmate of Eastwood's, is the best of the rest, if I had to pick. The film does feature dark themes, which helps the film's pacing out a lot.

It's nothing special in my eyes, though there is entertainment there no doubt. It's a borderline 8* rating for me, but not quite. || Another Hollywood (spaghetti) formula Western where homicidal maniacs abound.
Here, Clint plays a homicidal maniac who obviously comes back from the dead after being killed by three bad guys and betrayed by an entire town of people.
So, the first thing he does is murder the only three men who weren't part of that. Makes sense? Not if you're looking for credible motivation.
But credible motivation isn't a part of most of Eastwood's Westerns. Certainly not the spaghetti ones.
So, the rest of the movie is just sound and fury, signifying nothing, and don't try to make sense out of any of it. It's just another movie about homicidal maniacs being everywhere. If the West or East or anywhere was anything like this, there wouldn't be anyone left in one piece to keep a town going. They'd all either be dead or crippled.
But Eastwood loved to be in that sort of thing. A hundred years from now, he'll be remembered for many good Westerns like Hang Em High and Joe Kidd, and his Rawhid series, and Dirty Harry, because he played credible characters in those. 
He doesn't do that here."
4929.0,Hang 'em High,"Marshall Jed Cooper survives a hanging, vowing revenge on the lynch mob that left him dangling. To carry out his oath for vengeance, he returns to his former job as a lawman. Before long, he's caught up with the nine men on his hit list and starts dispensing his own brand of Wild West justice.",The hanging was the best show in town. But they made two mistakes. They hung the wrong man and they didn't finish the job!,"Western, Drama",114,1968-04-12,en,6.856,791,3.0688,"Clint Eastwood, Inger Stevens, Ed Begley, Pat Hingle, Ben Johnson","Ted Post, Leonard Freeman, Mel Goldberg","prison, death penalty, judge, widow, marshal, oklahoma, cattle drive, hanging, law man, lynching, search party","We all have our ghosts, Marshal.

Hang 'Em High is directed by ted Post and written by Leonard Freeman and Mel Goldberg. It stars Clint Eastwood, Inger Stevens, Pat Hingle, Ed Begley, Ben Johnson, Charles McGraw, Ruth White and Bruce Dern. Music is by Dominic Frontiere and cinematography is shared by Richard H. Kline and Leonard J. South.

An innocent man survives a lynching and returns as a lawman and sets about bringing the vigilantes to justice.

After making a name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy, Eastwood returned to America and began cementing his name in the genre of film that would come to define him. Though very much an American Western, this does have Spaghetti Western tonal splinters. Story is derivative and safe, however the characterisations are not and are pungent enough to warrant viewing investment.

Unfortunately director Ted Post often lets the pace sag to unbearable levels - especially in the last third of film, it's a shame that the mooted Robert Aldrich didn't get the gig. There simply is not enough on the page to sustain the near two hour running time, with the finale proving to be a rather flat experience. The liberal stance on the death penalty is a touch heavy handed, but not so as to kill the picture since the thought process of the complexities of justice holds high interest values. Then of course there is Eastwood to lure one in.

He's not the best actor in the film, though the amorality of character he plays makes him the fascinating centre piece. Hingle steals the acting honours as the stoically forthright Judge Fenton, while Stevens also shines as Rachael Warren, a character who like Eastwood's Jed Cooper has an obsessional motive for capturing criminals in her heart. All told the perfs across the board are pitched right and good value.

I'm not sure if the fact two cinematographers were used was a job for mates scenario? Whatever though, for there's nice work here, the New Mexico locations pleasing and at the same time mood compliant for the harsher edges of the story. Frontiers's music is interesting, full of ebullience - sometimes overbearing, it strangely at times sounds familiar to some of Herrmann's compositions in the fantasy genre...

Hang 'Em High is an important entry in the Western genre library, though neither great or bad, it's still a must see for genre enthusiasts. 7/10 || <em>'Hang ’em High'</em> is entertaining stuff.

I personally think the first half is much stronger than the second half, which loses its way a tad and ends up concluding in a perfectly good but not as great way as what I had wanted - based on the impressive opening hour or so.

Clint Eastwood, though, is excellent from start-to-finish. I undoubtedly enjoyed his performance, which is great to see follow on from the major highs of the Dollars trilogy. Pat Hingle is also a positive performer, he and Eastwood share one terrific scene in particular. || When ""Cooper"" (Clint Eastwood) gets caught up in a case of mistaken identity, he is all but lynched by a group of citizens convinced he has committed murder. Luckily for him, he is snatched from the jaws of death by deputy ""Bliss"" (Ben Johnson) who takes him in for a more legitimate hanging. Fortune continues to shine on ""Cooper"" though, when local judge ""Fenton"" (Pat Hingle) finds his story checks out and offers him a job with a badge of his own. This isn't to take the law into his own hands - he is expected to bring the men who tried to kill him in for due process. He might be willing enough, but are they? Meantime, he finds that his rekindled law-man occupation sees him involved in other dangerous business, and after one especially close near-miss, he finds himself falling for the nagging ""Rachel"" (Inger Stevens) who has her own fairly harrowing story to relate. On the face of it, this is just another routine revenge western, but Eastwood and Hingle deliver a bit more than that as they try to apply some elements of the rule of law to a society that is still pretty much living a survival of the fittest (or fastest) existence. We get to know a little more of some of the vigilantes and realise that perhaps they weren't quite as brutal as initially thought - some attempt is made to give the characters some personality. The production isn't the best though - I'm sure I saw a car in shot at one point, and the studio sets are all very familiar, but Eastwood imbues his persona with a degree of his less-is-more style of decency as we head to a denouement that's predicable in outcome, but not so much in execution."

Wilke","Terrence Malick, Terrence Malick","chicago, illinois, farm, husband wife relationship, love triangle, texas, marriage, field, love, poverty, class differences, farmer, jealous husband, harvest, relaxed, ambiguous","Following the story of Bill (Richard Gere), a hard working laborer in the early 19th century, Days Of Heaven is a cinematic masterpiece. Accompanied by his girlfriend, Abby (Brooke Adams) and sister (Linda Manz), Bill departs on a steam engine for a lone wheat farm in Texas for work. The journey is a long one, but director Terrence Malick makes the ride pleasant with beautiful shots of nature at its best.
The rest of the movie follows suit. Although once at the farm the labor is arduous for the three characters, they find solace in being surrounded by the natural aesthetics. Everything is made even better when Bill, against his better judgment, convinces Abby to marry the owner of the farm. Life becomes carefree.
The common thread that ties the film together is the depiction of nature. The plains of Texas are exactly that–plain. Malick is able to capture this simplicity and turn it into something extraordinarily beautiful. A common theme emerges–the relationship between humans and nature. At times the relationship can be a close one, as illustrated by the carefree frolicking through the fields. However at other times, by piecing together wide shots of the plains, Malick portrays humans as insignificant in comparison to nature.  While the two are contrasts, the two work together to form a cohesive depiction of nature. This relationship is especially illuminated by the attempt to industrialize the farm. Steam engines and massive coal powered plows stand tall over the individual farmhands. One can look at these massive machines as an attempt for man to conquer nature and assert his dominance.
Additionally, Malick is able to give nature emotion, almost as vivid as if it was an animate object. Wheat blowing back and forth in the wind while the sun shines through the clouds provides for a very melancholy and relaxed mood. The breeze is almost palpable on one’s cheek. Yet, when the massive machines arrive and the farmhands are forced to do intense manual labor, the calmness disappears. Life becomes hectic. This contrast shows the duality of nature. For every pleasant thing in life, there is a bad thing as its complement– much like heaven and hell. This is extremely apparent when Bill attempts to leave the farm for the second time. As he leaves the farmer’s residence, he hears a droning sound. Before Bill or the viewer understands what is happening, the sky opens up with locusts. The farm literally becomes engulfed in these insects coming straight out of the ten plagues. All hell breaks loose–sirens sound and hundreds of workers tried to get these locusts off the farm. All that is beautiful–the wheat, the sky, and the vast emptiness of the plains–is covered up. It is almost as if hell is covering the heaven on earth. This allegory becomes even clearer once a fire erupts. The days in heaven are clearly over as the fire cannot be contained and the beauty is physically destroyed. Following the duality in nature already established by the movie, heaven is subsequently restored. Although most of the crops are gone after the fire, the land still has an aesthetic quality to it. And although Bill and Abby never find solace after fleeing, Bill’s sister finds herself enjoying life again after reuniting with her friend. Just as it had been during the days of heaven, she is carefree again. || Outstanding. My second favourite Malick film next to Badlands. I'm not sure anyone has ever been better at photographing fire. The only other of his films I have seen thus far is 'To the Wonder', but it's films like this that make me such a lover of cinema. I'm not a Richard Gere fan in the slightest (though I have always loved Brooke Adams), but it's roles like this that cement his reputation as a cinematic icon in my books. I didn't say 'actor' because I'm not really sure that's his strength--it's more a presence, such as Alain Delon in 'Le Samourai'. || I wasn't ever really a fan of Richard Gere. Maybe it was just all that hair? Anyway, in this rather poignant story he is ""Bill"" who works in a smelter in Chicago whilst living with ""Amy"" (Brooke Adams) and his younger sister ""Linda"" (Linda Manz). He's not happy, and after the latest in a series of lively squabbles with his foreman, the three decide to quit the city and head to Texas where they find casual work on farm. As the season progresses, it soon becomes clear that the owner of the farm (Sam Shepard) has taken a bit of a shine to ""Abby"". He is poorly and ""Bill"" reckons that he isn't destined to be long for the world, so ""Abby"" agrees to marry him so that, in due course, they can inherit the whole shebang! Thing is, though, someone's been telling some fibs and the perhaps the farmer isn't quite so close to his sell-by date as many had been led to believe! Things only get murkier when we learn that ""Bill"" has a past - and that past is homing in on their new lives and threatening their triumvirate. It's gently narrated by ""Linda"" and the story from Terrence Malick is tightly packaged into a quickly paced ninety minutes of characterful, sometimes poignant, drama. Shepard gets the plaudits from me, his performance stands out but generally this is a decent ensemble effort that guides us through a story of avarice, loyalty and menace with aplomb. Gere still isn't great, but the film looks great and is certainly worth a watch."

Niagara Falls, so often a place of honeymoon love is the setting for this engrossing and gripping thriller directed with tight astuteness by the brilliant Henry Hathaway. Hathaway works from a screenplay collectively written by Charles Brackett, Walter Reisch and Richard L. Breen. It stars Joseph Cotton, Marilyn Monroe, Jean Peters, Max Showalter (as Casey Adams), Denis O'Dea and Richard Allan. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald.

Plot wise it's very simple, the core essence that of an unfaithful wife scheming against her husband - thus garnering peril ire from the jealously unstable man -  but simplicity of plot does not stop this from reaching craftily high peaks. Hathaway and MacDonald breathtakingly weave the splendid location into the unfolding story, something that simultaneously brings out the sensual beauty of the two lovely leading ladies, with the sense of danger still always as a constant factor. The framing of man made structures such as staircases and the bell tower are readily given a noir vibe, again enhancing a story pungent with human fallibilities and dripping wet metaphors.

Now that the film is readily available in restored home formats, one gets to see the sublime work of MacDonald. The Technicolour photography has a lurid broody sheen to it, thus enhancing the disquiet mood pulsing away in the story and that of Monroe's sensuality within it. Peters (a true classic beauty), in what is the toughest part, doesn't let her character become secondary to Monroe's (even more impressive given Monroe's fine work and Hathaway's lingering usage of her), so much so that when the edge of the seat finale arrives we the audience are fully immersed in it. While Cotten as the tortured husband to Monroe's adulterous wife nails the duality of the character for maximum returns.

Nature's ferocious marvel and the raw power of sex and its destructive powers comes crashing together in this early 50s Hitchcockian like diamond. 8/10"
3767.0,Gilda,"A gambler discovers an old flame while in Argentina, but she's married to his new boss.",There NEVER was a woman like Gilda!,"Romance, Drama, Thriller",110,1946-04-25,en,7.495,600,1.5321,"Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, George Macready, Joseph Calleia, Steven Geray",Charles Vidor,"jealousy, casino, penalty, nightclub, buenos aires, argentina, tricks, patent, film noir, argentina, extramarital affair","Gilda is just like Casablanca if Casablanca had a happy ending, which would have been a bad idea even if it hadn’t been already done two years earlier in To Have and Have Not (which at least had Bogie in it). 

Like Casablanca, Gilda revolves around a love triangle set in a gambling establishment in an exotic location, but while Casablanca takes place in North Africa during World War II, Gilda takes place in South America just after the war. Moreover, if Casablanca ends with ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", Gilda concludes with the continuation of a horrible romance.

Following the Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), Victor Lazlo (Paul Heinreid) pattern, Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) lives a carefree existence running a casino in Buenos Aires until Gilda (Rita Hayworth) walks back into his life hand-in-hand with Ballin Mundson (George Macready). 

Macready, despite his character's unfortunate name (Victor Lazlo sounds merely foreign; Ballin Mundson is positively alien), and especially Hayworth, look their parts to a T; as for Ford, let's just say he was taller than Bogie, but there’s a big difference between height and stature.

Gilda has married Ballin after knowing him all of one day. This drives Johnny mad with jealousy; however, to Gilda's chagrin, he’s less jealous of Ballin than of her — and understandably so; casino owner Ballin is something of a mentor and father figure to Johnny, who in turn is his bodyguard, confidante, and right-hand man. In short, Johnny is betrayed by Ballin and Ballin is betrayed by Gilda with Johnny's complicity, though Johnny more to protect Ballin than to help her.

The whole thing is sick and twisted and a lot of fun thanks to Hayworth; Johnny hates her with a passion, and if we never question the authenticity and intensity of this feeling, it is not Ford's performance but hers that makes us, not only believe in Johnny’s hatred of her, but in fact even share it. 

Like Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage, Hayworth owes her well-deserved fame to an absolutely infamous character. The difference is that Leslie Howard eventually wins, like Scott Pilgrim, The Power of Self-Respect, Johnny, however, ends up not only putting the pussy on a pedestal, but keeping it there.

He begs Gilda: “I want to go with you … Please take me,” and is lucky, or rather unlucky enough that Gilda welcomes him back with open arms, rationalizing this decision with the dubious logic that “No one has to apologize because we were both scoundrels, right? Isn’t it wonderful?"". All things considered, some couples will always have Paris; for others, there’s always Family Court. || ""Johnny"" (Glenn Ford) is quite a streetwise gambler who finds himself rescued amidst the Buenos Aires docks by a suave stranger whose cane comes with a rather lethal optional extra. He suggests that he try his luck at a casino and when he manages to fleece the dealer of a modest fortune, discovers that it's owned by his erstwhile benefactor ""Mundson"" (George Macready). He manages to avoid a beating by suggesting that he put his skills to better use and well, this next bit you can guess. By the time his boss wants to take an holiday, ""Johnny"" is pretty much running the joint, but he's ill-prepared for the shock when he discovers that there's a new wife on the scene and that it's pretty plain for all to see that ""Gilda"" (Rita Hayworth) and he have some sort of past. What now ensues sees ""Johnny"" having to navigate the waters of a marriage in which the wife feels somewhat less engaged than the husband, and all while the local cops are keeping a very close eye on operations at the venue where gambling is illegal and bribery pretty rife. As tensions mount amongst the three, it becomes precarious for a man who has become fond of his boss and even more wary of a woman who is no slouch when it comes to scheming. On the face of it, it's just another love triangle film noir, but there are strong characterisations here from Macready, and on-form Hayworth and there is also an amiable effort from Steven Geray as the sagely ""Uncle Pio"" - he sort of reminded me a little of a Shakespearian fool. Even Ford, not always the most versatile of actors, turns in a well considered contribution as the smouldering takes us to a denouement that smacks of betrayal and conspiracy. Usually when there is a surfeit of writers, the dialogue can get a bit waffly, but here under the guidance of Charles Vidor, the story gathers pace cohesively and leaves us with a superior thriller that has just enough romance to make it work, but not so much to throttle it. Anita Ellis does the singing, but there are still some classy dance numbers from an elegant Hayworth too and the miming isn't so very clear, either!"

Hooked up with this man, they meet his open-minded sister (Mary Astor) to whom “Gerry” spins some fanciful yarns about her husband that only come home to roost when that poor soul, determined not to give up on his wife, arrives and risks spoiling her carefully stacked line of fibbing dominoes. What chance they can get the money without someone in this ostensibly spoiled and vacuous scenario cottoning on? The story is a bit on the far-fetched side, but Colbert has excellent comedy timing and there are quite a few pithy gems amidst the fairly relentless dialogue as the story takes aim at the owners of inherited wealth and at attitudes to the wealthy from those who aspire and despise in equal measure. There’s some fun chemistry on display between all four here and though the denouement is a little rushed and disappointing, this is still a fun romp that I did quite enjoy."

It is a very positive-looking film with an upbeat theme and that helps carry what is otherwise a really rather poorly acted affair with some clunky dialogue and a narrative that follows a fairly predictable pattern - before the ending that we just know is coming. Laura Branigan and Giorgio Moroder had a hand in the rest of the soundtrack, which when you watch this film again after all but forty years proves remarkably memorable (if not great).

Even though it's gargantuan in length, this is actually a ""small"" screen adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play. Met with indifference by the critics of the time, it has however come to be loved by many a musical fan. I'm not one of them though...

There's no denying that the songs are superb, mostly top draw, but there are so many irritating issues within. The much discussed colour filters that were used by director Joshua Logan and cinematographer Leon Shamroy, are overkill, trying to supplant whimsy when really a static set can't carry the treatment. Pic is easily 45 minutes too long, thus when the war sequences come so late in the play they feel at odds with what has transpired in the previous 2 hours of film.

Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi as our loved up lovers are polar opposites on character terms, but also in acting skills. She is radiant for the key musical numbers, but her character away from the musical numbers starts to grate the longer the pic goes on. He, well he's as stiff as one of Logan's camera set-ups is. Even some of the dancing choreography comes off as something that was originally thrown away during production discussions.

The tunes carry you through to the end, for they demand to be given our attention, but really this is one musical that I really could never watch again. 5/10 || Amidst the backdrop of the Second World War, Joshua Logan takes us, courtesy of Rodgers and Hammerstein, on a romance set on a beautiful tropical island. Mitzi Gaynor is one of the few women here who is surrounded by squad of hormonal sailors who declare ""There's Nothing Like a Dame"" early on, so she has no shortage of would-be suitors. Also on this island is the Frenchman ""Emile"" (Rossano Brazzi) whom the visitors want to use to help map out the adjacent islands held by the Japanese. What now ensues follows the will they/won't they nature of their developing relationship interspersed with some wartime plotting and peppered with musical standards like ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair""; ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and ""Younger than Springtime"" the film trundles along to it's rather obvious conclusion. There can be no doubt that the songs are memorable, but there is not a jot of chemistry between Brazzi and the increasingly Doris Day-esque Gaynor and the ensemble chorus numbers come across as overly choreographed and not in the least natural. For much of the film, it appears as if it's shot through a telescope with slightly blurred edges. Initially reminiscent of dream sequences, this technique soon loses it's potency and ends up contributing little to this generally rather lacklustre and thinly plotted comic love story. There's also no getting away from the glaringly obvious dubbing as Giorgio Tozzi provided the real operatic bass tones on behalf of our leading man. The music carries this a great deal, but the rest of it is little better than colourful wartime B-movie that I found did disappoint."

Right up there with my favourite Aldrich films (though maybe 'Kiss Me Deadly' is still my number one), and of the greatest performances of both Lee Marvin and John Cassavetes (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at both the Golden Globes and Oscars for his work here).

This hearkened back to the heady times when if you got a great cast and director together, you were virtually guaranteed you'd come out of it, because of comparatively little studio interference, with a bonafide classic piece of cinema. People thought the studio system was broken and needed fixing, by films such as 'Easy Rider'? THIS, along with other fine Aldrich works from this period, age a lot better and hold up much finer today than Dennis Hopper's so-called 'masterpiece' and its ilk. || One of the most quintessential macho movies of all time. 

The Dirty Dozen is directed by Robert Aldrich and adapted for the screen by Nunnally Johnson & Lukas Heller from the novel by E. M. Nathanson. It stars Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, John Cassavetes, Donald Sutherland, Richard Jaeckel, Robert Ryan and Jim Brown.

1944, just prior to D-Day.

Major Reisman (Marvin) is a none conformist kind of guy and he riles the higher brass no end, so it comes as no surprise to him that he is the man assigned the unenviable task of assembling a suicide squad of army criminals for a mission to destroy a château in France. This particular château has no military value as such, but as it is used by many of the Nazi big chiefs, destroying it whilst they relax inside will upset the German plans immensely. But can this rag tag band of murderers, rapists and thieves shape up into something resembling a fighting force? Their reward, should they survive the mission, is amnesty, but Reisman for sure has his hands full on both sides of the war.

""One: down to the road block, we've just begun.. Two: the guards are through.. Three: the Major's men are on a spree.. Four: Major and Wladislaw go through the door..

The Dirty Dozen has become one of those films that is a perennial holiday favourite like The Great Escape, Zulu and The Magnificent Seven. Which while it most definitely deserves such big exposure, it's a little surprising it's part of the holiday viewing schedules given its cynicism and amoral core, something which is one of the many great & intriguing things about Aldrich's testosterone laced movie. Met with mixed reviews on release, with the negative side of the fence bemoaning its nasty violence and preposterous plot, The Dirty Dozen none the less performed great at the box office where it was the fifth highest grosser of the year and the number one money maker in terms of profit to budget. Coming as it did during the middle of the Vietnam War, it was evident that the paying public quite easily bought into the thematics of it all. Over 50 years since it first lured people into the picture houses, Aldrich's movie shows no sign of aged frayed edges, or better still, and more remarkable, the enjoyability factors it holds has not diminished.

What makes it a great film, then? First off is the all-star macho cast assembled by Aldrich and his team, big hitters like Marvin (stepping in when John Wayne balked at the script), Borgnine, Kennedy, Ryan and Bronson were already names to the public, but these are also supplemented by soon to be ""stars"" like Cassavetes, Sutherland and Savalas (also stepping into a role vacated by another, this time Jack Palance who didn't like the racial aggression of the character) & stoic performers like Jaeckel & Robert Webber. Into the mix is curio value with the casting of singer Trini Lopez and Gridiron star Jim Brown. Throw Clint Walker into the pot as well and you have got a considerable amount of beef in the stew! Secondly the film led the way for a slew of movies that featured bad guys as heroes, so with that Aldrich's film holds up well as being a hugely influential piece. Then thirdly is that not only is it intermittently funny as the violence explodes on the screen, but that it's also chocked full of action and adventure. All that and for those so inclined you can find questionable morals under scrutiny and see the ""war is hell"" banner firmly flown during the nastiness of the missions' culmination.

Split into three parts - meet the guys - see them train - and then the mission, pic has been criticised for its lack of realism, but is that really needed in what is essentially a male fantasy piece setting out to entertain? Besides which, lets applaud it for acknowledging that brutality and atrocities were committed on both sides of the fence, rest assured, The Dirty Dozen still had enough edginess about it back in the 60s! It's also true enough to say that the characters, are in the main, stereotypes, and that the unravelling story is a touch clichéd, but these are men that men want to be (okay maybe not Savalas' religious maniac rapist!) and men that women can cast a flirtatious eye over - there's plenty of character here to hang your hats and undergarments on as they appeal to the inner rebel hidden away in many a viewer. The messages in here are not sledge hammered into the story (Aldrich always said he wasn't making a message movie, just a film about camaraderie and unlikely heroes), and the construction of the action is top notch from one of America's most under appreciated directors. It's nicely shot in 70mm MetroColor/MetroScope by Edward Scaife (Night of the Demon/Khartoum) and features a suitably boisterous music score from Frank De Vol (Cat Ballou/The Flight of the Phoenix).

It's a far from flawless picture, of that there is no doubt, but it's loved by millions and continues to gain an audience yearly by those who are willing to view it on its own entertaining terms. As a boy I wanted to be Lee Marvin because of this film, as a middle aged man now, I still want to be Lee Marvin in this film. That's yet another reason why The Dirty Dozen is so great. 10/10 || Lee Marvin is charged with a mission to drum a dozen criminals and reprobates into some sort of cohesive military unit with a view to destroying an heavily guarded chateau that serves as a respite for high ranking Nazi officers. The challenge looks impossible as the band are assembled - a bigger crowd of cowards, thugs and zealots you would never hope to see; but with the assistance of his stoic sergeant (Richard Jaeckel) he manages to get the wacky zealot Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Sonny Bono, Jim Brown and a woefully sleazy John Cassavetes to pull in the same direction. It's all good stuff, with plenty of humour to keep it all going nicely. Maybe a bit too long, but a good wartime action drama that builds well to a strong conclusion."

- Potential Kermode || Bond, Bowler Hats, Galore and the Man With the Midas Touch.  

Goldfinger is directed by Guy Hamilton and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum & Paul Dehn from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Gert Frobe, Honor Blackman, Shirley Eaton & Harold Sakata. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.

Operation Grand Slam.

Connery's third outing as James Bond sees 007 investigating the movements of wealthy gold dealer Auric Goldfinger (Frobe). Little does 007 or MI6 know, but Goldfinger is hatching a master plan that will spell disaster for the world's financial climate.

Undeniably the turning point in the James Bond franchise, Goldfinger is also one of the most fondly remembered by the cinema loving public. Here is when Bond not only went go-go gadget crazy, but he also impacted on pop culture to the point the waves created are still being felt today. Bond traditionalists are often irked by the mention of the change Goldfinger represents, and with just cause, because this really isn't Fleming's core essence Bond. Bond has now become a gadget using super agent, a man who laughs in the face of death, a quip never far from his lips. Yet the hard facts are that this Bond is the one the world really bought into, ensuring for the foreseeable future at least, that this type of Bond was here to say. Marketing was high pitched, fan worship became feverish and the box office sang to the tune of $125 million. Toys, gimmicks and collectables would follow, the Aston Martin DB5 would become ""The Most Famous Car in the World"", in 1964 Bond truly became a phenomenon.

Purely on an entertainment front, Goldfinger delivers royally, the sets, casting and the high energy set-pieces all seep with quality. This in spite of the actual plot being one of the weakest in the whole franchise. As great a villain as Auric Goldfinger is, with a voice dubbed Frobe simply joyous in the role, his motives are rather dull and hardly cause for some worldwide Bondian panic. But the film rises above it to the point it only really registers long after the end credits have rolled. We have been treated to Odd Job (Sakata instantly becoming a Bond villain legend), that laser, the DB5 and its tricks, the delicious Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (still an awesome name today and still sounding like a character from a Carry On movie), the golf match, Shirley Eaton's golden girl and the ticking time bomb finale played out during the chaotic scenes involving Ken Adam's brilliantly designed version of Fort Knox.

Bond staples also serve the production well, the title sequence is neatly strung together as scenes from the movie play out over a writhing golden girl, who was model Margaret Nolan and who briefly appears in the film as Dink. The theme tune is a blockbuster, sang with gusto by Shirley Bassey and the locations dazzle the eyes as we are whisked to Switzerland, Kentucky and Miami. Stock characters continue to make their marks, with M, Moneypenny and Q (setting in motion the wonderful serious v jocular axis of his ""to be continued"" relationship with Bond), starting to feel like old cinematic friends. Only let down is Cec Linder's turn as Bond's CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter, gone is the swagger created by Jack Lord in Dr. No, and while Linder is no bad actor, he doesn't sit right in the role, he's looks too world weary. A shame because he is integral to how the plot pans out.

Director Guy Hamilton was helming the first of what would end up being four Bond movies on his CV, he made his mark by bringing more zip and quip to the Bond character. Connery was firmly ensconced in the role of Bond, he was a mega star because of it, but cracks were beginning to appear in how Connery viewed this gargantuan success and the impact it was having on his hopes to be viewed as a serious actor. However, he was signed up for Thunderball, the next James Bond adventure, and Terence Young would return to the director's chair, could they top the success of Goldfinger? 9/10 || _**Iconic 60’s Bond film**_

Released in 1964 (or January, 1965, in the USA), ""Goldfinger"" was the third Bond film in three years. This was the film that pushed 007 over-the-top and is rightly considered a classic. It's very iconic of mid-60's cinema -- the title song, the gold-painted woman, Oddjob's deadly hat and the breaking into Fort Knox. The next two films in the series are just as great and IMHO better -- ""Thunderball"" (1965) and ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967). ""Thunderball"" made more at the box office than any other Bond flick from the Connery era and ""You Only Live Twice"" upped the ante with the action & spy stuff and is just all-around entertaining.

Yet ""Goldfinger"" continues to be the Bond film that's most highly regarded of the 60s and this should be respected. But don't expect the wall-to-wall action that was introduced with ""You Only Live Twice"" and remains to this day. Yes, ""Goldfinger"" has some quality action sequences, but less than what you'd typically get from a 007 flick post-""Thunderball.” In fact, one clash in the film is a simple game of golf between James and Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe). An earlier scene involves Bond forcing Goldfinger to lose a card game. This doesn't make ""Goldfinger"" bad, of course, just different. ""A View to a Kill"" (1985) is notable for the same reason.

Other positives include a fairly long sequence in the magnificent Swiss Alps, where it was shot, and quality Bond women like Shirley Eaton (the ‘golden girl’) and brief appearances by Margaret Nolan (Dink) and Nadja Regin (Bonita); Honor Blackman is cool as Pussy Galore, but she never tripped my trigger.

Despite all the good, there are some negatives. For instance, the gas fly-over by Pussy Galore's girls and the falling-over of the troops comes off lame. There's also a little too much ""down time"" in the second half that's not all that interesting.

Nevertheless, ""Goldfinger"" is a James Bond classic, full of iconic imagery and scenes. When it was released it was extraordinary, but it may now strike some viewers as tame or even lame in ways. Regardless, it's definitely a worthy Bond flick and has its unique charm.

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Miami Beach, Florida; England; Switzerland; and Kentucky.

It stars Sean Connery, Daniela Bianchi, Lotte Lenya, Robert Shaw & Pedro Armendáriz. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.

James Bond's second cinematic outing has 007 sent on a mission to Istanbul to try and acquire a Russian cypher machine known as Lektor. It's a trap set up by SPECTRE, who formulate a plan to upset the world order whilst murdering Bond in revenge for his killing of their agent Dr. No.

Spy Hard! A certain JFK had announced From Russia With Love as being one of his favourite books, thus making the minds up of producers Broccoli & Saltzman to make Fleming's Cold War thriller the follow up to Dr. No. It's a favourite of many a Bond aficionado because it represents one of the few occasions where Bond was still down to earth as a person, a hard working agent forced to do detective work. The adaptation is very literate as well, with a high fidelity to the source material a major bonus to Fleming's fans. The story is tautly told, often with dark tints the deeper Bond gets into things, and a number of excellently constructed set pieces fill out the latter half of the picture. It's not hard to understand why Connery cites this as his favourite Bond film.

Though it is mostly free of the gadget excess that would become a trademark of the franchise, it's still very much a quintessential Bond movie. Exotic locations and exotic foes, eye poppingly gorgeous ladies (Bianchi smouldering like few others can), pre-credits sequence, the snazzy title credits (here on a dancing lady), title song crooned by a big name (Matt Munro), Barry's blending of the Bond theme into the score, Blofeld (a faceless Anthony Dawson) and an impressive cast list. One of the film's big strengths is the cast assembled, Connery (firmly moving into iconic realm) is aided considerably by the presence of Lenya, Shaw and Armendáriz, while the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Boothroyd (latterly to be known as Q) is a telling point in the series.

With a $2 million budget in the coffers, the makers were able to really push the boat out technically, and so they were rewarded as the pic went on to gross nearly $79 million Worldwide. Crucially it became apparent that James Bond was popular outside of Britain, the template had been set, what would they do with the next Bond outing we all wondered? 8/10 || _**SPECTRE agents, Istanbul, Gypsies, beautiful women and the Orient Express**_

Agent 007 (Sean Connery) is sent on a dubious mission at Istanbul to possibly acquire a Lektor cryptography device from the Soviets via their consulate. Bond meets a naïve Russian beauty (Daniela Bianchi) that SPECTRE agent Klebb (Lotte Lenya) recruits to carry out their assassination plan with the help of a brawny Irish Assassin (Robert Shaw). 

""From Russian with Love"" (1963) is a solid sequel in the franchise highlighted by the Istanbul locations, the Gypsy sequence where two women have a catfight (Aliza Gur & Martine Beswick) and, later, a serious train scrap. In addition, Eunice Gayson returns for another cameo as Sylvia Trench and the flick closes with a thrilling clash with a helicopter and a boat chase.

Unfortunately, the story’s just not as compelling as “Dr. No” (1962). It’s my least favorite in Connery’s run, although it’s still a solid entry.

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in Istanbul, Turkey; Pinewood Studios near London; and Crinan, Argyll & Bute, Scotland (finale helicopter and boat chase scenes).

GRADE: B- || I love this one... surprise, surprise, surprise. Everyone loves this one.

I think if there were a true point of contest amongst die hard Bond fans it is From Russia With Love v Goldfinger for the best Bond film.

Clearly I'm in the From Russia With Love camp, because it works as a serious spy thriller, it works as a Bond movie, it works as a dramatic thriller and it works as an action movie.

It has enough character to be an extremely well made Bond film, and, for a second outing, nobody has done it better."

People often forget just how important in the grand scheme of things a first film is, and how it was so requisite that Sean Connery had to be just right, the Bond girls, the action, music cues, opening scene, credits sequence, etc. Even though recently, Daniel Craig has at least captivated audiences to almost the same extent, he only reminded me of Connery's endearing qualities, and through completely lacking humour and charisma, simply showed by omission why Connery (who had already made five films as Bond before Craig was even born) was so essential in the first place.

Watching my blu from the complete Bond boxed set, it wasn't dated or a lesser experience for me in the slightest. Long may Sir Connery live--the enjoyment his work has given me over the years is inestimable! =) || The Americans are fools. I offered my services, they refused. So did the East. Now they can both pay for their mistake.  

Dr. No is directed by Terence Young and co-adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood & Berkely Mather from the novel of the same name written by Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Joseph Wiseman, Ursula Andress, Jack Lord & John Kitzmiller. Music is by Monty Norman and cinematography by Ted Moore.

And so it all began here, what was until Harry Potter arrived on the scene, the most successful film franchise in history. James Bond, a name that would become synonymous with suave spies, deranged villains, beautiful women, exotic locations, gadgets, cars and sex. Ian Fleming's James Bond novels were big come the end of 1961, yet producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman met some resistance from studios. It was never plain sailing, even after release the film garnered mixed reviews, but word of mouth and condemnation by the Vatican and the Kremlin propelled it to being one of the surprise hits of 62/63. At the box office it made £60 million Worldwide, this after being made on a budget of only £1 million.

Plot basically sees Connery's Bond flying out to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of agent Strangways (Timothy Moxon). Once there he finds a case of murder is to be investigated and evidence points to the mysterious Dr. No (Wiseman), who resides on Crab Quay island, a place feared by the superstitious locals. Bond must keep his wits about him as he gets closer to the truth, for there are many obstacles in his way and not everyone can be trusted. Cue the suave and athletic Mr. Bond getting involved with lovely ladies, dicing with death, making friends, making enemies and just generally being an all round awesome anti-hero.

SPECTRE: Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.

There are a number of changes from the book and some censor appeasement was required to get the film a certificate enabling youngsters to see the film with an adult. What Dr. No rounds out as is a jolly good spy/action movie yarn. Some of the hints are there for what would make Bond such a profitable and well loved franchise, but there's no sign of the gadgetry, tricks and japes that would fill out so many of the titles that followed Dr. No. Here Bond is just armed with his Walter PPK 7.65MM pistol, Sunbeam Alpine car and his bravado and nouse.

Some future stalwart characters are given modest introductions (M, Felix Leiter, Moneypenny) and Ursula Andress sets the marker for all future Bond girls to follow. Ted Moore's capturing of the Jamaica location is sumptuous, something that really comes to the fore on the re-mastered DVD edition of the film. Connery is supremely cool and fearless, the theme tune and gun barrel opening are already in place, and Terence Young, who directs three of the first four Bond movies, keeps it zippy and suspenseful when story gathers up a flame throwing tank, car chases, fights and a quite brilliant tarantula sequence.

Quite a debut, uneven at times as it begins to find its feet, but even if it wasn't the first James Bond movie it would hold up as an entertaining bit of secret agent shenanigans regardless. 7.5/10 || _**Say YES to “Dr. No”**_

After an MI6 chief & his secretary are murdered in Jamaica, agent 007 (Sean Connery) is sent to investigate. He teams-up with a boatman (John Kitzmiller) with focus on a mysterious nearby island owned by a shady German-Chinese mogul (Joseph Wiseman). Jack Lord is on hand as a CIA agent and Ursula Andress as a shell diver

Based on Ian Fleming’s 1958 novel, “Dr. No” (1962) was the beginning of the never-ending James Bond franchise and features the common staples: The catchy James Bond theme, the opening gun barrel sequence, the suave protagonist, gorgeous women, ritzy casino gambling, exotic locales, spy devices, action thrills, shaken-not-stirred drinks and a megalomaniac villain. 

While this one’s not as ridiculous with the gadgets or action as later installments, somehow Bond’s relatively mundane but increasingly dangerous investigation on Jamaica is compelling as it progresses to the lair of the titular antagonist. It’s no wonder that it was a hit and sparked the espionage hysteria of the ’60s.

Andress stands out on the feminine front, but there’s also Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, both just as beautiful in their own way.  

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Jamaica and Pinewood Studios & London, England.

I will say the dubbing nature of <em>'A Fistful of Dollars'</em> is a little distracting early on, but by the time the opening portion concluded I was incredibly interested in what was happening onscreen. The pacing is excellent, thanks to some very fine cinematography, great action sequences and a top notch score.

Clint Westwood debuts as a leading movie star and is terrific throughout, portraying the wonderfully named J̶o̶e̶ ""the Man with No Name"". It's little surprise these are the films that truly made him. Away from Eastwood, I really enjoyed the trio that played the Rojo brothers - Gian Maria Volonté (aka Johnny Wels), Sieghardt Rupp and Antonio Prieto. They're just as important as the main man and play the roles superbly.

David Fincher’s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.

Despite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.

Without spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.

Now, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.

The second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.

In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.

Don’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.

Fight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.

Once again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.

Last but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.

In the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.

An absolute delight. From director David Lynch, The Straight Story finds the famous purveyor of the oblique on wonderfully mellow form. Story finds a superb Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight, an old boy long in the tooth who sets off across America on his lawn mower to visit his estranged brother. You see, he doesn't have a driving licence, so lawn mower is the viable form of transport.

Lynch and writers John Roach & Mary Sweeney have offered up a wry and astute observation of Americana. The journey Alvin takes involves him meeting a number of eccentrics and confused souls, which pitches Alvin as our conduit to a rich view of the life we have - or will - live. Culminating in a finale that rewards anyone with an intelligent soul. The message is clear.

A beautiful film for the beautiful of heart. 9/10 || Beautifully made film.

It's a difficult one to describe. <em>'The Straight Story'</em> features a very touching, true life, story about Alvin Straight. It's a very simple premise but one that the film brings to life wonderfully. There's a crap tonne of heart, alongside some brilliant cinematography and a top notch score.

Richard Farnsworth plays the role of Alvin expertly, it's an outstanding performance from him. Credit also to Sissy Spacek, who makes an impact as Rose despite not really being in the film for all that long. Harry Dean Stanton (Lyle) makes an appearance, too.

It's a slow burn but one that's totally worth the 112 minute run time. What a great way to end the millennium for Disney's live-action theatrical releases."

The Bad Seed is directed by Mervyn LeRoy and adapted to screenplay by Maxwell Anderson from the novel of the same name written by William March. Anderson had also adapted for the stage play as well. It stars Nancy Kelly, William Hopper, Patty McCormack, Henry Jones, Eileen Heckart and Evelyn Varden. Music is by Alex North and cinematography by Harold Rossen.

Is there such a thing as Bad Seed? Where I grew up there was a violent family of four brothers, each one would think nothing of doing a Begbie on you. It was the first time I heard the saying Bad Seed, with the conversation basically saying that their father was a psychopath and the four lads just inherited the violent tendencies by way of Pops. It's this theory that drives LeRoy's movie, only here it's a young ""butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth"" girl who has murderous leanings courtesy of her Nana's iffy genetics.

The theatre origins are very much evident, there is no hiding this fact, with the acting (some of the actors are held over from the play here) very much as if playing to an open auditorium, while at over two hours in length there's an over stretching of the talk heavy material. However, this is a very engrossing piece of horror cinema, pulsing unpleasantness and mood oppressive by way of black and white photography and a musical score that underlines the blending of sweet innocence and sinister evil.

McCormack as the Devil Child is outstanding, likewise Jones as the simpleton handyman who recognises evil when he sees it. Kelly, Heckart, McCormack and Rossen were all Academy Award nominated for their respective work in the film. As for the much discussed finale? Personally I have no problem with what transpires as regards mother and child. Oh for sure the ending to both the novel and play is far darker and dramatic, but there's a campy bizarreness in this Production Code influenced denouement that befits the whole production. Though the end credits curtain calls by the cast members is pushing it too far... 7.5/10"

It’s the early 1900s and there’s a rubber boom. To fund his dream he decides to exploit a considerable area of rubber trees growing beyond the impassable Ucayali Falls. To get to this remote area he incredibly has his steamboat lifted over a hill from another branch of the Amazon with the assistance of notorious headhunters. Claudia Cardinale plays his girlfriend, a successful brothel owner. 

Werner Herzog’s “Fitzcarraldo” (1982) is superior to his “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” (1972), which was shot in the same general area, the Amazon basin east of the Andes Mountains. It’s longer by just over an hour, but it has a more compelling story.  “Aguirre” influenced Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” (1979) but “Apocalypse Now” likely influenced “Fitzcarraldo.” The difference is that “Apocalypse Now” took advantage of its infamous setting, the Vietnam War, whereas few people know of the rubber boom of the early 20th century in the Iquitos area. 

There’s also less thrills in “Fitzcarraldo.” It’s more impenetrable and all-around curious, a cinematic oddity. Yet it has its highlights, including the core cast, e.g. the burly captain, the impressively hulking indigenous engineer and the drunkard cook. What’s it all about? The beauty of art, great dreams, indomitable will, mysterious cultures, devastating failure and… winning anyway.   
         
The film runs 2 hours, 37 minutes, and was shot in the Iquitos area, Peru, and Amazonas, Brazil, including a couple Tribal Regions. 

GRADE: B+/A- || Klaus Kinski is great as the eponymous, slightly maniacal, opera lover who decides that his love of Verdi, Bellini and Puccini needs to be shared with his mid-jungle community. He realises that to do that, he must have cash - and that's only to be found if he can manage to tap into the rubber trees deep into the Amazon. To that end, he and local hostess ""Molly"" (the sparingly featured Claudia Cardinale) manage to scrape together enough cash to buy a dilapidated old steamer from local grandee ""Don Aquilino"" (José Lewgoy) and he sets off into uncharted waters with a skeleton collection of untrustworthies into the realm of rapids, insects and hostiles. There's a snag to his cunning plan, though. The area he wishes to exploit is all but inaccessible and he is going to have to figure out some considerable engineering legerdemain if he is to achieve his goal. Fortunately, along the way, they encounter some locals who have a legend that a yellow-haired man would come from their gods and - well anyway, he fits that bill and they agree to help him get the boat uphill - literally - from one river to another. Can they keep their superstitious new allies and their fairly fickle crew on side long enough to succeed and then make it back to what passes for civilisation? Now it does have to be said that some of the continuity here puts John Wayne's watch to shame, but given it was filmed in Peru and on the Amazon itself, this is an astonishingly accomplished piece of film making that really does immerse us in not just the struggle itself but in the character of a man who treads the paths between lucidly, ingenuity and insanity adeptly. It is a little too long, there are too many scenes that add little to the pace of the film, but Kinski and Herzog thrive in this hot and humid climate to deliver an entertaining and exciting travelogue the likes of which you'll never see anywhere else!"

Frank Pierce is a member of the Nork York paramedics, serving the Hell's Kitchen district he is witness to some terrible incidents. As he starts to crack under the pressure of the job, and getting no help from a succession of zany partners, Frank may just find solace with an ex-junkie girl who's father he brought in dying of a heart attack.

Martin Scorsese can never be accused of not being adventurous, after dabbling in Eastern spiritualism with 1997s Kundun, he returns to New York and tackles a wing of America's tortured heroes. Based on the novel by Joe Connelly, Bringing Out The Dead is at times a difficult watch in many ways, but it's haunting poignancy is told with brilliantly adroit ease from one of America's famed directors, whilst it has to be said that the humour that is in there is darkly genius in its execution. We are along for the ride with haunted Frank for three days (and nights) as he and his borderline bonkers partners deal with overdoses, heart attacks, drunks and a notably cynical virgin birth! As Frank starts to see ghosts of people he couldn't save in the past, Scorsese and his team treat us to an adrenalin fuelled nightmare, the editing (Thelma Schoonmaker) is swift and explosive like, Robert Richardson's cinematography framing certain aspects of this journey with impacting deftness, and then we have the soundtrack.

Scorsese is always a man who takes great care in sound tracking his movies, in fact few modern day directors can touch his knack for a perfect soundtrack. Fusing Motown with 70s Punk Rock would seem an odd combination, but all of it works as the paramedics start to feel the strain and (in some cases) as the mania takes hold. It's rare to hear a New York Dolls track in a movie, to hear a Johnny Thunders solo track is as rare as a dog that speaks Norwegian, and here the use of Thunders' You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory is pitch perfect, impacting so. Such is the use of early Clash standards as our protagonists feed off each others precarious mental conditions, it's a soundtrack to savour basically.

Nicholas Cage plays Frank Pierce, and it's a great performance full of restraint and honesty, it's the sort of performance that his detractors tend to forget about such is its emotive simplicity. Tom Sizemore (wonderfully manic), Ving Rhames, John Goodman and Patricia Arquette fill out the cast and all do fine work, but I'm sure they would be the first to acknowledge the excellence of Paul Schrader's screenplay. This piece is far from being a masterpiece, but with it's intensity sitting side by side with a paramedics need for coping, it's clear that Scorsese and his talented team have made one of the most astute and undervalued pieces of the 90s. 9/10 || Been a long time since I last watched this and according to IMDb I gave it a 3/10. With the new Paramount release on 4K, I decided to give it another watch and while I can appreciate some of the style and even performances, this one just didn't do much for me and is one of Scorsese's lesser movies. Probably won't ever revisit this one. **2.25/5**"

After a fight with one of Grantby's goons, he returns to his captain with the bad news that he has been unsuccessful. The captain is for obvious reasons, not pleased.

In an abandoned warehouse, Palmer finds a small piece of tape with the name IPCRESS on, but at this point in the movie, has no idea what it means, if anything. Later on, though, he learns that it is an abbreviation of ""Induction of Psychoneuroses by Conditioned Reflex Under Stress"". When a scientist suddenly appears, with a strange memory loss, all the dots are about to get connected.

The Ipcress File is an old movie, but not so old that you are bored by the plot, dialogue or even images. It starts out with a mysterious disappearance from a train and a murder. Who did this and for what reasons? Then we meet a young Michael Caine, this time playing an agent called Harry Palmer, who is taken from his job on a stakeout, to investigating the murder and disappearance. He is no James Bond, and thank you very much for that. In Harry Palmer we meet a real person with real routines, real emotions and who can speak like a real person without a single one-liner. For these very reasons, this is a very satisfying movie.

I quite liked this movie, and while the colors are a bit faded and the dialogue a bit stiff, it actually felt contemporary, and the plot itself is as relevant today as it was back in 1965. The drama is not big car chases or rivers of blood, it is the drama between people, people that feel real and with real relationships. Also, the Harry Palmer character is not without humor, especially in the scenes with the young Jean (Sue Lloyd) who has been asked by her superior to learn more about Palmer.

_Last words... As far as agent movies go, this is one of the better that I have seen in a while. If you are thinking of seeing Skyfall… don't… go rent this movie instead. You'll be the better person for it._ || Slow but still engaging British spy thriller that is almost completely carried by Michael Caine more so than the story. Still, well directed by Sidney J. Furie and now interested in checking out the other Harry Palmer films with Caine. **3.5/5** || ""Harry Palmer"" (Michael Caine) has a reputation with his boss ""Ross"" (Guy Doleman) of being a bit of a pain in the neck. It comes as as source of great delight, then, when he gets to redeploy him into the department of ""Dalby"" (Nigel Green). His task? Well it seems that there's quite a sophisticated operation going on to kidnap and brainwash some of the top scientists of the day. ""Palmer"" is a bit sceptical about the whole thing - not least because he thinks he's been chosen in the hope that he won't come out alive... Anyway, as his investigation progresses he starts to smell quite a large rat in his organisation and realises that neither his old nor his new boss entirely trust one another! Can he stay alive long enough to solve the puzzle? This is quite a compelling adaptation of Len Deighton's novel with Caine on top form as the almost recalcitrant man determined to discover who's the cat and who's the mouse. Nigel Green also delivers well here and once the template has been set out, this proves to be an engaging political thriller offering more than a decent indication at just how human torture can work - overtly and subliminally. It's maybe just a little too slow out of the blocks, but once it's going it's a good watch and no matter how many times I watch it - I never quite remember what happens at the end!"

Not the least of which is Paul Verhoeven's incredible feat of practical effects engineering: _RoboCop_. This is one of those older movies where I can totally confirm for you, my love for it is in no way rooted in nostalgia. I didn't watch _RoboCop_ for the first time until 2013, when I was starting up my third decade of life. It's a phenomenal example of the period, but its also a great movie on its own.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || They'll fix you. They fix everything.

On his first day out on the streets of Detroit, Officer Murphy is brutally killed by known thug leader, Clarence Boddicker. Scientists at OCP are able to use what remains of Murphy's body and build a new heavily armed cyborg police officer, one that could rid the streets of crime forever.

Paul Verhoeven has been called many things in his career, bonkers, challenging and visionary, here with his first perceived block buster American feature, he showcases all of those things. Robocop on the page (and with its title) looked like your average run of the mill sci-fi shoot them up, with its basic premise not exactly oozing originality either. But Verhoeven had screenwriter's Edward Neumeier & Michael Miner in his corner, and they came up with a superior script to fully realise his vision. That Robocop is a satirical critique of totalitarianism and corporate corruption is now a given. Yet it wasn't at first evident to the summer block buster crowd, but Robocop has stood up well to critical re-examinations and the depth digging that so many have afforded it.

So with the script he wanted in place, Verhoeven utilised his memories from childhood, where his Netherlands home was taken over by a stomping German army, and added in the destruction factor, with no amount of technical expertise as well. Verhoeven paints an unhinged portrait of this Detroit (actual location shoot was parts of Texas), with skew whiff angles and bizarre twists lining the picture, the special effects even today looking tremendous. Robocop is extremely violent, especially in the directors cut that's now widely available, but even during the most wincing scenes, it stays brisk and sparky, and on his side is that his characters are as inhuman as the title protagonist is!. Thus the fusion of berserker sci-fi and human realism sits easy with the viewer, with the result serving notice to what a fine director Verhoeven can be.

Peter Weller dons the Robo suit (enduring agony for weeks on end apparently) and does what is required, and Nancy Allen kicks buttocks as Murphy's partner, Anne Lewis. But it's with the unsavoury characters that Robocop gains its acting kudos. Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer and a wickedly vile Kurtwood Smith dominate proceedings, helped immeasurably by the nature of the script. Verhoeven is thought to be a hard character on set, demanding much from all involved, even driving the normally amiable Weller to thoughts of violence against his director. But few, if any of those involved in Robocop can now say the final result wasn't worth it, because between them they made a genre classic. 9/10 || Seen this several times over the years and still holds up well, story and satire wise, though certainly some of the effects were dated (in particular the death of one character falling out a window). Other than that, an entertaining and bloody 1980s action-thriller, where the sequels and a remake, and certainly the third entry, could not touch. Would like to think the proposed RoboCop Returns will succeed where other failed, but don't hold out much hope. **4.25/5**"

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || I wasn't the biggest fan of the first of these, but this a far cry from even that! ""Robocop"" (Peter Weller) is doing his best, but Detroit has become even more lawless with half the population addicted to a potent drug, and it now also faces a bankruptcy that will allow the all consuming OCP to take over the city from the enthusiastic, but out of his depth ""Mayor Kuzak"" (Willard Pugh). Just to make certain of success, the big boss, Dan O'Herlihy, develops a ""Robocop 2"" - this time using the dastardly criminal brain of arch criminal ""Cain"" - the man behind the drug - as the human template. Can the prototype take on and defeat his much more sophisticated rival and save the city? Perhaps Irvin Kershner wanted to take a pop at corporate greed, or megalomania, or bad government or maybe even the inane human nature of the empowered mob, but whatever his plan was, we end up with a sort of faintly comedic hybrid of ""Terminator"" (1984) by way of ""Bugsy Malone"" (1976) with some metallic action routines that could easily have been formulated better in clay by Ray Harryhausen. The story is all over the place, indeed Weller hardly features at all for much of it and by the time it does start to liven up I really wasn't sure if this was a spoof! The highly-pitched ""Robocop"" signature tune said it all - this is just, well, not very good! || The first thing anyone can say about this movie, and should say, is that it isn't RoboCop. But that should be said for all reviews for all movies always. Yet, this is still one of the best sequels ever put together to any movie anywhere at any time. Weller is outstanding again. How can stuffing a man into a foam latex suit and have him clip clop around in front of a camera work so well? Its mind blowing."

Licence to Kill is directed by John Glen and written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. It's an original story that uses characters and instances created by Ian Fleming. It stars Timothy Dalton, Carey Lowell, Robert Davi, Talisa Soto, Anthony Zerbe, Desmond Llewelyn, David Hedison, Benicio Del Toro, Frank McRae, Everett McGill and Wayne Newton. Music is scored by Michael Kamen and cinematography by Alec Mills.

Bond 16 and 007 goes rogue when drug baron Franz Sanchez leaves Felix Leiter mutilated and his wife dead. With licence revoked by MI6, Bond has to go it alone to enact revenge for the Leiters.

The controversial Bond for many reasons, Licence to Kill even today has been known to induce fearsome arguments in Bond fan circles. Not since On Her Majesty's Secret Service has a Bond film so polarised opinions. In one corner are the folks who determine it's not a Bond movie, in the other is those who say it's a stripped to the bone human Bond. You either love it or you hate it it seems. True to say that it is more an action thriller than a outright Bond film, no humongous sets, no megalomaniac villain (Davi's drug baron a very realistic menace) and of course there is Bond being pursued by those that have courted him previously as their number one agent. Yet there's a whole raft of scenarios that could only exist in a Bond universe, there's gadgets, too, for those that enjoy that side of Bond. Where else would you see a tanker driving on its side? Or exploding toothpaste and alarm clock, camera's that turn into weapons and a broom that is actually a transmitter? Not Bondian enough? Really?

Licence to Kill is a superior action thriller movie, the script is tight, the cast ace and the picture is crammed full of exceptional action set pieces. From the pre-credits sequence that sees Bond and Leiter enact a mid-air arrest, to the rather brilliant tanker carnage at the finale, the film rarely pauses for breath, and right there in the centre is a brilliant Dalton giving a rogue Bond plenty of layers. He's brainy and classy, fallible and driven, intense and tough, always sexy and always dangerous. Dalton's ability to convey raw emotion as each challenge comes his way is a real treat to watch. But most of all he is right there restoring Bond to being a serious action figure. What Bond fans didn't realise at the time was that it would be 17 years before Bond would be this raw again, then it would be heralded as a brave new start for Bond!

Another of the film's strengths is bringing back Hedison as Leiter, last seen playing the role in Live and Let Die, Hedison has great chemistry with Dalton and it's a joy to see Leiter play an active part in the action on screen. However, the makers do make a misstep by having Leiter be all too jovial at the end of the film, weird since he is minus a limb and his wife was raped and murdered by Sanchez's henchmen. Another big plus is Lowell's Pam Bouvier, a tough and brave Bond girl, sexy as heck, her pilot skills come in handy and she's no mug when it comes to brawling. Lowell does fine work in the role and keeps it away from being a token interest cliché. Davi keeps Sanchez as believable, a very driven drug baron who is cultured and funny, but always pulsing a vicious streak, while McRae has presence, McGill neatly keeps the cards close to his chest, Del Toro a nice line in nastiness and Soto is pretty as a picture and plays Lupe Lamora with skilled vulnerability. And of course there's Llewelyn as Q, who here gets a right old meaty role as he goes out in the field to become Bond's only aid from MI6. Again, not Bondian enough?

Licence to Kill saw the end of Dalton's tenure as Bond, legal issues between Danjaq and MGM/UA meant that no Bond movie would be made for another six years. By then Dalton had moved on to other work and was 51. It also marked the end of production duties for Cubby Broccoli, the final direction by John Glen (5 Bond films in total), Richard Maibaum's last script and the last performances by Robert Brown as M and Caroline Bliss as Moneypenney. One of the many misconceptions about the Dalton era is that Licence to Kill was a flop, it made $156 million worldwide, considerably down on The Living Daylights but more than A View to a Kill. A huge profit of over $100 million, this in spite of it being pitched against Batman and sequels to beloved American films by a studio head who had no idea how to market a film. The best actor to take on the role of Bond, Dalton's impact on the series cannot be overstated, he (rightly so) is very proud of his work in the two films and still talks very fondly of a role he respected beyond compare. 9/10 || _**A different kind of Bond**_

Released in 1989, ""Licence to Kill"" always struck me as the most atypical Bond film. In this one James (Timothy Dalton) goes rogue after a good friend's bride is murdered and the friend is half-eaten by a shark. Stripped of his authority, Bond vengefully goes after the responsible drug lord, Sanchez (Robert Davi).

The opening act drives home that ""Licence to Kill"" is a more serious and brutal Bond flick. Although there's still a lot of ""yeah, right"" moments, the comedic edge of past Bond films is all but gone. And the violence is so savage and merciless compared to past films that it almost comes off shocking.

In addition, the spectacular globe-trotting locations are absent in favor of a more one-dimensional setting -- the Florida Keys and Mexico (where the film was shot). Although they do fine with these limited locales, the change is noticeable.

The women are below par as well. Carey Lowell works best as the ""Bond girl,"" but she pales in comparison to, say, Lois Chiles, Luciana Paluzzi and Claudine Auger. Talisa Soto is also on hand as Sanchez' girl and, briefly, Priscilla Barnes.

The opening stunt sequence is alright, but it's unmemorable compared to past Bond films, like ""The Living Daylights,"" ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker.""

Furthermore, there's an under-developed subplot about a cult guru and the film seems overlong at 133 minutes.

But the movie scores points with effective villains (it wouldn't be right to say ""good villains"", would it?), particularly Davi and a young Benicio Del Toro, both cruel and sadistic.

FINAL SAY: The fun might be over, but at least they tried something different to stir things up. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work. ""Licence to Kill"" performed weakly at the box office and ranks with the lesser Bond flicks. Still, it's interesting as an atypical part of the series -- darker and grittier, albeit still comic booky. Plus Dalton is striking as the vengeful protagonist and, if you can hang around till the final act, it's totally kick-axx.

GRADE: B- || I was just not a fan of Timothy Dalton's ""007"" and so can't say I was looking forward with much enthusiasm to this. Sadly, it didn't surprise - it's a really far fetched, frankly rather unpleasant, outing for Ian Fleming's deadly agent that sees him on the trail of an evil drug lord who fed ""Felix"" (David Hedison) to a shark whilst doing away that man's new wife. What now ensues is just a series of unremarkable set-piece escapades that have precious little jeopardy to them. Anthony Zerbe just doesn't cut it as the supposedly menacing ""Milton Krest"" (surely a milk-shake?) nor does Robert Davi as baddie-in-chief ""Sanchez"". Not that it's unusual for a ""Bond"" film - but this one really does play a bit too much to stereotype without any of the fun; the tongue-in-cheekiness or any charisma at all from the star very much on the wain here. As adventure films go, it is entertaining enough - there are gadgets; but the banal dialogue grates after a while and this one somehow appears much less ""British"" than many of it's forebears - certainly it is grittier and more violent. Adequate, but I would not say anything for the far classier and engaging Connery or Moore to worry about."

Agent 007 (Roger Moore) seeks to apprehend a lost British encryption device in order to prevent the Soviets from acquiring it as events switch from the Ionian Sea to a villa in Spain to wintery actions in Northern Italy to a Greek Island to Albania to an abandoned mountaintop monastery (Meteora, Greece).

Whilst “For Your Eyes Only” (1981) tones down the excesses of the previous film “Moonraker” (1979), it still contains the requisite Bond staples & absurdities and is another strong installment in Moore’s 7-film stint (1973-1985). There are high society pool parties, mountainside car chases, ski thrills, ice skating, underwater intrigue and an exciting cliff-climbing close.

Of course, there are the usual beautiful women, this time headed by grief-stricken brunette Melina (Carole Bouquet) with bubbly teen figure skater Bibi (Lynn-Holly Johnson) in second. Although some find winsome Lynn-Holly annoying as curvy Bibi, she’s a highlight of the film and one of the best ‘Bond girls’ in the franchise IMHO. Plus her naïve, spirited disposition works as a necessary counterpoint to Melina’s comatose solemnity. James’ line to Bibi is priceless: “Well, you get your clothes on and I'll buy you an ice cream.” Johnson, incidentally was 21-22 during shooting while her character was around 16-17.

The film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.

GRADE: A- || This and the Spy Who Loved me were Roger Moore's top 2 of his own Bond films... and I can see that.

It's not as over-the-top as Moonraker (which is one of the worst Bond movies ever made), it's not as silly as some of his other outings, although, if you are a Moore fan that hasn't seen this yet, fear not, it still has the Silly Bond moments that are his trope.

It's actually just... solid. For Your Eyes Only is the Roger Moore film that could have been a solid, stand alone movie, removed from the 007 franchise, that still stood up on it's own.

It's a bit darker than the others, it's a bit more realistic, it's a bit more story driven... and yet it maintains the Moore Era silliness that people come to expect out of his films, but with an actual story feel to it.

The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's magnum opus in the 007 franchise, but For Your Eyes Only comes pretty close to dethroning it.

Even as an unapologetic Connery Bond fan, this is one of the best in the franchise. || This is an epic Bond film.
007 is sent to beat Russia to find an important device that sank in the ocean. It's important to the security of the British people.
There is non stop action, beautiful women, beautiful scenery, exotic locales, wit, gadgets, everything that makes Bond movies special and entertaining.
Over the top? Well, all Bond movies are over the top, which is why the ones that pretend not to be over the top look sillier than the ones that don't make the pretense.
In Carole Boquet as Melina, we have the most beautiful of all the Bond females, with perhaps the exception of Bach in The Spy Who Loved Me.
Melina also helps to make this as great a movie as it is. I rate it as the second best 007 film ever made, just behind ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". 
And that's great company."

Agent 007 (Roger Moore) travels from Harlem to the Caribbean to Louisiana to stop a black heroin mogul (Yaphet Kotto) fortified with a multifarious organization and a lovely tarot card reader (Jane Seymour).

This was Moore’s dynamic debut as Bond. He did 7 films for the franchise in 13 years from 1973-1985. The tone of “Live and Let Die” is similar to Sean Connery’s final canon Bond flick, “Diamonds Are Forever” (1971). Moore’s stint is my favorite run in the series with all seven films being kinetic, amusing, scenic and just all-around entertaining. There’s not one stinker in the bunch and they were all profitable at the box office. 

Aside from the picturesque globetrotting, “Live and Let Die” features several colorful characters beyond those already noted: The metal-armed Tee Hee (Julius Harris), the chortling voodoo minion Baron Samedi (Geoffrey Holder) and redneck Sheriff JW Pepper (Clifton James). On the female front, Seymour is young & cute while Gloria Hendry is impressively fit as Rosie. The head-turning Madeline Smith has a small role. In addition, there are several memorable thrilling parts, like the amusing airport sequence, Bond using crocogators as stepping stones, the great bayou boat chase and the closing train cab brouhaha.

As far as the movie being “racist,” as SJW’s whine, the character Agent Quarrel Jr. (Roy Stewart) blows that whole eye-rolling idiot-theory.

The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute and was shot in Manhattan, Jamaica and Louisiana (New Orleans & the bayous) with additional work done in England.

GRADE: B+ || By my clock, this era started with Diamonds are Forever... the era of the Silly Bond.

But Diamonds are Forever was a Connery Bond and it kind of sucked because of it.

So... Live and Let Die is the first of the GOOD silly Bond movies.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm on team Connery. Team Connery all the way... but Live and Let Die is still a GREAT 007 film despite the total change in mood and persona.

It moved away from the heartless assassin to pick up a more comedic and Fx driven fair that worked better for Moore.

And because it is a new 007, the fish out of water setting works to drive it home. It's not the first time 007 set foot in the United States, but it is Harlem in 1973 and it is The Big Easy, and these are places that a white British man with an Oxford education would be a HORRIBLE person to act as a spy in. He's going to stick out like a sore thumb, and he does...

... and that is probably why they choose it as a setting to usher in Moore's era Bond. Because Moore was going to be different. He was the fish out of water in the franchise, and the setting helps drive it home.

But, who cares, it was silly Bond, but it was FUN Bond. It was just fun in a different way than Connery was. But it was still fun, and fun is still entertaining. || This 007 film aged very well.
007 follows in the footsteps of three prior agents who were assassinated.
There's a lot of ""jive"" in this one, since this is the one where the villain is black, and he uses mostly black helpers, so the white James Bond really sticks out.
And thus we get a lot more comedy here.
There's a bit of a condescending attitude towards Harlem here, and too much respect for the few who are the criminals of Harlem, but this is a ""comedy"" 007 adventure.
The beautiful Solitaire is the love interest, and there's a lot of belief in the supernatural here. That's part of the ""condescending"" part.
This movie was very bad in 1973, but it aged well, because in 1973 the ""red neck sheriff"" was such a trite cliche that one had to groan in 1973.
But today, after all the movies that have tamed down the image of the red neck lawman, it's a fresh bit of comedy, and that's why this movie has aged well. It comes close to breaking into the top ten 007 films of all time due to its lack of negativity that has been the Hollywood formula since about 1965."

Thunderball is directed by Terence Young and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins from a story by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Adolfo Celi, Claudine Auger, Rick Van Nutter and Martine Beswick. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.

The fourth outing for James Bond (Connery) sees 007 assigned to the Bahamas to try and thwart SPECTRE's number 2 operative, Emilio Largo (Celi). Largo has hijacked two atomic bombs from NATO and sets about extorting huge ransoms of money. If his terms are not met he will blow up major cities.

It was meant to be the first James Bond film, but Thunderball became part of a long drawn out legal battle between Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and Ian Fleming. Eventually an out of court settlement was reached and Thunderball rolled into theatres in 1965. After the colossal success of Goldfinger, and Bond as a pop culture phenomenon, producers Albert Broccoli & Harry Saltzman knew that they had to try and up the ante to keep Bond on top. They were also acutely aware that many imitators were springing up on film and TV. These facts led Bond to go epic, with the producers going for a more is more approach, however, Thunderball is a considerable step down from Goldfinger.

As with many other Bond movies, Thunderball polarises opinions amongst the fans. Some are happy to laud the pure entertainment value on offer, the reliance on hardware and gadgets viewed as an aid to the Bond persona and not a hindrance to his humanistic worth. Technically the film is often exceptional, be it on or under the water, director Young really crafts some Bondian quality. The exotic Bahamas locale is beautifully realised by Ted Moore, Barry's blunderbuss score is one of his best for a Bond movie and Connery has charisma in abundance. The girls, too, are delightful, particularly Auger who positively sizzles with sexuality. Bond's by play with M, Q and Felix Leiter (Nutter very enjoyable and more charismatic than Cec Linder in Goldfinger) is well scripted and performed. While for those who adore the gadgets and daring stunts? Thunderball excels with its assortment of trick vehicles, under water weaponry, aids and radioactive pills! Without doubt the near $6 million budget is all up there on the screen.

Yet for other fans, and this is the category I fall into, it's a film of too many flaws to be considered one of the greats. Whilst it's undeniable that when it hits the high points it excites royally (the extended underwater battle is eye popping brilliance), but there's too many languid passages in the overlong running time. Young himself lamented that he couldn't get the pace right on account of the plot structure. The other major problem for me is Celi as Largo. Visually he's striking, with his white hair and eye patch, he looks well villainous, but physically he's wrong and someone you can't buy into as a man able to not only take on Bond, but to overcome him as well! While the finale lacks a grandness to reward those having sat for over 2 hours with the film. But what do I know? Film made a stunning $141 million at the box office! And the fanaticism that began with Goldfinger had now reached epic proportions.

The more is more approach worked for the makers, and it ensured that for the time being Bond was going to stay in this epic, gadget effects strewn groove. Connery wasn't happy though, he had voiced his concerns about Bond becoming characterless, while he hated the mania surrounding the films and his role within them. He would return for the next instalment, You Only Live Twice, but the question was, would it be his last performance as Bond? 7/10 || It can be difficult and not very useful to compare the early James Bond movies to the later ones. The female characters become more than merely ornamental and more interesting, the plots become more intricate, the villains less stereotypical, and the special effects better and better.

Having said all that, I must confess I give Thunderball a pass on any such criticism or comparison, for a rather odd and personal reason, and not just because I like Sean Connery! As a teenager I sort of inherited the soundtrack album for Thunderball, either from my dad or an older brother. That was well before I ever saw the movie. Except for the Tom Jones title song, the album is all instrumental, and I found myself playing the album while doing school work, or reading, or writing short stories and later on, novels. I am surprised I didn't wear the grooves out. Later my taste moved towards instrumental new age and finally on to ambient music. 

Where was I? Oh yeah, so when I finally watched Thunderball, I recognized the background music whenever it came into play. So I liked this film in a way I never quite experienced with other James Bond films. I admit I don’t know that this helps prospective viewers, so I will add that if the newer Bond films seem to glossy and too much like each other for your taste, Thunderball is a slightly different animal, so you might enjoy it. And did I mention it includes a Sean Connery? || _**James Bond underwater adventure with the best female cast**_

After a couple atomic bombs are stolen from the RAF, agent 007 (Sean Connery) travels to Nassau, Bahamas, to clash with SPECTRE agent Emil Largo (Adolfo Celi) and his femme fatale accomplice (Luciana Paluzzi). Claudine Auger is on hand as Largo’s naïve woman.  

""Thunderball"" (1965) is one of my favorites of Connery’s run in the franchise due to the interesting intrigue, the Tom Jones’-sung title song, and the best cast of women in the series. Other than Luciana Paluzzi (Fiona) and Claudine Auger (Domino), Molly Peters plays a voluptuous masseuse at a health clinic while statuesque Martine Beswick is on hand as an MI6 agent in the Bahamas (Beswick previously appeared in “From Russia with Love” as one of the Gypsy cat-fighters). 

I was surprised that the bulk of the flick takes place in the Bahamas as “Dr. No” (1962) took place mostly in Jamaica, which is 400 miles south in the Caribbean.

For those interested, “Thunderball” was remade as the non-canon “Never Say Never Again” (1983), which was Connery’s final excursion as 007. I prefer this one, which was the most successful Bond flick of the 60s (at the box office), but “Never Say Never Again” is worth checking out even though it’s not as ambitious as Roger Moore’s dynamic “Octopussy,” released the same year.  

The film runs 2 hour, 10 minutes and was shot in Château d'Anet, Anet (opening) & Paris, France; England; and the Bahamas.

----

While there are many movies about self discovery, self growth and identity, not many (if really any) have taken the approach of 'Being John Malkovich'. The general premise of the movie is: struggling puppeteer Craig discovers a portal allowing him to enter the mind of the actor John Malkovich. Through multiple attempts of possessing John Malkovich, he is able to take control of the actor and live his life through him. His wife, Lotte, and his new love interest Maxine are also entangled in the journey. The finale of the movie shifts the dynamics in the relationship as Lotte and Maxine find love and Craig is eventually forever trapped in a kind of 'sunken place'.

While the movies plot is somewhat straightforward and easy to follow, the movie is highly entertaining due to the great writing and screenplay along with the great pacing and performances from the small but highly talented cast (Cusack, Diaz, Keener and Malkovich). There are also enough elements of absurdity and surrealism to create this somewhat fantastical world we are immersed in. However, the real highlight of 'Being John Malkovich' is the number of ethical and philosophical questions about self identity and consciousness it evokes. 

The central question asked in this movie, is what is identity and how do we define it? The central character Craig, battles throughout the film with his desire for both power and clout. As a highly insecure struggling artist, he instantly falls for Maxine, but it's clear his desire is more about what Maxine represent's (a highly confident and seductive women) rather than who she is as an individual. She is a means to an end to help make up for all that is lacking in Craig's life. He believes that having possession of someone like Maxine would help him in his endeavour as an artist and ultimately a man. Lotte on the other hand,  while also struggling with self-acceptance, is looking for someone to fill the void which has been left by Craig through his disinterest in her romantically as her husband. Lotte appears to be somewhat of a victim throughout the film, as her struggle to find love, and embrace her own power comes through some rather difficult and unfortunate circumstances (e.g. being rejected by Maxine on multiple occasions and later being trapped in a cage with her pet Chimpanzee). Maxine, maybe the most interesting of the 3, comes across as opportunistic and rather shallow, but highly confident in contrast to Craig and Lotte. Her journey to eventual happiness comes in the way of realising the beauty within through falling in love with Lotte, but at first, only when she is in Malkovich's vessel. In contrast, her relationship with Craig when he has captured Malkovich is shallow and unsatisfying. The subtle similarities, and stark differences between these three characters leads to some interesting questions which are posed about self discovery and the journey each character takes to uncover about themselves. John Malkovich, although mostly just a device throughout the film, has perhaps the most bizarre scene in the entire movie, when he himself enters his own portal and see's a world full of different versions of himself. This scene has a number of different interpretations about how we often view ourselves, the different characters we play in our own lives, and how our subconscious can be visually represented. 

Being John Malkovich is a special movie which takes a central theme of identity and makes the audience question what that really means. It does so in a highly engaging manner, never sacrificing an engaging story for the overall deeper themes at hand. It's a movie which viewers can come back to multiple times and still be in awe. || <em>'Being John Malkovich'</em> sure is quite something! Despite not knowing the type of movie that it is, I'm always wanted to get this one watched purely because of the title. Now I've seen it, I'm pleased I've done so. It's strange on the surface, though by the end it's... almost normal?

Based on the opening and the genre it's listed under on Wikipedia, I was expecting more of an artsy sorta thing. Pleasantly, it isn't that. Of course it has deeper meaning and I'm not saying I got 100% of it, though in the end it's relatively simple. But impressive and original, no doubt.

I love that John Malkovich agreed to do this, I now read that he was apparently ""half intrigued and half horrified"" when he first read the script - I can see why! John Cusack, Cameron Diaz (took me a while to recognise her) and Catherine Keener are all great behind (inside?) JM.

My only criticism is that it didn't keep the humour that it shows when Craig first meets Lester, the <em>'Airplane!'</em>-esque nature of it fitted so well. Sure, there is plenty of humour in there, but the deadpan delivery of Lester (and Floris, of course) is the most amusing."

There is still a bond, if one is hurt another, it means the one suffer itself as well. || Original title: Mononoke Hime

The film is set in the 14th Century during Japan’s Muromachi Period.

Young Prince Ashitaka, the last royal of his line, slays a wild boar that is about to attack his village. The boar, demonised because it was consumed by rage and hatred, infects the young Prince, who will eventually become demonised too.

He leaves the village to find a cure in the form of Shishigami, a deer-like god. On his journey he realises that the latent rage and hatred within him, when it surfaces, gives him enormous power – proven when he slices off the arms of a Samurai warrior and decapitates another one.

On his journey, he sees a travelling group of people attacked by a wolf pack. He saves two of the men who, it turns out, are from Irontown, run by the Lady Ishobi. He brings the two men back to Irontown, which is peopled by women who do the foundry-work and chores, and men who provide the security and protection, although even that is not cut and dried as the women are capable of defending themselves with guns being manufactured especially for them by the lepers to whom the Lady Ishobi provides food and dignity. There is much humour when the women verbally chastise their menfolk. I found those scenes hilarious.

When Ashitaka brings the men back to Irontown he is welcomed by the Lady Ishobi. He also discovers that the wolf pack was led by the wolf god Moro, and the strange girl he saw help the wolves was San, the adopted daughter of Moro. San has the ability to talk to the nature spirits, and she is therefore known as Princess Mononoke (“Spirits of things”).

Ashitaka is concerned that Ishobi is destroying the forest. It turns out that the Lady Ishobi and Moro are in battle because of the damage being done to the forest.

To add to this, Ishobi has also recruited Samurai to help her in her fight, but the Samurai have two motives: one is to take the head of the Forest Spirit back to the Emperor, who believes it will give him immortality. The second is to take Irontown from the Lady Ishobi.

That is an abstract of the plot.

Miyazaki used computer-generated graphics in this for the first time, but most of the film was generated by hand. This I think is to its benefit. The drawing is breathtaking in places, and the depiction of such supernatural events as the Forest Spirit changing into the Nightwalker and the scene of the demon-possessed boar when it emerges from the forest for the first time are spectacular.

I think it’s too scary and bloody for children, but a friend assures me that this sort of film is par for the course for children in Japan.

The film is over two hours long, and it does pack a lot into that two hours. I found this film very interesting and watchable. I wanted to know what happened, and the plot was certainly not predictable. I believed in the world it depicted. I think in any film you have to allow it to draw you into its world (up to a point, some films are ludicrous and expect too much, this isn’t one of them).

Part of the reason for the film’s ability to keep me interested is because the characters cannot be labelled “goodies” and “baddies.” Yes, Moro and his pack are attacking helpless workers, but they are destroying the forest and he needs to protect his way of life. Yes, the Lady Ishobi is destroying the forest, but she’s making a living for herself and is helping others: she has removed the women from servitude in brothels, given them security, work, and a home; some have found husbands or companions. She has provided shelter, home and work for the lepers, normally outcasts. Neither side seems particularly vindictive; Ishobi’s attempts to rid herself of the wolf pack are for self preservation, and her coalition with the Samurai to destroy the Forest Spirit is her attempt to remove the constant threat of attack. One can argue that if she took a more conciliatory view, maybe some sort of truce could be reached, but time and again members of the wolf pack merely say “they are humans, they must be killed” – to the point that even Ashitaki, who has helped the animals – is threatened with death if he does not leave the forest. In fact, one could argue that it is the animals who show a “racist” attitude here – demanding the death of the humans because they are humans. None of the humans in the film demand the death of the animals simply because they are animals. Their deaths, and the destruction of their habitat, are an unfortunate side-effect of the humans’ industrialisation, not a deliberate act.

I hope that what you see from my analysis above is that the film is not goodies v. baddies. It’s nature v. industrialisation, and the compromise to that is not an easy one, and the film reflects that.

You’ll be happy to know the film does have an upbeat ending, but thankfully it’s not entirely predictable, in my opinion.

I thoroughly recommend the film."

As the days pass, and the excellent make-up artists do their work, the visceral nature of the characterisations emerge unrelentingly, leaving us with a distinctly uncomfortable watch that exposes a fruitlessly venal culture based on the premise of dog eat dog. Perhaps, though, as these people endure physically and psychologically, they might begin to realise that the pot of gold at the end of this rainbow isn’t actually the cash, but a sense of self-respect. The last ten minutes settle things in quite traumatic fashion and suffice to say there is no chocolates and Champagne. The dialogue is sparingly potent with gentleness and optimism gradually replaced by a stoic realisation of the relentlessness of their predicament and I think Sarazin, Fonda and particularly York give the performances of their careers in the slow-burning exposé of human toxicity."

With Evil Dead, Halloween, Friday 13th, Italian horror ... the genre was dynamic. Then, reading Mad Movies, I see this very gore movie inspired by a short Lovecraft tale, coming soon.

I go there at 2pm, watch the movie and end up seeing it 7 times in 3 days.
The cast gives an insane (!!!) performance, especially Jeffrey Combs of course, but having Bruce Abbott try to keep his sanity and stay alive in the horrific events. Barbara Crampton will be mainly remembered by being licked by a severed head, but she does a nice ""normal"" character. The couple try to save what they can (sanity and life) and are quite a counterpoint to West and his madness of overcoming death, whatever consequences there may be.

Most scenes are in the Arkham faculty, some at Dan's apartment. This also enhances the madness of it all, with a regular setting where usually nothing wrong could happen.

The ""gore"" SFX still are vivid in my mind. So OK more modern SFX are done now, but those rubber body parts with liters of blood were really efficient, and I'll add ""physical"". Those computer generated very often lack the practical physicality of holding a severed hand or head they do now (must be a challenge for the actors to interact with nothing beside a green sceen.

Overall these elements create  a powerfully entertaining movie."

Its not really a tale of urban reality more that the everyday annoyances that we do nothing about and this guy turns them into a personal insult. Its starts normally enough, stuck in traffic, beep noises and drilling on a hot day, his AC is broken, the window is broken. Instead of just shrugging it off with that Monday feeling he just abandons his car and goes for a walk, to start with its a shop owner with overpriced drinks that gets his shop smashed up a bit, later only when threatened with violence himself does he defend himself against 2 gang members. This is where things start to suddenly go weird, the gang members drive round and stumble across him somehow, (I'm British but I think LA is a little too big for that) then spray bullets in a drive by 20ft away and miss him completely but hit everyone around him and then they promptly crash. He walks over to the car, collects a bag of guns from it then goes and shoots up a burger bar because they are not serving breakfast, which he then changes his mind to lunch anyway and it continues from there. I don't know if this was meant to show some sort of mental brakedown due to his previous life choices but his empathy just disappears. At the start you could relate to the character but the more you watch the more you begin to distance yourself from that notion until you realise you just watched a movie where a guy went round killing people for no reason other than anger at himself for destroying his family life. It leaves me wondering if that was the directors intention or a happy coincidence to push that prospective on the viewer. || ## Not about the guy
This movie isn't about the main character, William 'D-Fens' Foster. He does some crazy things and I guess that what some people remember, but if you really watch the movie you see that it puts society's erosion of the U.S. ""normal guy"" on display.

People who ""do everything right"": get a degree, marry, make babies, work for a corporation. They feel disillusioned, cheated out of the promise of the American dream.

Class divides, racism, toxic masculinity, coroporate greed, urban decay, breakdown of interpersonal connections and flat, sloppy hamburgers that look nothing like the picture on the menu. They are all present in Joel Schumacher's chronicle of the late 80's and early 90's. Even the inaction of police under the strain of declining budgets.

His ex-wife that dodged a bullet by getting out before D-Fens got violent, is almost ridiculed for being oversensitve, instead of rewarded for her insight and protective instincts.

There are so many things we can see through D-Fens' interactions, but also his wife and the excellent portrail of Prendergast by Robert Duval.

In essence, Falling Down is less about D-Fens as an individual and more about the society that shaped him and countless others like him, not coming to terms with the weight of systemic failures. It’s a film that leaves viewers with questions rather than answers. Even decades later people will recognise themselves in the characters, the neighbourhoods and the way they navigate life in the shadow of the American dream."

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Adventuresome and fun ""Jaws"" homage with far superior women 

RELEASED IN 1978 and directed by Joe Dante, “Piranha” chronicles events when genetically-enhanced piranha are accidently released into a river system in central Texas, which threaten kids & counselors at a Summer Camp and vacationers at a lake resort. A spirited skip tracer (Heather Menzies) and a backwoods drunkard (Bradford Dillman) team-up to save the swimmers. Kevin McCarthy and Barbara Steele play military scientists who experimented with the escaped piranha.

While ""Piranha"" is sort of a ""Jaws"" (1975) knockoff, it’s different enough to not be a rip-off:  The story takes place in a river system deep in the mainland and not the ocean; the ‘monster’ consists of teams of little vicious fish rather than a huge Great White Shark; the beach sequences involve quaint campground-like beaches rather than major ocean beaches; unlike “Jaws,” there’s a focus on alluring young women, although “Jaws 2” (1978) delivered the goods in this area as well; there’s more of a sense of adventure and even suspense; and the tone mixes-in amusing elements with the horrific mayhem.

As inferred, the picture is highlighted by several quality females with curvy Belinda Balaski (from ""The Howling"") and cutie Melody Thomas Scott (from The Young and the Restless) featured in prominent roles. Moreover, voluptuous Janie Squire has some worthy screen time in the prologue. There are superb women in the periphery as well. Interestingly, the 2010 quasi-remake, “Piranha 3D,” took the sleaze route with loads of nudity, but the women are ironically hotter here, not to mention the film’s all-around more entertaining.

THE MOVIE IS LEAN and filler-free at 93 minutes and was shot along a river near San Marcos in the heart of Texas, Northeast of San Antonio. WRITERS: John Sayles and Richard Robinson.

GRADE: A- || Decent watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend for fans of Jaws or any other version of this movie.

There is a 1995 remake of this movie that I would probably watch instead if I wanted to watch this gain.

Not-trigger warning: There is a surprising LACK of gore in this movie.

This has a decent story to it, but it shares aspects with Jaws, Friday the 13th, other movies of the era.  Particularly the ""hide the effect"" routine that Jaws made famous.  The practical effects aren't very good, which is why the best use of them was to hide the fish whenever possible.  In a way, it really works if the threat is massive, unstoppable, and nearly invisible.

The whole ""secret government project"" angle is a little irritating as this crossed my movie watching with my ""otherworldy research"": things like this are presented in movies as an absurd idea when they are reality.  Maybe not to this extent, but as the government used to claim Area 51 didn't exist, that should prove my point.

Akira Kurosawa is just a master movie maker. || Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film YOJIMBO is a Japanese period drama where wily strategy is worth just as much as prowess with a sword. In the late Edo era (some decades before its end in 1868) a community is plagued by two opposing gangs who have built up a criminal empire of prostitution and gambling. Even the local officials are on the take. Into this town steps a nameless samurai (Toshiro Mifune). Once they get a taste of his swordsmanship, both sides want to hire him, but he decides to play them off against each other and free the innocent citizens from this evil.

In past films Kurosawa had taken advantage of Mifune's ability to produce exaggerated facial expressions of laughter and fear. Here, however, the nameless samurai is completely unflappable, while it is the criminal bosses and corrupt officials who play the clowns. Ikio Sawamura is a town constable constantly toadying to the gangsters, for example, while Isuzu Yamada gives a memorably sassy performance as the madame of a brothel. In what would become a convention of the Japanese period drama, the numerous henchmen in the gangs were apparently chosen from the most grotesque men that Kurosawa could find (each furthermore has distinctively ratty attire), and one thug is played by an actor suffering from gigantism.

That darkly comedic drama between the characters coexists with brutal violence. Yet, while audiences may have been shocked in 1961 by the samurai dispatching his opponents with realistic slashing sound effects and a hacked off limb, there are only a handful of fights here, and they are all over in a flash. (Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of Mifune's acting is his speed in executing the sword moves.) While Kurosawa delights in gangsters getting their comeuppance, he doesn't revel in gore.

Much has been said about how this Japanese film would inspire Westerns made in America and Europe (Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS was a straight-up remake). However, the film is also interesting for how it draws so much on influences from the West. Kurosawa's inspiration was an American crime caper by Dashiell Hammett, the samurai’s walk down the main street is drawn from the Westerns of John Ford and others, the soundtrack mixes Japanese music with Western instruments such as harpsichord, and Tatsuya Nakadai's pretty-boy looks are clearly modeled on Hollywood.

All in all, I was very impressed by this film. Everything here – from the script and aspect to little things like the wind and dust and the little decorations on the set – seems the result of great effort and talent, all coming together to impress the viewer. And like Kurosawa's RASHOMON, it stays fresh even as its elements have been repeatedly reused by other film and television productions for half a century now. || I was surprised when I saw this, how late it was set - 19th Century - as I'd always imagined it to be of a more historical nature. That doesn't remotely detract from the story though - as again Kurosawa casts Yoshirô Mifune (""Sanjûrô"") in the leading role. Here he is a wandering samurai who arrives in a village torn by strife. His skills are sought by the two opposing headmen and he quite successfully manages to play them off against each other - and keep the peace - until one the their sons arrives, armed with a pistol, and completely alters the balance of power. Mifune is superb as the maverick, thoroughly honourable and at times quite amusing ronin - I was reminded a little of the characterisation by Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone films - with a ruthless, violent streak: but somehow only towards those meritorious of their fate. It takes it's time, this - there is a fair degree of character development and as such, I felt quite invested in both Mifune and in his friend the innkeeper (Eijirô Tôno) as their peril gradually increases. The remainder of the cast adds to the tension well as does the frequent use of the weather in helping create the gripping atmosphere making this a corker of a film, very much worth watching."

Robert Neville appears to be the sole survivor of a biologically waged war. That is except for the mutant night creatures that thirst for Neville's death. Known as the family, they represent the scientific downfall of mankind. Can Neville survive? Is it worth him surviving even after having found a vaccine to the plague?

The Richard Matheison novel, I Am Legend, is proving a really hard book to adapt successfully, even now after a CGI laden modern take starring Will Smith, we are waiting for a film to do this incredible premise justice. The Omega man isn't a bad film at all, the first half is quite simply very intriguing stuff, Charlton Heston is Neville and he has to battle with mental solitude whilst worrying about the albino creatures of the dark that want his blood. But once the story kicks on, the plot wears thin and drifts off into horror conventions purely as a means to up the entertainment value of the piece. 

It's also not helped by a quite ludicrous score from Ron Grainer, even allowing for the 70s nature of production, it's jaunty when it should be menacing and detracts from the darker moments of the story. Heston does fine, and easily carries the picture well enough to keep it from mundane average hell, but once the final credits role and the ending sinks in, you kind of feel you have been cheated out of a good movie, which is sad because it promised so very much early on. 6/10 (mainly for the first half). || You know for years I thought I had seen this. I insisted I had seen it, and then I caught it on Netflix, waited for Hoffman, and was sort of shocked. There was no Nazi dentist and I realized I was walking into something totally new.

This is sort of cheap. I think it's supposed to be a dystopian LA, but it doesn't look much different from the last time I went there. No joke. And I think this is supposed to be I am Legend, at least it stole the plot so much I am pretty positive that is what they were adapting.

But, it didn't age well and probably wasn't the highest budget to start with.

However it is more 70s dystopian fun, only set in seemingly pretty modern LA, and sunny Southern California seems like the worst place for vampires, but it hits all the tropes I want... so I'm throwing it a 10 for entertainment value.

The story is great, but the production is pretty bad. || **_'Taylor' in a bad movie_**

There was something about Charlton Heston that made him perfect for the role of Taylor in ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes,"" two of the greatest sci-fi/adventure flicks of all time. So it's no wonder that the producers of 1971's ""Omega Man"" chose Heston for what is essentially the same role in this film about the supposedly last man on earth living in L.A. after a war waged with biological weapons (loosely based on a book by Richard Matheson). Unfortunately the third time's definitely not the charm and the film holds little interest beyond an early 70s period piece or nostalgia.

I remember catching ""Omega Man"" sometime several years ago and expecting a great early 70s sci-fi flick with a great protagonist and all I remember was being extremely disappointed and (I think) not even finishing it. Well, I decided to give it another chance, fully braced for an underwhelming experience, and my original impressions were pretty accurate.

The film starts off well with Taylor, I mean Neville (Heston,) wandering around a deserted Los Angeles, muttering to himself, watching ""Woodstock"" for the 100th time, etc. but the horribly dated 'hip' score is the first bad sign and then night comes down and these cloaked albino vampire-zombies appear, which is what turned me off the first time I caught the film. Just listen to their dialogue. I wanted to run away in horror, and not in the good way.

But, from there, I hoped, that the film would settle into its own groove, as long as I overlooked the bad music and corny villains or just accepted them as a part of this period oddity. ""Omega Man"" does settle into a groove, it's just that it's not all that engrossing. And what's up with Heston taking off his shirt every 8 minutes? The flashbacks to how this apocalyptic scenario originated were interesting, as well as Neville's run-ins with others, but the film never rises above the mediocre and heavily dated.

One might argue that ""dated"" is an unjust criticism given the film's age, but all good or great films are able to transcend their eras even while clearly being from their eras, like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""King Kong,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" ""Runaway Train"" and ""The Blue Max."" ""The Omega Man"" miserably fails to accomplish this.

Overall the film feels more like a mediocre made-for-TV flick than a theatrical release of its time. It almost has the look and feel of the original ""Star Trek"" series, but without the great writing and characters. The albino villains with their dark hoods and cloaks are reminiscent of the 'villains' in the episode ""The Return of the Archons."" The average Syfy flick is more interesting. But it has its points of interest: a black female protagonist (Rosalind Cash), a worthy sidekick of sorts (Paul Koslo) and the desolate scenes of L.A., but its main appeal is as a period piece.

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes.

Disney take on the Robin Hood legend in animation form with family friendly rewards aplenty. 

Directed and produced by Wolfgang Reitherman (Sleeping Beauty/The Jungle Book), the voice work comes from Brian Bedford (Robin Hood), Phil Harris (Little John), Monica Evans (Maid Marian), Peter Ustinov (Prince John), Terry-Thomas (Sir Hiss), Andy Devine (Friar Tuck), Roger Miller (Allan-A-Dale), Pat Buttram (Sheriff of Nottingham) and Carole Shelley (Lady Cluck).

All the characters are drawn as animals, with Robin suitably given a fox make-over, plot revolves around the dastardly machinations of Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. Who find themselves hindered considerably by Robin and his band of merry men. Meanwhile Robin and Marian are rekindling their romance on the sideline. It lacks the class of other Disney animation movies, with no songs of note to tap the feet to, but the action is strong (love the archery), Prince John and Sir Hiss are great comedy value, and ultimately it’s a delightful retelling of an often told wonderful legend. 8/10 || This probably stands out as the first time I really noticed Disney turn to cast an ensemble of more established ""stars"" as their voice talents - a wonderfully paired duo of Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas as Prince John and ""Sir Hiss"" as well as Phil Harris as ""Little John"" and ""King of the Road"" crooner Roger Miller narrating the whole tale as ""Alan-a-Dale"" really do animate this story splendidly. Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood - the gent of 12th century English folklore. When the King heads off to fight the Saracens in the crusades, his evil brother remains to extort all he can from the poor population whilst Robin Hood leads the rebellion against this tyrannical regime. The personifications of animals in this film is a masterstroke - and the choice of animals: a snake, fox, bear, lion, badger and even a tortoise all add hugely to the symbolism and fun of this thoroughly enjoyable rendering of the ultimate good v evil tale. I always seem to have a problem with the intrusive scores in Disney's animations - it never seems to let up long enough to let the voices take centre stage, and as such is quite distracting much of the times. That said, I am nit-picking - aside from a rather protracted musical interlude - the action animations are first class and this is a cracking film."

The dynamic amongst the three friends becomes a little complicated when they are captured and escape with the addition of ""Ika"" (Rae Dawn Chong) who arouses in them passions hitherto suppressed. It's the bleakness and simplicity that makes this film work.

Will they find fire? What will they do with it if they do? Well I found myself quite enthralled by their journey, the complete lack of a traditional script and a look at an existence that really was survival of the fittest, tempered by some quite human - even funny - moments. || **_A well-done fantastical portrayal of early humans_**

After a tribe of cave-dwelling homo sapiens in prehistory are attacked by neanderthals, three members of the group (Everett McGill, Ron Perlman and Nicholas Kadi) leave to apprehend fire, since they don’t know how to create it themselves. On their journey, they run into saber-toothed tigers, cannibals, a friendly female in body paint (Rae Dawn Chong), woolly mammoths and Ika’s more evolved tribe where the chief is interested in eugenics.

""Quest for Fire"" (1981) is a serious attempt to depict people from prehistorical times in the tradition of “One Million Years BC” from fifteen years earlier (the one with Raquel Welch), although don’t expect any dinosaurs. Like that movie, there's no talking as we understand it; only grunting and primitive lingo.

This of course prevents the flick from being compelling in the sense of interesting or entertaining dialogues, which leaves us with a dramatically dull film with amazing locales and visuals. But there are some worthwhile scenes, such as a member of the Ivaka tribe showing Naoh their advanced knowledge of creating fire with a hand drill.

The special effects were shot live with no optical additions done in post-production. The Smilodons (saber-toothed tigers) were obviously just lions with long canine teeth added while the woolly mammoths were played by trained circus elephants.

Rae Dawn Chong does well in her role as the lithe girl, but don’t expect a stunning female on the level of Lisa Thomas as Sura in “One Million Years BC” or Beth Rogan in the 1961 version of “Mysterious Island.”

The film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in Canada (Greig's Caves on the Bruce Peninsula near Lion's Head, Ontario, and Cathedral Grove on Vancouver Island), Kenya (Lake Magadi) and Scotland (the Highlands and Tsavo National Park). I heard the mammoth scenes were done in Iceland.

Little Big Man is directed by Arthur Penn and written by Calder Willingham. It stars Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Martin Balsam, Chief Dan George and Richard Mulligan.

Arthur Penn's Little Big Man is tagged with many filmic sayings, be it revisionist or anti Western etc, it's a picture much cherished for its oddly quirky slyness. Allegorical movies are now in this day and age ten a penny, but back in 1970, with the Vietnam War in vivid focus, that wasn't the case. Marking this out as a provocative and ambitious venture.

Penn has fun debunking and poking fun at the myths of the Old West via an array of pungent characters that Jack Crabb (Hoffman) meets in his lifetime. All of which leads to the question hanging in the air, that of is Jack Crabb the sole white man survivor of Custer's last stand at Little Big Horn?

The portrayal of the Indians, here the Cheyenne, is superlative by way of the fact that they are the sensible spiritual race, the whites on the other hand are emotionally corrupt in comparison. It gets a little heavy handed at times and really half an hour could have been shaved off the running time and still the pic would have had the same effect. But great performances, the quirks and the potent thematics make for a fine piece of film making. 7/10 || This is quite a fun series of escapades told by way of a flashback interview from the ostensibly 121 year old ""Crabb"" (Dustin Hoffman) who is the last survivor of George Custer's ill-fated battle at the Little Big Horn. His not entirely convinced interviewer asks him about his lively life and we embark on his times as a white man who became an Indian before being ""rescued"" again before some toing and froing between them all set against the pioneering culture of the settlers encroaching on the ancient territories of the natives and of the ensuing hostilities that culminated with ""Yellow Hair"" Custer's calamitous campaign against the Sioux. Along the way we meet an array of interesting characters like ""Wild"" Bill Hickok (Jeff Corey), the force of nature that is ""Mrs. Pendrake"" (Faye Dunaway) as well as the dapper, slightly foppish, General himself (Richard Mulligan) but it's really the sagely old chief (Chief Dan George) whose stoicism in the face of the advancing of modern times is both engaging to watch and poignant as he begins to symbolise both a disappearing and an emerging way of life. There's loads of room for romantic interludes, the odd bit of bad news and by the end of this, I was starting to believe that however implausible many of his recounted adventures might have seemed - who knows, maybe he's really who he claims to be? It's a bit long, but most of the time the quirkiness of the story and it's pace carry it along entertainingly as a simplistic pastiche of US history that Hoffmann holds together really quite well, even if his characterisation as a gunslinger is maybe just a bridge too far. It has dated, and personally I'd have liked to have seen more of the ancillary characters developed a bit more - it'd have been great with the likes of Strother Martin, Jack Elam and Walter Brennan in there too, but it's still well worth a watch."

Two competing camps on a lake in SoCal go through the challenges of a typical summer, except this year there’s an extraterrestrial visitation. Richard Mulligan is on hand as the director of Camp Sasquatch.

“Meatballs Part II” (1984) is all-out comedy compared to the first movie, which was a relatively realistic summer camp flick with some amusing bits. This one throws in an ET-like character along with a lot of goofiness and camp, particularly the ‘general’ of the military camp (Hamilton Camp).

Petite Tammy Taylor stands out on the feminine front as Nancy, along with voluptuous Misty Rowe (Fanny) and Kim Richards (Cheryl) with her glorious long hair. The flick is superior to the first one in this department. On the other side of the spectrum, John Mengatti is effective as the Chachi-like Flash.

While there’s some sex-oriented humor, which is to be expected given the milieu, it doesn’t go overboard into tastelessness like the next sequel. There are some excesses that I could do without (e.g. the implications of John Larroquette’s character and Flash’s boxing outfit) but, other than that, the movie provides practically everything you’d want for a fun summer camp flick.

Watching the respective characters rise and fall respectively creates laughs aplenty whilst asking the question of how we all would cope in similar circumstances?

Sure the film does beat one over the head with its social message, we are in no doubt from the off about the gap between the rich and the poor, and yes the colour of a persons skin also rears its ugly head here to make this one of the more braver comedies of the 80s. Billy Ray Valentine (a brilliant dual performance from Eddie Murphy) is elevated up the social ladder, he becomes a force in industry, but as the progression enthrals him it also makes him aware that the things at the top end of the ladder aren't exactly stand up doings. Winthorpe (a perfectly casted Dan Ackroyd) drops further down the social ladder and resorts to behaviour that nobody from the upper echelons could ever have dreamed he would be capable of - it's only an encounter with prostitute Ophelia (Jamie Lee Curtis at the peak of her sexiness), and her good heart, that starts to see an upturn in his now dead bottom fortunes. 

The gags come thick and fast, both verbally (Murphy on fire) and visually, as the film sees the whole cast fusing together to create a cracking comedy.

Rudy Gerner (Patrick Dempsey) gets a summer job in upstate New York at a river “resort” on the St. Lawrence River wherein a strange woman (Sally Kellerman) helps him with his pursuits of the fairer sex. 

""Meatballs III: Summer Job"" was shot in the summer of 1984, but not released until early 1987 due to the difficulty of apprehending a distributer after the box office failure of “Meatballs Part II” (1984). Of the three sequels this is the only one with connections to the original 1979 film in that Rudy, the mentee of Tripper (Bill Murray), is 2-3 years older and focused on girls. Tripper doesn’t appear in this one, but Rudy reads a letter from him.

The flick is a mixture of the original “Meatballs” with the goofiness and biker gang of the beach party films of the ’60s, plus the raunchiness of “Porky’s” (1981). It’s that last part that ruins the movie for me, although it’s thankfully not AS crude. In short, this is “Meatballs” minus the innocence. Another negative is the eye-rolling competition involving bedding the marina owner’s woman upstairs (Shannon Tweed).

Nevertheless, Dempsey makes for a quality protagonist and the subplot of the porn star (Kellerman) having to come back from the other side to do a genuine good deed is amusing, reminiscent of the quirkiness of a Woody Allen flick. Moreover, the coming-of-age element is compelling.    

There are several nubile females with winsome Isabelle Mejias playing the girl interested in Rudy, Wendy. For a superior movie featuring Isabelle, check out the similar “State Park” (1988).   

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Hudson, Quebec, with some stuff done west of there in Ontario.

His third film is Peters Friends which would compare more with Woody Allen instead of William Shakespeare.

A group of 30 year old friends gather to celebrate their friendship from their theater years at University.  The screenplay is by American actress/comedian Rita Rudner and her husband Martin Bergman. They are able to bring a unique perspective to the high British environments and phobias.  To top it off, Rita also portrays the American in the film in a funny turn.

The cast each embodies their assigned personality admirably.  Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Hugh Laurie, Alphonsia Emmanuel, Kenneth Branagh, Rita Rudner, Tony Slattery all join Stephen Fry as the film's namesake Peter.

The story brings the characters together after a decade long separation.  Their party captures that moment in time, and may age the film quite a bit.

A solid mystery/thriller--the kind that's not done enough these days IMHO. Though he's certainly diversified his oeuvre recently, what with Disney remakes and even superhero films, I wish he had done a lot more like this one, rather than, high-quality as they are, a metric tonne of yet-more Shakespearean adaptations. || Kenneth Branagh's first film, **HENRY V**, was a critical triumph.  But since it was a Shakespeare story, it is overlooked as high-brow. With **DEAD AGAIN** as his sophomore directorial effort, Branagh has a film for the popcorn crowd.  If **HENRY V** was tonally like a Laurence Olivier film, **DEAD AGAIN** is tonally like an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
Filmed in 2 eras, in both color and black and white, with characters portraying multiple characters,  a private eye, reincarnation,  a fortune teller even a _femme fatale_ suffering from amnesia!  Obviously **DEAD AGAIN** is a suspense thriller of old. 

The screenplay by Scott Frank - screenwriter of **OUT OF SIGHT**, **GET SHORTY** and **MINORITY REPORT**- is taut and exciting.  Branagh's creative use of camera and the thundering musical score by his musical alter ego, Patrick Doyle, marry well with that script.

Once again, Branagh carries the film in front and behind the camera.  This time taking on 2 different roles, as does his one-time wife Emma Thompson.  While some from his Shakespeare community appear in other roles, Branagh embraces his first Hollywood film by bringing on board American actors, like Andy Garcia and Robin Williams.

In the end, story is king in **DEAD AGAIN**.  It is fun and exciting and easily one of the best films of 1991.

There were a few plot holes that jumped out at me, but they were forgivable in this type of comedy.  With a wink and a nod, they cast edgy comedian and atheist George Carlin as a big time evangelist or bishop or something.

It seemed to take a while for the various pieces of plot to merge together, unless it was just me being thick. The movie has some laughs and is well written in places.

To rectify matters, he and his pal ""Joey"" (Johnny Murphy) - aka 'The Lips"" decide to hold auditions to create a band. A band with an unique sound to challenge the prevailing mediocrity. After some frankly hilarious auditions that pitch the tone deaf straight into the arms of the fashion police, the pair manage to assemble ten folks as different as gin and Guinness. It's no easy task moulding these disparate and lively individuals into one coherent unit, but oddly enough - despite their differences - it's the music from the likes of Mack Rice (""Mustang Sally""), Al Green & Teenie Hodges and a range of established American soul songsters who manage to provide them all with a common language and purpose as they gradually start to gain some traction amongst a sceptical community and an even more cynical music business. It's fair to say that neither ""Lips"" nor ""Jimmy"" are high on the list at the diplomatic corps, so keeping these people from - quite literally at times - tearing each other apart is no mean feat. Being a Scot of a certain age from Glasgow, it's easy for me to appreciate the old adage that for many, the escape from post-industrial poverty was music - and both Danny Boyle and Roddy Doyle work well to create and engagingly plausible story of folks whose ambition is not to win a Grammy, but to have enough money to buy their kids milk in the morning. Those they assemble for the band are a myriad of characterful and colourful folks - some likeable, some certainly not - but put them on stage and the toes start tapping and all is forgiven. For a while, at least! There's a sense of real talent here, warts and all - and for just shy of two hours it's a compelling watch that reminded me that most bands started out with a talent scouting mechanism that didn't require the likes of Simon Cowell."

...that's the basic plot of 1992's ""Poison Ivy"" starring Drew Barrymore in the titular role. The movie comes from a long tradition of films about an alluring babysitter (or nanny or friend) taking control of the family by winning the hearts of the kids and seducing the husband. ""The Babysitter"" (1980) and ""Summer Girl"" (1983) are two examples, both TV flicks (available on youtube). In ""Poison Ivy"" Drew, as Ivy, plays a friend of the awkward misfit Sylvie (Sara Gilbert). Tom Skerritt plays the aloof husband and Cheryl Ladd the withering (but still beautiful) mother.

""Poison Ivy"" is more stylized than the aforementioned examples and technically better due to a much bigger budget. One of its best highlights is its score, which is equal parts haunting, romantic, melancholic and beautiful. Speaking of melancholic, there's an element of sadness to the proceedings because the family is so wealthy -- living on a mansion on a hill in Los Angeles (shot on location) -- but they're so spiritually bereft. It just goes to show that all the financial success and material possessions in the world can't buy happiness and love.

Drew was almost 17 during filming and plays the sultry little tamale well, which brings up why people tend to look down on the film -- it's nothing more than a lethal Lolita tale with a slick garnishment and they write it off as trash exploitation. Regardless, it works for what it is; and, after all, does every film have to be ""Ghandi""? Besides, ""Poison Ivy"" and similar films are more than just ""trash exploitation."" They're commentaries on the power of a woman or, more specifically, the power of a young beautiful female. In the story, Ivy comes from a troubled past but, as a blossoming woman, she realizes the power she wields and seems to bask in it.

I was involved with a church for a number of years and the granddaughter of the pastor was aged 17-22 at the time. She wasn't in Drew's league, as far as beauty goes yet she still had power. She would lie about people and spread rumors and, because she was the pastor's granddaughter, some morons would believe her. She started dating a naive relative of mine, who was 19 years her senior, and it was clear that she was just interested in his money. At some point she was able to get his credit card info and bought over $17,000 worth of merchandise without him knowing it until it was too late. She did everything in her power to move into his house, but his aging mother blocked the last attempt at the last minute. His mom said that she could just see the vixen pushing her down the stairs or whatever to get her out of the picture. It was even discovered that the lil' tart tried to buy life insurance on the guy, which was very odd. You can draw your own conclusions.

My point is that these lethal Lolitas exist -- young vixens who use their beauty to take control, cause havoc and ruin lives. Trash exploitation or not, it's good fodder for a movie, particularly if it's done stylishly, like ""Poison Ivy"".

The film is short and sweet at 88 minutes with the unrated version running 93 minutes.

The events of D-Day, told on a grand scale from both the Allied and German points of view. 

The retelling of June 6, 1944, from the perspectives of the Germans, US, British, Canadians, and the Free French gets an all star production. One of the great war movie epics, it has all the requisite blunderbuss spectacle and heroism as the Allies invade Normandy. It's not hard to see why it was such a box office winner, sure it's a touch too long given that a lot of characters don't really have much to do, but performances are strong and the slices of humour off set some of the national stereotypes on show.

One has to marvel at the ambition of the production, Fox Studios boss Darryl F. Zanuck spent $10 million to get it onto the big screen, and it shows. Narrative is split into three parts, the preparation, the operations on land and sea in readiness for the Normandy assault, and then the landings in all their powerful glory. For sure we have seen more authentic war movies post The Longest Day, but it undeniably deserves its place as a template movie whose power to entertain in any era forever holds firm. 8/10 || John Wayne may have featured just slightly more than anyone else in this drama, but it's very much an ensemble effort that delivers a film with a great deal of authenticity to it. It's all set around the day of the D-Day landings in 1944. The weather on England's south coast was, in the words of their meteorologist, ""akin to mid-winter"". Delay meant more frustrations for everyone so off they go using just about every form of transportation available - gliders, planes, tanks, landing craft - you name it, as a quarter of a million men (plus lots of sparkling ""Tommies"") headed to Normandy. Meantime, we also see a fairly plausible perspective from the Nazi side of the channel. They've been preparing for an invasion for a while, but are unsure where and when it will come and the apprehension is beginning to take it toll. What's also clear is that the High Command are, themselves, losing faith with the battle tactics of the Bohemian corporal and much less afraid to let it be known. It's now that the story picks up the pace as troops land by sea and air and face the entrenched enemy who are determined to stop the establishment of a beach-head. With bullets flying and explosions everywhere the cinematography, stunt arranging and pyrotechnics really do give us a sense of the dangers the men faced trying to secure a few miles of sand. There's a lovely, short, cameo from Bourvil as the mayor of a small town so delighted to see them that he turns up, suitably sashed and armed with a bottle of champagne to celebrate as the shells drop all around them! Gert Fröbe also finds his milk round become just a touch too perilous too, allowing just a little humour to creep into the story of precision logistics that didn't always go to plan. It's effectively and tightly edited and the momentum drives itself as we see but this one day - no conclusions, not even the end of the end of the beginning. It's lengthy, but each beach has it's own story to tell and the four creative brains behind this project keep it enthralling, for the most part, for a watchable three hours of horror and hope."

But things get complicated when Jim's old partner, Ted, turns up and sets his sights on Linda, Jim's gorgeous ""friend"", this holiday period may not be so happy after all.

Boasting great star power in the form of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, Holiday Inn still feels short of the required genre excitement. There is no doubting the benefit here of having both the leading men's respective abilities on show, where Bing croons with the best of them and Fred of course dances with majestic grace. We get a firecracker sequence that's particularly memorable, but sadly the women of the piece are forgettable, while outside of the songs and dances the film drifts into almost sleepy auto pilot. 

All those involved have done far better, that's for sure, but at least here we get to hear the first airing of the Academy Award winning song, White Christmas. The film is a favourite of many, certainly it is, yet it's just a very average picture and not one that under revisit scrutiny survives away from nostalgic glows. 5/10 || A mildly entertaining movie if you don’t mind watching classics. There are  witty and funny moments, but the romantic aspects aren’t very convincing. Perhaps this is how romance is with celebrities— no passion? No, I doubt that.

The dance numbers aren’t up to Fed Astaire’s usual imaginative standard and a few of the songs about lesser holidays are rather lame. The sets are unconvincing- would a farmhouse really be this large? But this is picky stuff. If you don’t mind classic black and white films this is entertaining enough, especially if you are watching with friends or family, as it doesn’t require close viewing to stay caught up with the plot.

I only wish it had a bit more real romance and less talking about romance. || Simply a must-watch at Christmas time. An Irving Berlin musical made in the forties. Yes, please!"

Many parts are very accurate whereas others are more or less. This is after all a Hollywood movie, NOT a documentary such as ""The World At War"", so we can't be too critical about perfect accuracy.

Originally it was supposed to be directed by two directors, 1 for the American story line, and Akira Kurosawa, for the Japanese story. There were rumored difficulties between Mr. Kurosawa and the American studio bosses so Mr. Kurosawa left the production despite having an uncredited role in scripting the Japanese part of the screenplay.

I have read recently that the version that was being shown, of the historical account in the movie, was different than the conventional history's perspective. However, I would say that is only in demonstrating, theatrically, how Admiral Kimmel and General Short, who were scapegoats and put through rigorous Congressional Hearings after the actual event, may have taken ample precautions. That their shortcomings were due to communications being delayed or intelligence reports being withheld. I saw it in the movie theater in 1970, and many times since and have found it to be a very fair and well done ""Hollywood"" representation of the essential history of an important historic event.

The movie is essentially well acted, and believably presented with a few surprising disappointments. The Battleship Nevada was depicted with an inaccurate arrangement of its main batteries. In reality it had 10-14 inch guns, a 3-gun mount with a twin ""Superfiring"" turret over it, on the Bow and the Stern. Not 4, 3 gun mounts, (triple would mean all 3 guns were connected and couldn't be aimed independently which was retrofitted in the 1930s). When you see a ship that says Nevada on it and it isn't correctly laid out it is hard to believe the rest of the movie, particularly where details about ships, planes, equipment, facilities and ordnance were important characters in their depicted historic roles.

Some actual footage of the carnage at Pearl Harbor was used, including the Battleship Arizona conflagrating (exploding). As Docu-dramas go, Tora-Tora-Tora is among the best and superior to ""Midway"", which used some of the same footage and sound effects having been Produced by many of same people. I mentioned the aforementioned criticisms because at the film's beginning it has a Notation, ""True To Historic Fact"" and expands on that statement. In reality few films or testimonies can live up to 100% accuracy and weighted relevance, but Tora-Tora-Tora does have me returning to re-experience it, and not generally to look for more errors but rather because it is an overall worthwhile film. || I remember viewing this film as a kid shortly after it came out in Sweden. At that time I was not impressed. I was expecting an action filled war movie and what I got was a boring movie where the good guys got beaten up at the end. I do not think I even new anything about the real events in Pearl Harbor at the time.

Naturally I view this movie in a somewhat different light and now and when re-watching it yesterday evening I enjoyed it quite a lot. I cannot help but wondering at the historical accuracy though. If someone would have told me that this was nothing but a Hollywood script, and a predictable at that, I would probably not have doubted it.

Did all these blunders really take place? That the Japanese where not playing with all their cards on the table is clear but there where so many screw-ups all over the place. Sightings not being reported, communications a mess everywhere, people asking for confirmations in absurdum, lining up the planes like ducks on a shooting range etc. etc. If this is really what happened then some of those movie scripts that seems so ridiculous maybe are not as ridiculous as one might think?

Naturally the film has the drawback of being predictable. What else can you expect when it is supposed to depict actual, well known, events? I think I would have felt that it was predictable even if I did not know what was supposed to happen though. Even so it is an enjoyable, well done, movie as far as I am concerned."

Jeremiah Johnson is directed by Sydney Pollack and is inspired by two books, Raymond Thorp and Robert Bunker's Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson and Vardis Fisher's Mountain Man. Script was written by John Millius and Edward Anhalt and cinematography is by Duke Callaghan. It stars Robert Redford, Will Geer, Stefan Gierasch, Delle Bolton and Josh Albee.

Hardened after the war with Mexico, and fed up with everyday life, American Jeremiah Johnson (Redford) leaves civilisation behind to live life as a mountain man. He intends to be self-sufficient as a trapper, but he finds that mother nature can be tough, and out here in the mountain wilderness he is not alone. There are others here, and Jeremiah must face many challenges if he is to truly survive.

Filmed entirely on location in the vast wilderness beauty of Utah, Jeremiah Johnson is light on plot but all the better for it. Film basically constitutes Redford's mountain man learning to survive up in them thar mountains, and, earning the right to do so. A number of issues will arise to test his metal, giving him a number of hardships and adventures to define his transformation from average Joe to a fully fledged mythical man of the Earth. Redford is wonderfully at ease in the title role, and very quickly he gets the audience on side to share in his journey. But ultimately it's the landscapes that you take away from this movie. Not only gorgeous, but also the critical character that frames Johnson during his isolation and battle for survival. 8/10 || I watched it in September 2019, and found it absolutely amazing.
The beauty of the landscapes are astonishing. 
If you like adventure movies, then this film ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is for you, do not hesitate a second.

Sydney Pollack shows here how a great director he is. 
You will see how hard the life in mountains is, especially in winter, and especially in the 18th and 19th century.

A cautionary 7/10. || I love the first half hour of this film. It's all about the fastidious policeman ""Patou"" (Jack Lemmon) who is unwittingly transferred into a Parisian red light district where he encounters the eponymous hooker (Shirley MacLaine) plying her trade with her little dog. He smells a rat and immediately calls for a police raid on the hotel in which she works. Bad mistake! Not least because one of his bosses is enjoying the hospitality of the house - so he gets fired. Now pretty much resident in the café of ""Moustache"" (Lou Jacobi) across from her workplace, he becomes increasingly frustrated that this woman that he is now enamoured of is still working, so he concocts a cunning plan to adopt the identity of a visiting British lord and to woo her into a relationship that's exclusive. Initially this is a success - paid for by borrowed money from his new best friend, but when ""Moustache"" starts to want repaying, ""Patou"" has to start working overnight in the adjacent meat market and his burning of the candles at both ends soon causes consternation with ""Irma"". Eventually he concludes that his lordly lark isn't sustainable and so fakes his suicide. The razor-sharp mind of ""Insp. Lefevre"" (Herschel Bernardi) takes a different view though, and soon ""Patou"" in in jail for murder! Now he has to escape, prove his innocence (quite innovatively as it happens) and hope that his gal hasn't got bored of all of these shenanigans and found true love elsewhere. MacLaine puts her heart and soul into this - dancing, teasing and playing the game for all it's worth - and she's entertaining to boot. Lemmon was never my favourite comedy actor, but here he uses her and a strong screenplay from Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond to create an engaging character that, for the most part, manages to stay on the right side of farce as the plot proceeds from the sublime to the ridiculous. It does drag a little in the middle, and the preposterous does start to overwhelm it then too, but it rebounds well for a last half hour of quirky, entertaining cinema with a twist in its tail."

I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.

Too bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton’s work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.

Unfortunately Ichabod’s inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science and in the end Ichabod had exposed an evil but perfectly human adversary by scientific means or if it had gone all supernatural and Ichabod was an adept at exposing (exorcising) supernatural beings rather than a scientist.

Having said that, the movie was still a decent enough evening flick and fairly enjoyable. The footage and scenery are well done as one would expect from Tim Burton. It is not exactly a special effects loaded movie but what is there is fairly okay, at least for a movie from 1999. || It is you, Ichabod Crane, who is now put to the test.

Sleepy Hollow is directed by Tim Burton and co-adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and Kevin Yagher from the The Legend of Sleepy Hollow written by Washington Irving. It stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Marc Pickering, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones and Casper Van Dien. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki.

1799 New York, and Ichabod Crane, a timid but forward thinking detective, is sent to the way out village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a number of decapitations.

A perfect match of director and actor to the source material, Sleepy Hollow unfolds as a fun filled creeper of such visual and aural pleasures, it's a wonder nobody thought to put the combination together earlier than 1999. Story is familiar, though with a few changes, and although some of the comedy ends up a bit sillier than is tonally appropriate (really, Ichabod, stop pushing the effeminate angle to breaking point), film runs along at a fair old clip and never wants for period devilment. It's never really scary when Walken's headless horseman isn't part of the scene, but it's very unlikely that Burton or Depp were aiming to soil underwear anyway. More a case of charming you whilst caressing the tingler on your spine. A case of style of substance? Yes, to a degree, but the source story still comes through the lavish eye candy painting to reveal itself proudly.

Burton had created a world of Gothic mysticism, a blend of Hammer horror values and Brothers Grimm bad dreams, a land of swirling mists and tall shadows, where black, red and purple are essential colours. From the quaint duck pond in the centre of the village, to a creaky old windmill, there are visual treats galore here - which are enhanced magnificently by Elfman's foreboding rumbles. Costuming is first rate (Colleen Atwood), as is Lubezki's colour lensing and Rick Heinrich's production design. The cast are led superbly by Depp and appear to be pitching performances at just the right tone, such is the director's want. Although Ricci is sadly underused in a key role, and we could have done with more Richardson since she is wonderfully catty and yummy in equal measure. But with bona fide thespian quality in the support ranks (joining Gambon and Jones are Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths), picture never falls short of scene enhancers.

Period peril with a glint in its eye, Sleepy Hollow is a delightful nights entertainment by the fire. 8/10 || Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

While Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci do carry quite a bit of the movie, there is quite a lot else going on here.  The horseman does tend to dominate much of this story as the original does.

I don't feel there was much to the original fable of the Headless Horseman so pretty much any take you do on it seems fine: though maybe an Easter Bunny version would push some boundaries.

This is about as weird, but more because it has to create a weird atmosphere, then add Depp doing weirder stuff than the weird people can handle, despite believing in ghosts which he all but fights with them about.  Ichabod Crane being a smart, if cowardly, constable is interesting as he literally has the ""hero"" role painted on him.

This is surprisingly more of a mystery than any other type of movie.  The action is usually intense and brief when it happens, and much of the movie is spent looking for rational explanations until ocom's razor wins out.

This is a good movie and a decent mystery, but I do feel it's just awkward in too many cases for most people to be on board.

I expect Headless Horsemen and mystery fans to enjoy this though."

The World is Not Enough is directed by Michael Apted and adapted to screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein, using characters created by Ian Fleming. Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by Adrian Biddle. 

Bond 19 and 007 is required to protect a female oil magnate from potential assassination, but it soon becomes apparent that something far bigger and sinister is around the corner. 

Pierce Brosnan returns for his third turn as super suave secret agent James Bond and all the crucial elements for the franchise are firmly in place. From the exhilarating pre-credit sequence down the river Thames (14 minutes worth) to the glorious over the top explosive finale, this is a Bond film for those that enjoy the cheeky action led mania over thought and depth. Into the Bondian mix are the usual stalwarts; Judi Dench as M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Desmond Llewelyn as Q (bidding a sad farewell to the franchise with a poignant moment) and Robbie Coltrane joyously returns as Zukovsky. Bond girl duties fall to Sophie Marceau (beautiful and solid) and Denise Richards (sexy, elfin like, but out of her depth) and the psycho for hire role lands at the considerably fine feet of Robert Carlyle, even if the latter is badly underused. 

The World Is Not Enough (the Bond family motto) is a whizz bang entry in the series and finds Brosnan well settled in the role; nailing the multitude of traits that make Bond a man that women want to bed and a man that men want to be. Locales are lovely and interesting (Turkey, France, Spain, Azerbaijan), the plot carries some intelligence (with a decent mystery element for a change), characterisations are high end and Arnold's score is a safe accompaniment; as is the title song by Garbage. It is, however, all too aware of wanting to appease Bond fans across the spectrum. Thus the comedy moments come off as saggy and the more scientific aspects (as gloriously ridiculous as they are) feel more like auto-pilot plotting. Still, you get what you pay for with 90s Bond, and the action sequences are terrific. After the mixed Tomorrow Never Dies the makers were clearly intent on taking the fans on a ripper of a ride, and no doubt about it, they achieve that in spades; with the two hour running time just flying by. 

Eon of course would take things one step too far three years later with the nadir that was Die Another Day, thus making this the last good Bond film before Daniel Craig's fabulous re-invention arrived in 2006. 7/10 || _**The oil pipeline in central Asia episode**_

After a British oil tycoon is assassinated, agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) traces the hit to a crazy ex-KGB terrorist (Robert Carlyle) and travels to the Caspian Sea/Black Sea area to protect a sultry oil heiress, the daughter of the murdered mogul (Sophie Marceau). Denise Richards is on hand as a nuclear physicist working at a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan while Robbie Coltrane returns from “Goldeneye” (1995) as Valentin Zukovsky, the former KGB agent turned gangster.

“The World Is Not Enough” (1999) is Brosnan’s third installment in the series with the opening featuring an absurd-but-fun boat chase on the River Thames in London and a great title song performed by Shirley Manson & Garbage. Other highlights include a paraglider-snowmobile assault in the snowy mountains, underground mayhem at the ICBM base in Kazakhstan, a wild sequence inside a pipeline to deactivate a bomb and a thrilling climax in the Bosphorus strait near Istanbul. 

Many complain about Denise Richards as the nuclear physicist, Dr. Christmas Jones, but she does a fine job and looks great, especially in those short shorts at the ICBM base in the high desert. Meanwhile Sophie Marceau as Elektra King is alluring in a classy way. Also on hand in the feminine department are Maria Grazia Cucinotta as the opening femme fatale, Serena Scott Thomas as Dr. Molly Warmflash and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny. Judi Dench of course returns as ‘M.’

This is a competent Bond flick with all the requisite staples; it’s just kinda unmemorable in the grand scheme of the franchise. Like the previous “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997), the colors are muted, which casts a grey pall over the proceedings, although not as pronounced. 

The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes, and was shot in Bilbao, Vizcaya, País Vasco, Spain (opening scene); London, England, & areas nearby; Baku, Azerbaijan, & the Azerbaijan Oil Rocks; Chamonix, Haute-Savoie, France (ski scenes); Bosphorus River, Istanbul, Turkey; and Eilean Donan Castle, Scotland (new MI6 headquarters).

GRADE: B- || I am afraid I struggled with this film right from the get-go. Not that Pierce Brosnan doesn't turn in a decent enough effort as ""007"", it's the supporting cast that are pretty average and the story - it is just so weak. Arch-baddie ""Renard"" (Robert Carlyle) has been shot in the head so gets stronger every day until he dies (any physicians please explain how a bullet near your brain can make you nigh-on immortal?). Robbie Coltrane is ordinarily excellent as a comic actor, but somehow his performance here as Russian hard-man ""Zukovsky"" is the wrong kind of funny and we see way too much of ""M"" (Dame Judi Dench) and the woefully cast John Cleese as ""R"" - luckily because Desmond Llewellyn was still round to amiably, and briefly, fill the role of gadget master ""Q"". To her credit, Sophie Marceau tries hard in the spirit of the old ""Bond"" girl role, delivering a feisty and adequate performance that is sexy but also pretty potent, too, as she tries to get to the bottom of who killed her industrialist father and is now trying to hijack her oil pipeline through some pretty lawless terrain. That plot, though, lurches from the silly to the ridiculous before an ending that took for ever to deliver what we all knew was bound to happen. There is plenty of action, car chases and pyrotechnics but sadly, the characterisations are what makes the ""Bond"" franchise stand out. Here they needed much better writing and a stronger hand at the tiller than was delivered by Michael Apted."

There’s also a struggling actress “Huma” (Marisa Paredes) who is having the wobbles ahead of a performance of “A Streetcar Named Desire” as well as some troubles with her younger pal “Nina” (Candela Peña) whose habit is starting to get a bit out of control. If you look at the all of the ingredients here, it can seem a little contrived but the combination of a forceful and powerful effort from Roth and some creative flair from an on-form Pedro Almodóvar manages to create a series of scenarios that flow effortlessly from the seemingly sublime to the ridiculous whilst raising a few smiles along the way and dealing with some serious topics, like Alzheimer’s, grief and identity issues along the way.

This is a perfect vehicle for Bill Murray, his brand of sarcastic and caustic delivery is nailed on perfect for Frank Cross, the modern day scrooge in this tale. I have often found him to be an acquired taste, I mean don't get me wrong here, I'm a big fan and can repeatedly watch his best offerings, but it's not hard to understand why his style is not universally loved. Scrooged is pure and simply the modern spin of the story we all have grown up with, that isn't to say that the film loses anything as regards Christmas spirit, because it doesn't, the message is still the same, and in this ever changing world of ours the core essence of the story is one the world should heed.

This version is a blast, it's loud, it's brash, but boy is it damn funny, and I personally watch it every Christmas without fail. And yes, I watch it alongside the glorious Alistair Sim version, for although they are poles apart in class, they both entertain for very different reasons.

Joining Murray in this festive romp is the delightful Karen Allen, while luminaries such as former New York Dolls front man David Johansen and Mr. Laconic himself, Robert Mitchum, add some weight to the cast list. It all works really rather well with the exception of Carol Kane's Ghost Of Christmas Present, where to me she comes off as being more annoying than funny, but that of course is a personal opinion and I know as fact that many others adore her energetic performance. With quips aplenty and of course with a simple heartfelt message at the core, Scrooged is truly a sharp and enjoyable film to be enjoyed at the festive period. 

Thanks boys, get the nurse! 8/10 || Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy <em>'Scrooged'</em> all that much.

I never really clicked with this 1988 release whilst I was watching it. Bill Murray is fine, the Ghost of Christmas Past is good and the bits of the plot involving Alfre Woodard's character are decent. That's all I have for noteworthy positives, though. The vibe of the film felt off to me. I didn't connect with Murray's Frank at any point, whether it be the past, the present or the future version of him.

I get, as Scrooge, you're supposed to dislike him, but I've seen a fair few versions of <em>'A Christmas Carol'</em> and I feel like the Scrooge character is usually moreso cowardly bad, as in he'll be horrid to people behind their back or under his breath - as opposed to Frank Cross, who is in your face, over the top, overtly mean. Perhaps I'm misremembering or it just stuck out to me more here as I didn't like much else from the 100 or so minutes.

For an Xmas flick, also, it doesn't hit the Christmassy spot either. It could've done with more warmth, or at least some entertaining and/or funny moments; I did minorly chuckle a few times, I will say, but not nearly enough. I still wouldn't describe this as a 'bad' film, but it is quite far adrift of being a positive in my books.

I thought this would've be a good'un, many think it is which is fair, but for me I unfortunately didn't particularly like it. || Does Bill break the 4th wall or is he talking to the TV audience?  I mean, this movie and the argument my parents had after it was how I learned what the 4th wall was... and for the record, I side with Mom, he was clearly breaking it.

You already know the plot, which is nice about these movies, you know what is going to happen, it's all about how they are going to present it, and the presentation was pretty hysterical.

It is very 80s, very 80s comedy, playing with the offensive and the inoffensive in a family friendly way, and at the end of the day, you get a good laugh over a Christmas tale.

There isn't that much to say, you already know everything about it without actually needing to watch it, just that this presentation is funny and heart warming... heart warming like all the others, save for the remake made for ""Modern Audiences"" that ends on a note of spite and hate."

Elwood P. Dowd is a charming harmless fella, he takes a drink or two for sure, but he's a delightful human being regardless. So why then does his sister want to have him committed to a home for the insane? Ah well you see, Elwood has an invisible friend who happens to be a six-foot-three rabbit!

Faithfully adapted by Mary Chase from her hit Broadway play, Harvey remains to this day a wonderful fantasy comedy that delights all members of the family. It's the kind of film that leaves a warm glow once the credits role, it's basic premise is one of fantastical whimsy as Elwood drives all around him to distraction with his discourse with the invisible Harvey. It's here that the film has a rather naughty streak because Elwood actually appears to be the only sane person on show, all around him is chaos, but he remains calm and completely at peace with his lot.

Starring as Elwood is James Stewart (Academy Award nominated), and it's a very special memorable performance as he carries off with ease the eccentric nature of the character. Stealing the show as Elwood's sister Veta, is Josephine Hull (Aademy Award winner best supporting actress}, completely flustered and effervescent with comic timing precision. Solid support comes from Peggy Dow (why didn't she do more movies?), Charles Drake and the always watchable Cecil Kellaway. The direction from Henry Koster I personally find uneven, at times too hectic when the magic moment has passed, it's as if he was caught between making a screwball comedy or just a basic fantastical one. I often wonder what Frank Capra could have done with this particular adaptation? Still, the film remains much beloved by many, and I'm certainly counting myself amongst that number.

Bless the pooka indeed. 8/10 || Harvey is a whimsical film, at times a clever film about innocence and making sure it is not lost in a cynical dog eat dog world.

James Stewart plays Elwood an amiable pleasant drunk, although we never see him actually drink. He is a sweet man who likes talking to people, so adept he is at listening to people, they tell him all sorts of hopes, desires, wishes and problems like he was the parish priest.

Elwood's sister Veta Louise (Josephine Hull) wants to marry off her daughter Myrtle Mae (Victoria Home) but what is holding them back is Elwood and his conversations with Harvey, a 6 feet tall invisible rabbit.

Veta decides to have Elwood committed but due to a series of mishaps it is her who ends being institutionalized before the error is discovered and further farce ensues. Eventually she realises that she wants her brother just the way he is. || People like Elwood P. Dowd. He has plenty of friends, and knows almost everyone in town. If he doesn't know you, simply allow him to give you his card. His best friend, however, is a clever pooka who takes the form of a 6'3"" tall rabbit.

I didn't know it was possible to like James Stewart even more than I already did! Here he gives one of his most endearing performances, in a role he called his personal favorite. Josephine Hull, Victoria Horn, Charles Drake, Peggy Dow, Cecil Kellaway, and others make up a colorful and lively supporting cast.

From the Pulitzer prize winning play comes this wonderfully zany comedy celebrating the eccentric in all of us. A delightful and heartwarming film enjoyable for all ages.

I think Jimmy Stewart speaks for all of us when he says at the end, ""I prefer you, too, Harvey."""

What ensues are a series of escapades as the father and son team encounter a range of equally war ravaged citizens - some more helpful than others - on their mini-quest. It's an interesting study on humanity this, centred around something so apparently pedestrian as losing a bike, but the cascading impact of that event on their lives and their relationship as well as with the profound effects on their livelihood and self respect are expertly laid out by De Rica, who draws us gradually into their series of adventures. The simplicity of the story also engenders an opportunity to look at the poverty endured by many sections of the citizenry (those who sit through the mass so they can be rewarded with a bowl of soup rather than worrying about any redemption of their soul, for example). The performance from the young Staiola is excellent. He plays the role of the young boy with considerable natural skill - his character has no real idea of why this bike is so important, nor of why it's loss is causing his father's behaviour to vacillate - but like a loyal puppy, he continues to help out, even saving the day at one stage. The settings in this ancient city add considerably to the sense of despair - ruins (old and new) - and at times they make you wonder of life here has really moved on so much from Roman times. The pace of the film is very well measured, the script is not devoid of a bit humour, even joy, now and again and the momentum builds steadily to a conclusion that is remarkably poignant and that left me with a smile on my face.

McCabe and Mrs Miller is directed by Robert Altman and Altman co-adapts the screenplay with Brian McKay. It's adapted from the novel McCabe written by Edmund Naughton. It stars Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, John Schuck, Keith Carradine, Rene Auberjonois and Bert Remson. Music is by Leonard Cohen and cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond.

A gambler and a prostitute become business partners in the remote mining town of Presbyterian Church, as their enterprise booms it comes to the attention of a large mining corporation who want to buy the action.

Altman's grim and dirty slice of the Old West (Northwestern here to be precise) is a divisive picture in Western fan circles. In fact it's been said that it's more beloved by none Western fans and Altman acolytes than actual Western lovers. Put up as a flag bearer for the Anti-Western splinter, a mud and rags Oater for terminology purpose, there is no denying the quality on show across the board.

Set in bleak winter time, Altman and his crew pour on the atmospherics in practically every frame, with the director using his familiar film making trademarks (overlap conversations, realistic movement of characters in framing shots etc) for maximum impact. With Cohen warbling his plaintive tunes at each story juncture, there's a haunting beauty on offer that belies the narrative thrust fronted by losers and dreamers. While Zsigmond brilliantly photographs the extreme difference between the homely feel of the interiors, with that of the cold snowy wilderness outside the doors, where the muted colours ooze period flavour.

Purposely built for the film, the town of Presbyterian Church is a sea of mud, snow and timber, where the weather is perpetually dank, the surroundings enveloping chief protagonist McCabe like an unearthly portent. There are no great pyrotechnics here, and the story is being told in slow and deliberate time, which goes a long way to explaining why it is a divisive film, so any newcomers should be forewarned of this. Beatty and Christie in the title roles are superb, both defrocked of their star status beauty, they perform skilfully for realistic portrayals.

Not an easy watch, but always riveting and fascinating, it for sure is a piece of art. A picture worthy of revisits when the mood is set for total immersion. 8/10 || ***Dreary, realistic Western about a brothel in a remote town in the Great Northwest***

A gambling businessman (Warren Beatty) rides into a secluded town near Puget Sound, Washington, and starts a house of ill repute with a professional madam (Julie Christie). When he arrogantly refuses the offers of a major corporation to buy him out, they send grim men to take care of the situation.  

Being a Robert Altman picture, “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” (1971) isn’t your typical Western, although the gunfight in the third act is reminiscent of “High Noon” (1952). The topic is unsavory, reveling in the ugly side of life and the Old West. On top of that, the first half is tediously mundane with an overuse of Leonard Cohen’s monotone folk ditties (""The Stranger Song"", ""Sisters of Mercy"" and ""Winter Lady""), although they fit the mood. 

There are glimmerings of light, however, and the town set is convincing, half-built for the movie. The unexciting opening sets the stage for a powerful second half. Hugh Millais as the hulking Butler is quietly menacing. There’s an unforgettable scene with Keith Carradine and Hans at a rope bridge (the latter’s name may not be Hans, but it looks like it).

At the end of the day, “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” is professionally made and timeless (it’s barely aged at all). Whether or not you like it is a matter of taste. I have mixed feelings, but its positive points make it worthwhile. It’s vastly superior to Altman’s dreadful “Buffalo Bill and the Indians” (1976). At least he takes chances, even if they’re not always completely successful. 

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in the Vancouver area, British Columbia: West Vancouver (Presbyterian Church), Squamish (Bearpaw) & Howe Sound.

This annoys Alfred and both he and Klara take an instant dislike to each other, completely unaware that they are I fact both each others lonely hearts pen pal.

Boy oh boy was this production in safe hands. Produced and directed by the fabulous Ernst Lubitsch (""To Be Or Not To Be"" & ""Heaven Can Wait"") and starring James Stewart (take your pick of many classics), Margaret Sullavan (""The Good Fairy"" & ""So Red the Rose"") and Frank Morgan (""The Wizard Of Oz""). Adapted by Samson Raphaelson from Miklós László's play (""Parfumerie""), The Shop Around The Corner ranks up with the best of the romantic comedies from the classic era. Blending charm with community spirit, and dark moments with beams of light, it's a concocted remedy for the blues at a time when war was at the forefront of everyones minds.

Unashamedly sweet as it is, it's important to note the intricacies of the plot, with people being desperate for work, even forming rivalries within the confines of the shop, they even manage to flesh out an infidelity arc to really keep the viewer on their respective toes. All the efforts here are first class, Stewart gives the kind of performance that is often overlooked, no middle America ""Aww Shucks"" on show here, it's precise and with feeling, this is a truly great Stewart performance. 

Sullavan is sadly something of a forgotten actress, and her films are so hard to find as well, it's a shame because she's right on the money and matches Stewart pound for pound in both humorous and emotive acting. Director Lubitsch once said that for human comedy he was never as on form as he was with The Shop Around The Corner, so who wishes to argue with that? Because the evidence suggests he was right, and I can only add that it is not merely just a romantic comedy, it's an experience all around the table - and then some. 9/10 || Frank Morgan is super in this delightful comedy drama. His general goods store finds itself with a new employee in ""Klara"" (Margaret Sullavan) who has loads of new techniques and a style that manages to irk long time supervisor ""Kralik"" (James Stewart). What we know from early on is that both are engaged, enthusiastically, in a pen-pal relationship unaware of the true identities of each other - and their antics as the first meeting looms ever closer make for highly entertaining stuff to watch. Things take a bit of a downturn when, suddenly, ""Kralik"" falls a little foul of his normally jovial, somewhat dithery, boss - and though the audience can readily guess why, it takes a while for the old gent to realise the error of his ways. There is something immeasurably genial about the whole thing. The scenes in the stockroom where they are moving what are clearly empty boxes, the character actors in support - especially Joseph Schildkraut (""Vadaz"") and the ever reliable Felix Bressart (""Pirovitch"") frequently raise a smile but it's always Morgan who steals the scenes as the amiable employer who gets the wrong end of the stick. Certainly a classic film from Ernst Lubitsch, well worth searching out on a big screen if you can."
11393.0,The Natural,An unknown middle-aged batter named Roy Hobbs with a mysterious past appears out of nowhere to take a losing 1930s baseball team to the top of the league.,He lived for a dream that wouldn't die.,Drama,137,1984-05-11,en,6.903,613,2.433,"Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley",Barry Levinson,"corruption, sports, baseball, attempted murder, talent, redemption, child prodigy, femme fatale, lightning bolt, hdd","The Wonder of Wonderboy.

The Natural is directed by Barry Levinson and adapted to screenplay by Roger Towne & Phil Dusenberry from the novel written by Bernard Malamud. It stars Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley, Barbara Hershey, Robert Prosky and Richard Farnsworth. Music is by Randy Newman and cinematography by Caleb Deschanel.

The Natural is a wistful sports movie, one that asks every person who views it to buy into the whimsy and mythologising on show. If able to do that then it's a film of beguiling beauty, awash with strength of the human spirit and of luscious technical credits. The Arthurian core to Roy Hobbs' (Redford a superb presence yet calmness personified) second chance ensures we always know this is fanciful stuff, but that's just fine, we are in Field of Dreams territory here and fans of such fare are rewarded royally. Period art design, photography and musical score are grade ""A"", snuggling up nicely with a support cast to Redford that is of high end proportions. If it's in you and you know what sort of film to expect, you may well, come the end, be punching the air whilst having a tear in your eye. Lovely film making. 8.5/10 || Many, many years ago when I was a bit of a sports fan, I remember reading stories about scouts who had seen athletes in the olden days like Roy Hobbs. Players who could hit a ball a mile or throw a hundred mile per hour fastball, but who never made it to the big league for some reason. But of course, this movie is based on a novel by Bernard Malamud, though there are hints of actual events here and there.

It is an entertaining movie, presenting baseball as America’s game and therefore, ultimately, above corruption. It has an old timey feel, perhaps even older than the 1939 setting that is presented. The movie is less gloomy than the book, and I guess the purists don’t like that, but for me, life is gloomy enough and the mood and ending were just fine with me. (And I did read the book.)  Since actual events and people from bygone days are cleaned up and mythologized for our history books, why get upset when fictional stories are purified with a rose colored lens?"

After WW1, two brothers come-of-age in the Missoula area of Montana; one prudent (Craig Sheffer) and the other imprudent (Brad Pitt). Tom Skerritt plays their father, a wise Presbyterian minister, while Emily Lloyd plays the sensible son’s potential romantic interest.    

""A River Runs through It"" (1992) was based on the memoir of American author Norman Maclean and is similar to “Legends of the Fall” (1994), but understandably more mundane (in a positive sense). This was Robert Redford’s third directorial effort and it was very successful. It effectively brings to life the Prohibition Era of the 20s and early 30s with their Model T's and speakeasies. 

Aside from Lloyd, Susan Traylor appears on the feminine front as a woman with, um, rather loose morals while Nicole Burdette plays the Indian lass that Pitt’s character brings to a speakeasy. 

The moral is deep and a little murky, but clear if you reflect on it. Regardless, it’s a great drama that takes you back to rural America during the roaring 20s. If you like “Legends of the Fall” and “The Horse Whisperer” (1998) it’s a must.  

The film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in western Montana (Livingston, Granite Falls & Bozeman) with one scene done in Wyoming. Needless to say, the locations are a highlight.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Seemingly happily married man, Dan Gallagher, gives in to the seductive charm of Alex Forrest and partakes in a night of wild sexual passion with her. Trouble is, is that Alex is a tad unhinged and a woman scorned can be the ultimate nightmare.

I have just revisited this monster smash hit from the 80s (highest grossing film of 1987), and it still packs the same punch as it did back in the late 80s when it not only became a big hit, it also became a cultural phenomenon and one of the most talked about films of the decade. I'm saddened by the relatively average rating here because its significance and bravery should always be highlighted instead of pointless allegations about it being only of its time. Just how many imitations did Fatal Attraction spawn I wonder? Fatal Attraction was a monster hit because it gave the audience something different, a monster flip flop of having the man stalked by an uncontrollable female loony. Much credit goes to screenwriter James Dearden for laying it on like a slowly tightening spring waiting to explode, for as the plot unfolds and Alex Forrest's Madame Butterfly fuelled revenge gathers apace, the audience starts to realise it has been doubly conflicted on the emotional character attachment front.

Dan has done the dirty on his beautiful wife and child, the bastard deserves what is coming to him for sure? Alex is right in that he's had his fun and now she can basically go and whistle at the moon, but the cheeky saver here from the makers is that Alex did the chasing knowing that Dan was happily married, she led the way fully armed with the facts. This makes for a wonderfully constructed thriller that ups the suspense quota to positively seal the deal with a heart stopping finale. I'm mightily relieved that American test audiences gave the thumbs down to the rather downbeat original ending that saw Alex committing suicide and thus framing Dan for her murder, the ending that stands may lose impact on repeat viewings, but boy it has still got a kick to it.

Glenn Close is fantastic as Alex, playing against type she manages to convince as a disturbed individual, a perfect blend of sadness and soul destroying stupidness. Michael Douglas is also giving a performance of depth, firmly in the shadow of Glen Close's film stealing show, he none the less plays it perfectly and is believable in all aspects of the character, and I'm sure the ladies watching were pleased to see no sign of the saggy bottom that scared them in Basic Instinct five years later! This film coupled with Wall Street in the same year would propel Douglas to major A list status, and he rightly deserved it in my opinion. Anne Archer is Beth Gallagher, the hurt wife of the piece, she looks stunning and sexy, but thoughts of her looks are quickly erased with a special two layered performance of note. Containing a great script and directed astutely by Adrian Lyne, Fatal Attraction remains one of the best thrillers of the 80s, it was talked about profusely back then, and here and now it should not be forgotten. 9/10"

He hires a lawyer who hasn’t taken a criminal case in years, and as they work together, a complicated romance develops amidst the trial.","When a murder case is this shocking, which do you trust?

Teddy Barnes is a conflicted lawyer, still reeling from the dubious methods of a colleague, she takes on the defence of Jack Forrester, who is accused of murdering his wife with a jagged edged knife. Gradually falling for Jack's seductive powers, Teddy falls in love with the man she now has to defend, her problems it seems, are about to become far far worse.

Jagged Edge, directed by Richard Marquand, starring Glenn Close (Teddy), Jeff Bridges (Jack), Robert Loggia (Sam Ransom) and Peter Coyote (Thomas Krasny), is bringing nothing new to the table of a much replicated genre. It does however boast brilliant acting, a tremendous screenplay (Joe Eszterhas) and a production value that demands it be viewed with less than cynical eyes. That it is written by Eszterhas is obvious when looking at the structure of the picture, death, sex, troubled romance, greed and that old devil called obsession (Basic Instinct anyone?), yet aided by a competent director and an exemplary cast, Jagged Edge shines brighter than most other films of its ilk.

It looks a little frayed (not jagged) around the edges now, but that is purely because of the advent of time and the ream of thrillers using this format that have followed this piece. If one (such as I) can transport oneself back to the 80s and view Jagged Edge on its original terms, then its easy to recognise just what a well put together picture it is. Close and Bridges are superb, whilst Robert Loggia steals the picture from under their noses, his interplay with Close is a particular highlight. In spite of some less than great twists and unsubtle scapegoat placings, Jagged Edge succeeds because you are there at the finale, and because its held you in its grip all along, you (hopefully) have invested yourself with these characters, you simply just have to know, for better or worse!

The ending was cause for much discussion back in the day, and viewing it now it still feels like a moment of cheek mixed in with some form of clarity, but rest assured it works well, as does, funnily enough, the whole film. No world beater here, but highly accomplished and worth the time of any thriller obsessed movie fan. 7/10"

The unsung DeNiro classic. The missing 80s masterpiece as regards everything coming together, and simply the best buddy buddy movie that, to me at least, has ever hit the screen.

De Niro & Grodin, there is no other duo in the genre that bounces off each other with the 100% joyful results we get here. They define the term dynamic duo. Director Martin Brest lets his actors do their thing, it is the sort of film where the cast are just happy to be working and use their talent to the max. Be it improv or visually acting in the back ground, both men are at one and in some chemistry zone. 

The score from Danny Elfman is like some hybrid Western wacky races fusion, but hell it works well. One of Elfman's best ever scores in fact. The dialogue is electric, some of the script is so sharp it should be put away in a sharps box and labelled up as to be opened whilst wearing gloves. The rest of the cast are uniformly brilliant, be it the wonderful John Ashton as rival bounty hunter Marvin, the menacing yet cheekily attired Dennis Farina as mob boss Jimmy Serrano, or Yaphet Kotto as the constantly irritated FBI agent Alonso Mosely, it's pretty much a flawless cast in optimum gear. 

The rating on the big movie sites, though high enough, is still a disgrace, I can only think that DeNiro fans really didn't want to see him doing a comedy? Well I say they are wrong! Because this film shows that the great man once had much to give the comedy/action splinter of film. Perhaps he just needed the perfect foil of Charles Grodin alongside him? Either way this film is smart, funny, even tender at times (I defy all to not be touched deeply during a daughter/father reunion).

It has no peers for an 80s action/comedy, with bags of action (Brest shows some great skills at action construction) to keep the pulses raised. A group of characters beautifully brought to life by a top draw cast, and a finale that gladdens the heart because it closes exactly the way it should, Midnight Run, my bias not withstanding, is a benchmark movie for its ilk.

Fistophobia for those that don't agree! 10/10 || ""Midnight Run"" has a generous measure of wonderfully executed action sequences and comedy that is genuinely funny, although there is an extremely high reliance upon swearing and this will undoubtedly offend and alienate the more sensitive souls sitting out there in the audience. This is also a hugely entertaining film which contains a number of memorable Robert De Niro moments - he is fascinating to watch during the scene where he visits his ex-wife Gail to borrow some money (this, in turn, leads to a spectacularly awkward encounter with his daughter which eventually ends in embarrassing silence) and again when he finally comes face to face with Jimmy Serrano, an unwelcome face from his past - and the many locations look absolutely gorgeous."

A shy doctor (Robin Williams) gets a job at a Bronx hospital in 1969 where he attends to several patients in a catatonic state after the encephalitis epidemic of 1917–28. He experiments with a new drug that offers the hope of reviving them. Robert De Niro plays his key patient, Julie Kavner his nurse and John Heard his supervisor. Penelope Ann Miller is also on hand as a potential romantic interest.

""Awakenings” (1990) is based on Oliver Sacks' 1973 memoir of the same name, which chronicled the true event that occurred the summer of ’69. Being a hospital movie about ailing people trying to recover puts it in the same camp as “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” (1975) and “Instinct” (1999), but it’s not as compelling. 

There’s just not enough human interest beyond the viewer being sympathetic toward the patients’ plight and wanting them to get well. It’s also marred by some blatant predictableness, like Leonard’s name on the bench and the “cup of coffee” aspect. Still, this is a tale that needed to be told and I’m not sorry I watched it. It’s just overrated.  

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, New York City.

There was always time to catch a movie, an it's a bit easier because it isn't as weather dependent as playing catch is.

My dad took me to see this when I was a kid, and I absolutely hated it, I thought it was a horrible movie.

And then, I watched it again when I was in high school and I absolutely loved it. Thought it was an amazing film.

And then I showed it to my wife, who pointed out that I was only 11 when dad took me to see it.

And now I can see how my attitude about this totally changed.

It is really the story about the Fisher King isn't it? At least it's a grail quest to restore the health to someone who kind of acts like a charitable king with the worst Percival character known to mankind.

And, I don't mean to cast shade on Jeff Bridges by that. He played a great role, the... well... I can't think of a polite word for his character. But we all know people a little like him don't we? He's a bit stereotyped of that friend that you also kind of hate, but he pulls it off absolutely brilliantly.

He's just, you know, not the pure Godly Percival that we know from the legends.

But then again, Williams isn't exactly the same dignified wounded king is he? He kind of comes across as a bit of a Leprechaun in this, and he is the most redeemed of any character in Arthurian Legends. He kind of out Percivals Percival in this...

.... but who cares? It's Terry Gilliam redoing the Fisher King, once more tackling a Grail Quest and it is all brought to you in a way that only Terry Gilliam can bring it to you...

... OK, yeah, it's Gilliam, so it could be a bit of a bias review.

At any rate, so long as you're not watching this in the theater with your dad when you are 11 you're going to enjoy the heck out of this film. And even if your dad does make you watch it when you are 11, give it a few years, watch it again, and I promise the second time around you will enjoy the heck out of it. || ""Jack Lucas"" (Jeff Bridges) is one of those late night radio presenters who loves the sound of his own voice and who enjoys nothing better than to put down, disdainfully, the collection of sad individuals who phone in with their problems. It's one of his casual off-the-cuff remarks that leads to a tragedy and a spiral that sends him into some serious doldrums. Things change for ever one night when he finds himself on the wrong end of a beating and then rescued by an eccentric looking fellow called ""Parry"" (Robin Williams). This is an erudite and complicated man who is obsessed with the ""Fisher King"" legend of the Holy Grail. Upon further investigation, ""Lucas"" learns more of the tragic cause of his new friend's predicament and as much as for his own salvation as for that of ""Parry"", he embarks on a task to find him meaning again. To that end he introduces him to the shy ""Lydia"" (Amanda Plummer) in the hope that this might help him find a new reason to live again. Things come full circle when ""Parry"" himself becomes a victim of the thugs and ""Lucas"" must strive to fulfil the quest and save something of both men. Whilst all of this chaos is bubbling away, it's down to ""Anna"" (Mercedes Ruehl) who is the former broadcaster's long-suffering girlfriend, to carefully tread on the eggshells of her relationship with him whilst quite temperamentally (and engagingly) trying to make sure she keeps him on as straight and narrow a path as possible. This is one of Bridges' better and more natural efforts and he works well with what I thought was an over-the-top performance from Williams to provide a film that is at times funny and at times quite poignant. The underlying mythology is quite effective at providing a modern day conduit for an ancient story of a hunt for the perfect in all of us and though it does take it's time, Bridges keeps it going."

""Places in the Heart"" (1984) belongs to the troubled farmer dramas that flooded the market in 1984. The others include “The River,” “Country” and “The Dollmaker.” I prefer this one over “The River” (which are the only two I’ve seen). It’s based on writer/director Robert Benton’s experiences growing up in the Waxahachie area, which is 30 minutes south of Dallas. The flick works up some quality human interest and would influence the soon-to-come “Mississippi Burning.”

Being a slice-of-life picture based on someone’s experiences in real-life, I appreciated the subplot featuring Lindsay Crouse, Ed Harris and Amy Madigan, which some people complain was superfluous. There’s an effective table scene & aftermath that was done even better in the later “Little Children.” 

Anyway, it comes in the tradition of great American dramas like “Of Mice and Men” and “The Great Santini.”

The movie runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in Ellis County, which is just south of Dallas in northeast Texas. Waxahachie is the town and Five Points is where the cotton gin is located.

End Of Days is directed by Peter Hyams and written by Andrew W. Marlowe. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger, Udo Kier & CCH Pounder.

It's the end of the Millennium and as 1999 draws to a close Satan (in human form played by Gabriel Byrne) is in town and looking for his bride. That bride is Christine York (Tunney), who 20 years earlier on her birthday had been chosen by Satanists to be the one for the spawning of the anti-Christ. Enter retired cop Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), a suicidal security expert whose family were murdered, and who after being hired to protect an every day business man finds himself in a battle with evil itself. It's not just the fate of poor Christine that's now in his hands, but that of mankind too.

Arnold versus The Devil, you couldn't make it up could you? Well actually ""they"" did, but hey, what's wrong with pitting modern cinema's action super star against man's ultimate enemy? The answer is nothing wrong with it at all; as long as the expectation level is set at brain left at the door for some mindless popcorn fun. Which when one sees the premise on offer is all one can surely expect to see. Surely? Budgeted at $100 million by Universal Studios, of which $25 million went on the Austrian Oak's salary, End Of Days, contrary to some beliefs, made over double that when all sales were factored in. However, it was still a poor return for such a big block-buster and Universal were most disappointed in the returns. As was Schwarzenegger himself, who was hoping to launch a big movie come back after a run of sub standard movies had seen his stock fall. Throw in the Razzie nominations for Schwarzenegger, Byrne (who was also up for Stigmata) and Hyams, and it doesn't make particularly inspiring reading.

It's all very ridiculous, the film not the statistics, but End Of Days is a whole bunch of explosive, bonkers, action based fun. The flaws are many, not least that the plot is actually an adventurous reworking of T2: Judgement Day (Arnie playing it on safe territory one feels). While giving the big man some character depth was never going to be a good move considering his-ahem-range. Yet the film finds him on particularly good muscular form, machine gunning, shooting rockets and facing off against Byrne's (having a great time and playing it as it should be played) snarly, sarcastic Old Nick adversary. Tunney (wolf whistle that body) bats the eyes and screams as befitting the role, Pollak deserves better but runs with it in his usual dry dulcet way, while the wonderful Miriam Margolyes gets to kick Arnie's butt! Yes it's that kind of movie folks.

With dashes of grue and explosions aplenty it was never about trying to win awards. If ever a film does exactly what it says on the tin then this is it. Arnie V Satan, it is what it is, relax and enjoy. 7/10 || **_Solid action/horror with Arnie_**

The devil (Gabriel Byrne) comes to New York City to impregnate a chosen female (Robin Tunney) during the last hour of the second millennium to bring about the end of the world. The hope of humanity falls on an atheist ex-cop, Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), and his partner (Kevin Pollak). Rod Steiger is also on hand as a no-nonsense Catholic priest.

""End of Days"" (1999) is a comic book action flick with horror/fantasy elements. It's not meant to be an accurate depiction of biblical eschatology. As such, it's useless to pick it apart on those grounds; just go with it and enjoy the ride. That said, there are some real-life subtexts and accurate biblical aspects. For instance, disillusionment due to the unjust death of a loved one (or any number of other tragedies) happens all the time.

The movie is R-rated not just for the violence and cussing, but because the filmmakers try to convey the devil's filthy lawlessness, like a threesome with a mother & daughter in a brief dream sequence (which may be ""reality,"" but it's hard to tell). Byrne has fun with the role of Satan.

As a holiday action blockbuster with Schwarzenegger ""End of Days"" delivers the requisite thrills where there's a massive explosion about every 12 minutes. These types of movies only work if the story and the characters pull you into their world and the film accomplishes this just enough.

It's no where near as good as the first two Terminator flicks, but it's close to being on par with the third one. Of course, ""End of Days"" is its own animal due to the apocalyptic, religious subject matter. On that note, the palette the filmmakers use is fittingly dark. The entire film takes place at night, mostly in the urban labyrinths of Gotham with additional sequences in Gothic churches, shadowy subterranean rooms and eerie woods.

The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute, and was shot in New York City and the Los Angeles area.

Over the years, I've known many, many, many people, and seen a great number more online, who are of the opinion that this second entry is not only better than its predecessor, but that it went on to stay the best film in the (now 4 movie strong) series. I always sorta figured, that when I grew up and rewatched it, I'd reach the same conclusion, so, uh, nope. Basically. That never happened. _Toy Story 2_ is pretty good, but nothing on the original.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || One of the greatest sequels around. <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>, whilst marginally inferior, still manages to create the same magic that the original has - which is mightily impressive.

It, at least to me, has less humour but what it loses there it makes up for in the premise, which is arguably more interesting when compared to the 1995 film. I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.

Tom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.

There are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.

The other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently. || Now that ""Woody"" and ""Buzz"" have well and truly buried the hatchet - and not in each other, they both hope owner ""Andy"" will take them to his summer camp with him. Sadly, though, ""Woody"" has hurt his arm - so is left behind, only to narrowly escape being sold in a car boot sale. Worryingly, though, he is spotted there by toy museum owner ""McWiggin"" and is promptly kidnapped! It now falls to ""Buzz"", ""Mr Potato Head"" and the rest of the gang to track him down and spring him, with his new friend ""Jessie"" before they are sold to a collector in Japan. Not all of the toys are on board though - and poor old ""Woody"" has to be wary of the double-dealing ""Prespector"" whilst ""Buzz"" finds that, unlike his abducted friend, he is not exactly unique! There are now plenty of fun escapades for all concerned to keep this high quality animation entertaining. That said, I don't really do sentimentality, and I found this to be a little more so than the first one. The introduction of ""Jessie"" accompanied by the rather sad story of her abandonment (set to an equally sad song) did drag the pace down a bit for me, but when the action kicks in again, then we revert to a first-rate, team-driven and wittily written tale of camaraderie, loyalty and ingenuity. Messrs. Hanks, Allen and Rickles keep up their established good work, this time joined by Joan Cusack and an on form Kelsey Grammer as ""Prospector"". It could be argued that the first ""Toy Story"" film was a marketing man's wet dream; this second feature is very nearly as good and demonstrates the enduring and engaging nature of the characters who value each other above all. Rare for a sequel to rival the original, but this gives it a good try!"
22267.0,Ride with the Devil,"Ride with the Devil follows four people who are fighting for truth and justice amidst the turmoil of the American Civil War. Director Ang Lee takes us to a no man's land on the Missouri/Kansas border where a staunch loyalist, an immigrant's son, a freed slave, and a young widow form an unlikely friendship as they learn how to survive in an uncertain time. In a place without rules and redefine the meaning of bravery and honor.","In a No-man's Land between North and South, You didn't fight for the Blue or the Grey... You fought for your friends and family.","Drama, War, Romance, Western",138,1999-11-24,en,6.351,194,0.9983,"Skeet Ulrich, Tobey Maguire, Jewel, Jeffrey Wright, Simon Baker",Ang Lee,"civil war, friends, bush whacker, raid, american civil war","I'd be bad meat – pretty well rotted to a glob.

Ride with the Devil is directed by Ang Lee and adapted to screenplay by James Schamus (also producer) from the novel ""Woe to Live On"" written by Daniel Woodrell. It stars Tobey Maguire, Skeet Ulrich, Jeffrey Wright, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Simon Baker, James Caviezel and Jewel. Music is by Mychael Danna and cinematography by Frederick Elmes.

""On the Western Frontier of Missouri, the American Civil War was fought not by armies, but by neighbours. Informal gangs of local Southern Bushwhackers fought a bloody and desperate Guerrilla war against the occupying Union Army and pro-Union Jayhawkers. Allegiance to either side was dangerous. But it was more dangerous still to find oneself caught in the middle""

Made for $38 million and intended to be a sweeping epic for the summer blockbuster crowd, Ride with the Devil was a considerable financial flop. With a limited release both in America and abroad, the financial figures are hardly surprising. More so considering it was given next to no promotion by the distributors. Factor in a little controversy about the events featured in the story, some cuts made by the studio (Lee didn't have final cut) and a delay in home release formats because the distributor incredibly wanted Jeffrey Wright's presence removed from the cover art! Well you would be forgiven for thinking that the film has to be something of a stinker. Not so say I.

Part rites of passage drama, part reflective war movie, Ang Lee's film is a grand film viewing experience. Dealing as it does with the often forgotten part of the war down on the Missouri/Kansas border, where Lee also shoots on location, film manages to be both savage and lyrical in equal measure. The savagery comes with the fights, bloody, frenetic and high on potency, while the lyricism comes with the human relationships, internal conflicts and the political awareness of the men (boys) fighting for their cause. All given deft treatment by Schamus, whose screenplay contains crisp period dialogue and a narrative correctly showing that this part of the war was not just driven by racist Dixie's hell bent on revenge, violent lust and political allegiance, but often for family, land and rights. Picture is at pains to let us know the youth of the main characters, ramming home the point of boys forced to become men, killing machines, very quickly. Case in point, the culmination of the violence in the film that comes by way of the Lawrence Massacre, a tragic and upsetting slaughter that saw 180 people murdered under the leadership of a vengeful William Quantrill (John Ales). Lee and Schamus aren't interested in showing heroism in this particular war, they show it as futile, nasty and it leaves the taste of bile in the throat.

From here the film slows considerably, as the lead characters withdraw from the action of war, to awakenings and friendships forming. It's here where Lee is at his best. No great director of action, as evidenced by the previously mentioned Lawrence Massacre; which lacks the cutting edge to really grab us by the throat and never let go, but for human interest aspects and bucolic scenes with characters framed within, Lee owes film fans absolutely nothing. The latter of which he is aided considerably by Elmes' widescreen photography. Ulrich and pop star Jewel nicely handle their parts, he puts a confident swagger into Jack Bull Chiles, she is tender and unassuming in the pivotal female role of Sue Lee Shelley. Caviezel gives Black John Ambrose a brooding menace, while Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is on overdrive as sadistic loony Pitt Mackeson. But it's with Maguire and Wright that the acting plaudits go. Maguire has arguably never been better, he gives Jake Roedel an effective sensitivity as a virginal boy receives a violent initiation into manhood. Wright is sublime, said to be one of his favourite performances, Wright as freed slave Daniel Holt is the heart beat of the film. Conveying most of the good traits available to man, Holt fights not just out of loyalty to his friend George Clyde (Baker), but to gain ultimate catharsis in is life. It's a beautiful measured turn from Wright, and it deserves more appreciative attention. 

The last third of it may be too talky for some, and a couple of dangling narrative threads left unanswered stop it from being a masterpiece. But it's close to being just that, a savage, beautiful and lyrical movie. The stupid studio execs had no idea: Putz's. 9/10 || _**Southern guerrillas along the Missouri/Kansas border**_

Released in 1999, ""Ride with the Devil"" is a Civil War tale focusing on Southern guerrilla fighters known as Bushwhackers, mostly young men who stage daring raids on Union forces and communities along the Missouri/Kansas border. The story includes Quantrill's infamous 1863 raid on Lawrence, Kansas, which his men burned & pillaged, murdering over 150 unarmed men, women and children.

The story shines the spotlight on the son of a German immigrant (Tobey Maguire), a beautiful woman (Jewel) and an ex-slave (Jeffrey Wright), all of whom take up the Southern cause. I enjoyed how Tobey and Wright slowly develop a close friendship, as well as Wright's growing sense of freedom as the story progresses. Jewel makes an impressive acting debut and should do more films, she's a natural.

One reviewer erroneously stated that the film ran 3 hours so I was surprised when the credits started rolling at the 2 hour and 13 minute mark. In fact, I was disappointed because I wanted the story to continue; this is a sign of a good film. The story takes its time and gradually pulls you in.

Before viewing ""Ride with the Devil"" I caught the new Indiana Jones flick ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" The contrast couldn't be more different -- ""Crystal Skull"" is essentially a 2-hour Road Runner cartoon, whereas ""Ride"" is a realistic drama/Western. Although I enjoyed ""Crystal Skull"" for what it is, it can't be taken seriously for even a second, not to mention they overdid it with the over-the-top action and fake CGI location enhancements & props (cliffs, waterfalls, jungles, monkeys, etc.). ""Ride with the Devil"" is the perfect antidote to such loony-toon drivel. It's totally realistic and takes its time so you get to know the characters and FEEL their experiences. For instance, what's it like spending the entire Winter in a dugout hut in the woods with three other guys and the only highlight is some cute blonde stopping by to drop off food? What's it like when you have no other recourse but to saw a buddy's arm off? What's it like when a blood-thirsty ""comrade"" tries to kill you during battle? What do you do when you run into him two years later and you're not sure what his intentions are?

The film was shot in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas where the conflicts actually took place. Authentic locations are vital to this viewer or, at least, authentic-looking locations (for instance, ""Cold Mountain"" was shot in Romania, but the locations LOOK like western North Carolina). After all, how are we to accept the film's visualization of history if it wasn't shot where the actual events occurred or at locations that at least _resemble_ the actual ones?.

I encourage you to view the film with the subtitles on as the language is sometimes hard to understand due to accents and archaic phrasing; this will help you follow what's going on and who's who.

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""Ride with the Devil"" is reminiscent in quality & style of films like ""Cold Mountain,"" ""Pharoah's Army"" and ""The Long Riders."" If you appreciate those films you'll enjoy ""Ride."" It's leagues better than the generally aloof and soporific ""Gettysburg."" It's a class 'A' picture which brings to life Quantrill's raid on Lawrence, Kansas, including what leads up to it and what follows -- how can you go wrong?

A young woman from Sydney (Kate Winslet) becomes a follower of a guru in Delhi, so her family hires a top deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel) to liberate her from the cult’s brainwashing, which is carried out at an isolated cabin in the Outback.

""Holy Smoke"" (1999) is similar to “The Piano” from six years prior (also starring Keitel), which isn’t surprising since it was made by the same writer/director. Both are adult-oriented drama/romances, but this one is set in the modern day and is just as much a quirky comedy.

There are numerous highlights, including the charisma of the two stars, Kate’s voluptuousness (she was 22 during shooting, almost 23), the breathtaking scenery, the humor in which every Australian is goofy or eccentric, the beauty of Sophie Lee (Yvonne), insights on male/female relationships and the power of a beautiful woman.

Unfortunately, I found the last act tedious; it needed reworked to make it more compelling. Also, are we to seriously believe that the woman from the first act, who swoons over a charismatic cult-leader in a patriarchal society, is the same one in the last act? _Why Sure!_

Lastly, the film flirts with interesting commentary on serious cult indoctrination, such as the Manson family, Koresh’s Branch Davidians and Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple, yet discards it for: Cult brainwashing, what cult brainwashing? I suppose the Campion sisters were shooting for amusing irony. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in Sydney, Australia, and 1000 miles west in Hawker, Finders Ranges (the Outback scenes), which is located in southeast South Australia. The Indian sequences were done in New Delhi and Pushkar in north-central India.

Director Woody Allen has a penchant for this style of music, and as faux-homages go this isn't at all bad.

It's a great looking film with plenty of attention to detail, and it does work well at illustrating just how important it is for people to have decent anchors in their lives.

""Boeldieu"" forms an unlikely, respectful relationship with the Commandant - Erich von Stroheim; a fellow aristocrat who feels himself a failure for ending up as a glorified jailor rather than fighting gallantly on the battlefield. On a basic level, it is really quite routine; and the ending almost incidental: what makes this distinctive is the way the story interweaves the decline of a centuries old class system; the chivalric honour between opponents being a thing of the past. This is very much about ""Egalité"" and ""Fraternité"" in order to secure ""Liberté"" and is told in as sympathetic a fashion as it is possible given the gritty peril of their circumstances. Gabin and von Stroheim are particularly effective as is Joseph Kosma's score and the tightly focussed direction on just a few central characters really does give this a sense of purpose."

I loved _Chinatown_ and was very curious to see this film, notoriously less famous and less recognized. I was curious to see to what extent this would be a consequence of the widespread ill-fame that hangs, more or less justifiably, over the sequels of good films. What I can now say, after having seen it, is that I can understand why it has fallen into a certain oblivion: in fact, it is not a very interesting film, and it is very far from having the quality that we found in _Chinatown_, even if he tries to do it and manages to have a certain merit. Honestly, there are far worse sequels out there, and this movie still has its value.

This time, the director's chair fell into Jack Nicholson's hands. The actor was committed to this project in a very deep and personal way from the beginning, and if this film came to fruition, it is entirely his credit: he was the one who unlocked the necessary funding and ended up agreeing to direct the film when no other director wanted it, and when it was already impossible for Roman Polanski, for legal reasons, to travel to the USA in order to do so. He believed in the project, even eleven years after the initial film, and that is always commendable. The film tries everything it can, but it was very poorly received by critics and the box office was extremely adverse to it.

The script is, in part, the source of the problem, with a creative, engaging and original story that, however, has several strange twists and moments where we don't understand the attitudes of the characters. It all starts when detective J.J. Gittes is hired by a rich man, Jake Berman, to keep an eye on his wife and catch her in adultery. However, at the moment, Berman kills his wife's lover. It turns out that the lover is the partner with whom he had a real estate company, and the act of adultery was then virtually the only situation in which Californian law allowed for forgiving a murder. Gittes is thus convinced that he has been used and that Berman has instructed his wife to seduce his partner in order to kill him and, by law, take his share of the company. Gittes decides to investigate the matter further and discovers that the real estate's land may be more valuable and that it was owned by someone he had sworn, in the past, to protect.

The film brings together a cast of heavyweights. In addition to a powerful and committed performance by Jack Nicholson, in the lead role, the film also has an excellent collaboration by Harvey Keitel. Also, Meg Tilly and Madeleine Stowe, the two main actresses, are excellent and leave us a mature and very well done work. However, the rest of the actors do not stand out and almost do not appear.

Technically, the film seeks to closely follow the style and look of “Chinatown”, recreating in a way the neo-noir style that this film has acquired. It doesn't do it so happily, there's the notion that this is a copy, and the cinematography works in a less happy and less elaborate way, with less present play of light and a sepia color that doesn't look exquisite and pretty, rather faded. The film was happy in the way it recreated the mannerisms, attire and sets of 1948, and the choice of automobiles was particularly successful. There are several sound and visual effects that work well, but it's all brought down by clumsy editing and the clumsy way in which the story is told, and the scenes are put together. || I kept looking out for Anne Bancroft, or - indeed anyone who could inject a little class into this really rather dreary vehicle for Jack Nicholson. Reprising his ""Gittes"" role from ""Chinatown"" (1974) he finds himself embroiled in a murder mystery that leaves him unsure who he can trust as he tries to get to the truth and stay alive! Yes, that's the gist - hardly novel, is it? What could have helped it would have been better writing and a more compelling contribution from the star. As it is, he is going through the motions - accompanied by a pretty lacklustre voice-over narrative - as the well-travelled noir-esque plot gradually unfolds - and I do mean ""gradually""! Nicholson directed this plodder too, and perhaps that also explains why this is such a dud. Nobody was taking an objective view of what we were seeing, the pace at which the story was developing and the sheer predictability of it all. He has assembled a sturdy cast - Harvey Keitel and Eli Wallach amongst them, but they have precious little to work with beyond the stereotypical roles we would expect - there is virtually no character depth or development here at all! Simply, it is nobody's finest work and a very pale imitation of the first outing for this grizzly PI. It does look good, but I reckon it's only just about fine for the television on a wet winter's evening."

I actually like Rob Schneider a bit, and the guy can certainly act, but it's like he got he's talent from a Monkey's Paw, there is usually some draw back.  In this, it's where the movie systematically makes fun of people from anger management issues, to serious conditions, to amputees, and all of them lonely and possibly desperate, so it's extra sad.

Yes, it's the premise of the movie that he's an unexpected gigolo with unexpected clients, but I'm not sure anyone was asking for this movie.

All that aside, this is a alternating abuse humor / ridiculous escalation humor, and a lot of the movie is just Rob being exasperated with his own script.  To top it off, it feels like there is one story line too many with the cop investigating him.  The angry gigolo with WAY too many expensive things that he mistreats is plenty of antagonist.

They definitely put the work in on the production side though, even incorporating a couple of matrix references that probably cost far more than warranted for the movie.

The head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression (Tom Hanks) observes a new inmate, a black man named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. He and his fellow guards become intrigued by the gentle giant and conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. Who, then, is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.

""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not), DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; it's by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.

Running 3-hours, it's over my limited attention span, and yet it's somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. It's character/dialogue driven, unique and unpredictable. Don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is a powerful supernatural mystery/drama.

**SPOILER ALERT** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey)

John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. Actually, John is a type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1) His initials are JC. (2) He's good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3) He miraculously heals people. (4) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles.""

**End SPOILER ALERT**

Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. || ""Edgecomb"" (Tom Hanks) is in charge of the prison officers who tend to the inmates on death row. He's a decent man who, with the help of his partner ""Howell"" (David Morse) tries to carry out his task as humanely as possible. Their team also numbers the truly odious ""Percy"" (Doug Hutchinson). He's an incompetent coward, but he also happens to be the nephew of the state governor, so tends to get away with his obnoxiousness towards the prisoners. That nasty behaviour becomes more pronounced when the giant ""Coffey"" (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives. Also newly arrived is a small mouse which befriends, much to the chagrin of ""Percy"", a fellow inmate (Harry Dean Stanton) and oddly enough it seems to help keep the peace as people come and go. Things take quite an intriguing turn when some physical contact between their gentle giant and ""Edgecomb"" seems to cure his liver complaint. As the officer realises that this man may well possess healing hands, he and his team begins to bond with him. Meantime, the ghastly little ""Percy"" screws up his first execution causing an effect straight out of a Wes Craven film and Sam Rockwell's psychopathic ""Wild Bill"" arrives to liven things up. It's actually Rockwell who steal this for me. His performance is viscerally effective and he really does commit to the role. It's over 3 hours long but the acting is almost perfect as these characters develop and the story unfolds reconciling the brutality of racism, crime and punishment with the attempts at humanity and decency applied by virtually everyone whose lives are touched by these scenarios - even amongst the staff who struggle at times to keep their own priorities in kilter. One of Stephen King's much better stories with depth to the personas, a good baddie to loathe and a message of redemption delivered subtly but powerfully. || Great acting by everyone involved, but the story is just not my cup of tea. If you like fake miracles (no shortage of people that do) and fantasy storylines, like prison guards that are humane and empathic (on death row nonetheless), then you might enjoy this more.

1715.0,The Cider House Rules,"Homer is an orphan who was never adopted, becoming the favorite of orphanage director Dr. Larch. Dr. Larch imparts his full medical knowledge on Homer, who becomes a skilled, albeit unlicensed, physician. But Homer yearns for a self-chosen life outside the orphanage. What will Homer learn about life and love in the cider house? What of the destiny that Dr. Larch has planned for him?",A story about how far we must travel to find the place where we belong.,Drama,126,1999-12-17,en,7.074,1210,2.0089,"Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, Michael Caine",Lasse Hallström,"based on novel or book, orphanage, pregnancy, drug addiction, cigarette, cider, maine, orphan, incest, drug overdose, war injury, apple cider, anesthetic, incinerator, picking apples, 1940s, abortion, abortionist","Beauty and the beast in Maine during WWII

On the surface “The Cider House Rules” (1999) is a quality period piece about life at an apple orchard and orphanage in Maine during WWII. Tobey Maguire stars as Homer Wells, who was raised at a remote orphanage and favored by caretaker Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who imparts his vast medical knowledge & skills to the young man. At the age of 21 Homer decides to leave the orphanage with a couple that stopped by for an illegal abortion and ends up working at an apple orchard. Will he ever return?

It's the subtext where the film soars for those interested in ruminations on the complexities of morality and the place that outward or inward rules play.

Here's a taste: The movie contrasts outer rules with innate moral rules. The former can be broken as it suits the individual without any ill-effects, like the cider house rules in the film or stepping over the wall at Niagara Falls to get a better picture; innate moral rules, however, cannot be broken without severe consequences. To illustrate, the apple workers rightly mock the cider house rules made by people who don't know what it's like to live & work there, but one laborer breaks a universal spiritual law and so loses a close relationship and something worse, which conveys the idea that ""the wages of sin is death.""

Another example involves the rules of society demanding that a person have proper credentials in order to do the work Dr. Larch performs, and understandably so, but official credentials on a wall are irrelevant in regards to some people, like Homer, who's thoroughly expert at his craft, credentials or no credentials. And so Larch creates fake ""proper"" credentials to appease officials and patients.

Also, Wally & Candy (Paul Rudd & Charlize Theron) impulsively have an illegal abortion at the beginning of the movie but, by the end, it doesn't look like they're going to have very wild sex anymore (which is different than saying they won't have any sexual relations). They no doubt strongly regret deciding to break the rules and have an abortion, which was illegal at the time.

Obviously the movie's not far Left or far Right; it's somewhere in the middle in its realistic reflections on moral complexities and ambiguities. Both sides of the abortion debate, for instance, are presented. And, while it could be argued that the movie somewhat supports the pro-choice position, it doesn’t neglect to convey the conservative view and effectively shows how the debate is more complex than black or white. For example, if a man forces his self on a woman and she gets pregnant, the life within her is not there by her choice and therefore she arguably has the right to abort that life with the blood of the child being on the head of the impregnating male.

Elsewhere, Homer argues the conservative position, suggesting that people should be responsible enough to control themselves BEFORE a woman is impregnated and the ugly issue of abortion rears its head. Dr. Larch later remarks that he wishes the world were as idealistic as Homer sees it, but instead we’re stuck with an intricately phukked up planet where people make wrong choices all the time, which have a negative domino effect.

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in Northampton, Massachusetts (orphanage); Dummerston, Vermont (orchard); Bernard, Corea and Sand Beach, Maine; as well as surrounding New England locations.

Tim Roth dons the directing hat for the first time and brings to the screen a shattering tale of incest and child abuse.

The son, Tom, is unhappy and feels alienated in the new surroundings, but when he discovers a dark family secret, things become much much worse.

It's an uncomfortable viewing experience at times, making it a film you don't readily recommend, but Roth's approach to the story gives out a powerful message without exploitation or sermonising. The script is deliberately taut and sparse, while the marrying up of the crashing waves and jagged rocks of the locale with the emotional turmoil is a deft piece of directing. The use of newcomers Belmont and Cunliffe add a potent sense of realism to the whole thing, aided no end by an intelligent screenplay that doesn't go for conventionality.

Nothing much has changed…","Drama, Romance",119,1971-10-03,en,7.62,721,1.3951,"Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn",Peter Bogdanovich,"small town, new love, based on novel or book, texas, graduation, high school graduation, billiard hall, graduation present, elopement, 1950s, thoughtful","***Bleak, trashy B&W drama of life in a fading Texas town in the early 50s with several strong points*** 

Released in 1971, “The Last Picture Show” is a B&W drama of several teens and adults in a dying Texas town on the windy plains in 1951. Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd play the main high shoolers while Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn appear as the adults. Randy Quaid and Clu Gulager have peripheral roles.

Sam the Lion (Johnson) is the minor mogul of the town, the father figure of several of the boys, who are fatherless in practice, if not reality. Despite wallowing in a dreary pall (which ties-in to the theme), the movie conveys many insights about real life and has some genuine warmth. A couple good examples are when Sam looks at Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Bridges) before they leave for a wild weekend in Mexico or the final scene between Sonny and the coach’s wife (Leachman); Sam’s reflections at “the tank” is another. Furthermore, I respect a movie that has the confidence to take its time without feeling the need to rush to the thrills and titillations.

“The Last Picture Show” is slightly infamous for its sleaze quotient, but it’s interesting what little sex actually goes on in the story; and the quality of some of that sex is dubious, e.g. Duane (Bridges) and Jacy (Cybill). As far as the nude pool party in Wichita Falls goes, it seems that these kids were older than Jacy, except for the little brother swimming in the pool and Lester (Quaid). I'm assuming they were college age; in other words, about 1-4 years older. Regardless, they were the offspring of rich libertines from the Big Oil business in Wichita Falls. Jacy was a rich girl from backwater Nowheresville and wanted to fit in with these bigger city kids.

Regarding the realism of the nude swimming, the story takes place in 1951; a mere 18 years later teens were publicly skinny dipping in Woodstock, NY, which is documented in the film of the same name. Do we seriously think a few teens weren't doing the same thing a mere 18 years earlier? For comparison, it's 2018 as of this writing. Do we really think teens today are all that different than teens 18 years ago in 2000? Besides, teens on the wild side were skinny dipping in the 1800s, 1700s, 1600s, etc.

At the end of the day, this is a decent adult-oriented drama about the kinetic experimentations & aspirations of youths in the early 50s juxtaposed with the sometimes sad reflections & practices of the adults.

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes and was shot in Archer City, Texas, as well as nearby Olney, Holliday and Wichita Falls.

GRADE: B || I must have watched this movie a few years after it came out, but I had no specific memory of it, no feeling of deja vu of having seen a scene before. It is a good film in many ways, certainly achieving its apparent goal of portraying a bleak landscape of a dying town.

The dialogue, which I notice since I write novels that feature a lot of dialogue, is excellent, just what you expect from Larry McMurtry. The acting is solid, though a little dreamy and perhaps overdone in places. I like how the camera focuses on faces at times even when nothing is being said.

Because there are so many young men and women characters, there is a lot of sex and obsession about sex. That is the intended audience, I imagine, the young and young at heart. 

I liked the imagery I saw in the life blood of a town symbolically blowing away gradually in the ever-present wind. For that reason I wish there had been a tad less sex and more of a focus on the social aspects of a town fading away, taking the dreams of the young with it. But I suppose that would be a different film aimed at a different audience. || ""Sonny"" (Timothy Bottoms) and ""Duane"" (Jeff Bridges) are best pals in a remote Texan town that offers them little by way of prospects. They both vie for the love interest of ""Jacy"" (Cybill Shepherd) although she is supposed to be dating ""Duane"". She comes from the family that passes for wealth in ""Anarene"" and her mother (Ellen Burstyn) has essentially told her to keep her options open and see which, from an extremely limited gene pool, might offer her the best prospects. For most of their lives, ""Sam"" (Ben Johnson), himself a symbol of a bygone era, was a sort of father figure and his death leaves them in charge of the town's entertainment - a dilapidated bar/pool hall/cinema that's just about as run down as the town itself. Do they stay and run it together? Will one or both decide that the future lies elsewhere? With their graduation and the draft looming, their collective hormones racing and rivalries becoming rife, the whole town starts to feel the strains of their predicament. I kept expecting Marlon Brando to appear here as the monochrome photography and the 1950s style of the production deliver quite a potent coming-of-age drama that's distinctly lacking in sentiment. It's also one of the first examples I recall of nudity occurring freely in an American-made film. Sometime that is overtly sexual, but it also features more naturally too as they come to terms with their own bodies and discover some stimulating peccadilloes along the way. Bottoms and Bridges rather effectively epitomise the hopelessness of life in these dead-end towns and Larry McMurty's screenplay offers us some honest and pithy dialogue to contextualise the behaviour that we can readily see amidst a community that is bursting at the seam for something, anything, out of the ordinary to finally happen. In the end, though, the plaudits have to go to Shepherd whose character treads a fine line between curious and manipulative as well as coming to terms with her own sexuality and whom she portrays really quite plausibly. I didn't love the denouement, it felt a little unnecessary to me but as an illustration of life for some many young, horny and exasperated this is a really good watch."

Captain Sindbad and his crew land on the island Colossa and come under attack from a Cyclops. Aided by the magician Sokurah and his magic lamp, they manage to escape back on board with their lives intact. However, the lamp which contains a helpful genie, is left behind in the Cyclops' hands. Once back in Bagdad, Sokurah sets about getting a crew together to reclaim the lamp off of Colossa, but the chiefs of Bagdad refuse to sanction such action. After failing to impress all with his magic tricks, Sokurah shrinks the princess of Bagdad to the size of a hand, then craftily offers to restore the princess to normal the next day. Only trouble being that the ingredients needed for the cure are of course on Colossa. So Sinbad and his men, and the dastardly magician, set sail for an adventure that is fraught with danger... 

Stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen, for his first film in colour, delves into the mythical legend of Sinbad The Sailor. Thus, along with director Nathan Juran, putting life into the Sinbad legacy that had been viewed as a no go area after less than favourable responses to prior attempts at the legend. Though not adhering to the Persian fable source, the 7th Voyage was nothing like this one and The Rocs for instance actually appear in the 5th voyage fable, Juran and Harryhausen turn the merchant seaman of the origin into a dashing hero figure. Someone that children and adults of both sexes can easily get on side with. 

Visually it's a treat, admire as Sinbad (in the form of a handsome sword swashing Kerwin Matthews) does battle with Cyclops', Rocs and a Harryhausen calling card, the Skeleton. Throw in a fire breathing Dragon, a genie of the lamp, a pretty princess (Kathryn Grant) and a devilishly creepy magician villain (the always great value Torin Thatcher) and the result is unadulterated joy. Some churlish folk will point to being able to see the lines between the real footage and Harryhausen's marvellous creatures, but quite frankly those people should be rounded up and sent to live on Colossa with all the other monsters. For to not appreciate the craft and genius on offer here is as sad as it is foolish. And with master composer Bernard Herrmann laying a brisk mystical flecked score over proceedings, it's a treat for the ears as well. 

When you consider the budget afforded this production, it's high quality film making, and it's now, along with the two sequels that followed it, still being enjoyed by those of us who remember before computers controlled such magical things. 8/10 || I really enjoyed this film as a kid - and that's because, like in so many of these Sinbad films, the visual effects from Ray Harryhausen are great and here Torin Thatcher's efforts as the malevolent and scheming ""Sokurah"" work really well too. Kerwin Matthews does fine as the hero, hoping to be married to the princess ""Parisa"" (Kathryn Grant) until they run into the aforementioned magician whom they rescue from an island. Thing is, he really wants to get back there armed with a mighty crossbow. ""Sinbad"" is, however, completely loved up and has no intention of returning once they reach Baghdad, so the evil one conjures up a spell that turns the princess into something a little more diminutive. You help me get back to my island and I'll restore ""Parisa"" from bite size. With caliphs and their armies ready to start a war over their predicament, ""Sinbad"" is left with no choice than to trust the plotting sorcerer - and yep, betrayal looms large. What's all the fuss about? Why does he want to get back so urgently? Well - that's down to the kindly but all-powerful genie (Richard Eyer) who must obey the person who says the magic words. Can our intrepid sailor fend off his foe, restore his love and make it back against giant rocks (birds), a cyclops and a great big dragon? Well no, jeopardy isn't really the point here - but the hand-crafted, stop-motion, animation shows off well what a creative man Harryhausen was and with Nathan Juran keeping the pace rollicking along we can easily overlook the rather wooden efforts of the couple and the unremarkable writing. I love this genre of cinema, swash and buckle and action all the way - and this is a good example, well worth ninety minutes."

Watching this film is like listening to a fairy tale, or a fable, set in our days. It's the best way I've found to describe it. What we have is a family that decides to adopt a little white mouse, orphaned, after a visit to an orphanage, and that will count on the hostility of the house cat, unhappy that it now has a mouse as its owner.

I saw the movie when I was a kid, at the cinema, and I really liked it. Now, more than twenty years later, I decided to see him again as the adult person that I am and I had a slightly different feeling. The film is extremely simple, Rob Minkoff's direction managed to understand the sweetness and simple effectiveness of the work he had in hand, but was not able to moderate the sugar. That is, we feel, several times during the film, that there is an excess of sweetness, and this makes the adult audience feel like they are too much in the room. I felt it now and that was the big problem with the film for me, a problem that most kids will have ignored without much difficulty.

If little Stuart is a truly adorable character, the same may not be consensual when we think of his adoptive family. The characters weren't as well developed as they could have been, even considering it's a movie for children and young people. Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie do a very good job as the parents and Jonathan Lipnicki is not far behind, lending his character a welcome authenticity. Even so, there remains the question of what the actors could have done with better material in their hands. The work of the voice actors is quite good. Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane deserve full attention in this department.

On a technical level, I think we really have to highlight all the CGI animation involving the animals and their attitudes on a positive note. The effects are also very well done and you can see that there is some financial investment in the film. Of course, a small, almost toy house in the middle of Central Park, one of the most expensive plots of land imaginable, is hard to believe, but that's a detail. The very familiar-looking sets and costumes, hinting at the 50s a bit, were also a nice addition, and the soundtrack does a smart job."

At times, it's as if I was watching through a thick pane of glass looking at something that has very little real about it. A fairy tale, almost. The film does present us with a glimpse of the almost feudal system that still prevailed in Czar Alexander's vast and contrasting Russia, with millions of people living in twig-built lean-tos whilst the brightly coloured palaces offered the wealthy and privileged an altogether different life, and it was good to see a few brief appearances from Irene Worth (""Princess Alina"") but I felt by the end just as uninvolved in these characterisations as ""Onegin"" had been at the start.

I mean, the closest thing that came to it was American Beauty, and we had only seen that a few months prior... and that had more of a plot.

At the time, I'll admit, I thought it was pretty good.... and then I returned to it and now, honestly, I just think it's pretentious.

Pretentious really is the best way to describe it. When you first see it, it hits you one way because it's an odd movie that you really haven't seen before.

Simpatico is directed by Matthew Warchus and Warchus co-adapts the screenplay with David Nicholls from the play written by Sam Shepard. It stars Nick Nolte, Jeff Bridges, Sharon Stone, Catharine Keener and Albert Finney. Music is by Stewart Copeland and cinematography is by John Toll.

Three young confidence tricksters have orchestrated a horse racing scam tat is making them big money. However, when the scam is unearthed by a top official they set him up for blackmail and make off into the sun. Twenty years later the three of them are brought together by circumstance and the time of emotional reckoning…
It was met with disdain by critics and film goers alike, and even now some 20 years after it was first released it holds below average ratings on the main internet film sites. Is this fair? Does it at the least deserve to be revisited and re-evaluated on its neo-noir character driven terms? Well sort of…

Off the bat it deserves better scores than those afforded it on line purely for the acting alone, this is a high grade group of actors breathing life into damaged characters. Very much a talky character driven piece (stage origins boom out from the off), the screenplay does have a deft potency about it, dealing as it does about shame and guilt and the foundation of success built out of financial gain, with the kicker being the long term repercussions of youthful criminality. Dialogue is often sparky (helps being delivered by those fine actors of course), Toll’s cinematography around the Kentucky locales is beautiful, and come the final resolutions to the main characters journey we get a huge emotionally metaphorical whack.

However, there’s an overuse of the flashback structure to show us the principals in their younger scamming – life altering – days (played by Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Shawn Hatosy and Liam Waite). Annoyingly there’s also the puzzling question hanging over the play as to if this is a simple life story of errors never mended – of cheats prospering only to fall at the later in life hurdle? Or is this attempting to be a complex study of the human condition? Maybe even giving us a stark warning, a message piece if you will. Of course, maybe that’s Shepard’s thing? to not have definite answers? Either way it’s a little frustrating to not have an absolute with such a strong character piece. 

It’s hardly a must see recommended picture, that’s for sure, in fact Warchus’ first time direction away from the actors is uncomfortably staid. Yet there’s some nice craft here, and a tantalising “more than meets the eye” question mark that keeps you interested if you be so inclined to stick with it. Infertile or interesting? 6/10"

A few of his films are on my list of favorite films out there, but sadly this effort did not threaten to crack that list. Not that I didn’t enjoy it overall. It was entertaining and fun, though it hovered on minor scenes sometimes on its way to lasting two hours and forty minutes. And it was interesting to see how the Gilbert and Sullivan characters worked together, assuming it is somewhat accurate portrayal of the actual historical duo. Finally, it features four of my favorite British actors: Lesley Manville, Timothy Spall (who disappears into the role of the Mikado), Alison Steadman and Jim Broadbent.

One element that kept me from enjoying the movie even more was the tendency for the characters to mutter to each other when conversing. I turned up the volume at those times, which not only failed to solve the problem completely, but then when the scene changed into one of the great choruses from the Mikado, it blasted me out of my seat. Then I’d turn it down, wait and repeat.

So I cautiously recommend watching Topsy Turvy, especially if you like understated British movies, or for that matter, The Mikado."

If you can't handle the counterculture movement of the late 60s and early 70s and all that went with it (hippies, drugs, skinny dipping, free sex and communes) I suggest staying away from ""Easy Rider."" For everyone else, this is an excellent period piece of the late 60s (shot in 1968) that explores the nature of freedom and the quest thereof.

Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as Wyatt and Billy, two hippies who travel by choppers from Los Angeles to New Orleans to attend the Mardi Gras. Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a brothel when they arrive.

Jack Nicholson stands out as one of the friends they meet; while the beautiful Karen black & Toni Basil star as two prostitutes in New Orleans.

What makes ""Easy Rider"" great is that it's more than just a road adventure with a modern Western garnish (i.e. Cowboys on motorized ""horses""). The film has depth that separates it from the typical biker flicks of that era. It's really about freedom or the lack thereof. Wyatt and Billy certainly have some grasp of freedom - and they desperately pursue it - but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it.

Wyatt laments near the end of the film: ""We blew it; we really blew it"" as he realizes freedom has slipped through their fingers like water. Nicholson's character, George, has more of handle on what's going on, but he obviously has his own issues.

The hippies at the commune seem to have escaped society's shackles but to what end? There's a reason communes never really caught on in America, and the film shows why.

In an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s, Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that ""Easy Rider"" is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. So the most fitting thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was... (I can't give away the climax).

In a sense, they were committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, ""Look at those terrible rednecks, blah, blah, blah."" But ""Easy Rider,"" he pointed out, is a Southern term for a prostitute's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America - liberty's become a prostitute, and we're all taking the easy ride.

So what's the answer? The answer's there and it's pretty clear, but I won't hand-feed it to anyone. Seek and you will find.

This might give you some food for thought the next time you catch the film.

Some modern viewers with ADHD criticize the film as boring, but I find it strangely engrossing from beginning to end. The climax is equal parts sudden, powerful, shocking and unforgettable.

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah (Monument Valley) and Louisiana.

In the late 1940s, Two roommates at Amherst College (Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel) exchange personal info about their sextivities with various women as the years progress to the early ’70s. The female cast includes Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret, Cynthia O'Neal, Carol Kane and Rita Moreno.

“Carnal Knowledge” (1971) is not a conventional look at college life in the manner of the later “Small Circle of Friends” or “The ’70s.” Rather, it’s a sometimes depressing, sometimes amusing chronicling of the evolution and devolution of the sexual lives of two college friends, one a smooth-talking narcissist (Nicholson) and the other a sensitive nice guy (Garfunkel). Their friendship and discussions are reminiscent of Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza in the 90s, just more edgy and not as funny. 

When released, the counterculture revolution of the late 60s was still fresh and nudity was the hip thang, which explains the skinny-dipping sequence in ""Woodstock"" and, a year later, the nudity in this flick and ""The Last Picture Show,” as well as the soon-to-come ""Stigma"" and “The Harrad Experiment.” Of course, nudity in mainstream movies was nothing new in light of the pre-Hays era, as observed by ""Tarzan and His Mate"" from 1934. With the code lifted after almost three decades, movies like this seemed to exult in a new sense of libertine freedom. Whilst risqué and cutting edge at the time, it's just a quirky adult-oriented drama today. 

Nicholson has his likable smirk, as usual, but as the story progresses his character becomes increasingly distasteful and pathetic. Reflect on where he ends up; it’s a powerful point. Garfunkel’s character isn’t anywhere as bad, but he also becomes somewhat pitiable. “Meaningless! Meaningless! Everything is meaningless.”

Although the story is sometimes tedious and there are distasteful elements, the cast is great and the psychological insights interesting.

It runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in New York City and at Panorama Film Studios in Vancouver.

Tim Allen (Home Improvement, Last Man Standing) adds his brilliant comedic contribution to this star studded cast which includes Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Alan Rickman, and Sam Rockwell. They are the aging stars of the one time hit TV series Galaxy Quest. None of them have worked much since the series ended and they make a meager living reprising their characters at various sci fi conventions, or worse, store openings. Tim Allen loves appearing for die hard fans of the show as ""Commander Jason Nesmith"", but none of the other cast members are very thrilled about these appearances, and resent the attention the ""Commander"" receives. 
The cast finds a high quality mock up of the show's space ship at a store opening appearance, as well as some ""extras"" who are nothing if not 'in character' as members of an alien race seeking help from the famous crew. 
  Before they realize what has happened they find themselves in space on a real life adventure. This is a FUNNY movie which had me laughing to the end. I was really sorry when it was over, I loved it that much. || Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend, especially for Star Trek fans.

This has a sufficiently high production value, but I think a lot of the budge went to hiring the cast, and building the locations, especially the ship.  It's probably the chief reason why (at least I feel it is the case) people have wanted to do spoofs of Star Trek since the original series, but only ""Galaxy Quest"" and ""The Orville"" have really made the attempt.  Usually the reaction is to take it in its own serious direction, like Babylon 5, and even ""The Orville"" lands in between.

I think my favorite aspect of this movie is that it's actually very similar to ""The Invention of Lying"" where not only does an alien race build a starship, hands it to Terrans, and then we just keep up the ruse so we can have a starship.  While I think the more interesting aspect is the same things that we see in ""Star Trek"": the interactions between xenos and Terrans and the reflective aspects of humanity, the audience is quickly reminded that it's a comedy throughout the movie.

Everyone of the actors is funny, there's even a young Justin Long here, and while there is sufficient action / drama to move the story forward with some substance, it's the comedy that you're going to remember here.  Alan Rickman and Tim Allen fighting, Sigourney Weaver translating from human to ship, and general awkwardness of situation.

It's a good watch, and I think that whether or not you're a fan of ""Star Trek"", then I think there is something at which you can laugh. || I usually struggle with comedy movies - but a combination of great casting; good, well-paced comedy writing and some lovely special effects from Stan Winston keep this rollicking along with loads of tongue-in-cheek swipes at the sci-fi genre (and ""Star Trek"" in particular) that is done in a sympathetic, engaging fashion. The ""crew"" are a bunch of washed-out actors doing the comic-con rounds with Tim Allen as the supercilious Captain: Alan Rickman - a wonderfully aloof thespian playing the disillusioned semi-crustacean ship's doctor; Sigourney Weaver as the buxom, but largely pointless ""Tawny Madison"" and Tony Shalhoub as the engineer on the ""NSEA Protector"". At one such event, they encounter the ""Thermians"" who need help battling the evil, all-conquering ""Sarris"". Having seen the telecasts of ""Galaxy Quest"" and treated them as actual historical documents the ""Thermians"" have built a real starship and hope the crew can be as true to their characters as they were to their scripts and save everyone's bacon... They are all on good form here, even poor old Sam Rockwell in the sort of Trekkie ""red shirt"" role (who expects to be killed at any moment). Perhaps not quite laugh out loud, but if you are a fan of this genre then you cannot fail to frequently raise a smile at the fight scenes that are comically staged; off course the captain's shirt gets ripped - and everyone finds a tiny bit of heroism in their persona. I loved it!"

Stone, the perennial poo stirrer that he is, shifted gear this time around to bring us his take on the brutal world on and off the pitch of American Gridiron. Though without doubt this is far too long in run time (2hrs 40), given that it isn't actually multifaceted in characterisation terms (Diaz underwritten), there's no denying that visually this finds Stone at his best. The quickfire editing might not be to everyone's taste, but it really puts you right in every play out there on the field. So much so you can hear and feel every spit, vomit, blood spill and vociferous grunt.

No faults in the acting performances either, with Pacino thankfully doing his thing and Foxx superb as egotist QB Willie Beamen taking the honours and holding court.

Nobody is much interested in these stage shows until talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) spots him and sees something original about his talents. Exposure on television followed, then his casting in the sitcom about New York's amiable mix of yellow cab drivers - the series that made the name of Danny DeVito too - before he embarked on a curious and one-sided career wrestling women. It was this latter profession that introduced him to male wrestler Jerry Lawler who tired of this and took to fighting him man-to-man. Needless to say, he's no match for the man with the ""Piledriver"" so has to resort to other ways to keep ahead of the ever changing entertainment game. His behaviour becomes more erratic and soon nobody with a television camera will touch the man... Jim Carrey is a natural at these quirky and over-the-top interpretations, and here is no different. He immerses himself into the role and manages to very successfully convey the sheer irritation factor of this man who had practically no talent but an ability to pander the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" theory to an audience who thought, initially, it better to laugh with the crowd than to scratch their heads and wonder what they were actually laughing at. On that front, Milos Forman has created a cleverly structured biopic of a man who was flawed and obsessed and who was fuelled by a market place desperate for something different. What I didn't feel here was any empathy for Kaufman. The industry is hard, cruel and unforgiving to the best of them and maybe it is a testament to the acting, but I genuinely felt this person hadn't the skills required to entertain at an holiday camp for the hard of hearing.

That’s because he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and swiftly found himself on the wrong end of a triple life sentence for murder. With the authorities quite happy that the right man (or, indeed, any man) is locked up for these crimes, nobody is interested in paroling him let alone hearing any appeals. Things might be about to change, though, when the young Lesra (Vicellous Shannon) reads of his case and together with a few of his own mentors, decides that he is going to strive to prove Carter’s innocence. What’s quite clear is that his incarceration has robbed Carter of any semblance of faith in the system, and his anger is barely disguised as his contempt becomes more ingrained and his despair more entrenched. The young Lesra does, however, manage to make him see that there is always hope, even when it’s clear that for the establishment, admitting it is/was wrong is simply not on it’s agenda. To add to the complications, there are also some more venal aspects enthusiastic for him to remain in jail and finally there is the convicting sheriff (Dan Hedaya) who is as racist as it’s possible to get, and who has no intention of seeing his quarry ever escape from behind bars. There are a few solid supporting roles from Liev Schrieber and briefly from Rod Steiger - though not so much from the curiously cast John Hannah - to support this developing critique on the flawed justice system that put him there, and though there’s no actual jeopardy to the conclusion of the story, Norman Jewison and Washington do still manage to keep this interesting for much of it’s admittedly overlong two and an half hours as it spotlights racial discrimination and hatred hiding in plain sight.

The emperor marries ""Tamora"" (Jessica Lange) - a hostage Queen of the Goths brought back from the war and what now ensures is Shakespeare at his most brutal - just about every crime in the book is featured - a battle for survival in which no-one is safe. The style of this production mixes the traditional (Oscar nominated) costume based drama with a more modern interpretation of other aspects of the complex story. The screenplay does try to stick to the play in general (though the men in the pie bit is perhaps an addition!) and the quirky nature of the characterisations are well captured by the likes of Cummings - a sort of Charlie Chaplin meets Hitler persona; Harry Lennix stands out as ""Aaron"" - a man who really epitomises evil and there is fun to be had from ""Demetrius"" (Matthew Rhys) and ""Chiron"" (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) whose leather clad antics are worth seeing before pie-dom looms. The direction from acclaimed theatre director Julie Taymor offers us quite an unique perspective on this lesser known but powerful tale of lust, greed and power and that perspective enhances some of the more physically (limiting) theatrical aspects of this play - especially when filmed out of doors. Sir Anthony is on authoritative form and Jessica Lange's malevolently sexy performance is probably the best depiction of that character I have seen on stage or screen.

In the end, Winona Ryder was chosen to play Susanna Kaysen, a teenage girl who overdoses on aspirin and is admitted to psychiatric hospital. While in the 1960s institution, she meets and befriends many of the other patients, including sociopath Lisa (Angelina Jolie) and schizophrenic Polly (Elisabeth Moss), and nurses including Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg).

It is difficult to believe that at the release of _Girl, Interrupted_ Angeline Jolie was barely starting in her acting career. This was a time before Tomb Raider, and even further before Changeling and Mr and Mrs Smith. Rather, Jolie had a handful of acting credits and one notable film (Gia). So, it is perhaps with huge credit that she was picked to handle such a complex character as Lisa.

And it is Lisa who really keeps _Girl, Interrupted_ moving forward, earning Jolie a well deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - her only Academy Award to date.

Susanna, while the protagonist and perhaps more together mentally, spends most of the film going with the flow, at one moment grateful for the support of her roommate and then the next swept up in Lisa's chaotic whirlwind of destruction, never really offering much to the story other than a set of eyes to view it through.

The final act is the explosive conclusion that the film's initial promise deserves, but overall _Girl, Interrupted_ can't shy away from the fact that not a lot really happens over the course of its runtime. 

Each of the girls are in the institution through no fault of their own, and their personalities are intrinsically linked to their conditions, so it is difficult to follow exactly what their redemption arcs are.

Perfectly watchable, especially for Jolie's performance, but by no means a must-see. || Sometimes you see them as crazy or mentally ill, but they are the cure that keeps you from going crazy if you love them. The movie touched my feelings when I realized that we were the disease that penetrated their bodies and made these angels crazy || Winona Ryder is on great form here in this rather brutally frank look at a girl struggling with mental health issues. ""Susanna"" had been rushed to hospital by her worried parents after an apparent attempt at suicide. Diagnosed with a potential personality disorder, she is admitted to the ""Claymoore"" facility under the care of ""Dr. Wick"" (Vanessa Redgrave) and nurse ""Valerie"" (Whoopi Goldberg). As you'd expect, this place has a multitude of characters inside and she (and we) are introduced to a mixture ranging from the pathological liar to the anorexic, the sociopath to the schizophrenic. Some are friendlier to her, others ignore her altogether. It's ""Lisa"" (Angelina Jolie) whom she seems to relate to her best. She is a controlling character who swings between munificence and malevolence at the drop of an hat whilst giving the staff a constant stream of headaches. On the outside, her recently drafted boyfriend ""Tobias"" (Jared Leto) is trying to coax her to return to the outside world, but she seems to thrive on the institutionalised nature of her new life, addicted to it even. Gradually, though she begins to appreciate that ""Lisa"" is a toxic influence on her life - evidenced by a tragedy that really brings things home to her. The ensemble of patients - Clea Duvall, Brittany Murphy and Elizabeth Moss all work well with the sparingly appearing Goldberg and Redgrave to create a really affecting atmosphere here, but it's Jolie who delivers best with a career-defining effort as a creature that it's impossible to like but equally difficult not to feel sympathy for too. It's intensely scripted, occasionally funny and pretty perfectly paced and though not a easy watch, is certainly a powerful one."

The back story to Supernova is actually more interesting than the studio cut of the film that is available to view. Director's coming and going, one (Walter Hill) taking his name off the credits, butchery by studio interference, different endings, different planned thematics, shelved for two years and etc. Supernova was a messy production and sadly it shows, making Walter Hill's original cut (unavailable) the ""Magnificent Ambersons"" of the sci-fi genre.

Plot, in the skew-whiff edited version we are fed here, is basically a riff on Ridley Scott's Alien. Space dudes up in space take on board a too good to be true hitch-hiker dude, which is a bad idea. Sadly it's all very dull, yet strangely you can see that in amongst the mess, and the often used diversion tactic of Robin Tunney's breasts, there was a very good film here. Brains and effects work to light up the screen, some sexy sizzle marrying up to the tension up there in the galaxy, James Spader on wonderfully broody and heroically damaged form, and some belting deleted scenes on the DVD. But, it's not to be, so the studio should be ashamed of themselves, even if it isn't quite the ultimate stinker it has been painted as. But! Super it is not, in any shape or form. 5/10 || Supernova feels like a wasted opportunity wrapped in decent visuals. The directing is all over the place, which makes sense given the messy production history, and it really shows. The pacing drags, making even the short runtime feel longer than it should. You can tell there were attempts to build tension or mystery, but the script just doesn’t give it enough fuel. The story lacks depth, and the characters feel like cardboard cutouts drifting through space. It tries to be a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, but it never really commits to either, leaving it floating in this weird limbo.

On the plus side, the cinematography is surprisingly solid in parts. There are a few beautiful shots of space and the sun that really stand out, and the set design had potential. The acting isn’t terrible, but the cast doesn’t have much to work with, and it feels like everyone’s just going through the motions. As for the score and sound design, nothing really stood out, which isn’t great for a sci-fi film that should be using sound to build atmosphere. Overall, it’s a slow, visually decent film that struggles to say or do anything memorable."

A disparate couple meets in college in 1937, New York, and then reignite after the war. Katie (Barbra Streisand) is an uber-Liberal while Hubbell (Robert Redford) is more levelheaded about politics. He becomes a writer in Hollywood during the blacklist investigations of the late 40s wherein Katie’s activism threatens his social life and career. The story closes in 1957.

“The Way We Were” (1973) is a classic drama/romance, much acclaimed in its day. The vibe is similar to “Love Story” (1970) but this has superior characters and a more interesting setting.  

It’s interesting to see how loony Liberals existed way back then in the 30s-40s. The movie works because it wisely makes Katie three-dimensional. Sure, she’s a typical INtolerant, obnoxious Leftie, but she also has a human side, a warm and humble side. Meanwhile Redford is at the top of his game here. Streisand incidentally developed a crush on Redford during shooting, but didn’t share her feelings. He feigned ignorance and used Barbra’s infatuation for the benefit of the movie.

There has been some confusion about the last act. Pay attention to what Hubbell says. What happens has nothing to do with Carol Ann and everything to do with the obvious.    

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Union College in Schenectady, New York; Ballston Spa in upstate New York; New York City; Malibu; and nearby Union Station in Los Angeles. The peripheral cast includes Bradford Dillman, Lois Chiles and James Woods.

Two Petty Officers in Norfolk, Virginia (Jack Nicholson and Otis Young), are assigned a shore patrol detail to escort a naïve 18-year-old Seaman (Randy Quaid) to Portsmouth Naval Prison just across the coastal border of Maine. They decide to give the ‘kid’ a good time in several misadventures along the way. 

“The Last Detail” (1973) is a road movie in the Northeast during the transition from late Fall to early Winter (shot in November-January). While a realistic drama, it’s also a dark comedy with interesting and amusing commentaries on life, the American military, corruption, injustice, friendship, recreation, folly, sexual relations and so on. To be expected with young characters in the military, the talk and shenanigans are often R-rated.

Nicholson’s friend, Dennis Hopper, took the template of this film to make the similar ""Chasers"" two decades later (1994). While it’s way more obscure, “Chasers” is the more entertaining film. This one is too mundane on occasion, like when the guys drink & blather in their underwear in the hotel room. Another similar flick is ""The Lucky Ones"" (2007). While I feel “The Last Detail” is the least of the three, it’s definitely worth checking out.

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot on location, taking the same journey as the trio, except for Toronto doubling as Norfolk in the first act, as well as a later scene involving the fictitious Calvin Coolidge Junior High. The rest of the film was shot in coastal Virginia, DC, New York City, Massachusetts and New Hampshire/Maine.

GRADE: B || ""Meadows"" (Randy Quaid) got caught trying to steal $40 from a charity box and so was kicked out of the US Navy and sent down for eight years! Charged with getting him to the jail are two veteran chancers ""Buddusky"" (Jack Nicholson) and ""Mule"" (Otis Young). These two think this is all just a bit of a lark that will get them away from the grind, but they haven't bargained on their prisoner. He comes across as little more than a timid child. Nervous and vulnerable. Why not make sure his last day of freedom is a bit more enjoyable? A few drinks won't hurt. Then, maybe, an hooker to pop his cherry (and make him even more aware of what he's going miss for the next eight years!). As you'd expect, as the young man starts to come out of his shell a little, this trio start to bond and they also begin to question their own attitudes and priorities as they get ever closer to the end of their task. Nicholson is in his element here: slightly loud, completely flaky and over the top. His characterisation of the decent but flawed ""Buddusky"" is powerfully presented here and is foiled equally well by the more understated Young who has a slightly more stoic, reserved, reaction to a life that perhaps his colour has drummed into him over the years. It's Quaid, though, that stole this for me. He plays the part like he's a flower waiting to blossom - and a prickly and thorny one, at that. It's all about masculinity but it's also about picking holes in that façade as these men deal with their own humanity all whilst they all make sure there are some darkly comedic enterprises along the way, too - just ask Carol Kane. Perhaps the USN won't have liked the portrayal of it's elite, here? These men feel themselves completely undervalued and under appreciated by their superior and are determined to break free from their own prison of mundanity. Even if it is for just one day."

Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet Of The Apes/Patton), Papillon is adapted for the screen by Dalton Trumbo & Lorenzo Semple Jr. from notorious French felon Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière's own novel. It stars Steve McQueen (Papillon) & Dustin Hoffman (Louis Dega), is primarily shot in Jamaica & Spain with Fred J. Koenekamp (The Towering Inferno) on photography duties and Jerry Goldsmith provides the score.

Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière was a crook, a bad egg, he however was sent to the notorious, inescapable, prison fortress of Devil's Island for a murder he didn't commit. The film, as is the book, is a fictionalised account of Charrière's time at the penal colony.

The film is probably best described as being a stirring drama of friendship under duress, endurance and opportunism, all neatly blended with an adventure based heart. Schaffner directs it with great technical skill, for in a film with minimal dialogue, he manages to perfectly stifle the viewer with a hot sweaty atmosphere. Something that is crucial for us to feel the confines of this penal colony life. These men are doing hard time, lets not soft soap it Hollywood style, lets get the feel right, something, that much like Don Siegel also did in 79 with his excellent Escape From Alcatraz, Schaffner does exceptionally well. He is helped enormously by two fabulous performances from McQueen & Hoffman.

McQueen is in his element as Papillon. Always an actor whose ability for dominating scenes without using histrionic acting was undervalued, Papillon goes some way to readdressing the myth that he was more about iconography than actual talent. His solitary confinement scenes are sublime, without saying barely a word. As Papillon stave's off starvation, madness and disease, McQueen has such a powerful and believable presence, he pulls us into that five by five paces cell with him. Incredible! Once again tho the Academy ignored McQueen's excellent work and the film only received the one Oscar nomination for Goldsmith's pinging tropical score. Hoffman's great work was something of a given, meticulous as usual in his preparation {he had studied for weeks about penal colony life}, he is the perfect foil for McQueen and the relationship is tender yet never twee. Fine support also comes from Anthony Zerbe as a compassionate leader of a leper colony & Victor Jory as an Indian Chief.

The production was an expensive one, with the original budget of $4 million ballooning to $14 million, making it the most expensive film of 1973. A couple of scripts were jettisoned {money down the drain} before Schaffner enlisted Trumbo to write the screenplay. A good move because Trumbo was able to flesh out character relationships that didn't exist in the source novel. Hoffman himself was adamant that he would only play Dega if the film steered away from a buddy buddy formula and gave Dega intelligent integrity. He got it, which is credit to Trumbo since the Dega character is barely formed in the novel, in fact the film version is an amalgamation of several penal colony characters. Trumbo was rewarded with not only a considerable paycheck, but also a bit part in the movie as the colony commandant early in the piece.

Initial critical reaction to the film was harsh, but the public didn't agree since the theatres were packed and the film made almost $50 million Worldwide. Making it Allied Artists most successful film ever. It has since garnered a massive fan base and has been favourably reassessed by a new wave of critics. Those old complaints about it being too sombre and too enduring to get thru just don't add up.

Those old complaints about it being too sombre and too enduring to get through just don't add up. One only has to note the thematics and essence of the story to know that this is indeed fact. 8/10 || Although present for much of the filming, author Henri Charriere didn't live to see the release of PAPILLON (1973), which was based on his allegedly autobiographical novel. The veracity of what he recounts has been questioned virtually since the books' release in 1969, and the film takes further liberties, leaving one to wonder if this adventure picture is more fiction than fact. What one doesn't have to wonder about, however, are the results achieved by an underrated director at the top of his craft; a bracing Jerry Goldsmith score; marvelous cinematography by Fred Koenekamp; and spot-on performances by Steve McQueen, Dustin Hoffman, and a stellar supporting cast which features some of the best character actors of the period."

Well, of course they can - this film has precisely no jeopardy at all. Though the motive for the crimes remains a mystery for a while, the rest of this follows a well travelled line that is disappointingly predictable. Harmon is never a particularly strong or convincing actor, Connery - and his traditional, wry, smile - clearly just wanted his fee and not for the first time Meg Ryan adds very little as this plods along. It's watchable on the television over a glass or two, but it's all very unremarkable. || Occasionally my mother would really get into a movie, choose a quote as a favorite, and then repeat it constantly in a cartoonish exaggeration of whoever said it in the film.

The Persidio is one of those films she latched onto, and for years after we were subjected to her Sean Connery impression as she threatened to beat us up using only her thumb.

So now every time I see it, heck, every time I'm in Frisco, that is the quote that gets stuck in my head for days after. But, in her defense, it was a very good scene and actually does deserve to be remembered and quoted more.

It's my go to Sean Connery impression... when I'm not impersonating Johnny Lee Miller impersonating Sean Connery. Or the Untouchables, but I kind of feel that one is over used. Everyone goes there when they do Connery. Or, you know, I could just live in Chicago. Maybe the rest of the country and the world just does James Bond.

The point is, you have a quotable Sean Connery scene. And that alone is worth it.

And you have the San Francisco chase scene, and I really hate Frisco, but I do really love movies that are set there and any chase through San Francisco streets is fun if for no other reason than it makes you instantly think of Bullet.

The multi-jurisdictional cliche thing is here, and tragically underused in a lot of movies. But you get a good dynamic of military and civilian cop bumping heads with one another. It's a situation that is made worse by bad blood and a bit of history, and then made even worse by a blooming romantic interest.

And it's the 80s, so you know that the romantic interest is going to be Meg Ryan, no spoiler there.

And all of that with an actual compelling case that the two cops have to solve.

It's kind of all over the place, but in the best possible 80s cliche kind of way. || ""The Presidio"" is an interesting diversion that has an immediately intriguing and literally explosive opening gambit which is eye catching and it easily grabs your full attention, but then the pace quickly eases up out of pure necessity and the murder of Patti Jean Lynch loses all sense of urgency and it is eventually relegated to becoming a secondary consideration as the main focus of the film now concentrates upon the complex and argumentative character dynamics of Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell, his daughter Donna, and Inspector Jay Austin although all of this is nicely juxtaposed with the ongoing murder investigation. However, this film is much too pedestrian for the talented cast involved, but at least the action sequences are superb and the pace is extremely well maintained throughout."

Dead Calm is directed by Phillip Noyce and adapted to screenplay by Terry Hayes from the novel of the same name written by Charles Williams. It stars Sam Neill, Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Dean Semler.

After losing their young son in a car accident, John (Neill) and Rae Ingram (Kidman) head out alone on their yacht for an ocean vacation. Whilst taking in some R&R, the couple spy a ship drifting in the distance, then a man in a dinghy hurriedly rows towards them. He boards their yacht, frantic and panicked, he tells them the ship is sinking and that all on board are dead, killed by food poisoning. His name is Hughie Warriner (Billy Zane), and the Ingram's are about to wish they had never met him....

The Saracen and The Orpheus.

It's so refreshing to find a thriller that works without tricks or elaborate plotting, where the narrative is stripped down to the bare bones and played out purely by three characters. Dead Calm, whilst not exactly the most credible of thrillers from the 80s, contains genuine suspense, a pot boiling heart and production value of some distinction. Director Noyce deals in psychological studies, primarily that of a lunatic and that of a woman beset with grief having to use her mental fortitude to hopefully save herself and her husband.

Noyce and his team get the maximum amount of edge of the seat thrills from a small isolated yacht in the middle of a vast ocean, with tight camera work and nifty editing, it's a film of quality that belies its pared back production. Even ace Aussie photographer Semler (previously Mad Max 2/Razorback, latterly Dances With Wolves/Waterworld) creates beauty out of such a sparse set up, where the blues and greens of the ocean warm the soul and the red sunsets please the eyes. They be glimpses of Mother Earth that give the Ingram's something tangible to fight for.

With the plot requiring Neill to be in his own isolated hell, he turns in a more measured performance, perfect in fact, but it's Zane and Kidman who steal the show. This would prove to be the launching point of Kidman's career, and it hints at the top actress she would become. She gives Rae Ingram a real strength through adversity, with energy in abundance, intelligence and a simmering sexuality, she's a lady character earning respect by film lovers because of Kidman's performance. Zane is suitably edgy, very much giving Hughie a man-child persona, he too exudes a dangerous sexuality, and when it inevitably kicks off, he is scary into the bargain.

A couple of daft character decisions within the story, and a WTF finale, stop it from being near the top of the thriller movie pantheon. But it's not far off from sitting with the best and it remains fresh and entertaining as the decades roll by. 8/10 || Perfect example of why you should check out all the movies that doggy paddled away with an average 3/5 or 6/10 or whatever.

That itinerant life suits him. He is a man who seeks casual fun and who shuns any sort of commitment to his gal, to other people, or even to himself. Gradually he begins to become a little disaffected with his choices in life and with the emptiness it has left him with, and so returns to the family home where he discovers his dad has suffered from a few seizures. This new state of affairs compels “Bobby” to finally start to put a few things into perspective. It’s been three years since his last visit home and so, naturally, he is not the only one with reconciling to do - and there are a few at home who don’t quite have forgiveness first upon their lips. The question for everyone here is whether or not there can be any catharsis or is it all just too dyed in the wool. This is, for my money, the best effort Nicholson ever presented on screen. Coupled with some really quite poignant writing and paced at times as if it were a fly-on-the-wall documentary, we see a man about whom we probably couldn’t have cared less at the start expose his flaws, demons and humanity - and even then, there’s still a distinct possibility we won’t care. It’s good to see Ralph Waite - forever “John Walton” - take on a much more substantial and nuanced role as “Carl” and on that front, plaudits also have to go for an emotionally charged effort from Karen Black’s “Rayette” - the long-suffering girlfriend whom you frequently wonder shouldn’t just drop him like an hot brick. The soundtrack also plays quite a powerful role in this film with a sensitive mix of predominately country music ballads paired with some of the finest pieces of classical piano works - supposedly emanating from “Bobby” and from his sister “Partita” (Lois Smith). Essentially, it is a coming of age story only this one isn’t so much about in the traditional vein of loved-up hormones, more about adulthood and growing up by a man who lives in an uncomfortably claustrophobic world largely of his own choosing."

A discredited Nazi-hunter in Vienna (Laurence Olivier) slowly learns of a plot to resurrect the Third Reich spearheaded by a mad geneticist, who’s conducting experiments in remote Paraguay (Gregory Peck). James Mason is also on hand as a colonel in the latter’s service. 

“The Boys from Brazil” (1978) was based on the book by Ira Levin, who’s known for “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Stepford Wives.” It was helmed by the director of “Planet of the Apes,” “Patton” and “Papillon.” You could say it’s cut from the same cloth as “The Odessa File” and “Marathon Man,” just mixed with the weird horror elements for which Levin was known.

Beyond the high caliber cast, the creativity of the script is a highlight (the less you know, the better), along with the great locations and entertaining bits spiced throughout, sometimes reflecting a (welcome) sense of humor or hamminess. A couple of examples include the superb dam sequence and Josef’s unexpected fit at the Nazi celebration, not to mention playful Mrs. Doring and the amusing blonde mother.

It runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot primarily in Portugal with additional filming in London, Vienna, Austria (the dam sequence) and Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

An NFL player loses his place on the team in Los Angeles (Jeff Bridges) and is hired by a shady nightclub owner (James Woods) to find his lover who took his money and ran off to the Yucatan coast (Rachel Ward). Richard Widmark shows up as the arrogant owner of the team.

“Against All Odds” (1984) is part island adventure/romance and part big city crime thriller. Woods is great as the smirking antagonist while Bridges and Ward are in their physical prime. The Yucatan section is in ways similar to “The Deep” (1977) while the big city part is sorta akin to “Sharky’s Machine” (1981), but this is better than both. The relationships are convincing and the dialogue is snappy.
 
The Yucatan sequences are a highlight, especially the mind-blowing Mayan ruins, as is the inventive score that’s sometimes reminiscent of Pink Floyd meets “Apocalypse Now.” Ward never did anything for me, but she’s a’right, and there are several quality females in the periphery, including Swoosie Kurtz. Then there’s a quirky-but-entertaining performance by Kid Creole and the Coconuts.

This is basically a character study of the three principles. The plot is too busy, but I had no problem following it. The well-done ending with the Phil Collins’ song is notable.

Pacific Heights is directed by John Schlesinger and written by Daniel Pyne. It stars Michael Keaton, Melanie Griffith, Matthew Modine, Laurie Metcalf and Mako. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Amir M. Mokri.

Young couple Patty and Drake plough all their resources into buying a large house in the affluent Pacific Heights area of San Francisco. With two apartments to rent they think their numbers have come in when they manage to find tenants for both. But one man, the mysterious Carter Hayes (Keaton), soon proves to be anything but the perfect tenant…

There are twin terrors at work here, one is the tenant from hell, the other is the laws that protect him as he manipulates the system to its very stupid core. The makers do a very good job of making the film unsettling throughout, the ghastly menace who invades someone’s home and holds all the ace cards is a constant terrifying presence.

Schlesinger for two thirds of the piece crafts a tightly wound thriller, unfortunately it just gets too daft for its own good as the cat and mousery reaches the culmination of plotting. Keaton is great, expanding upon the dark part of Bruce Wayne portrayal to be scarily smooth and convincing. Griffith is good value as well, and it’s great to see a female character showing great resourcefulness, but both actors are let down by Pyne’s screenplay in the last third where the psycho versus good lady section is too far fetched.

We are presented with, essentially, a collective of unpleasant individuals who either started out that way, or were corrupted by the environments in which they existed and/or created - clearly illustrated, for example, by the way the women are treated by their husbands/bosses etc. This left me with an overwhelming feeling that had there been more general respect and decency on offer here - across the board - then a lot of the violence from both ""sides"" might have been avoided.

Like Clarence Williams III from The Mod Squad?

When a worldly singer witnesses a mob crime, the police hide her as a nun in a traditional convent where she has trouble fitting in.

Whoopi Goldberg is the sister act of the title, and boy does she have a great time with the characterisation. It's hardly pulling up any trees, and it holds few surprises, yet it's so warm and gentle with its humour it's near impossible to dislike.

The laughs obviously come from Goldberg's street wise gal trying to adapt to life in a convent. The big message that unfolds, as she gets more at ease with her surroundings, is that not only can earthy girls come to be honourable by learning new fortitudes, but also that they can positively affect those around them in a perceived stuffy environment.

The trajectory of the nunnery choir under Goldberg's tutorship - from wailing cats to cherubic angels - is the film's highlights, while Maggie Smith as the prim and proper Mother Superior is class unbound. Harvey  Keitel as the gangster who is after our sister's blood is wasted, and the ending is never really in doubt, yet this is a good pick me up movie, undemanding fun for those after a quick smiley fix. 7/10 || **One of the great comedies of the decade.**

We are facing a film that was a huge success when it was released and continues, even today, to have a vast legion of fans. It's one of those light, friendly comedies that doesn't age, is always current, and is a pleasure to revisit from time to time. The expertly written screenplay tells the story of Deloris, a casino singer who must be protected by the police after witnessing her lover, a married gangster, kill a police snitch at close range. The authorities' solution is to hide her in a convent, where she will have to assume a false identity and pretend that she is a nun. Of course, most of the film's jokes come precisely from the difficult adaptation of a showgirl to a strongly strict environment, where obedience and discipline are taken seriously.

The film works wonderfully well, and despite the years that have passed, it remains an amazingly up-to-date film that doesn't show its age. It's one of those films that we can watch and rewatch without getting tired, from time to time, and that is still fondly remembered by many people today. It's not a great film from a technical point of view, with average cinematography and editing, good sets and decent costumes, but no big fights and other challenging technical elements.

The cast is lavish and full of talent. The protagonist is the great Whoopi Goldberg, who was at the time experiencing one of the highlights of her career (shortly before, she had received the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for _Ghost_), becomes, with this film, truly an icon. Next to her were the grandiose Maggie Smith and the funny Kanthy Najimi, Wendy Makkena and Mary Wickes, who bring to life the most significant nuns of that convent. The villain, in turn, is very well done by Harvey Keitel. || Whoopi Goldberg and Dame Maggie Smith are on top form in this engaging comedy thriller. Goldberg ""Deloris van Cartier"" witnesses her gangster boyfriend commit murder. When she is drafted in by the police to testify against him, she is put into a witness protection scheme with a difference. She is to hide out in a convent under the tutelage of Dame Maggie's ""Mother Superior"". After initial clashes on just about everything, Goldberg - ""Sister Mary Clarence"" - finally finds a sense of purpose with the choir - and soon that choir is attracting global attention, even the Pope is coming to hear them sing. Of course, the publicity isn't all good - and her boyfriend ""Vince"" (Harvey Keitel) soon tracks her down. Can she be rescued from his evil clutches? This is an enjoyable film to watch. Once it gets going, there are plenty toe-tapping musical numbers and both women at the top of the bill, as well as the feisty Mary Wickes (""Sister Mary Lazarus""), are clearly having some fun having a funny and well paced script to work too. The conclusion is pretty much as you'd expect, descending just a little too much into slapstick for my liking before a rousing Papal audience! To be honest - there is nothing here not to like. Good fun!"

Can she lick them into shape and use their newly formed choir to save the school from the bulldozers? The premiss is not a patch on the first film, and neither is the execution. Dame Maggie offer a few classy cameo roles, as does an on form Mary Wickes with James Coburn appearing occasionally as the ferret-like administrator determined to help ensure the school does actually close, but for the most part this is akin to an early episode of ""Fame"". The kids, including an early appearance from Lauryn Hill, are almost auditioning - either to the nuns or to the audience, and even the ending is just a little like the end of ""the Sound of Music"" (only admittedly, somewhat livelier!). It's not terrible, but somehow it misses the faux-menace of the first in the series.

A well-to-do couple in the Puget Sound region (Matt McCoy & Annabella Sciorra) hires a nanny not knowing that she has axes to grind (Rebecca De Mornay). Ernie Hudson plays a mentally challenged laborer while Julianne Moore is on hand as the wife’s best friend.   

""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" (1992) is a drama/thriller in the mold of contemporaneous flicks like “The Stepfather” (1987) and “The Crush” (1993). The events even take place in the same area as those. While it’s the least of these, it’s not far off in overall quality. 

It has a bit of a Lifetime movie vibe and the serviceable Sciorra doesn’t trip my trigger while De Mornay’s character is a turn-off because she’s obviously nutzoid. Meanwhile Moore superbly plays a biyatch while McCoy is ineffectual as the hubby. The locations are fabulous, however. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Seattle, Tacoma and Issaquah, Washington.  

GRADE: B-/C+ || For a while, Rebecca de Mornay is quite menacing as the live-in nanny ""Peyton"". She is hired by ""Claire"" (Annabella Sciorra) and her husband ""Michael"" (Matt McCoy) to look after their baby. Initially all kind and helpful, we soon begin to suspect that she has another agenda - and that she will stop at nothing to attain it! Sadly, after about twenty minutes the story rather settles into a predictable pattern as she gradually manipulates the family, exploits and creates some cracks in the marriage (or tries to, anyway) before a denouement that is really rather weak and takes just a bit to long to arrive. The production is maybe just a bit too pristine, too sterile, to sustain the sense of peril and the dialogue is just too wordy with scenarios taking too long to cook. Still, it's quite watchable film just one that I think has dated rather over the last thirty years into a mediocre television thriller."
24735.0,Agnes of God,"When a dead newborn is found, wrapped in bloody sheets, in the bedroom wastebasket of a young novice, psychiatrist Martha Livingston is called in to determine if the seemingly innocent novice, who knows nothing of sex or birth, is competent enough to stand trial for the murder of the baby.","That night, murder wasn't the only sin.","Drama, Mystery",98,1985-09-13,en,6.2,130,1.2466,"Jane Fonda, Meg Tilly, Anne Bancroft, Anne Pitoniak, Winston Rekert",Norman Jewison,"court, nun, quebec, hypnosis, montreal, canada, based on play or musical, trial, chain smoking, psychiatrist, mother superior, convent (nunnery), novice, stigmata, dead baby, paternity mystery","_**Melodramatic havoc at a rural Canadian Convent with Jane Fonda, Anne Bancroft and Meg Tilly**_

After a bloody scandal at a Convent outside Montreal, a court-appointed psychiatrist (Jane Fonda) investigates to determine if a devout, but hysterical young woman (Meg Tilly) is fit to stand trial, but she’ll have to get past the intractable Mother Superior (Anne Bancroft) to find the truth. 

""Agnes of God"" (1985) is a psychological drama revolving around a Convent with a few scenes of Montreal thrown in. 

What we have here is a mystery: Was the innocent & naïve Agnes (1) impregnated by God, (2) by some dude in the barn or wherever, or (3) a kind of spontaneous cloning or twinning. Concerning that last possibility:  There are supposedly nine documented virgin births on record and the offspring were all girls who looked like their mothers.  The idea that Agnes calls the baby ""she” augments this possibility, plus the fact that she seemingly has enough faith to put holes in her hand, aka stigmata, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?

I’m not going to say what conclusion the ambiguous film points to, if any. 

“Stigmata” (1999) covers some of the same ground but is from the thriller/horror genre whereas “Agnes of God” is more mundane. “Stigmata” is all-around more compelling while “Agnes” is rather one-dimensional with women constantly confronting each other with a lot of screaming and crying. Yes, there are heavy reasons for these emotional dialogues, and those reasons are interesting to explore, but the story just wasn’t gripping for me. Too bad, because Fonda, Bancroft and Tilly bend over backwards to pull it off.

While the movie didn’t really work for me, it’s a passionate and noble effort centering around faith, logic and ultimate reality (truth). And I have no doubt it has a cult following. Give it a try if the themes trip your trigger, but you’ll probably be disappointed.  

The movie runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Rockwood & Toronto, Ontario, with establishing shots of Montreal.

Survival is the first order of the day, before rescuers surely come, but does anyone have the faintest idea where they actually are? With the low cloud cover would the wreckage be spotted anyway? What now ensues is a better than average survival movie, with Ethan Hawke (Parrado) and Vincent Spano (Balbi) on quite good form trying to motivate the assembled survivors. Their attempts to ration wine and chocolate soon prove fruitless, and morals and ethics are challenged across this largely god-fearing group as they begin to realise that deliverance from the middle of this avalanche prone country is unlikely, and they must turn to the more urgent needs of finding food... Will they resort to cannibalism? It's based on a true story, which though adding legitimacy, does rob the film of any real sense of jeopardy as clearly someone had to survive to tell us this story, but the route of their eventual salvation demonstrates well the difficulties they faced and the tests to their humanity and faith that they must address. It's not without the odd bit of dark humour and the snowscape cinematography contrasts well with the claustrophobic imagery as the sixteen survivors huddle together in the shell of their aeroplane for warmth and shelter. It is too long with some of the scenarios recycling themselves once or twice, but there is a genuine sense of peril from Frank Marshall that makes you realise just how pointless those pre-take off safety briefings are on an aircraft."

I must say I probably thought more of it some 30 years ago. Nothing against the actors. I think they all did a credible job. I just think two and a half hours was too long to spend with the Colonel (oops, sorry, Lieutenant Colonel).

Even Slade himself admits that he has always been a screw-up, and it seems since the incident that led to his blindness he has gotten much worse, and suicidal to boot. Fair enough, at times he did seem to be a waste of skin, so suicide was a viable option. 

Lt. Colonel Frank Slade can be casually  insulting or verbally abusive to any person that enters his orbit: friend or foe, family or stranger, it doesn’t matter. And he can be physically abusive for provocations that we mere mortals learn to swallow in silence or with some modicum of class. Yes, that is his style, but wait. That applies to men only, it seems. With women, whom he magically knows are attractive by their smell despite his blindness, he is courtly, charming, respectful with only occasional lapses of lewdness.

So if he can be a normal human with attractive women, what is his problem with everyone else? Well, of course it doesn’t matter, because he is larger than life and the centerpiece of the movie. All of his moods and actions lead up to a speech he delivers at the end of the film, words that prove he is the hero of the movie. I would like to think that his time spent with Charlie was transformative for him and led to real character growth, but really, I don’t think that anything short of miraculously regaining his sight would have achieved that happy result. || ""Charlie"" (Chris O'Donnell) is a hard-up student at the posh Baird prep. school where his bursary-funded status sees him looked down upon by many of his fellow, silver-spooned, colleagues. Their rather pompous principal ""Trask"" (James Rebhorn) is the victim of a rather messy and humiliating prank, and convinced that ""Charlie"" and his rather spineless pal ""George"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) know whodunit, he decides to convene a meeting of the entire school to force confessions from the boys. Meantime, and always hard up for cash, ""Charlie"" is offered a job babysitting a blind man. Boy, is he in for a shock! His introduction to ""Lt. Col. Slade"" (Al Pacino) certainly opens his eyes. This man is a bully, not really any other word for it. He lost his sight fighting for his country, and initially appears as little better than an intolerant and foul-mouthed thug with quite a superiority complex and a penchant for bourbon. ""Slade"" and his new helper are destined for a luxury trip to New York for Thanksgiving. First class flights, a suite in the Waldorf and a $28 burger turn the young man's head but no so much as the confession his employer makes as to the purpose of the trip. What now ensues does follow a rather predictable path, but it's really the two characterisations that shine here. Pacino has, arguably, the easier part to play. His being the stronger, more forceful role as the epitome of the obnoxious. It's O'Connell who has to tread on the eggshells as he must reconcile his need for the cash, his dread of what awaits him back at school and a growing interest in this man of contradictions. By going to extremes so often, ""Charlie"" (and the audience) are introduced to a man who has standards he feels are long gone. Loyalty, dignity and maybe most of all - integrity. It's those virtues that he hopes to see in his companion - but will he? We are treated to a well written and delivered tour-de-force from Pacino here in what I think is easily his most emotional and visceral performance, and O'Donnell works well as the shy, introspective foil with whom he fences on an increasingly less one-sided basis. A disastrous trip to his family for turkey lunch is tempered by one of the best performed tangos you're ever likely to see on screen - and I found 2½ hours just flew by in a compelling and enthralling fashion.

The first thing any prospective first time viewer of this piece should note, is that it's not actually a film about Baseball. It's about friendships, challenges and differing off shoots to the complications of war, it just so happens that it's the game of Baseball that brings it all together! 

Directed by Penny Marshall (Big), screenplay by Lowell Ganz & Babaloo Mandel (City Slickers/Parenthood) and featuring Tom Hanks (wonderful as drunken coach Dugan) as the leading male, it's no surprise that ""A League Of Their Own"" booms with sentiment and no little amount of comedy. It is to me a very rewarding picture, the sort that wants you to chuckle along with it whilst noting the need for human interaction during a troubled time. 

The lady actors do great impressions of bona fide athletes, asked to parade in short skirts and entertain the watching public, these gals, led by the always engaging Geena Davis, deliver a sparky picture that never veers into maudlin territory. There are of course some sombre moments, but they are placed nicely by Marshall in the context of the films' events, never trite, they serve more as tender vignettes to run alongside the frivolity on offer.

 Ultimately ""A League Of Their Own"" has achieved its aims come the final credits, its not taxing and its not purporting to be an intelligent look at a period in history. It's asking us the viewers to feel heartened by what we just watched, and just maybe to give those girls back in the 1940s a piece of our respect, job done. 7/10"

Patriot Games is a more than serviceable thriller, perhaps a bit out of date when viewing it now, but still a very effective good against evil piece. 

The source material is so dense and intricate it was always going to be hard to condense that into a 2 hour movie, but I feel the makers manage to keep it fleshy whilst making the respective characters interesting and watchable.

The acting on show is more than adequate, Harrison Ford is great in the role of Jack Ryan, he manages to portray him as a sensitive family man who can step up to the plate when things get ugly, and Anne Archer is solid enough as the wife and mother caught up in the web of nastiness unfolding.

The baddies are led by the brooding Sean Bean who is a little under written, whilst Richard Harris is sadly underused. However, the action set pieces make their mark and thankfully we get a riveting final reel that cements the entertainment deal for time spent with the pic. 

It is formulaic to a degree, but that is OK if the combined efforts of all involved are spot on, and thankfully here they are. 7/10 || Clearly Alec Baldwin was too exhausted after his submarine adventure in 1990, so Harrison Ford picked up the mantle of ""Jack Ryan"" - now a former CIA operative who is on the UK on holiday with his family. Hardly have the titles ended before he is embroiled in an IRA attempt to kidnap ""Lord Holmes"" (James Fox), a distant cousin of the Queen Mother. Intervening, he kills one of the attackers who happens to be the younger brother of the surviving attacker ""Sean"" (they kept it simple for Mr Bean). Of course he is sprung from police custody via some dinghies near Tower Bridge and next thing ""Ryan"" and family are the new targets of this vengeful terrorist cell. What now ensues is a really dry thriller that plods along with little to make it stand out. There is an irony that the IRA man is played by an Englishman, but neither Richard Harris nor Samuel L. Jackson really make much impression on this politically simplistic revenge vehicle for a star who is far from his best. The perilous scenarios rather lurch from frying pan to fire, but never with much jeopardy - before an ending at sea that at least gave the pyrotechnics folks something to do. It's not Tom Clancy's best book, and is really only a passable watch on screen."

Nevertheless E.M.Forster gives us a huge, complex story that holds our interest for the entire 142 minutes.

And the Ivory-Merchant team contributes a beautiful setpiece, complete with perfect cinematography, locations, costumes and a team of the finest actors in Britain. And two of the Redgrave family to play mother and daughter. The acting from everyone on screen is phenomenal! || I think this might be the pinnacle of the Merchant Ivory storytelling world (with thanks to E.M. Forster), as a strong ensemble cast assembles to tell a tale of Edwardian Britain that brings into stark focus a class system that is just beginning to show some cracks. ""Wilcox"" (Anthony Hopkins) is what I suppose you'd call nouveau riche. A millionaire industrialist who has acquired quite a few grand country properties from the increasingly impoverished aristocracy. When his first wife (Vanessa Redgrave) dies at the eponymous country cottage, she has apparently promised it to her friend ""Margaret"" (Emma Thompson) but the family choose to disregard the bequeathing letter and she is none the wiser. Meantime, her well meaning and quite fussy sister ""Helen"" (Helena Bonham-Carter) has become aware of the hard working clerk ""Bast"" (Samuel West) who is married, sympathetically but rather unlovingly, to ""Jacky"" (Nicola Duffett) and not without ambition. ""Wilcox"" is set upon remarrying, and it's ""Margaret"" who gets the nod. Thing is, though, can there ever be any chance of any real love between them, or indeed for any of them, as the family ghosts - past and present, come back to haunt them and poor ""Bast""? It's a grand looking saga this, and it plays the politics of the day well as there are three initially distinct strata of society gradually intermingling, some more willingly than others, throughout the unfolding drama. I actually thought it was the engaging effort from Duffett that stole the show, but Redgrave also contributes well, if briefly, as the ailing ""Mrs. Wilcox"" and Samuel West also stands out, portraying his character  as a decent man who is a fish-out-of water at the best of times, but even more adrift after entrusting himself and his affairs to ""Helen"". It's a characterful study of human nature that shows up hypocrisy and delivers kindness, showcases nicely all the artifice of the creative talent and is worth a watch."
11068.0,Singles,"A group of young adults in their twenties, who share an apartment in the city of Seattle, ponder on love and face all the challenges of adulthood.",Love is a game. Easy to start. Hard to finish.,"Romance, Comedy, Drama",99,1992-09-18,en,6.394,400,1.9072,"Bridget Fonda, Campbell Scott, Kyra Sedgwick, Matt Dillon, Sheila Kelley",Cameron Crowe,"lovesickness, love of one's life, free love, cheating, roommates, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend, seattle, washington, blind date, grunge, nostalgic, lighthearted, comforting","**_Quirky romcom with the backdrop of the early 90's grunge scene_**

Two 20-something couples and others explore life & love during the advent of the grunge scene in Seattle. Dillon's character is the only one musically involved in the scene, as the vocalist of the band Citizen Dick. The two couples are played by Campbell Scott & Kyra Sedgwick and Bridget Fonda & Dillon while other cast members include Sheila Kelley and Bill Pullman.  

Although ""Singles"" was released in September 1992 it was actually shot in March-May, 1991, a full half a year _before_ the explosion of grunge music with the success of Nirvana's NEVERMIND. Writer/director Cameron Crowe originally wrote the script in 1984 with the setting of Phoenix in mind but rewrote it six years later inspired by how the burgeoning Seattle grunge community came together after the death of Mother Love Bone's singer in March, 1990.

The flick is a little reminiscent of 2001's ""Rock Star,"" but the latter is better IMHO simply because it focuses more on the music scene than romantic relationships. Not to mention the style of music in ""Rock Star"" is metal, which is preferable in my book (although Alice In Chain's song performed live for this movie definitely smacks of metal).

The very title ""Singles"" tips off that this is a romcom focusing on dating. As such, if you favor dating movies you'll probably like ""Singles,"" even if you don't particularly like grunge. Speaking of which, the soundtrack includes cuts by grunge luminaries Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice In Chains, Mother Love Bone, Jane's Addiction, Smashing Pumpkins and Screaming Trees, amongst others. In fact, quite a few grunge stars have cameos, such as Chris Cornell, Layne Staley, Eddie Vedder and Kim Thayil.

The film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in Seattle.

GRADE: B- || I don't understand the hate for this, it's a nice little rom-com.  I think the big deal was that they tried to make it Gen-X and, for the most part, it got rejected because commercial film, and I get that, I don't understand it because it was still done well, but I get it... it's a Rom-Com, it's supposed to be that way.  If they casted Meg Ryan you can complain more.

Had it been released in the 80s it would have played, and they not tried to focus on grunge, it would have been better received.

The focus is really all over the place and that is part of the charm. And probably also why it was rejected, but the ensemble cast works. Bridget Fonda is adorable, probably the most relatable in the cast, but it does manage the ""I know people like that"" characters, and the ""I've done that"" scenes that makes it relatable across the cast.  Cliff, for example, Matt Dillon's character, you knew someone like that in your twenties.  ""If I make this basked, I should call him,"" everyone's done that over something.

So it has marks for relatability,  it has marks for a well done ensemble.  It does what Romantic Comedies should do, they just needed to bring all the characters into the apartment complex to really pull it off better."

Swanson plays her part for all that it's worth; I certainly couldn't fault her enthusiasm and Perry was an handsome man and provides an extra degree of slightly comedic eye-candy in what is otherwise a throwaway television movie that is probably only ever going to be remembered for spawning the television series five years later. I didn't hate it, I have to say.

I didn't like this film. It's a low-budget film, directed by Rémy Belvaux, which basically makes a kind of false documentary around the criminal and violent activities of a cruel and bloodthirsty killer, who accepts being filmed while he kills his victims. A film that looks like an academic work by a film student, and not something made for the public. It will certainly be an interesting film for film students and cinema critics, but it is not something I recommend to the general public.

The film has frankly positive points, starting with the excellent performance of Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays the main character and is the only character worthy of the name here. Everything else is extras or people who simply have to appear there. The realism is impressive and, at times, shocking, and the cinematography, in black and white, is very good and worked with creativity by the director.

The film's biggest problem is the feeling of amateurism and experimentalism that is felt at various moments. It's also one of those extremely violent films where everything happens without there really being a reason, a reason for being. Much of the film is a succession of violent crimes where there is nothing more than purposeless violence. The killer kills because he does, and it seems that the journalists following him are also filming because they have to film something. || One of the most amateur movies I have laid my eyes on.

This entire movie is an agonizing display of the directer/writer's alter ego, over acted and over the top with violence. Everything feels pointless, and the ending really exasperates that.

Hong Kong has a long history of good action cinema, but this movie didn't seem that good and interesting to me. Many people love it, they say it is wonderful, and I accept that very well, I think that everyone has their own tastes, but the truth is that the film did not work for me. Sounds like an excuse for an action movie.

John Woo is a director I don't know very well. I liked “The Killer” and, therefore, I decided to see this film: it is considered, by many people, one of the director's best. They're not even alike. It is noted that it is the same director, there is a certain style and look, and some shooting options, which are in both films, but we lack a good script, a convincing story. From the middle, sensibly, the director's brutality and bloodlust lose the brake: in minutes, we watch in the armchair what we can only classify as a gratuitous bloodbath (false, obviously).

I would like to talk a little about the actors, but I felt that none of them has the time, space and material to represent a character properly. They are there to kill or die, according to the wishes and desires of the Machiavellian Woo, who abuses visual effects, brutality, the toughest and most soulless action that we can see on a cinema screen. Loaded with graphic effects that accompany a cinematography worthy of an industrial rock music video, the film takes us from massacre to massacre and, before halfway through, we already begin to doubt that there is a live cast. In truth, and to be fair, the film also has the grace of being quite immersive, be it for the good use of sound effects, be it for its magnificently adequate soundtrack, be it for the fast and visceral filming. We are part of that, we are there. And that makes it even harder to bear, depending on how insensitive you can be."

Based on the classic John Steinbeck novel and released in 1992, the story focuses on two traveling companions desperate for work in rural California during the Depression: George (Gary Sinise) is of average stature and smart whereas Lennie (John Malkovich) is big and mentally challenged. They get a gig at a big ranch while dreaming of owning their own one day when the opportunity suddenly presents itself. Unfortunately, the arrogant son of the owner, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), and his flirtatious wife (Sherilyn Fenn) complicate matters. John Terry is on hand as Slim, Ray Walston plays Candy and Joe Morton plays Crooks.

I've been a fan of this potent Western drama/tragedy ever since I read the book as a teenager and both this version and the 1939 version are worthy film adaptions (I have yet to see the 1981 TV production with Robert Blake and Randy Quaid, which I've heard is good). It seems that you just cannot do a 'bad' ""Of Mice and Men,"" as long as you have decent actors and filmmakers.

Some people scoff at the moral of the story, as if it all comes down to shooting your aged, useless dog yourself, but it's way more than this. It's a commentary on the nature of companionship and loneliness: Whereas George and Lennie compliment each other many of the other characters languish in isolation, like Candy, Curley's wife and Crooks, even Slim. Questions of strength, weakness, usefulness, reality and utopia are explored as the story leaves you scratching your head.

Comparing the two versions, I slightly prefer the newer rendition because it's in color and is just overall better made with a superior score and cast with the exception of Lon Chaney as Lennie. Malkovich is very effective in the more recent version, but Chaney's Lennie is just more likable. While I don't like the addition of cussing in the 1992 rendition, it's probably more realistic and it isn't so bad that it makes the movie unwatchable (for me anyway). In any case, Sherilyn Fenn is a vast improvement over the original's Betty Field, who's annoying and not desirable enough to pull off the part (but, then again, she might be desirable to male ranch hands with no other females within a dozen miles).

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in California.

GRADE: A- 

EXTRA COMMENTARY 

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you know the story) 

Curley's wife has only ever been valued for her sexuality, which she has learned to use to attract attention. Not only is she the only female character, she's also the only character not to be given a name in the book and the 1992 version, which emphasizes that she's a sexual plaything, currently owned by Curley. She was repressed by her mother and taken advantage of by men who made her empty promises. She prefers to believe that her mother stole her letters from the ""Hollywood"" man who used her, instead of accepting reality. She is married to a boor who places little value on her and so she seeks the only attention she can get from the men on the ranch as the only woman there: sexual attention. The contact with Lennie in the barn is as far as sexual as it gets. When she says ""It feels good"" to have her hair stroked, she isn't speaking sexually. She is enjoying the only nonsexual attention and affectionate touch she has had in a very long time, if ever. It is almost a meeting of children between this woman who long ago lost her sexual innocence but remains hopelessly naïve, and Lennie, who also longs for soft things in his life. It is a beautiful, tragic scene.

Someone argued that Curley's wife wanted to get Lennie on her side so that he would kill Curley and she would be free to leave. If Lennie killed him, no one would believe him if he ever said that she told him to do it; and since she didn't do the deed herself, she could easily leave and start her life over, hopefully as a movie star. While an interesting theory, the young woman doesn't come across this devious or cunning in the story where her actions are more natural and naïve. Similar to Lennie, she was a child in an adult body, albeit not mentally challenged. She was starving for companionship, but none of the other men would hang out with her due to Curley and the threat of losing their job. Lennie was alone in the barn and so she just took advantage of the occasion to converse with someone. Add to this the fact that Lennie was the only man on the ranch to humble (conquer) her arrogant SOB husband, whom she hated. Plus, she noticed earlier how Lennie appraised her with obvious awe. So there was a subconscious attraction and she wanted the gentle giant to touch her, stroke her hair; perhaps to ""reward"" him."

I have to admit that I once never gave this film much love, I loved the first two to such a degree that I felt this third and final instalment was way off being a fitting closure to what was at the time a trilogy. Yet as time has wore on I have really grown fond of the film, Parker Posey no longer annoys the hell out of me, the once jarring itch of watching the makers kill off a fave character of mine in the opening sequence is something I now view as a masterstroke, and the twisty ending that was once an irksome pest has moved on to be the perfect ""trilogy"" closure.

Scream 3 has its tongue firmly in its cheek, it's aware of its number and it's aware of its formulaic root, so in spite of treading familiar ground (I mean come on gang, have you not learnt nothing from your previous experiences), the returning characters still have our undivided attention. While the transporting of the story to Hollywood, with its movie within a movie structure, is fresh and adds a new dimension to proceedings. New additions to the scary fun are Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Lance Henriksen and the afore mentioned Parker Posey, and all of them add greatly to the mysterious plot unfolding.

The death quotient is still high, and the Wes Craven school of whodunitry is well and truly open, and I personally feel that this one is easily the funniest film of the three, witness Jay & Silent Bob turning up, a Carrie Fisher sequence that once heard will never be forgotten, and a video appearance by passed on geek god Randy Meeks. Scream 3 closes the ""trilogy"" just fine, it's got bags of energy and a glint in its eye, now if only I could get a copy of the uncompleted Stab 3 off the internet - and if only there wasn't to be a part 4 further down the line... 7/10 || Not even a brief cameo from ""Princess Leia"" herself - passing lively comment on George Lucas's casting techniques, can save this entirely derivative trequel. Amidst the filming of ""Stab 3"", people start to drop like flies almost exactly as they might following script of this soon to be completed masterpiece. The new slasher starts as he/she/it means to go on, by dispatching poor old ""Cotton"" (Liev Schreiber) and his girlfriend before turning attention to the old guard of ""Sidney"" (Neve Prescott), Courteney Cox (""Gale"") - and their movie-star doppelgängers whilst the indomitable ""Dewey"" (David Arquette) laudably, but ineffectively, keeps a look out as the corpses pile up. This is a really poor rehash of the original with almost exactly the same plot with the same red herrings, screeching hysteria and audio-induced jump-points. Although the structure of the story is marginally different, the ending is just as ridiculously left field and reminded me of something Agatha Christie might have drafted before she tossed it on the fire. This gift has stopped giving for Wes Craven, time to stop! || **_Scream 3’s_ lackluster screenplay and unimaginative kills leave a film that is a bore to watch.**

The meta-narrative of trilogies throughout the film does not make up for how abysmal the plot was. This film creates so much lore for the past movies seemingly out of the blue, muddling up the continuity for shock value. It added very little to this film and felt forced. The entire plot point of Sidney’s mother being a former Hollywood actress was pretty lame, especially with the added plot point of her being sexually assaulted by a movie producer. It may be personal taste, but I absolutely despise when films add that plot point, as it feels incredibly hypocritical since it is something that genuinely happens to an industry, they are involved in. The love triangle between Gale, Dewey, and the Gale actress was pretty dumb and felt undeserved, as we have not seen Gale and Dewey actually together in any of the films.

In horror films, you can have a good movie with a terrible plot as long as the kills are great. Unfortunately, Scream 3 continues the trend of having boring kills with no imagination. There has been only one truly unique kill throughout the entire franchise, and the rest are unbloody stab kills. I understand the meta being about stabbing with a knife, as the in-film movie is called Stab, but please add some gore to it. There is nothing, no blood squirts or body horror, and it caused the entire movie to be boring.

Our performances were exactly how I would describe Scream 2, with both Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox being the standouts and David Arquette being average at best. All of the new characters were pretty uninteresting, all of the actors in the film were annoying, and the movie producers felt generic.

The direction of this film felt pretty uninspired. I am not sure if Wes Craven was forced to make this movie by the studio, but nothing about it felt unique and creative. It felt like he was phoning it in for a paycheck.

Overall, there were not a lot of redeeming qualities for this film, and it left me feeling unfulfilled as the final credits rolled. Hoping Scream IV has more in store for me than this lackluster film.

She ends up with a friendly identical twin that lost her sister when she was a girl (Jennifer Jason Leigh). A quality friendship develops until dubious things start happening.    

""Single White Female"" (1992) mixes elements of “Fatal Attraction” (1987) with the setting of “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968). It’s not great like the former, but it’s on par with the latter and arguably superior. The film possesses a haunting ambiance, which is assisted by the venue, but this same attribute eventually hinders the movie by making it one-dimensional. “Rosemary’s Baby” had the same problem. 

The fact that the two stars regularly appear in various stages of undress is titillating, yet it can’t make up for the one-note tone and locale. Still, the movie’s entertaining enough and I would’ve given it a better grade, but the third act is overlong and curiously tedious despite the slasher thrills. 

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot at Ansonia Hotel, Manhattan, and Raleigh Studios, Hollywood.

I first viewed this film upon its release and felt that the final third did the film down - and that the voice-over took away from the essence of the story, thus it's average. My subsequent viewings over the years would see me lament about an arcade game sequence and bemoaning that Robert Carlyle wasn't given a more extended role, yet it has become a film that sees me totally on board with director Danny Boyle's production and it's now that I think it puts the story together with poignant precision.

Leonardo DiCaprio is Richard, a backpacker searching for a bit more in life, after a meeting with pot smoking loony Daffy (the wonderful Robert Carlyle), he learns of an island paradise that is everything he has yearned for in his life. Getting there will give him the adventure and danger he craves, because once there it apparently will be the thing of dreams, the perfect paradise cut off from civilisation...

The film is very much split in two, the first half introduces us to Richard and the people he would convince to travel with him to this island paradise, we then follow their journey that is perfect in fleshing out the characters, they come up against obstacles and learn about each other on the way. The second half is well worth waiting for because it's here that the story kicks in to make the viewer think, it's idyllic, it's gorgeous, it's near perfect, but wherever there is a community, there will be personal hang ups, jealousies, power seekers and etc, in short, the surroundings may be perfect but the human condition is far from flawless.

I love this film now, I love DiCaprio's performance, a cocky smart-arse thrill seeker about to get a wake up call is tailor made for him, and he delivers it with a  skillful array of emotions. Director Danny Boyle does a great job of juggling the joys of paradise with the uneasy distortion of the various characters in the community, and the cinematography from Darius Khondji is truly beautiful (Thailand locales). The film suffers with the inevitable comparisons to Lord Of The Flies & Hearts Of Darkness, and yes these are fair comparisons, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's a fine film for the modern generation in its own right, with the core point of the story relevant to all and sundry.

Fans of the novel would prove to be very ambivalent towards this filmic adaptation, but in my book it gets better on repeat viewings. 8/10 || We are lucky that the photography depicts some of the most beautiful scenery on Earth as the rest of this adaptation of Alex Garland's book is positively stodgy. Talking of beautiful things, Leonardo DiCaprio still has something of his ""Romeo & Juliet"" (1996) boyishness to him as he arrives in Thailand. After an encounter with an enigmatic Scotsman (Robert Carlyle) who doesn't last for long, he finds himself in possession of a map that sets himself and a couple of travelling companions on a quest to find to a beautiful paradise island that is well off the beaten track. After a few tricky experiences that remind them all that it's called a wilderness for a reason, they arrive to find that ""Sal"" (Tilda Swinton) has already set up camp and with what amounts to a naturist commune has strict rules for those who want to remain there. Initially this idyll works for all, but a trip to town for supplies redefines the relationship between ""Richard"" and his host, and his own stupidity leaves a path for others to follow. With tragedy and bloodshed now ensuing, the Elysian concept of their perfect existence is quickly compromised by both nature and the angry locals. To be honest, it's a pretty thin story at the best of times and it really does rely heavily on the pristine aesthetics to carry it for a great deal of it's almost two hour crawl time. Swinton is always a master at the slightly aloof, less is more, kind of characterisations and Leo himself has the camera enthralled. As as piece of storytelling, though, it's really nothing special beyond a wordy and ponderous exercise in sending a salutary message that the ever expansive march of tourism ought to learn to keep of the grass and leave nature in it's many different guises to live in peace."

The crazy dirtbag manager of a rundown hotel in east Texas (Neville Brand) threatens his clients if they upset him and feeds them to his pet croc. The cast includes notables like Mel Ferrer, Stuart Whitman, Carolyn Jones and a young Robert Englund.

Despite the presence of the croc, “Eaten Alive” (1976) is more of a slasher flick than crocogator horror (the croc is strictly peripheral, not to mention unconvincing). This was Tobe Hooper’s follow-up to his unexpected hit “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) wherein he borrows the plot of “Psycho” (1960). Unfortunately, he spectacularly fumbles the ball. 

The surreal style, sets and cast are all good, but there’s a lack of confidence in the execution: The flick’s full of nonsensical actions, meanderings and padding. Hooper tried to make up for it by exploiting the women with lots of raunch & nudity, but “Chainsaw Massacre” proved that a slasher didn’t need this to be effective.

Janus Blythe stands out in the feminine department as Lynette, as does Roberta Collins as Clara. Marilyn Burns (Faye) and Crystin Sinclaire (Libby) are also noteworthy.

Thankfully, Hooper moved on to much better productions, like “Salem’s Lot” (1979), “The Funhouse” (1981) and “Crocodile” (2000).  

The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, CA.

GRADE: C-/D+ || Eaten Alive devours its chance of being a credible creature feature by rarely showing its toothy puppetry. Cult horror is typically hit or miss with my taste in cinema. Quite often, I’ll appreciate and/or understand the adoration for a flick that ages finer that a campy bloody drag act. Conversely, my mind is baffled in the reasoning behind such fondness at the best of times. Hooper’s subsequent work after the impeccable slasher ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’ falls into the latter. Unnecessarily sleazy, underdeveloped maniac-syndrome and useless character choices forces this swampy hotel to be nothing more than a stagnated mess, with surprisingly laughable results. A prostitute is evicted from the town brothel and subsequently finds herself checking in at the decrepit Starlight Hotel, owned by a scythe-wielding maniac and his pet Nile crocodile.

Raked to death. Scythed through the esophagus. Pushed into mystically inclined water and, you guessed it, eaten alive. Yet despite the repetitive murderous narrative structure, that sees little to no depth in the manager’s antagonistic motives (other than he’s cuckoo), there’s minimal cohesion throughout. Dumb characters check into the most dilapidated hotel available, accompanied by the ethereally strangest bright red light ever, strip so their breasts are on full-display and then encounter “Mr. Croc” (or Judd I think his name was...) who erotically moans his way to the porch where he feeds his pet puppet...I mean crocodile. With no dimensionality in any action he takes, we as the audience are simply watching his maniacal debauchery as a means of entertainment. Problem is, it’s rarely enjoyable when the characters are expendable bones. Even the abnormally shaped dog was immediately dispensable!

Hooper replicated many aspects from his previous directorial efforts. Frantically running around foliage whilst in pursuit by a blade-wielding psychopath, only to then be rescued by a passing vehicle. Bloody infrequent deaths that exercise cheap yet enjoyable, if you’re a sadist like myself, gore that heightens the horror vibes residing within. But the filmmaking and its contents hide in the shadow of ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’, and Eaten Alive can’t seem to chomp its way out.

And, again, it’s a consequence of how underdeveloped these characters are. Example: a fractious couple arrive, with the disturbed husband behaving more unusually than the flippin’ psychotic manager, to which their young daughter flees the scene and hides within the crawlspace of the hotel. For. The. Entire. Film. Screaming at anything that moves an inch, she doesn’t even try to escape knowing full well that the manager is occupied with other guests. Then the sheriff is introduced and doesn’t care about anything, running around his vehicle nonchalantly unconcerned by the bloody mess on the porch calmly stating “are you okay?”. Like heck is she okay! She just got tossed over the banister and scythed twice! Do they look like tears of joy to you? Englund, without his Freddy Krueger attire, arrives and makes love to a girl by stealing keys to a room and ignoring the squeals of a little girl underneath the floorboards? Yeah, I’m done with the characters.

The production design clearly emanated an inexpensive set, with the hotel walls looking like they would flake at any moment. Although, Hooper’s score was surprisingly unflinching and, despite the audacious noises made, gave this cult horror some edgy flavour. And the crocodile moving through the crawlspace? Incredibly animate, I must confess.

However, that doesn’t excuse a creature feature without prominently featuring its creature. Sure, less is more, but nothing is nothing. Masochistically sleazy, and naturally campy, yet failed to exercise its full potential by withdrawing any and all bite within its plot. || Yikes, what was Mel Ferrer thinking when accepted the, admittedly brief, part in this nonsense? Neville Brand plays well, though, as the eccentric old-timer ""Judd"" who keeps a ramshackle old motel right beside a creek in which lives his caged-in pet alligator. Despite being in the back of beyond, this little establishment receives it's fair share of visitors and well, yes - you can guess the rest. Meantime, Ferrer - the wealthy ""Wood"" is out searching for his daughter whom he thinks ended up on the game working for the star of the film - ""Miss Hattie"" (Carolyn Jones) who runs the local house of ill-repute. At times this is quite an entertainingly silly romp and I frequently wondered if Jack Elam would have been better in the lead role. There's no jeopardy: of course we all know what happens in the end, but on a big screen with the right amount Malbec in your system, this is quite a watchable ninety minutes of low-budget, studio-shot, cinema that raises the odd smile but certainly not the hairs on the back of your neck."

Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.

Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. 

The year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. 

Right from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... 

Okies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade ""A"" from those involved. 

It's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. 

The narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. 

The setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... 

The science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10 || One of those few movies that most people don't care for, but I personally think is **criminally** underrated.

That knowledge always made the load I was carrying seem less significant, and helped me to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. Cinematically speaking, at least in the fine age of silent movies, one of the most difficult gestation periods for the birth of a great film was the highly traumatic 11 months of production for one of Sir Charles Chaplin's masterpieces, 'The Circus'.

I love both silent cinema and early filmic comedies, and though I prefer Buster Keaton to Chaplin, I always enjoy his great works, up to and including 'The Great Dictator'. Particularly close to my heart is 'The Circus'. Considering all of the brutal disasters Sir Charles Chaplin was facing during the movie's elongated production (ruined film negative, studio burning down, Lita Grey's divorce papers [and the related sex-scandals hitting the papers], nervous breakdown, mother dying, IRS demanding a million in back taxes, one of the circus wagons being stolen, just to mention a few), it's miraculous that a film was released at all, let alone one as gracefully hilarious yet contemplatively mature as 'The Circus', and that he was able to both recover and rebound from this bad spell to have a superlative career as one of the greatest actor/directors ever to grace cinema. His life was basically a three-ring circus, and he was still able to retain his dignity and escape virtually unscathed.

Because of the aforementioned trials and tribulations he endured in those eleven months of the film's making (which IMHO would be worthy of a fine film itself, in its documentation and chronicling), though it may not be as side-splitting in its hilarity as 'The Gold Rush' or 'Modern Times', it will probably hold the closest place to my heart of Chaplin's films."

Released in 1984, ""The Flamingo Kid"" is a coming-of-age beach flick. What occasionally draws me to these types of films is their youthful energy and fun spirit, as well as the oceanic locations and the women. It brings one back in time to the carefree era of his/her coming-of-age years. Thankfully, ""The Flamingo Kid"" shoots for something deeper than just a shallow beach flick, which the best ones do, e.g. the original “Gidget” (1959).

The story takes place in 1963 where 18-year-old Jeffrey (Matt Dillon), a plumber's son from Brooklyn, gets a summer job at a private beach club on Long Island called the El Flamingo. This was his final summer of carefree fun before going off to college, but his experiences at the club change his plans. He makes loads of money on tips, meets a beautiful blonde and becomes fascinated by a new mentor, a fast-talking businessman and card shark, Phil Brody (Richard Crenna).

Brody convinces Jeffrey that there are easier, faster (i.e. dishonest) ways to make loads of money than going off to college for years on end. When Jeffry cancels his college plans and moves out of his house it naturally creates friction with his father (Hector Elizondo). Will he go on to become the next generation's fast-talking businessman/card shark?

Almost the entire film was shot on location at a Queens’ beach club with loads of gorgeous females on hand, including Jeffrey's girlfriend in the story, Carla played by Janet Jones, whose body is so well sculptured she could’ve been Wonder Woman (the movie even jokes about this). Carole Davis also shines as Brody’s brunette daughter, Joyce, a low-key part. Cutie Marisa Tomei even has a cameo.

The bottom line is that ""The Flamingo Kid"" offers everything you'd want in such a film and more, including an interesting story where you care about the outcome. And, thankfully, there's NO RAUNCH (well, maybe a flash). In addition, the soundtrack includes numerous early 60's hits like ""Runaround Sue,"" etc. What's not to like?

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.

Two Little Tramps

The most amazing thing about Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid is that it was released in January of 1921. That makes this film 100 years old! A century has gone by since it was made, released, and first viewed, and yet it’s still available to be appreciated anew today. The DVD print that I watched was in very good shape, the picture was great, and I felt that I was watching an important piece of cinema history.

However, The Kid is by no means one of my favorite Chaplin films. In fact, two out of my top three aren’t even silent films, but prime examples of Chaplin’s later work: Monsieur Verdoux (1947) and Limelight (1952). And my third favorite, the 1936 masterpiece Modern Times, is only two-thirds silent!

The plot of the film is quite simple: our beloved Little Tramp finds another little tramp, and and raises the foundling as his own. Years pass, and together, they rise above their life of poverty through the power of love and comedy.

“Professionally funny” is a phrase that I thought a fitting description of Chaplin. He was an artistic genius, and he knew what he was doing and how to engage an audience. In fact, this was his first feature-length film, and he took a whopping five-and-a-half months to shoot it, which was an incredible amount of time for a film production in 1921. Chaplin, of course, not only starred, but wrote, directed, produced, and scored the film!

Jackie Coogan was fantastic as “the Kid”, displaying a wide range of emotion and deftly tugging at the viewer’s heartstrings. His father, Jack Coogan, Sr., coached his son during filming and was paid $125 a week by Chaplin, and also played several small parts within the movie.
Chaplin and Coogan in The Kid (1921)

It is said that Chaplin and Coogan were as close off-screen as on, and every Sunday during the first few weeks of filming, Chaplin would take the boy to the amusement park or other fun activities. This relationship was seen as either an attempt on Chaplin’s part to reclaim his own unhappy childhood, or possibly he was just thinking about his own son whom he had lost, having died three days after birth.

The Kid features a truly bizarre dream sequence in which the Tramp falls asleep on his doorstep and dreams of everyone — including himself — as an angel or demon.

He envisions himself as an angel, with white, feathery wings spread out behind him, and a harp in his hand. Others, including a neighborhood bully, appear as demons, depicted traditionally in dark (presumably red) attire and horns atop their heads. Even a little dog, suspended on wires, comes floating by in a little angel costume!

It’s one of the strangest and most inexplicable dream sequences I’ve seen in a film, and yet it is oddly captivating.

The technical aspects in this film — both in the dream sequence and in the rest of the movie — are marvelous when one considers that it was made a hundred years ago, when the movie medium itself was less than thirty years old.

Whether or not it is one of Chaplin’s greatest works is up to the individual viewer, but you cannot deny that it is a landmark movie, and holds an important place in the history of American cinema. It deserves a look, maybe even more than one. As the opening title card reads, it’s “a picture with a smile — and perhaps, a tear.” || An impoverished woman (Edna Purviance) feels compelled to abandon her child in the hope that he might find a better life - so she leaves him (with a short note) in the back of a car. The two men who find the little bundle don't want anything to do with him, so plonk him down behind some rubbish where de is discovered by the tramp (Charlie Chaplin). Now he's not that keen on children either, but the presence of an attentive policeman means can't just leave his new package in the pram of a woman nearby. Skip on five years and the two have become quite a formidable double act - the lad (Jackie Coogan) chucks stones at windows and his father-figure does the mending! Meantime, the mother finds success treading the boards and the boy's real father, likewise, succeeds - but that relationship is toast and she gradually starts to pine for and then search for her lost child. When the authorities cotton on to the lucrative acts of vandalism of the two, they attempt to seize the kid and put him in an orphanage - and that's when things all start to come to an head. There's a delightful bond that develops here between Chaplin and the enthusiastic young Coogan with Chaplin's direction showcasing both their skills and the extent of the poverty amidst which they lived and which drove people to make horrendous decisions to part with their children. The ending is exactly as it should be, so don't go expecting much jeopardy on that front - and the scenes with the angelic wings towards the end mix determination and comedy effectively, too. It makes you smile and pulls at the heart strings and is truly a classic piece of cinema."

Complemented by some amiable song and dance numbers that show off her skills and remind us of just what Edinburghers were seeing at the theatre at the start of the 1950s, this is quite a daft little comedy which allows Niven to do what he did best and Romero to prove he could deliver well enough as a comedy foil. The music itself is all fairly unremarkable, there's no killer routine - but there's a conviviality to the whole thing that pokes a little fun at us Scots, the theatre industry and it offers us not the slightest degree of jeopardy to the predicable ending."

I usually have very little patience for movies about writers because I am one, and I get tired of them bringing up writers’ block, which I don’t believe exists, or else they have the character become wildly successful in record time. There are a lot of struggling actresses and musicians and waitresses in movies, but writers often get fast-track succes.

Anyway, I wander off topic. I enjoyed the movie with its range of quirky characters, and minor plot twists. There are only a couple of two-dimensional characters; the rest are given depth, even a few who don’t have a lot of screen time. It shows what can be achieved with a good ensemble cast and a decent script. || ""Prof. Tripp"" (Michael Douglas) hasn't his troubles to seek. He hasn't been able to follow up on his first novel for almost seven years - much to the chagrin of his agent ""Terry"" (Robert Downey Jr); his third wife has left him and he is about to father a child with his (married) boss (Frances McDormand) at the university where he works. His writer's block isn't really much helped by the omnipresence of his star pupil ""James"" (Tobey Maguire) nor by his increasingly debilitating pot habit. It's the man's mid life crisis from hell, but can he navigate a way out of this and keep some semblance of his self respective and, maybe even his career! Meantime, his protégé is having a few issues of his own - not least because he accidentally shot the principal's dog and he is the object of the amorous attentions of the ambisextrous ""Terry"" too! There's quite a decent dynamic between Douglas and Maguire as both men have to come to terms with their own problems and with their growing reliance on and frustration of each other and there is plenty of witty dialogue that is more complexly structured and subtly potent at times. The narrative is quite tightly packed into just one weekend, and that helps keeps the momentum going as the characters develop in quite a plausible - and not always likeable - fashion. Luckily, the one-dimensional Katie Holmes appears only sparingly as the plot thickens to a nicely bubbling stew at the end. It's a decent reminder that Douglas could act, given a strong story and script, and he shows us that well here with this superior ensemble drama."

After a hit goes wrong through no fault of the assassin's own, his mafia liaison Louie (John Tormey) is sympathetic, but explains that his superiors now want Ghost Dog dead. The film follows Ghost Dog's revenge and depicts a clash between two ancient tribes that both seem out of date in this modern world: Ghost Dog's samurai code and Italian mafia ideas of loyalty.

Jarmusch has always been open about the fact that he soaks up a huge number of inspirations from earlier films, books, and music and then lets them reflect in his own work. Any cinephile will instantly recognize Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 film Le Samouraï as the point of departure for GHOST DOG. In Meville's classic, a Parisian hired assassin lives according to a strict code. But Melville didn't really know much about Japan, and even the quotation from a samurai text at the beginning of his film was just made up by Meville himself. Jarmusch seems to have decided, ""OK, I'll show you a hired-assassin film that's *really* rooted in the code of the Samurai"". Forest Whitaker quotes from Hagakure throughout the film, and there are also references to the work of Akira Kurosawa.

But GHOST DOG is not a remake, and Jarmusch takes the basic premise in a very individual direction. There's a lot of humour here, something missing from the serious Melville inspiration. In casting for the mafia dons, Jarmusch chose faces as brutal and distinctive as Dick Tracy's rogues gallery: Henry Silva as the don, and Cliff Gorman and Gene Ruffini as his righthand men. But Jarmusch then gives them the occasional zany line that cracks that chilling façade. Isaach de Bankole plays a supporting role as a French-speaking Haitian immigrant and Ghost Dog's best friend, a role that is pure comic relief because the man doesn't speak English and Ghost Dog doesn't understand French, but they always manage to understand each other.

Until the late 1990s, Jarmusch had mainly been known as a fairly low-budget independent filmmaker writing cute little stories about personal relationships in low-key American life. Jarmusch's America was consistently depicted as run-down neighbourhoods and overgrown vacant lots. With its generous budget, large cast and special effects, GHOST DOG marked a huge leap forward in Jarmusch's work. Still, it maintains Jarmusch's interest in America as a land of urban blight and seedy underbellies: most of the film takes place in an ugly New Jersey urban setting. Furthermore, instead of being glamorized, the Italian mafia is depicted as a spent force, mainly elderly men who can't rake in the cash and influence they used to, and even forced to pay protection money to Chinese newcomers. As the film reaches its shocking ending, the glamour is drained from Ghost Dog's warrior code, as well.

The music for GHOST DOG was provided by RZA, at the time still best known as part of the Wu-Tang Clan. The music mainly consists of wordless beats, though, with actual rapping only at a few points. Personally, I find the use of hip-hop a weak point of the film (Jarmusch looks like an outsider looking in to this scene, unable to organically make it part of his own work), and RZA's insistence on appearing in the film itself disrupts the rhythm of the film's climax."

Frank McCloud is in the Florida Keys to visit the widow and father in law of an old war buddy, whilst at the hotel they run, he finds it has been taken over by gangster Johnny Rocco and his thugs.

The cast, the performances, the screenplay, tight direction, the photography and on it goes to give us a bona fide entry into 1940s classics. It never ceases to amaze me how well Key Largo stands up on repeat viewings, each viewing bringing something new to my ever keen eye. This latest viewing brought me abundant joy in observing the background acting of the supporting players, not one of them looking on waiting for the director to shout CUT, each adding greatly with intense facial mannerisms - check out some of the background stuff Thomas Gomez does for example. Ah intense, what a truly befitting word to use as regards John Huston's direction here, perfectly capturing the stifling heat of Largo and coupling it with the sweltering tension inside this run down hotel.

Key Largo is often thought of as the lesser film from the Bogart/Bacall production line, which in fairness is against some pretty special opposition. Maybe we do lose the sexual chemistry of the mighty duo here? but in its place is a mano-mano face off teetering on the brink of explosion, Edward G Robinson's weasel Rocco in danger of becoming a loose cannon to McCloud's staid drifter, the atmosphere is palpable as this room full of hate and mistrust starts bubbling towards boiling point.

Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actress), Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are all excellent, all benefiting from master director Huston molding them together. Whilst Karl Freund's deep focus photography perfectly encapsulates the mood of the piece. I just love Key Largo so much, from a heart tugging singing for your drink scene, to a retreating in the shadows shot of Bacall, Key Largo is one of the reasons I became a cinema obsessive. 9/10 || A brilliant John Huston thriller with an unbeatable cast: Bogart, Bacall, Robinson, and Barrymore! It's neither amazing nor a secret as to why this classic noir will never get stale. || A storm is about to break over Key Largo, but that's nothing compared to the emotional eruptions going on inside James Temple's run-down hotel, where the crippled old proprietor, his daughter-in-law, and a disillusioned ex-GI are being held up by the notorious gangster, Johnny Rocco.  What does he want?  Well, to put in his own words, he wants ""more"".  And his temper, as well as his gun, could very well go off at any given moment.  Mr. Temple, you might want to stop antagonizing him.  This brilliant, tense noir is, in my opinion, one of master director John Huston's best.  Considered by some to be one of the lesser Bogie/Bacall pairings, it's still a superb film that you don't want to miss.  Some of the movie's best moments are (1) Claire Trevor, as Rocco's alcoholic moll, desperately singing for the sadistic Rocco and hoping to be rewarded with a drink, and (2) the verbal battles between the arrogant Rocco, and the wonderfully feisty Mr. Temple.

Would I recommend?  Yes, yes, and...yes."

24481.0,Born Yesterday,"Uncouth, loud-mouth junkyard tycoon Harry Brock descends upon Washington D.C. to buy himself a congressman or two, bringing with him his mistress, ex-showgirl Billie Dawn.",It's Here AT LAST!,"Comedy, Romance",103,1950-12-26,en,7.2,172,0.803,"Judy Holliday, Broderick Crawford, William Holden, Howard St. John, Frank Otto",George Cukor,"washington dc, usa, congress, tycoon, based on play or musical, political satire","Possibly the most endearing ""dumb blonde"" ever?

Judy Holliday rightly won the best actress Oscar for her portrayal of dumb blonde kept woman Billie Dawn, a role she successfully played on Broadway in the stage show production. Yet to only mention her would be doing a disservice to the films other strengths as it has many to justify it being labelled a classic of its time.

Billie Dawn is the girlfriend of scrap metal magnate Harry Brock, she's not that bright and Brock uses her as a front for some less than honest dealings. Sure he cares but his treatment of her borders on the repulsive whilst still managing to get the ribs tickled, Brock worries that her dumbness will do down important business issues socially, so he arranges for the calm and well spoken Paul Verrall to be her chaperon and train her to be eloquent and more astute of the world and its history.

The film then becomes your standard Pygmalion story as the nice but dim Billie not only learns about the world she lives in, she also learns about the world SHE HAS been living in, and coupled with the sexual awakening she finds with Verrall this fills out the rest of the story. It's full of delightful scenes that linger long in the memory, and outside of Holliday's brilliant performance, we get a wonderful example of the polar opposite Male love interest, Broderick Crawford as Brock is a maelstrom of shouting daftness, a man that makes you cringe such is his buffoonery. On the other hand we get the serene and well mannered Verrall played with the right amount of pathos by William Holden, and it is with much credit that amongst the loud brash shows from the other stars, he remains more than a distant memory.

The comedy here will make you cringe one minute, and then have you giggling away the next, all the chief characters here engage you in the way they are meant to, the climax may be a bit too condensed for some but it's a fine ending that befits the previous efforts you have just witnessed, and I defy anyone to not laugh at the gin rummy sequence! 8/10 || Intelligent script and a very funny movie, a true classic with a perfect cast. Judy Holliday steals the show, and both Crawford and Holden are at the top of their game. You will not be disappointed! || Born Yesterday’s philosophy – a fusion of Greek myth and allegory; specifically, Pygmalion (by way of Shaw) and Plato’s Cave – is not only timeless but timely. At one point, William Holden’s character says “I want everybody to be smart. I want 'em to be as smart as they can be. A world full of ignorant people is too dangerous to live in.” This is as true now as it was more than 70 years ago – perhaps truer; as recent events, such as the covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have made abundantly clear, the world is still a very dangerous place full of ignorant people.

This film is not only about the beauty and richness of the written and spoken language, but also about the power of words and thoughts. An uncouth, older, wealthy junkyard tycoon, Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) comes to Washington in order to bribe a congressman. Brock brings along his “fiancee” (more like lover; and although he does intend to eventually marry her, it’s only because a wife cannot be forced to testify against her husband) Billie Dawn (Judy Holliday), an uneducated young woman. When Billie embarrasses him socially, Brock hires journalist Paul Verrall (Holden) to tutor her.

Billie is willfully ignorant (“[Harry] thinks I'm too stupid, huh? … He's right. I'm stupid, and I like it … I'm happy. I got everything I want … There's somethin' I want, I ask … So, as long as I know how to get what I want, that's all I wanna know.”), and in that sense she has more in common with the prisoners of Plato’s allegorical cave than with Eliza Doolittle; accordingly, Paul doesn’t settle for improving her vocabulary and diction, but encourages her to read, learn, think, and ask questions, while director George Cukor challenges the audience to do the same.

I seldom use the term ‘must-see’ to describe a work of art (after all, art is not supposed to be a chore), and Born Yesterday can certainly be enjoyed on its aesthetic and technical merits alone, but I would be remiss if I didn’t stress that this is a film that comes as close to compulsory viewing as any I’ve ever seen. Nine out of 10 times it’s surely going to be like casting pearls to swine, but I would still recommend it to as many people as possible, hoping that at least one of them will be like the person who received the seed that fell on good soil."
