_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || Decided to revisit this after many years and still holds up so well. Great movie for both kids and adults with wonderful teachable moments. Just a groundbreaking animated movie all around. **4.5/5** || A stunning feature film entrance from Pixar! <em>'Toy Story'</em> is a true delight, from the first second to the last.

The CGI animation is excellent. All the toys look brilliant, as does the world itself - I love the feel of it. The music is very good, Randy Newman does a nice job - ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" is a cracker.

Tom Hanks leads a strong cast. Hanks plays Woody, to fantastic effect. He is the best part of this film. Tim Allen is great, too, as Buzz Lightyear. Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Wallace Shawn (Rex) and John Ratzenberger (Hamm) also bring fun.

Everything else is just as terrific: the humour, the pacing, the plot - I enjoy it all. There are probably some flaws in parts, namely Buzz's supposed unawareness, but nothing impacts the viewing experience. Go watch!"

Jumanji is directed by Joe Johnston and based on Chris Van Allsburg's short story of the same name. It stars Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, Bradley Pierce and Jonathan Hyde. The story is about a weird board game that when played unleashes hazards from the jungle with every throw of the dice. Once you have started playing you have to finish the game for normality to be resumed.

Simple in plot and coming off as an excuse to show off some impressive effects -said the critics - Jumanji defied the critics of the time to become a box office winner and a family favourite. Enough of a favourite to spawn a sequel (Zathura 2005), an animated TV series and a board game. In truth the film is reliant on the effects to entertain, with the cast (all competent and enjoyable) merely lurching from one perilous throw of the dice to another. But to call the film shallow is wrong and ignorant. There's flecks of bad parenting, peer pressure, grief and bullying, while the impact of a missing child on one town is a noteworthy addition to the story line. You wonder if those critics actually paid attention during their free viewings?

Yes it's berserker family fun, but it's not without worth in the writing either. Besides which, for the action set pieces and the laughs, they alone mean the film has its merits. 7/10 || The original movie. Robin Williams makes this movie funny. Honestly without him the movie would be nothing."

Firstly, allow me to say that I am not one of those who think that there can or should be untouchable films, which due to their value or relevance should never be subject to revisits or remakes. “Sabrina”, the original film starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, is a renowned classic and its place will never be in question. However, after seeing this modern remake, I can't help but feel that it was unnecessary. Despite being a good film, it can't be better than the original, it isn't the slightest bit different, and it wasn't able to update the original story. I really don't know where Sidney Pollack was able to think this was a good idea.

The story of this film, as well as a large amount of the dialogue, are copied from the original onto carbon paper, with almost no essential modifications. In fact, the most striking phrases of the dialogues are all there, the situations are the same. Where the film tries to be better is, essentially, in the high production values and the updating of a series of details without great relevance. For example, young Sabrina no longer goes to Paris to become a chef, but to work as an assistant at “Vogue” magazine. And of course, the sets, the filming locations, the props, everything takes us back to contemporary times and is done with the utmost good taste, from the choice of the mansion to the Larrabee corporate headquarters. And given that Pollack is a renowned and highly prestigious director, it's no surprise that the cinematography and soundtrack are also excellent: he was able to find the best. For example, the soundtrack is written by John Williams and, although it is not a remarkable work by the composer, it still has the quality he has accustomed us to.

As for the cast, Pollack also bet on great actors, with solid credits and a solid career in the seventh art. The three main protagonists are Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear, and the latter is perhaps the director's riskiest bet. Ormond and Ford give us, each in their own way, solid and consistent interpretations. However, if in the original film the huge age difference between Bogart and Hepburn was barely noticeable, this was glaring here, and it is extremely bizarre to see Ormond flirting with a man who appears to be her father. And with an aggravating factor: Ford is not, and has never been, an actor particularly suited to romantic plots, it is not a comfortable terrain for him. As a result, Ford and Ormond's romantic chemistry resembles a wall between them. Greg Kinnear does what he can, but doesn't have the strong charisma that is necessary for playboy David. The film also features contributions from John Wood, Nancy Marchand, Lauren Holly and Paul Giamatti."
949.0,Heat,Obsessive master thief Neil McCauley leads a top-notch crew on various daring heists throughout Los Angeles while determined detective Vincent Hanna pursues him without rest. Each man recognizes and respects the ability and the dedication of the other even though they are aware their cat-and-mouse game may end in violence.,A Los Angeles crime saga.,"Crime, Drama, Action",170,1995-12-15,en,7.921,7688,11.2661,"Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore","Michael Mann, Michael Mann","robbery, chase, obsession, detective, heist, thief, honor, murder, betrayal, gang, los angeles, california, cat and mouse, bank robbery, criminal mastermind, cynical, ex-con, one last job, loner, bank job, neo-noir, crime epic, tense, antagonistic, audacious, bold","You don't live with me, you live among the remains of dead people.

Heat is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti.

Big time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself.

In the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director whose kink for realism and commitment to research stands him out from much of the modern directing pack.

Rarely does a film come together as one, where all the cogs of the engine are in tune, but Heat is one such picture. From cast performances to visual aesthetics, to screenplay and actual substance of story, Heat is as meticulous as it is thrilling. There are a myriad of characters brilliantly stitched together in one de-glamorised City of Angels, as plot develops, and each character and their crumbling relationships come under inspection, we are witnessing a coarse viewpoint of human nature, where people's lives are ended or defined by their choices. Everywhere you look, here, there are folk cracking under the strain of being exposed to high end crime, dreams, hopes and happiness are unlikely to be achieved, and this is on both sides of the law.

For Heat, Mann fuses the tonal and visual ticks of Manhunter with that of the adrenalin rushes from Last of the Mohicans, with the former gorgeously born out by Spinoti's pin sharp photography, the latter thrillingly realised by Mann's skill at action set pieces. Once again word of mouth about the key heist and shoot out in the film led to high expectation, and again there is no disappointment. L.A. becomes a battle ground, rapid gunfire punctures the air, cars swerve and crash, bodies fall, visually and aurally it drags you to the edge of your seat, an extended action sequence fit to sit with the best of them. The kicker as well is that because Mann has been so detailed in his characterisations, we care about what happens to all parties, we understand motives and means. Which in a film with such a huge support cast is quite an achievement.

There is enough in Heat to fill out a dozen other cops and robbers films, fans of neo-noir and crime films in general are spoilt supreme here. It's not rocket science really, put a group of great actors together, give them an intelligent script to work from and let them be guided by a director who will not sit still, and you get a great film. Heat, the ultimate predator and prey movie, where from beginning to end it refuses to be lazy or cop out, and energy and thought seeps from every frame. 10/10 || Partly I'm disappointed in myself for taking so long to watch _Heat_ because it's such a massive influence on one of the best movies ever (_The Dark Knight_), and one my favourite video games ever (_Payday: The Heist_).

Mostly though, I'm disappointed in myself for taking so long to watch _Heat_ because I've denied myself for so long the privilege of having seen such a great fucking crime movie.

_Final rating:★★★★ - An all round good movie with a little something extra._ || **Heat earns its way onto top 25 lists for heist films and 90s action, but its faults keep it low in the rankings.**

Heat gets so many things right. The stellar cast continues to surprise me with all the different names and faces I recognize when I watch it. The action is exceptional, especially considering this film is over 25 years old. The shoot-out in the middle of the movie is riveting, raw, and powerfully hard-hitting. The story made it impossible to guess exactly how it would turn out - was the cop going to get his man, or was the mastermind thief going to get away? Heat belongs on best heist and action movie lists but not nearly as high as many lists rank it. Heat carries some annoying faults. The ending of the film is abrupt and unsatisfying. The runtime is at least 45 minutes too long. The biggest frustration was Al Pacino’s performance. He was so over the top that his character felt like he was in the wrong movie. Every other action delivered genuine and serious performances while Pacino was screaming about women’s butts. What? Heat is a good film, but these low points keep it from being great."
45325.0,Tom and Huck,"A mischievous young boy, Tom Sawyer, witnesses a murder by the deadly Injun Joe. Tom becomes friends with Huckleberry Finn, a boy with no future and no family. Tom has to choose between honoring a friendship or honoring an oath because the town alcoholic is accused of the murder. Tom and Huck go through several adventures trying to retrieve evidence.",A lot of kids get into trouble. These two invented it.,"Family, Action, Adventure, Drama",97,1995-12-22,en,5.3,197,0.8963,"Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Brad Renfro, Eric Schweig, Charles Rocket, Amy Wright",Peter Hewitt,"based on novel or book, mississippi river, male friendship","Good enough.

It doesn't come close to Disney's other film from the 1990s featuring Mark Twain's Huckleberry, <em>'The Adventures of Huck Finn'</em>. In fairness, this one is more about Tom Sawyer than Huck, which is pleasing given they already portrayed Huck just two years prior.

The actor who depicts the latterly named character is Brad Renfro, who isn't all that to be truthful; he's fine, just not memorable at all. Jonathan Taylor Thomas, meanwhile, plays Tom and he is, probably, the best part of this production. He's cheekiness works well for the role. Elsewhere, Eric Schweig (Injun Joe) makes for a decent bad guy.

I like the vibe of <em>'Tom and Huck'</em>, I think it could've done without the love story but that doesn't hamper things much. I would say the film goes at a slower pace than I would prefer, it particularly drags ever so slightly towards the end. Still, I rate it... mostly thanks to Mr. Thomas. || **A (much) smaller production from the Disney repertoire that everyone forgot.**

No one can deny the quality and relevance of Mark Twain's work, even those who, like me, were never attracted to his books. Yes, I have never read Twain's books, even though they are available in good translations into my mother tongue. I never felt the desire or curiosity. This film takes advantage of two of its most important characters: Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, two boys full of personality. However, it's the only thing it takes advantage of, creating an entirely new story for them.

It may not seem like it, but it is a film with Disney's approval. It is a film aimed at a teenage audience, with some maturity, and therefore has some violence and already addresses normal themes among teenagers, such as dating. The story created for the film is good enough for the effect it is, and for the film in question, but it is clear that the studio did not waste a lot of time or spend a lot of money on this production. On a technical level, the film meets the minimum requirements, but does not deliver anything beyond that.

Overall, the film is good enough to entertain us, but it is unlikely to leave a lasting memory in anyone's mind. It is absolutely forgettable, so much so that, nowadays, no one remembers it. Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Brad Renfro are the duo of young actors who lead the cast, and they are really the only ones to deserve a certain type of prominence for the work they have developed. Eric Schweig and Michael McShane do smaller jobs, but they are the most valuable adults. The rest of the cast is an anonymous and indistinct mass like a ballet nucleus, moving and circulating without wanting our attention."

It's STILL at least 50,000 times funnier than Lena Dunham's 'Tiny Furniture' (or about 70% of the so-called contemporary American comedies made these days). || **Nielsen has done better, but this movie is good enough to be enjoyable and mildly funny.**

This comedy, starring Leslie Nielsen and intelligently directed by Mel Brooks, is truly good. It is a parody of old horror movies, in which Dracula is an aristocratic undead who lives off the blood of unsuspecting humans. The film is more directly inspired by the old productions of Hammer Studios and Francis Ford Coppola's _Dracula_, which was still recent when the film was released. The script is, therefore, similar in every way to the last film I mentioned.

Nielsen is perfectly capable of putting up with the film effortlessly, with a generous dose of good humor, charisma and spirit. The actor is a veteran of cinema comedies and satire, we've seen him before in very funny films, and the actor does well here again. However, I can agree with those who say that the actor has done better works. In addition to directing, Brooks gives life to Van Helsing and is also resourceful and witty, with a relatively flawless work, but also without major merits. Much better than Brooks was Peter MacNicol's excellent performance in the role of Renfield. The actor is good, and he seems genuinely deranged. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony do what they can, but they're not particularly happy, because their characters don't really matter here.

Being a film that takes place in the Victorian England, it is possible that Brooks gave the cast instructions to try to Britishize their accents. However, such an effort rarely resulted in any happy results, not to mention the jokes, who didn't always work well, with several scenes sounding overly serious or dull. The sets, as well as the costumes, are good enough, and I didn't find any major problems with the question of the historical period. The regular cinematography, the satisfying but not brilliant editing and the relatively lukewarm soundtrack complete the production values ​​of the film, which is far from being really good, but it turned out to be interesting, funny and good enough for us to bear watching it again. || **_Amusing parody of Dracula with Leslie Nielsen, Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman_**

“Dracula: Dead and Loving It” (1995) is a Mel Brooks spoof of the Dracula story with the same fun style and goofy humor of “Young Frankenstein” (1974) and “Spaceballs” (1987). Unlike ""Love at First Bite"" (1979) with George Hamilton, the story doesn’t take place in the modern day, but is basically a silly redo of the first half of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992) along with bits from other Dracula flicks.

With Nielsen as the protagonist, you can’t help but think of The Naked Gun movies. Meanwhile Steven Weber is effective as Harker and Peter MacNicol hams it up as Renfield.

The presence of the stunning Amy Yasbeck brings to mind Brooks’ previous film, “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” (1993. Along with Amy, Lysette Anthony is a highlight in the feminine department as Lucy. Too bad her part wasn’t bigger (but it’s big enough, I reckon).

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in at Culver Studios in Culver City, southeast of Hollywood.

The plot is on the thin side but is helped having Sean Bean as the sinister villain and of course Famke Janssen makes for an amazingly sexy psychopath with, ahem, incredible thighs. **4.0/5** || _**The Russia installment, plus Pierce Brosnan’s debut**_

Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) returns to Russia to investigate the theft of a space-based electromagnetic pulse weapon, which destroyed a radar facility in Siberia with only one survivor (Izabella Scorupco). Sean Bean plays an MI6 agent, Famke Janssen a ruthless assassin, Gottfried John a Russian commander, Joe Don Baker a CIA contact in St. Petersburg and Judi Dench the new ‘M.’

""Goldeneye"" (1995) introduces Brosnan for his four-film stint in the series and he does a fine job as James Bond. Some people write him off as a “pretty boy” but, while he’s a handsome man, he’s also masculine and kick-axx. He’s perfect for the role.

While the plot is overly convoluted, the flick delivers the goods. The action highlights include the opening Russian dam sequence, a car chase in Monaco, the theft of an attack helicopter in Monte Carlo, a wild tank chase in St. Petersburg and the action-packed close in the jungles of Cuba with the secret lair thereof. 

Izabella Scorupco is gorgeous in a winsome way and more shoulda been done with her. Meanwhile sharp Famke is perhaps the most sadistic biyatch in the series.

The film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot in Switzerland (chemical weapons facility); Monte Carlo (casino) & nearby Alpes-Maritimes, France (car chase); England; St. Petersburg, Russia; and Puerto Rico (Goldeneye Satellite Dish & beach scene).

GRADE: B || **Goldeneye is the gold standard of spy movies and Bond films.**

Goldeneye edges out Casino Royale and Skyfall as my favorite Bond film of all time. After decades of campy James Bond movies like Octopussy and A View to a Kill, Bond felt more like a punchline than a suave master spy. The franchise seemed to have lost its way, but Goldeneye brought gritty action, mind-blowing stunts, beautiful and capable Bind girls, and an outstanding cast back to Bond, returning the spy to his iconic and sterling reputation. Pierce Brosnan's Bond convincingly outwitted criminal masterminds and decisively overcame enemy opposition with precision and brutality while also believably charming and romancing beautiful villains and allies. Goldeneye nails every classic Bond element with more tenacity and realism. 006 betraying his country and becoming the evil mirror to 007 provides a deeper antagonist than Bond typically faces. The Bond girls are not helpless damsels but capable enemies or skilled partners that help him save the day. The action set pieces are astonishing, from driving a tank through the busy city streets of St Petersburg to dangling hundreds of feet above the ground in Costa Rice to the incredible base jump in the opening sequence. Even after all these years, Goldneye's effects and action still hold up. It is also the first movie with Judi Dench as M. Goldeneye is quintessential Bond at its absolute best!"

Hopkins did a great job too... except maybe looking a little too old for the role, but he captured a lot of Nixon's mannerisms, a lot of how he spoke and moved. It was far from uncanny, but he really did nail the essence of the character and that is almost better than cloning him.

Joan Allen fails though. She doesn't exactly ape Pat as well as she could and you are left with the impression that she doesn't understand who she was depicting.

And then you have little hints at the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories and, even though I supported them, I don't think that they had a place in a movie about Nixon. They felt alien and X-Files and you are left doubting that said conversation ever took place.

Aside from all of that, though, this seems like a great film that was fairly done, about someone that it would have been far too easy to stereotype as a drooling monster. Stone humanized him, and that took heart and talent."

Initially, though ruthless enough, he has a degree of decency to him, and when he falls in love with hustler ""Ginger"" (Sharon Stone) things seem to suggest that maybe he could be destined for the straight(-ish) and narrow. The same can not be said for his friend ""Santoro"" (Joe Pesci) who comes out to join him - ostensibly to make sure he stays safe - and is soon up to no good fleecing whatever and whoever to pay for his hedonistic lifestyle. It'd have been dull if all had gone to plan, and of course it doesn't - ""Rothstein"" has to deal with crooks, authorities (not that they are mutually exclusive), his increasingly rogue wife and his downright liability of a friend. Things come to an head when his wife and her former beau/pimp ""Diamond"" (James Woods) force his hand, the gaming commission wants his licence and ""Santoro"" - well, he is just toxic. Pesci only ever really has one style of acting, and this is perfect for that. He adds a distinctly plausible nastiness to his frankly rather odious character. Stone features a bit too sparingly perhaps, but she certainly steals the scenes she shares with a measured and confident De Niro very much at the top of his game. A nice little twist at the end works very well, too! It's stylishly photographed and has a great look to it - good stuff, this."

She brings her A-game and definitely tries her best but this just isn't her thing, and Modine's clearly not blockbuster star material for action films. A few of Harlin's set-pieces worked particularly well, but he pandered too much for his wife. That can work if you're, say, the Rossellinis and you're filming a drama set in Italy, but it's not working here, though I'll adore Davis to my dying day. I will add that this is my 13 year-old son's favourite films. Very curious if they would have made sequels had it not bombed--the ending sure was open-ended enough to give off that impression.

This is one film that if you just sit back and enjoy the ride will offer you a guilty pleasure. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy popcorn films or have children. Not as enjoyable as the first two 'Pirates of the Caribbean' releases, but better than their subsequent sequels. || ***Fun pirate flick tries too hard to be heroic and panders to youngsters***  

In 1668 a female pirate captain (Geena Davis) purchases an educated slave (Matthew Modine) to read a treasure map written in Latin and help her & crew find the priceless lucre on Cutthroat Island. Frank Langella plays her villainous uncle who’s also chasing the hidden loot. 

“Cutthroat Island” (1995) is a pirate adventure in the spirit of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981); it even has a cute monkey as a side character. It’s a fun adventure with several worthwhile scenes (you can check all the pirate staple boxes) and magnificent locations, but it doesn’t have the movie magic of “Raiders.”

For one thing, it tries too hard to be larger-than-life valiant and thus goes over-the-top with the action scenes, like the escape from Port Royal where there’s a sequence of like seven explosions amidst other ridiculous goings-on. This isn’t helped by the blaring score that overdoes the heroic bit to the point of nausea. In other words, the movie annoyingly panders to children and lacks the confidence for a more adult-oriented, reality-based tone.  If you want to see a rousing historical adventure like this done right, check out “The Musketeer” (2001). 

The cast is effective with Langella shining as the nefarious pirate rival while Modine is surprisingly good as a rogue turned hero. People complain about Geena’s performance, saying she was over her head and unconvincing, but she was the director’s wife and happily rose to the challenge, for the most part. Besides, who else could’ve pulled off the role better in 1994 when the film was shot? Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock are the only two that come to mind. Demi Moore might’ve worked, but she lacked the other three’s beaming smile, especially Geena’s big grin. 

But Geena & Modine needed a better script that made their characters more interesting. As it is, they’re just okay. And, despite my criticisms concerning the unbelievable and juvenile-focused heroics, the movie’s more realistic than any of the “Pirates of the Caribbean” flicks, probably because there’s no magical nonsense.  

The film runs 2 hour, 3 minutes and was shot in Fort Ricasoli, Kalkara, Malta (Port Royal); Thailand (the island footage); and England (studio). Speaking of Thailand, anyone who knows anything about geography KNOWS the flick wasn’t shot in the Caribbean, but rather Thailand.  

GRADE: C || I was born poor, I had no choice but to become a thief and a liar.

Cutthroat Island is directed by Renny Harlin and written by Robert King and Marc Norman. It stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, Frank Langella, Maury Chaykin, Patrick Malahide, Stan Shaw and Rex Linn. Music is scored by John Debney and cinematography by Peter Levy.

A film of many flaws, with a reputation akin to it being the devil of big budget failures, it is, however, a wonderful piece of piratical entertainment - that is if you are prepared to see past the monetary excess. Famously cited as the film that bankrupted Caroloco Pictures, the truth is that Carolco was going under anyway, the studio had filed for bankruptcy before Cutthroat Island had even been released, the box office performance was irrelevant, it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. And while no amount of hard sell marketing could have gotten the film to make back the $98 million spent making it, it received no support from distributor MGM who were in the process of being sold, so finances for marketing were not available.

Harlin's movie has all the pirate movie ingredients crammed in to the plot, yet it is a standard plot that sees Davis as female pirate Morgan Adams who leads her charges on a quest to find the ultimate treasure hoard. Problem here is that the map is in three parts, each part held by separate people, one of which is Morgan's vicious Uncle Dawg (Langella). The hunt and race is on, and Harlin doesn't pause for breath, he's a kid in a sweet shop armed with wads of cash, but the money, as gargantuan as it is, is right there up on the screen - well except for the hiring of better actors that is... Two magnificent ships were built for the production and they ""are"" magnificent, the costumes, the sets, pyrotechnics, exotic locations (Malta and Thailand standing in for 1668 Jamaica), stunning sound editing and visual thrills, all high on value and all cloaked by a tremendously robust score from Debney.

Action junkies are well served, with wild horse drawn carriage chases, sword fights aplenty, ships in side by side explosive battle, mucho perilous situations, bodies falling from heights or thrown in the sea, and we even get a comic relief simian! Who, as it turns out, is one of the best actors on show! It's hard to believe that a pirate action film such as this would not be better appreciated had it been released in the following decade, and I say that not just because of the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, but more so that the blunderbuss popcorn movie has had greater support these days. There's a good portion of the movie loving faithful who just want to be entertained, where rapid thrills are a requisite, not well drawn characterisations and thespian class. Judged on those terms then Cutthroat Island is a winner for sure.

Main problems are the clunky script and the three pronged miscast errors in the lead roles. Davis (erm, wife of Harlin) is full of guts, really attacking the material with gusto, but she never convinces, it always feels like a caricature and she's uncomfortable delivering key lines. She would prove herself a fine action actress a year later with The Long Kiss Goodnight (also with Harlin directing), but she's woefully out of place here. With Davis demanding more and more screen time for her character, the role of Shaw began to thin out, which was too much to bear for Michael Douglas who bowed out late in the day. In came Matthew Modine, zero chemistry with Davis, a bland acting style and as far removed from the period setting as you could get. Langella just isn't menacing as the main villain of the piece, a very good actor in the right role, but not here and some of his attempts at nastiness feel like panto season has started early.

So problems for sure, but wade through some of the misconceptions and poisonous press and you will find a film desperately aiming to please you, and with that there is much on offer for the pirate movie fan to savour. 7/10"

Talking of dashing, there’s also the charming “Col.

Meantime, whilst all this courting and counter-courting is going on, the young “Margaret” is totally besotted on “Ferrars” too! I usually found Jane Austen stories tended to follow a fairly predictable pattern, but the potpourri of characters here are aided by some really quite witty dialogue and some glorious scenery and build together engagingly. There’s an amiable degree of charm, haplessness and political incorrectness on display too as the writer takes quite a swipe at the ridiculousness of so many aspects of life for and amidst the landed gentry and it’s middle class associates. The headline roles all deliver well enough, but it’s maybe the engaging dynamic between Hardy and Spriggs that raises most smiles for me. The costumiers and designers have crafted a classy looking production and the screen adaptation does wonders for a time when the mantra was definitely more “why use one word when you can use ten”."

It was ok. Not as funny. I guess I just didn't like the whole jungle theme. || **Uninteresting, the film is only not worse thanks to Jim Carrey.**

Personally, I liked the first movie. Jim Carrey is a force of nature and almost always manages to surprise us with his crazy things. Unfortunately, this film is inferior, much inferior, and in good part due to the poor level of comedy, which abuses sexual and scatological humor to make jokes, increasingly predictable and unfunny.

I really think that the film's problem is in the script, a piece of garbage that shouldn't have been used for anything other than a good bonfire. Another problem is the departure of Tom Shadyac and the replacement by Steve Oedekerk, a director who is incapable of having the same creativity and comic spirit. These two problems doomed the film.

Jim Carrey turns out to be the least guilty. He continues to be a huge actor and carries the entire film on his shoulders with a panache and ability that is difficult to match, as far as comedies are concerned. I think he embarked too much on easy humor, he let himself go down a less friendly and less familiar path than would be desirable, but even so, he deserves a positive note. Simon Callow is the only supporting actor to earn a good grade, with the rest being average.

Technically, the film is poor. The sets and costumes are predictable and not pretty, the recreation of the African environment has aromas of falsehood (as if we were watching a school theater play and not a big budget film) and the effects are poor. The amount of animals involved is remarkable, and the animals deserve all the attention as they are, almost, actors in their own right."

Plus it has surfaced a few times when I surf streaming channels and I usually stop to watch for a while, no matter where in the film I am.

The ensemble cast (which includes a few lower echelon stars) is excellent and mostly look like they are having fun with it. There is violence, but not with buckets of blood. It almost seems like cartoonish violence. And of course wit and humor run through it, with a bit of satire on Hollywood thrown in.

Here they took a classic Elmore Leonard plot and made it too Hollywood for its own good. And then they tried a bit hard to make it too much like a Pulp Fiction film, but with less bleak comedy and more slapstick comedy.

""Powder"" was the first of two films that came out in 1995-1996 dealing with a gifted individual who is super-smart and has paranormal powers; the second was ""Phenomenon"" with John Travolta. ""Powder"" is the superior. While ""Phenomenon"" is good, ""Powder"" reaches for greatness and, in some ways, achieves it, even while it’s marred by a few dubious moments.

Sean Patrick Flanery plays a hairless albino teen in East Texas, nicknamed Powder, who's discovered living in a basement after his grandfather's sudden death. As a ward of the state, he is placed in a boy's school where his uniqueness stirs up trouble.

For a film like this to work you have to buy into the character, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Flanery reveals his acting expertise in his convincing portrayal of the shy, gifted teen. Flannery's Powder stands strong with the greatest misfits in cinema, like Nimoy's Spock and Hank's Forrest Gump.

Actually, the acting is good across the board: Lance Henriksen as the hardened-but-open sheriff, Mary Steenburgen as a psychologist who grows to really care for Powder in a motherly way, Jeff Goldblum as a fervent science teacher who's astonished, Bradford Tatum as Powder's main enemy at school, Brandon Smith as a redneck deputy who instinctively hates him, but actually fears him, and the beautiful redhead Missy Crider, Powder's fellow student and potential love interest.

Roger Ebert dissed the film for a number of reasons, one being Powder's enemy's don't learn from him. On the contrary, one enemy makes a 180 after being enlightened, but ultimately reverts back to his former base mentality. This happens all the time in real life. On another occasion Powder does something miraculous and you can clearly see the change on his enemy's face, the realization & acceptance. Whether this will prove to be a lasting change or temporary, isn’t revealed.

Ebert also complained that Powder's electrical tricks upstage his emotional insights. Really? I think it's the reverse. While the electrical tricks are there to maintain the attention of those with ADHD, it's the film's potent insights that stay with the viewer. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the electrical tricks, but they're way too overdone to be realistic. At the same time, I understand why the writer/director (Victor Salva) included them: this is a MOVIE, not real life; it's meant to transfer ideas AND entertain, and it does both pretty effectively.

Ebert also griped that the ending is unsatisfying the more you think about it. Actually, the ending makes a powerful statement and is reminiscent of the spectacular translations of Elijah and Enoch in the Bible. Let's just say Powder was too good, too spiritual, for the simpleminded and mundane.

I'm not saying the film doesn't have flaws or eye-rolling moments, but they can be overlooked in view of the big picture and the film's successes.

As for the paranormal phenomena featured in the story, like psychokinesis, telepathy, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge,” although some of these are exaggerated in the film I have a secret:

They're real.

Sly Stallone stars as an ageing assassin who gets embroiled in a cat and mouse game with a younger assassin who wants to be number one of the trade. Teaming up with a computer hacker, Stallone battles not only his pursuer but also an event from his past that troubles him so.

With Antonio Banderas and Julianne Moore in starry support, Richard Donner in the director's chair and the Wachowski brothers on writing duties, Assassins held the promise of a top line actioner. Sadly that promise is not met.

There's clear signs of the makers trying to make something more deep and cerebral, what ultimately transpires is a overly complicated - and way over long - picture. Punctured with great action scenes, none more so than an outrageous taxi ride that John Woo would be proud of, it's in the middle section where pic drags itself into needless slumber. By this mid-point, one has had enough of Banderas, who comes off more like a deranged excitable kid than someone to be feared. Donner really falters there, but conversely he gets an interestingly engaging tune out of Stallone. Moore is very good, and gets some good dialogue to spout, which is a rarity, though, since much of the chatter is mumbled or said in such agitated or broody manner that the sound mix strains for aural clarification.

It's not a stinker, and in its own way it's a diverting time waster, but too many holes and too many poor production desicions leave it knocking at the averageville door. 5/10 || A not great movie, but one that it's hard to pinpoint exact ways in which it could easily have been improved.

An alcoholic in Los Angeles (Nicolas Cage) cashes out of the film industry and moves to Las Vegas to apparently drink himself to death. He meets a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue) with whom he has a welcome affinity and they develop a relationship of radical acceptance.

""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995) is one of those downbeat realistic dramas about lost souls in hopeless dissolution. It’s well-done for what it is and Shue’s beauty is effectively showcased despite the unappealing nature of her profession. And I understand the message of “loving” acceptance with no questions. Although it could be argued that true love refuses to enable people to destroy themselves and holds them accountable to some reasonable degree.  

A guy who was my best friend 20 years ago developed an alcohol problem that became increasingly glaring. He died recently, but I didn’t see him for the last four years of his life because I refused to see someone drink themselves to death.

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area (Burbank & Santa Monica) and Nevada (Las Vegas, Laughlin & Paradise).

GRADE: B-/C+ || **A dense film, difficult to see, but one that should be seen, especially by young people who think that getting drunk is relevant to a night of fun.**

This film is based on the true story of a man who lost his will to live after a complicated divorce and the end of his personal and professional life as he gave way to alcohol addiction. With no prospects of getting back on top, he decides to go to Las Vegas, the city of all sins in the USA, and drink everything he can until he ends his own life. In the meantime of these suicidal intentions, he meets a prostitute with whom he has a very complicated relationship because, deep down, she too walks her own path of self-destruction.

The film is excellent, but it is deeply heavy, depressing, difficult to watch. In addition to taking us to the most negative and destructive side of alcoholism, it also shows us, without fear of shocking, how it can lead to death. That is, it shows us in very hard colors that drinking is an addiction, it is a serious problem and it can kill. It makes it clear that alcohol is not something that we can or should relativize, a punctual, occasional excess on Friday night. It is not something we should tolerate in the behavior of our children or family members. I say this at a time when drinking has become all too common, especially among young people, for whom getting drunk is a “sine qua non” condition for a night of fun. Anyone going to work the next morning can easily see young people, many of them women and looking as if they are not even 20 years old, sitting on the side of the sidewalk, next to nightclubs or bus stops, drunk or vomiting in scenes worthy of a pity that I refuse to feel because, after all, they wanted to stay that way. Many are Portuguese, but there are also many tourists who seem to come to my country because the law is more permissive than it should be. For me, who was brought up on the danger of addiction and only got seriously drunk once, it pains me to see how this youth considers excess fundamental in fun and I just hope, one day that I'm a father, I never have to go get one. child in such a state. I would be ashamed.

This is one of the movies that made Nicholas Cage's career. The actor does a remarkable job, and if we think about the turn that his life and career would later take, it's really a shame that he couldn't maintain this level. It's hard to see the way he gives his character all the elements to capture our sympathy as she slides down a path of no return. Elizabeth Shue, who gave life to the prostitute, also does a job full of merits, even if her character is much more conventional. After all, it is not the first time, nor the last, that the cinema has met a prostitute with feelings. There is a love story between the two characters, that is undeniable, but we can question to what extent it is really believable, since love is never used to redeem or grant the characters a path of salvation, a way out of the life of addiction and destruction they are in. And to some extent, even if this is rehearsed, such an option is largely rejected, especially by the character of Cage, who seems determined to die.

Technically, the film has several points of merit, especially with regard to cinematography and editing. The film was very well filmed, it uses light and shadow very well to thicken the whole environment of degradation in which the characters move, with the bright lights of the casinos working, almost, like the bright flame that attracts the moths to their death and perdition. It is in this environment that we see the characters live the only scenes of pleasure and relaxation, which only serve to keep pushing them to the bottom of the well. Very well edited, the film doesn't waste time with things that don't matter, it maintains a very pleasant pace and provides two hours that leave us thinking. || Is there any profession portrayed in cinema more likely to be an obnoxious alcoholic than an Hollywood screen writer? Well that's what ""Ben"" (Nicolas Cage) is and when he gets fired after one too many absences and foul-mouthed outbursts, he takes his redundancy cheque and his BMW and heads to Vegas. He doesn't have a plan, except perhaps to drink himself into a stupor from which he won't wake up. Meantime, we've met hooker ""Sera"" (Elisabeth Shue) who has a rather brutal relationship with her flaky pimp ""Yuri"" (Julian Sands) and works the Strip looking for high rollers to seduce. They meet in a casino and quickly conclude that there might be an element of safety, certainly sanity, in numbers and are soon living together platonically. What now ensues illustrates the perils for both as they continue down paths that seem destined to lead to self-destruction. ""Sera"" exposing herself to dangers every time she goes to work whilst ""Ben"" showers with two bottles of vodka to contain his increasingly dominant shakes. The soundtrack does much to help set the mood here, as these two people gradually fall in love - but it's not a sentimental love. It comes across more as a growing inter-dependency fuelled by affection and a desire to look out for each other - however doomed to failure we might anticipate that to be. Cage is on great form here, he really does carry of the role skilfully and plausibly - but I think Shue takes more of the plaudits for me. She allows her essentially quite decent character to thrive and to grow, demonstrating quite a degree of humanity even when faced with brutality and humiliation on a fairly regular basis. She also manages to give us a sense of a woman who is trying to escape but just doesn't know how. Mike Figgis keeps the pace taut and effective and with both on solid form with an actually quite emotional story, this is well worth two hours."

This production from the 90s, currently somewhat forgotten, is another film without any bones that we can watch with our grandmothers and our children by our side, and which deserves to be revisited and cherished. I can understand why it fell into the deepest forgotten films: it's not a remarkable production, it's not one of those films that leaves a mark on us for life. However, it does its job impeccably.

The story is quite nice, even if it has nothing original: four friends meet again many years after having separated to pursue their lives, and the bond of friendship that has united them since childhood is reinforced by the reunion, full of nostalgia and good memories. There are lots of films about situations like this, and with similar themes, this is not new, but it is well done.

The film has four good adult actresses (Demi Moore, Rita Wilson, Rosie O'Donnell and Melanie Griffith) and four promising ones (Christina Ricci, Thora Birch, Gaby Hoffmann and Ashleigh Aston Moore), since the four main characters are played today and at puberty, twenty years earlier. This is very interesting, but the truth is that there are not even similarities between the young actresses and their adult counterparts: the most blatant case is the character Roberta, where I really don't see any physiognomic similarity between Ricci and O'Donnell. Of course, people change… but not radically. If we forget this uncomfortable detail, the work of the eight protagonists is quite good, and each one has time and opportunities to show what they are worth.

On a technical level, the film is strictly nothing special. The recreation of the 1970s fails because it is not very evident, that is, there are no elements, in the sets or props on stage, that help us understand the era in which the action takes place. The setting has a certain charm and good taste (I especially liked the gas lamps), and the tree house is very beautiful, as are the filming locations and cinematography. But that's it."

It has also been a long time since I have read Jane Austen’s that this movie is based upon, and after seeing how this and two other versions stray from each other’s, in small ways that is, I would be curious to know how often each one remains true to the original. But that is not necessary to enjoy this well made production; it merely makes we wish I could take my favorite parts from all three versions to create a new whole. Failing that, I will merely say that this production, as with the others, should be acceptable to Jane Austen lovers who aren’t mortified by the least changes to her books.

I don’t know how easy it might be to track down this movie. As I understand it, it was originally released on British TV, but PBS in the United States had shown an interest due to a popularity of Jane Austen adaptations at the time, so that had allowed for an increased budget to film at actual sites in the book, built up some interest, and then was released as a feature film in theaters before it appeared on PBS, complete with an introduction by Russell Baker.

I loved – like almost everyone else – “Amelie” and I didn't particularly like “Delicatessen”. However, I didn't give up on Jean Pierre Jeunet and decided to see this film. I confess that I was impressed by the visual quality, but this is practically a trademark of the director, who seems to have a particular predilection for the color green (it was quite evident in Amelie, and in this film it was once again the dominant color of the chromatic palette). However, it returns to being, as “Delicatessen” had been, a rather strange, depressing and bizarre film. More bizarre than some Tim Burton movies, which isn't easy.

In view of what has been described above, I think it will not be surprising if I say that it is a film that is basically based on visual and special resources. There's immense visual effort here, and there's no doubt that Jeunet is behind it. The cinematography is very good, with an excellent filming work, and the sets deserve our attention. The costumes were designed by Jean Paul Gautier, so they're practically haute couture (with all the oddities that usually implies) and the soundtrack does a good job, too.

The cast is quite complete, and the characters are complicated and difficult to understand. I can even say that some characters look like caricatures or things out of Coney Island, from some freak show. I liked, however, the effort made here by Dominique Pinon, one of the great French actors of our time. He doesn't play just one character, but a legion of clones. I also liked Ron Perlman, he's good for this type of film, but honestly, I feel that the actor wasn't comfortable either with his role or with the material he was given. I don't know to what extent the language barrier was actually the cause of that, but it was the feeling I got.

The film is, essentially, a depressing and decadent futuristic dystopia, where a long-deranged scientist kidnaps children to steal their dreams. The basis of the plot is somewhat reminiscent of “The Island of Dr. Moreau”. Then we have a duo of Siamese twins who make up the main villains, and behave in an absolutely bizarre way, and a strong man who decides to go in search of his younger brother, kidnapped like many others, in the company of a girl who will help you. However, everything else is extraordinarily complicated. It seems that the script didn't get the attention it deserved: there are parts that are very underwritten, points that don't make any sense, strange twists that seem to happen just to make everything even more strange and out of the ordinary. As a story told, it's an irritating and worthless movie. || The basic premiss of this film is really quite simple. ""Krank"" (Daniel Emilfork) is super-bright, slightly deranged and lonely. He lives on a remote oil rig with only whom he can manufacture for companionship. His biggest problem is that he cannot dream. Without them he will die. He must, therefore, obtain as many other people's dreams as he can. To that end he constructs an entire community of one-eyed servants, a brain that lives in tank feeding on Alka Seltzer and some clones that are all led by the diminutively menacing ""Martha"" (Mireille Mossé). This ""family"" might have made ""Dr. Moreau"" proud. He hopes that they will help to collect enough kids to perpetuate his immortality. The thing is, all those he does manage to collect are nightmares because the children he kidnaps are all petrified of him. He needs some nice ones! Meantime, his army of robotic creations alight on ""Denree"" (Joseph Lucien) without reckoning on his determined strongman brother ""One"" (Ron Perlman) who is determined to fetch him back. He duly travels to their offshore structure and aided by the feisty ""Miette"" (Judith Vittet) and a lot of green wool, sets about trying to rescue his little brother - and all the others trapped in the installation - and to make sure that ""Krank"" and his hoodlums plunder no more. Emilfork is on great form as the archetypal mad scientist and Dominique Pinon looks like he's having great fun as the clones who do their masters's bidding whilst injecting some silly humour. There's an hybrid of stories here - part ""Frankenstein"", part ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" with costumes eccentrically designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier,  and it does rather meander at times - but this is a film about it's look and it's sheer imagination. It's as if someone had allowed Messrs. Caro and Jeunet unfettered access to the props department at MGM or Universal and told them to use what they can. They have the imagination of a child and boy do they use it. Mechanical gadgets, gizmos, green mists, dense fog. You name it and these allow the whole thing to imbue us with a sense of a playful, dark, adventurousness. It's comedic at times, threatening at others and there's a surprisingly effective chemistry between the usually wooden Perlman and his juvenile co-star Vittet that helps anchor the fantasy. It's surreal and gorgeous to watch and you'll need to suspend your expectations of linear, structured, cinema if you are to enjoy it. It's unique and creative. Probably a bit ""bonkers"" too!"

Really well done by director Terry Gilliam that has great pacing through the two hour running time. **4.0/5** || **_A-man-comes-back-from-the-future Sci-Fi with Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt_**

In 2035 survivors are living underground after a viral outbreak has wiped out most of the populace. A prisoner (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to obtain the original virus so scientists can find a cure. Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer and David Morse are on hand in key roles.

""12 Monkeys"" (1996) has a huge reputation as a sci-fi thriller and is iconic of 90’s cinema. The man coming back from the future plot immediately brings to mind the first two Terminator flicks (from 1984 and 1991), but “12 Monkeys” pales by comparison.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s worth seeing and is entertaining enough with Madeleine Stowe shining, but the story is hampered by a muddled tone of schizophrenia and the unrelenting grunginess of the visual aesthetic (which makes perfect sense for 2035, but not for 1990 and 1996 where most of the events take place). In short, the movie’s just not as compelling as it could be.

People gush over Brad Pitt’s role and he is entertaining, but it’s a glaring rip-off of Dennis Hopper’s photojournalist in “Apocalypse Now” (1979), although I suppose you could see it as an homage. In any case, I could see through Pitt’s acting here and there whereas Hopper was the real deal, perhaps because he & crew were literally stuck in the sweltering jungle waiting around for days doing drugs or whatever while Coppola & Brando worked out the kinks in the script for the last act.

If I'm in the mood for this kind of fare, the first three Terminator flicks are a superior option and even the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008). This one's decent, but overrated.
   
The film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot primarily in the Philadelphia & Baltimore areas. For instance, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia was used for the rundown asylum.

GRADE: B- || **An excellent sci-fi film that deserves our attention.**

I didn't really know what to expect when this movie was on TV very recently, but I was really glued to the set until the end thanks to a truly absorbing story and a collection of great actors who do a great job. I don't know director Terry Gilliam very well, I've only seen one or two of his films so far (not counting this film), but I'm beginning to understand his aesthetic a bit. However, I recognize that surrealism, of which the director is adept, and the bizarre script can really make it difficult to understand the work.

The film begins by immersing us in a profoundly dystopian world, where humanity was almost extinct by a pandemic. As the disease comes from an airborne virus that was deliberately released, the survivors moved into underground shelters. Technology, however, has evolved and allows the sending of chrononauts (that is, time travelers) to the past, in order to obtain pure samples of the virus, which can be used in the manufacture of a vaccine or medicine.

This is how James Cole, a criminal, is chosen for time travel in exchange for his crimes being forgiven. His mission is not to alter the past by preventing the release of the virus, even if he seems to want to. The mission is to locate those responsible and pass on all the information to the future, in order to send another agent who will collect the samples. But he only knows that a radicalized environmentalist group, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, was responsible. Sent by accident to 1990 (instead of 1996), he ends up in an insane asylum where he will befriend the manic Jeffrey Goines and endear Dr. Railly.

The film deals with very complex themes, such as time travel, temporal paradoxes, the impossibility of changing the past, and even madness, the tenuous difference between reality and imagination, or between sanity and insanity. It has several advances and retreats in time and you have to be attentive, but what intrigues viewers the most is its ending, strangely sudden and confusing. I understood it quite well, and I think you just need to pay attention to the film to understand everything, but I'll leave a clue to help: the eyes of the protagonist and the eyes of the child that we see at the end of the film are exactly the same, and the what she sees coincides perfectly with a recurring dream that torments the protagonist, coming from the future. I say no more.

I loved Brad Pitt's performance in this movie. The actor, very used to heartthrob roles where he can use and abuse his natural charm, is almost unrecognizable here. Of course, younger and less experienced, but just as impeccable. I don't know to what extent participating in this film had an influence on his learning as an actor, but I believe it was useful for Pitt. Bruce Willis is also an actor who deserves a positive mention for his work here. He really seems confused, and in many scenes he manages to give the character the feeling that she is abandoning herself to the course of events, fighting against it whenever she feels her mission is in danger. Madeleine Stowe's performance was not so happy: while being frankly positive, it is the least interesting and the most conventional.

Technically, the film is flawless. Gilliam cleverly takes advantage of the sets and costumes and makes a truly strange, bizarre future, with those plastic protective suits and that ball in the interrogation scenes. It's an ugly world that we don't want to see one day. I especially liked the cinematography, and the way the director works the footage in a way that makes everything even more surreal and strange. For example, the scene on the staircase of Goines' father's mansion, which is as elegant and majestic as it is labyrinthine and dreamlike. In addition to the good effects, the film also has a very effective soundtrack."

It also has a scene too much to be in a children’s film that reflects on domestic violence (between two dogs). The producers who made this sort of junk were obviously nuts in the head to put such a scene like this into such family oriented film. Please do not watch after seeing this review. You do not especially want to get inspired by such propaganda about using certain animals as food. || **Absolutely wonderful, and suitable for the whole family.**

Usually, people look at this movie as just another movie for kids. This is not my opinion. It is true that it is a fantasy film, with animals that talk and have human postures and behavior. However, it was built and developed in a way that turns out to be very pleasing to adults as well. Perfect to be seen with the whole family, it is a regular presence on television, especially during Christmas.

The script couldn't be more delicious: Babe is a baby piglet who, on his lucky day, was taken from the slaughterhouse where he would inevitably die (as happened to his parents and siblings). The little pig ends up in the hands of the owner of a sheep farm, who thought of fattening him up with the intention of killing him. However, and through a series of funny adventures, the little pig turns out to reveal a special talent for helping to herd the sheep, which will put the natural position of the animals and the reputation of the sheepdogs in the spotlight. Through this story, the film approaches, with humor and feeling, serious questions such as the meaning of life, death, the place of each one in the world, evil, reward and punishment.

Making this film as an animation, traditional or computerized, would have been easy. However, the production made the film with real animals and used technology to perfect the material and file rough edges. At the time, the film received some harsh criticism for making strong insinuations about meat consumption (after all, we are not used to seeing our lunch speak to other animals about the nobility of the food purpose for which it was created), and the truth is that it seems that there were really people to stop eating meat because of this.

If animals are the main protagonists of this film, where do humans come in? It's not the protagonism, I believe, that changes things a lot. The main human role in this film goes to James Cromwell, an extremely competent and talented actor who had no difficulty with his character, the owner of the farm where Babe will live, and who understands how special his piggy is. And despite speaking little, the way the actor communicates with his body and face is excellent. Magda Szubanski also does a good job, and it's interesting to see how the actress has aged so that she can play the character, which is a woman much older than the actress.

Technically, the film is exquisite and achieves some feats worthy of mention. To begin with, the number of animals, trainers and handlers that were used in the film is extraordinary. The logistical effort alone must have been enormous, in order to guarantee not only continuity (they could not all be different animals) but the hygiene and health of the animals. The make-up department, with her work, not only aged Szubanski but she humanized some of the animals, which is no small feat. The film has excellent sets and props, recreating well the childhood imagination and the idyllic bucolic rural life, very different from the life of hard work in the countryside. But what delights and surprises us most is the extraordinary cinematography, with vibrant colors, high contrast and radiant beauty. Although I'm not particularly a fan of mice, they serve their purpose. As for the soundtrack, it is solidly based on pieces from the classical repertoire such as the waltz “The Blue Danube”, by Johann Strauss II, “Cantique de Jean Racine” from Gabriel Fauré's Requiem and, particularly, the adaptation of the most famous chords of the last movement. from Symphony No. 3 Op. 78 for Pipe Organ and Orchestra by Camille Saint-Saenz. It is a piece that seems to have been chosen at random, but that may be explained by the fact that the composer is also the author of the famous work “Carnival of the Animals”, which could very well be here. || Who doesn’t like a bit of Camille Saint-Saëns and his rousing third symphony to get a movie going? It’s the ideal start to this entertaining story that reminded me a little of the “Charlotte’s Web” tale of farmyard antics. It’s the runt of the litter who is destined for the farmer’s table - via a raffle - but “Hoggett” (James Cromwell) senses that “Pig” might be more useful out of the oven than in it! That might be because this young critter is an inherent friend-maker. He chats with the geese, the cattle, the horses and even “Ma” - the cranky ewe-in-chief. Indeed it’s that very skill that alerts the farmer to some rustlers and makes him realise that this could be the world’s first ever porcine flock-herder. With his wife (Magda Szubanski) soon to go on a Women’s Guild trip and the local sheepdog trials looming, perhaps it might be time to check in that rule book - even if your own (now rather jealous) dog “Rex” things you’ve gone barking mad. Now if you’re of a grumpy disposition, you will probably hate the rampant sentimentality on display here, but I’m not and I liked it. The fellow creatures that share his farm, yes - even the annoying mice, all work well together to extol the definite virtues of looking out for each other and for caring. With the bacon slicer never far away, there’s the merest hint of teatime menace now and again but in the main this is just a cheerfully celebratory story that sort of superimposes a pig into a role that can pretty much mean whatever you want it to in terms of animal, surrogate child, pet - you name it. It’s an engaging watch that marries the live acting with the animation creatively and it’s one of those creature features that can make you cringe a little, but it’s still a joyous and charming film that it’s hard not to like."

It is based on a true story written and lived by a nun, Sister Helen Prejean though, as usually happens, the story is modified to fit the needs of a dramatic movie. For example, the two inmates she provided spiritual advice to are merged into one for this film. As a side note, Sister Prejean has an uncredited appearance in a scene concerning a vigil.

The movie is gritty at times,but always watchable. Susan Surandon received an academy award for her performance.

In addition to it being a great movie, there are two soundtrack albums of note. The first is the soundtrack, featuring an array of songs by Springsteen, Johnny Cash and others. Also there is a movie score version, with music of a more atmospheric nature. I use it to read or write fiction to sometimes. || **A very human film that is solidly based on the performance of the two main actors and on the discussion around the death penalty.**

There are certain films that are made to play with our feelings and with what we consider to be divisive themes. Films about the death penalty almost always do so in one way or another: the topic itself is highly controversial, and almost everyone has an opinion (the level of critical information in opinions varies) about it. The debate about capital punishment will never end, not least because there are legal, human, social and religious reasons that reasonably support who is in favor and who is against it. In the end, it is one of those choices that depends a lot on how the legal and correctional system is viewed, that is, whether we value more, as a society, the exemplary punishment of the criminal or his eventual atonement and correction.

The film is based on the memories and experiences of Sister Helen Prejean, a kind-hearted Catholic nun who, over the years, has accompanied and counseled several death row inmates in Louisiana, one of many US states that maintain the active practice. It is a very intimate film, as much of it is focused on the private conversations between the nun and the convict, who in this film is a man who killed a teenage couple, but who claims to be innocent.

The script does everything it can to sweeten the story in order to keep our interest: the constant allegations that he may be innocent, the flirtatious atmosphere that sometimes arises between the nun and the prisoner, the passionate (understandable) behavior of the victim's relatives, the various allegations about the promiscuity between the justice system and the conveniences (or inconveniences) of the death sentence for politics and for the image of the Governor. The film makes the most of its theme, shoots in several directions and, for the most part, hits its targets. In addition to being an authentic manifesto against the death penalty, the film is a poignant drama where a clearly evil and vicious man regrets the things he has done, even though it is too late for him. My only negative criticism of the script turns out to be, precisely, the flirtatious atmosphere felt in some parts, and which I think is left in the film, and was not necessary nor particularly positive.

Susan Sarandon, one of the great actresses of the late 20th century, gives us a remarkable job in which she ended up winning a deserved Oscar for Best Actress. She demonstrates sensitivity and a heightened sense of humanity as she plays the character, and never gives in to the temptation to become overly melodramatic (except, perhaps, for a few sugary, less-than-accomplished moments, near the end). Moreover, this is one of the great works of the actress's career. Sean Penn, on the other hand, still looks young, and is making the most of the opportunity to open doors to grow as an actor. As we know, he's going to do it, and he's going to get great achievements and important awards a few years later. Here, he is responsible for a good performance, in which he balances between resentment, regret, despair and the need for redemption and forgiveness. He never allows his character to appear to be one-dimensional, or too dark, or even too sugary, giving it complexity and various psychological undertones that are worthy of being appreciated.

On a technical level, the film is understated, functional and pragmatic. It makes no glaring mistakes, makes good use of source material and the collaboration of the real Sister Helen, who was engaged in this project, and tries to give the actors all the space they need for their work. This is the work of a sensitive and methodical direction by Tim Robbins, who knew how to understand that the film would depend heavily on the work of the two main actors, and he concentrated on extracting from them what he needed without adding anything that would hinder them or distract us. However, I don't think I'm being unfair or flattering if I briefly call attention to the good cinematography, with good framing (the use of bars and other effects to enhance the feeling of confinement) and an excellent setting. The film even has an original song, which was composed by Bruce Springsteen. || Susan Sarandon is on super form here as the conflicted nun who is tasked with offering some spiritual support to a man (Sean Penn) on death row convicted of the most brutal rape and murder of a young woman and the killing of her boyfriend. With him protesting his innocence and appeals flying about as the clock ticks down, “Sister Helen” has to reconcile her relationship with the accused with her enthusiasm to get to know the aggrieved families of the two victims who are convinced that the system has identified the culprits. It’s quite potently paced this drama, with a sympathetic dialogue delivered on the verbal equivalent of a tightrope from Sarandon and from a Penn who also presents quite a powerful characterisation leaving us with a degree of uncertainty as to whether or not he actually did commit the crime! Tim Robbins capitalises on his experiences in front of the camera here as he tugs at our heartstrings whilst quite successfully managing both our innate sense of revulsion as the details unfold and our own senses of humanity which are uncomfortably challenged. It’s quite touching at times, thought-provoking on subjects of revenge and retribution and is well worth a couple of hours."

While she's not entirely convincing as a career-Marine, she's certainly more so than Demi Moore, who tried the stunt not long afterwards, and she's certainly believable as a caring teacher. An intriguing film for Simpson and Bruckheimer to be associated with, this was back in the day, after her career-defining 'Catwoman' role in 'Batman Returns' that she was still getting great starring roles (I greatly look forward to checking her out opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in 'The Age of Innocence'). My favourite work of hers will always be in 'Scarface', but this is right up there IMHO--some really fine acting by her. It's simply a shame only one note was asked of her--had it been a more multi-dimensional character (ie., love or family interests--I've read a possible romance scene with Andy Garcia was left on the cutting room floor so they could focus on her interaction with the students), it would have been even more inviting to watch. || So cheesy, but still fairly good mind you.

I did find myself cringing a decent amount throughout <em>'Dangerous Minds'</em> though, not necessarily in a negative way but just due to some rather sickly scenes. I found Michelle Pfeiffer's performance to be, for the most part, pleasant, though there are a few scenes where she overacts ever so slightly - in my opinion, of course.

Away from Pfeiffer, there isn't much to shout about. George Dzundza (Hal) has a few moments, as do the likes of Renoly Santiago, Bruklin Harris and Wade Dominguez. The lead is the only one who keeps things interesting, though.

The plot is fine, as is everything else really. They use ""Gangsta's Paradise"" (at least?) three times which is undoubtedly, absolutely three times too little - what a banger of a song that is from Coolio and L.V."

Teen movies can really be a terrible plague. I've had other occasions where I didn't spare them criticism, and generally it's a style of cinema that I dislike a lot for its sheer stupidity. However, this comedy about a group of spoiled rich girls is a positive example, a film for teenagers that manages to have quality and grace, while being a satire, quite critical, on the materialism and consumerism of elite teenagers.

Amy Heckerling had a brilliant idea to make a modern adaptation of the novel “Emma”, by Jane Austen. Any and all of the author's material is guaranteed to be good, and if it is well used, it usually gives good results. And indeed, the essence of this book is here: a spoiled and superficial girl who learns more about life, finds true love and the most genuine kindness and altruism. This is the transformation we see in Cher, the blonde and exuberant heroine of this film. She lives with her father, a lawyer who doesn't seem to pay much attention to his daughter but who, in fact, has a way of doing so. And it is at school, and in the complicated universe of popularity-obsessed teenagers, that Cher moves for most of the film. Rich and beautiful, she has no problem assuming herself as a leader, at the top of that strongly elitist and prejudiced mini-society that is the universe of teenagers. And she doesn't hesitate to use it to try to improve things around her.

This is the great movie of Alicia Silverstone's life. The actress still did some work later, and is known and respected, but the truth is that her career did not have such strong and relevant successes again. She embodied Cher in such a sincere and authentic way that it became difficult, from then on, to detach the character from the actress. Brittany Murphy also deserves a round of applause. She was incredibly young, but showed signs of talent and remained active as an actress until the end of her (unfortunately) brief life. Stacey Dash does what she can, but she doesn't have the time or material to shine like her peers. The film also has good performances by Dan Hedaya and Paul Rudd.

The movie doesn't have amazing visuals or great effects, nor is it supposed to. In fact, one of the secrets to its success (commercially, of course) was the fact that it had an average budget and a remarkable success at the box office. Without an unlimited credit card, the production went to great lengths to make the film look more expensive than it is, and I believe that a good part of the investment went into the elegant and seemingly expensive costumes for the three main characters, as well as the house where Cher lives, a magnificent California mansion. || I remember growing up watching this movie. I liked it for probably different reasons then others like it. I liked it because I hated girls like her. So I thought she just looked ridiculous the whole movie which made it funny to me. Favorite line: ""Why would I listen to you? Your a virgin that can't drive!"" LoL! || Alicia Silverstone is on good form as the daughter of a wealthy lawyer who has all that money can buy but with virtually no common sense. She’s not quite as daft as she looks, though, and when she manages to manoeuvre loved-up teachers “Mr. Hall” (Wallace Shawn) and “Miss Geist” (Twink Caplan) into a bit of romance gets the idea that maybe she can help others. Who knows, maybe even herself? First task is to rehabilitate new arrival “Tai” (Brittany Murphy) which she sets about with her fellow rich kid “Dionne” (Stacey Dash) but that just gets her thinking about herself and so she hooks up with the extremely dapper “Christian” (Justin Walker) but anyone with the gaydar of a dead chihuahua can spot his interests are elsewhere. Whom else? Perhaps the very candidate is right under her nose? It’s quite a cheerfully characterful drama this with an amiable mix of quote potent stereotypes poked fun at as she proves that you ought not to judge a book by it’s cover. Some of the scenarios are really quite funny, especially when she tries to pass a driving test by playing dodgems down the street. It’s stood the test of time better than many of these coming-of-age dramas, perhaps because the writing relies less on lazy tropes and predictable set-pieces and delivers something just a little more substantial."

Today's English monarchy is, at best, nominal, but even way back in the 1930s there wasn't much to be gained by usurping it.

Then again, the film takes place in an alternate reality where the War of the Roses occurs 450 years after the true historical conflict did. I don’t mind so much that royalty has endured those four centuries and a half; what does bother me is that language has not evolved in the interim at the same rate as, say, warfare. Why on Earth would Richard (McKellen), who is neither dumb nor crazy, use the expression “my kingdom for a horse” when he could be asking for a tank instead?

This line is only in the movie because it’s in the play – but then, a great many things that are in the play aren’t in the film, and viceversa, so why keep this particular bit? I mean, it couldn’t be because the audience is expecting it, even though it makes zero sense given the circumstances, could it? Did they think diehard Shakespeare fans would riot otherwise? Well, if there were such a thing as hardcore Shake-heads, I assure you they would have rioted long before this point.

Similarly outdated is a scene in which several characters who have been at each other’s throats are compelled to swear mutual oaths of loyalty. As Al Pacino’s superb documentary Looking for Richard rightly points out, at the time that the original play is set this would be serious business, because only people who want to go to hell would swear an oath and not keep it. Ditto the scene where Richard blames his deformity on Queen Elizabeth's witchcraft; this is an accusation that would have been given credence in the 1470s, but not so much in the 1930s.

All things considered, it’s somewhat ironic that McKellen had a hand in the script, because his performance is worthy of much better material. His body language, in particular, is priceless – this Richard looks like a super-intelligent ape masquerading as a British Army field marshal. And when he breaks the fourth wall – another device that works better on a theater stage –, it feels as if Richard is letting the viewers in on that the entire movie is a sick joke he's playing on the other characters. If only."

Sam Neill is just plain wooden as the mischievous king and though the ensemble cast enter into the spirit of the film with varying degrees of enthusiasm, even this familiar array of British thesps can't make this sow's ear into a silk purse.

The pic very much harks back to the glory days of film noir in the 40s and 50s, where some talented film makers began to tell stories of returning war veterans finding what they left behind is now alien to them - with some characters, as is the case here - deeply scarred by their experiences. Add in some gangster elements and the coup de grâce that is the scintillating heist, and clearly the brothers have seen many an old classic film. That the narrative is tried and tested stops the piece hitting greater heights, this in spite of some super acting (especially Tate and the always value for money Keith David) and the hard hitting violence that pierces the senses. Predictable yet potent, and certainly memorable, it's well worth a look for the tough of mind and the classic era film of heart. 7/10 || The fairly charismatic Larenz Tate tries quite hard here as ""Curtis"", a lad with potential who falls in with petty criminal ""Kirby"" (Keith David) before enlisting in the US Marines to go and fight in Vietnam.

The story is pretty formulaic and the actors are rarely challenged by the lacklustre script - that does little to develop any characterisations - and the largely unimaginative direction. There is a missed opportunity to look at the post war trauma and loneliness; the sense of abandonment felt by many soldiers returning home after the intensity of conflict - but nope, nothing really doing here on that front. The photography has it's moments and the ending is lively, but sadly this film is just all a bit too entrenched in stereotype and a well trammelled plot that is far too long and misses way more than it hits. || Bank robbery movie.

When the film was being advertised, several people were either excited for it, or skeptical due to Street Fighter being a total stinker, and since the film was rated PG-13, which meant the violence and gore from the game had to be toned down to appeal to the then-young MK fan base. Thankfully, all expectations were surpassed as Mortal Kombat actually turned out to be, believe it or not, a good video game movie. Upon its release, the film was, surprisingly, a box- office success, making it the first video game adaptation to be successful both financially, and with fans, despite mixed reviews from critics (although Gene Siskel gave the movie a thumbs up). To this day, it is considered one of the better game to film translations. Now, it's time to find out why that is the case.

The film succeeds by sticking to the plot of the first game while incorporating elements from Mortal Kombat II. The plot itself is very similar to Enter the Dragon (which I consider to be the greatest Martial Arts film ever made), but with a supernatural twist to it, which is rather refreshing, and helps it stand on its own. Unlike Street Fighter where the focus was on Guile instead of Ryu and Ken (the original protagonists of that franchise), this movie centers mostly around the Mortal Kombat game's original protagonist; Liu Kang.

All of the characters from the first Mortal Kombat game (as well as a few from MKII) are present in the film, and are given appropriate development, and screen time. The casting is also spot-on. This is one of the few adaptations of a video game, comic book, and cartoon show (at least one of the few I could think of) where all of the actors are cast perfectly. Christopher Lambert, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are especially great as Rayden and Shang Tsung (respectively), they deliver the right amount of charisma without chewing the scenery. Linden Ashby also plays a great Johnny Cage since he brings the character's cocky personality to life, and delivers some of the best humor in this movie. But my favorite casting choice in the film has to be Robin Shou as Liu Kang. Not only is Liu my favorite character in the games, but Shou looks very much like the character, and makes you feel for him by showing his impulsiveness, and guilt over the death of his brother. It's a shame he didn't receive more starring vehicles after this movie, because I feel he is a capable actor, and Martial Artist. He definitely has more of a personality than Steven Seagal.

While the movie is rated PG-13, and doesn't contain the large amounts of gore from the game, it does make up for this area with the large amounts of Martial Arts action. The fight scenes are very well done, and often emulate more of the Hong Kong style of fight choreography, which was a refreshing change from most American action films prior to this. They also incorporate several of the special moves from the game, such as Liu Kang's bicycle kick, Scorpion's spear that comes out of his hand, etc., and they manage to make them look believable, and not embarrassing, unlike Street Fighter.

The person who directed this movie is Paul W.S. Anderson, and if that name sounds familiar, that's because this is the same man who would later go on to butcher Alien vs. Predator, and the Resident Evil movies. Despite his more recent efforts, he does a solid job directing this film. One of the strong points of his direction (aside from how well he filmed the fight scenes) is how he handled the movie on a technical, and design level. The cinematography, set designs, and lighting are stylish, and keep in touch with the game's dark, and mystical atmosphere. The special FX in the movie are also pretty cool, granted, they aren't exactly Terminator 2, or Jurassic Park, but they work fine for a film released in 1995. Though not everything is CGI, the character of Goro is a puppet, which still looks good to this day, and were created by special FX masters Alec Gillis, and Tom Woodruff, Jr.

Overall, Mortal Kombat is still a fun film to watch. It made up greatly for Street Fighter, and in my opinion, it still is one of the best video game movies (right up there with Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist). It may not be Oscar winning material, but it is one of my personal favorite movies, and as a huge fighting game fan, I couldn't be any more proud of it. || So, after years of lethal ""Mortal Kombat"" competition ""Outworld"" is poised to complete it's tenth victory over ""Earthrealm"" entitling it to take it over. It falls to defender ""Rayden"" (Christopher Lambert) to recruit three warriors who might just be able to thwart the ambitions of his nemesis - the sorcerer ""Shang Tsung"" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). The three he selects would not have been the obvious choice. ""Liu Kang"" (Robin Shou) and ""Sonya Blade"" (Bridgette Sampras) are driven by the need for vengeance of their own whilst the outwardly shallow ""Johnny Cage"" (Linden Ashby) is an actor just out to prove there is more to him than his acting. Can they defeat the champions of ""Outworld"" and their own demons? It is only 100 minutes long, this - but somehow it seems so much longer. The story takes far too long to get going, the character establishment introduces us to three people that have axes to grind, but they are not particularly interesting or characterful - and neither is their dialogue. The nature of the fight scenes is repetitive and shows a startling lack of imagination as does the really drawn-on look of the special effects. Lambert makes only the briefest of appearances as the guru in the white suit; indeed the star of the show is probably Tagawa who hams up wonderfully as the baddie. The narrative does try to combine action, adventure and mysticism - but neither the writer nor the director have anything like enough flair to make this anything other than a predictable, candle-lit, martial arts flop."

Seven is directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.

An unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.

Having been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.

""But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever""

Seven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!

Faultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to ""light"" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10 || Se7en put David Fincher on the map with this uber-creepy mystery thriller.

I've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.

I've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions… it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.

One of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.

The gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.

I'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.

Technically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.

Movies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.

Se7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made…. I can't recommend it more.

Suzanne sees that Larry is not behind her career, and uses a trio of teens to kill him. She begins her plan by befriending them while shooting a documentary, then begins sleeping with James (Joaquin Phoenix), who in turn conspires with Russell (Casey Affleck) and Lydia (Alison Folland). Most of the film is told in flashback by the killers and families of Suzanne and Larry, and Suzanne herself.

""To Die For"" is a strange film. Acting wise, the professional cast is saddled with one-note characters. While top-heavy with supporting players, Suzanne never really changes much, or offers enough menace to feel anything for her. Dillon fades into the background as Larry, trying too hard to make him normal. Buck Henry's screenplay is full of fits and starts, never gathering enough darkness to become a successful dark comedy, nor enough edge to become a successful satire. This is a shame, since celebrity due to murderous acts is such a part of our lives today. The film never takes that final step and calls the media on the carpet, instead trying to get the viewer caught up in the mechanics of Suzanne and Jim's relationship, and Suzanne's progressively strange certainty that she will be famous. Gus Van Sant's direction is absolutely fantastic. The interior of Larry and Suzanne's home is hysterical. His camera always finds the perfect tone of a scene, even if the scene is not especially well-written. I am one of the few who did not think much of ""Drugstore Cowboy,"" although I do appreciate many of the films Van Sant has done since. ""To Die For"" gets the viewer geared up for a no-punches-pulled look at popular culture, then throws in the towel before the bell even rings.

This starts off strongly depicting the story via a series of interviews with those closest to her, and they serve quite effectively as pillars supporting the deviousness of the plot. Thing is, though, given we know all along who's done what to whom, and why - there's no jeopardy and I missed that. Kidman does fine, but the menacing aspects of the role really do rather peter out half way through and the comedy is more miss than hit. Folland probably delivers best cutting a ditzy and lonely figure as the film develops and it's quite a potent indictment of ambition and manipulation from time to time too, but I just couldn't quite take her seriously.

<em>'Pocahontas'</em> is an enjoyable flick from 1995. The animation is lovely, while the voice cast each do fine jobs. The premise raises noteworthy thoughts regarding British colonisation. It isn't perfect and isn't in-depth by any means, but I like what the film takes on.

Irene Bedard does well in the lead role, while the seemingly ever topical Mel Gibson supports ably. It's also interesting to hear a young Christian Bale involved as Thomas. Billy Connolly appears too, though only minorly.

The animation and music are the key parts to this. The songs aren't massively memorable but are catchy, the score is solid throughout but really comes up big at the end. Most of the humour, mainly with the animals, is fun too.

Overall, it's a production worth watching. || Never really got into this movie.

Those looking for historical accuracy ought to look elsewhere; this is a vehicle of some good (not great) animation that touches on Native American traditions and beliefs (""The Willow Tree"" - voiced by Linda Hunt - being quite a poignant example) and for Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz's Oscar winning, if dreadfully sentimental songs.

It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.

Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor – leaving few survivors. 

It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.

The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him. 

We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.

It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.

The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10 || **A clever twist and heavy fan support are the only stand-out aspects of this average heist film.**

Bloggers, reviews, and friends hyped The Usual Suspects for years before I finally watched it, and it was ok. The movie had a pretty clever plot twist that the entire film was building towards from the beginning. Unfortunately, without the twist, the film is pretty mediocre. Brute force characterized the heists over clever planning. Keyser Söze's brilliant manipulation of the characters around him seems less mastermind and more taking advantage of criminals that aren't the sharpest tools in the shed. Many people would disagree with me, but The Usual Suspects rates average at best for me."

Murray Abraham, Donald Symington",Woody Allen,"prostitute, adoption, adoptive father, childlessness, looking for  birth parents, adoptive mother, illegal prostitution, kids","**_An older man befriends a kindhearted prostitute_**

A Manhattan scriptwriter (Woody Allen) meets the young mother of his adopted boy, a hooker (Mira Sorvino), and tries to help her situation. Meanwhile, his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) is caught up in her ambitious work as a curator of art galleries, not to mention the serious flirting of a colleague (Peter Weller).  A Greek chorus occasionally chimes in (F. Murray Abraham, etc.), linking the story to that of Oedipus.

“Mighty Aphrodite” (1995) is a quirky comedy set in Manhattan, which is unsurprising with Woody at the helm. The heart of the plot, described in my title blurb above, is reminiscent of “Hardcore” (1979) minus the gravity. 

Both Helena and Mira were in their prime and look great in totally opposite ways. The flick is amusing, touching and ironic. I enjoyed the audacious Greek chorus element, something few filmmakers could pull off, but Woody does so effortlessly.

The movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan with the Greek chorus scenes done at Teatro Greco on Sicily, Italy.

GRADE: B || To minimise the inconvenience to their daily lives, a married couple adopt a baby from birth, but by the time he is five the fizz has rather gone out of their marriage. He's a sports journalist and is a bit bored with her (Helena Bonham Carter) more ""arty"" friends whom she knows from her all-consuming work in her gallery. When their adopted son ""Max"" starts to show signs that ne might just be some sort of a prodigy, dad ""Lenny"" (Woody Allen) decides that he wants to try to track down the birth mother. Imagine his disappointment when he discovers that it's ""Linda"" (Mira Sorvino). She's an expensive hooker with hopeless aspirations to get on the stage and as thick as two short planks into the bargain. He decides that maybe he can help her out of her wicked ways, so tries to set her up with one of his pals so she can better conform to his own expectations of the parent of this boy genius. All the while, ""Lenny"" (and the audience) is being informed and guided by an ensemble of artistes from an ancient greek chorus who offer him sagely words of wisdom and prophecy which he invariably chooses to disregard - and so what ensues can at times resemble a work that might just have made Aeschylus proud. Allen always just seems the same to me, and here is no different, but Sorvino really does deliver the goods as the well-meaning woman who has an honesty streak a mile wide. Of course, there's the obligatory age gap between the two, and between him and his wife (she's thirty years his junior) which again serves to fuel the frustrations of a man who seems determined never to be satisfied - but hey, isn't that true of most Woody Allen films. There is some wit from the observational script but it's really all down to the comically potent artistes delivering their warnings of woe and joy and to a superbly engaging Sorvino to make this work. They do."

That's not to say it's a serious football film, it certainly isn't and the ball game isn't even the main takeaway from events - it's more about people caring and coming together. It's rather nice.

There's nothing really noteworthy about the cast to be honest, Olivia d'Abo (Anna) and Steve Guttenberg (Tom) are, I guess, the standouts. Kate's (Jessica Robertson) story has heart, as does Juan's (Anthony Esquivel), but they as actors don't get much to work with.

If there is something that manages to cause serious expression problems in the most flirtatious and fluent of men, it is the ardent gaze of the girl he loves. I know this from experience, and any man who has been in love, at least once, knows that it is not easy to choose the right moment and the right words to express the greatness and beauty of feelings. Things get worse, of course, if the man is shy or less experienced in Cupid's dealings. Then, yes, things get really complicated!

Contrary to what the film might make us think, it is not necessary to be a poet to tell a beautiful woman that we love her. Well, from the little that has happened to me, what often happens is that love itself transforms us into incidental, fortuitous poets. And if the first verses are given to us by the gods, the muse of our affection easily inspires the rest. And that's how poetry is made: through the adventures and misfortunes of the heart of those who write it!

This Italian production tackles these questions by facing two characters who, otherwise, might never meet: one is Mario Ruoppolo, a former fisherman who became a postman because he doesn't get along with seasickness, and who feels not being able to express how he feels about the girl he is in love with; the other is the famous Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda, famous for his socialist verbiage and for the romantic sonnets that earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature. The contrast could not be greater: the simplicity and natural shyness of the popular man and the expressiveness and charisma of a consecrated public figure. And if one has ascendancy over the other, I cannot say that the popular man seems to have had great importance for the public figure, despite the fact that the film tries to instill it.

Massimo Troisi, in addition to assisting director Michael Redford, brilliantly secures the lead role, giving Ruoppolo a balanced dose of modesty, shyness and curiosity. The only negative criticism I can make of him is the way he fades and darkens whenever he has to play with Neruda, well played by Philippe Noiret. However, it cannot be denied that the best parts of the film are the dialogues and scenes in which both are together. And in fact, the dialogues deserve a special note, for the quality and the way they were done. Renato Scarpa is irritating due to the excessive politicization of his character, which is as tiresome and repetitive as the political discourse of most communist and socialist politicians. If we listen to one in a single speech, we listen to them all in everything they might want to say. Despite not appearing much and not really having much to do, Maria Grazia Cucinotta is a welcome addition to the plot, as well as being magnificent and so beautiful that any man in the street would turn his head to admire her for longer (something that happens much to the ragazze of Italy, on account of the great merit of their beauty).

Technically, the film has some merits: if the cinematography is not particularly remarkable and looks misty and aged, the scenic beauty of the filming locations and the film's sets compensates for them, with plenty of room and with an abundance of light, sun, sea, magnificent outdoor scenes and truly breathtaking landscapes. The melody also deserves a frankly positive note: in addition to fitting harmoniously with the film and each scene, it is beautiful, very well conceived and stays in the ear. || With things unstable in his native Chile, renowned poet ""Neruda"" (Philippe Noiret) takes refuge on a small Italian island where his arrival is greeted with little more than a realisation that they are going to need to hire an extra postman! Step forward ""Mario"" (Massimo Troisi). He can barely read or write but is determined to engage the visitor in conversation and to learn from him. Initially indifferent, ""Neruda"" begins to converse with him as he delivers the daily post and when he declares he needs some help to woo the charming ""Beatrice"" (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), he finds himself with a new mentor. Now it's fair to say that his first attempts are maybe just a little too rough and ready. Too many references to the shapeliness of her breasts and such like, but gradually ""Mario"" learns how to express himself more fully, more characterfully, and less earthily too. This education also opens his eyes to what has been going on around him for years. His island doesn't even have running water and with elections looming, he finds himself drawn to a communist cause as he watches the visiting politicians make promises he knows will never be delivered. His new found political awareness doesn't always go down so well with his compatriots who just want to get on with their simple, maritime, lives. This adaptation of Antonio Skármeta's book really does imbue the characters with a generous spirit and loads of charisma. It's all understated, and the evolution of ""Mario"" is really well handled by Troisi who sort of co-directed with Michael Radford and with a delicately honest effort from Noiret too. The cinematography benefits hugely from the natural island scenario which at times seems to mirror the emotions being played out by the people. This is also quite an effective analysis of what constitutes poetry itself. The subtlety of the structure of the words that don't rely on the all-too-familiar rhymes is used to good effect. Another film that befits hugely from a cinema screen to enjoy the brightness and Luis Bacalov score and is really worth a watch."

A composer (Richard Dreyfuss) puts his lofty ambitions on hold to become a high school music teacher in Portland, Oregon, from 1965-1995. Glenne Headly plays his wife, Jay Thomas the coach, Olympia Dukakis the principal and William H. Macy the irritating vice principal.     

""Mr. Holland’s Opus"" (1995) is a good school-oriented drama that’s episodic in nature since it spans 30 years. The first 40 minutes were decent, but I was wondering if the film would be able to absorb me into its story, especially considering its considerable length. It did, particularly the episodes concerning Terrence Howard (playing Louis Russ) and angelic Jean Louisa Kelly (Rowena).  

The movie’s kind of a meshing of “Dead Poets Society” (1989) crossed with “Forrest Gump” (1994), although not great like either of those flicks. But it’s a solid drama. A 19 year-old Alicia Witt is on hand as one of the students in the first act.

The film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes and was shot in Portland, Oregon, and nearby Marylhurst.

GRADE: B || **Another good film about an outstanding teacher marking the lives of his students... another one.**

One of the things I like most about a film, in addition to telling a good story and positively entertaining us for an hour or two, is to reflect on different subjects and themes. This exercise of critical questioning, free and reachable to the public, much more attractive than a six-hundred-page book, is one of the most important qualities of cinema. And this film has lots of themes and topics worthy of our reflection.

First, I should say that the film is very good! It is very forgotten today and deserves to be revisited. It is, I think, the best film of Stephen Herek, an average director, more focused on TV, actually. The merit of the film falls, largely, on the great quality of the script by Patrick Sheane Duncan, who created the story of a composer who becomes a music teacher at a high school to earn some income and ends up marking several generations of students, teaching them to love music while trying to protect and support their own son, who was born deaf.

In addition to a deep and moving story, we have good actors working in a very committed way: Richard Dreyfuss may be an actor who is a little far from the spotlight, but he gives us an extraordinary performance in this film and was nominated for the Oscar (he lost to Nick Cage, who shone in “Leaving Las Vegas” in a more psychologically challenging role). Glenne Headly and a young Terrence Howard gave him welcome and very solid support.

The film moves us with its story, highlighting the importance of music and the relevance of artistic education. In a society where, more and more, we are appreciated for the money we earn to our employers (or companies, or countries), the arts and human sciences (history and philosophy, for example) are underappreciated because they are considered to have very few professional opportunities and practical applicability. The situation could not be more unfair: the human sciences teach us to think, to have a critical conscience and a vast general culture, while the arts transmit us an aesthetic sense and a capacity for self-expression that, unlike writing, tends to be universally intelligible. It's a shame that human resources directors often turn out to be such obtuse people, with such short horizons. The film addresses deafness in an interesting way, showing us that even a deaf person can appreciate music and that deafness is no impediment to an active and happy life.

The film has only two major problems: the first problem, and for me the most serious, is falling back on the older clichés about school films involving teachers, and all the impact they have. This was done, much more effectively, in “Dead Poets Society” and “Mona Lisa Smile”. At this point, the most essential of the plot, there is nothing original. The second problem is that unreasonable romantic tension between Holland and one of his young and seductive students. We all know that the relationship between a student and her teacher is one of the most appealing erotic fantasies among middle-aged men, and I can understand why they included that sub-plot, but it's beside the point and should never have been included in the final cut."

The premiss of vengeance here ought to have provided for a more robust framework for this drama, but sadly the direction meanders and the film quickly loses the pace is starts with. There is a convincing vulnerability to Miss Field's performance, she plays the desperate mother well. Harris and Sutherland, however, feature far too sparingly with the latter simply failing to inject any menace into the proposition. Though violent at times, it strays all too often into melodrama territory and ends pretty much as you expect right from the outset. Sadly, this is really not much better than a mediocre television thriller that I doubt I will recall next week."

For all intents and purposes, Fair Game is a decent action movie, although overindulgent in most aspects (huge explosions, gratuitous boob shots of Cindy Crawford, nudity, a famous sex scene and one-note acting). The film was designed solely as a vehicle to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Cindy Crawford, the hottest Supermodel of the 1990's... and in that respect, it had enormous success. Fair Game has become a sort of Cult classic, based on the adoration for Crawford's sex appeal and a brief, early role by Salma Hayek.

This is actually one of the first movies by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino that I watched and from then on I pretty much became a fan of them both. So, when it came out on Blu-ray a while ago I had to get it for the collection of course.

When I and my dear wife first watched this movie we did not really know what it was all about. We thought it was just another robbery/criminal story and the first half of the movie it is indeed “just” a robbery/criminal story. It is a fairly violent one at that which should be no surprise given who it is that have their fingers in the movie.

Then half way into the movie everything goes wild when the vampires enter the scene. I remember going “what the f…” when I first saw it since I wasn’t really expecting it to be a vampire movie at all.

The movie is quite a rollercoaster ride which bears all the trademarks, in particular lots of bizarre violence, of the Rodriguez/Tarantino couple. Needless to say this is one of my favourite cult/bizarre movies. || Outrageous!

It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging ""B"" horror movie gore fest.

The plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) & Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal (for others) hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu). From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico - a bar called ""The Titty Twister"", where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is, is that ""The Titty Twister"" isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's - and their newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour?.

Swearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a damn funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand its genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie (one of many awesome ""B"" cult movie actors in the pic). It's bonkers and silly as hell, but once a fan of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", you are a fan for life. Well as long as you don't venture out to ""The Titty Twister"" yourself of course..

Welcome To Slavery. 9/10 || So ""Seth"" (George Clooney) and his nasty brother ""Richard"" (Quentin Tarantino) leave a trail of death and mayhem as they head to the safety of Mexico after robbing a bank then trashing a convenience store and a motel! Close to the border, they abduct a pastor ""Jacob"" (Harvey Keitel) and his family and use them to slip un-noticed across the border before heading to a lively brothel ""Titty Twister"". Once there, and suitably tanked up with booze, they discover that there is something distinctly fishy (and it's not just with the stockings) as darkness descends and the clientele, well let's just say they get hungry... What now ensues is a bloodbath worth of any Hammer film - and frankly, it's of about the same standard. Tarantino may well be formidable behind the camera, but in from of it he is hopeless. Clooney fares a little better but it's really only Keitel who manages to keep this increasingly farcical film moving along for what seems like an age. I found what passed for humour to be pretty vulgar and tawdry and to be honest, I was rather bored with the relentlessness and repetition of the whole thing one we had got past the obligatory violent stages of the plot development. Was it supposed to be a comedy? You tell me - but either way, I won't bother watching it again."

I offer that his 1995 black and white film **IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER** is equally autobiographical.  And I guess that we will see a third black and white film in the future that would showcase the twilight of his career to close out the Branagh Trilogy. (_Cross your fingers_.)

**IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER** is also the first film that Branagh does not appear. It is arguably the least popular film in his oeuvre, partially because of the release in the United States under the name **A MIDWINTER'S TALE**.  For ease of understanding, this review will refer to it as **MIDWINTER**.

The storyline is brief, almost a British **WAITING FOR GUFFMAN** as a small group of theatrical performers are mounting an overly ambitious, _underly_ funded production of that old Christmas classic, **HAMLET**.  Yes the _everyone's dead at the end_ **HAMLET**.  It even results in a powerful movie producer attending opening night in an environment not typical to great theatre.

The screenplay is filled with great characters and very funny circumstances.  Although not on screen, Branagh's voice is loud and clear.  In fact, by this sixth film of his, we are able to see a bit of critical weakness.  Branagh's films are lacking in quiet moments - usually wall to wall dialogue mixed with Patrick Doyle's regal musical scoring.  This film is the first to subtly address that. In fact, it ends with many payoffs that the heart understands oh so well.

**MIDWINTER** is a very good film, but will likely remain his most forgettable work... Until my _dream Branagh Trilogy_ Box Set exists!"

The first half was decent and involving, but it kind of slid off the rails, interest-wise for me, the rest of the way and got too talky and uninspired.

I don't really know if the problem was with the script or its direction. I know I'm not the greatest John Cusack fan in the world (I find he's much better in comedy, like his sister Joan), but he had pretty good co-stars, whose talents were basically wasted, in Martin Landau, Anthony Franciosa and Danny Aiello (these guys were BORN for these roles and films, so on paper, this should have really worked out well). I had always wondered why this film had bombed so miserably, and now I know why. In cases like this, more should have been done to alter the story arc, just some basic tweaks, to make it more suspenseful and/or (though I usually balk at such 'Hollywood' tendencies) some romantic tension (a beauty such as Fonda's was misused--they may as well have hired someone else). All in all, a wasted opportunity that's worth a look if you like dramas about corruption--just don't go in with big expectations, and don't bother with a rewatch. || Saw this one maybe 20 years ago and for whatever reason had a hankering to check it out again. Not great or ambitious as it sounds and pacing was a bit off, but in general found it engaging and had solid performances. I do wonder how much better it could have been under someone like Scorsese. **3.5/5** || There is a historical accuracy in how the film is presented. A small thing, the murder of a boy, builds and builds, and unravels all the layers of the onions until the ripples can be felt at the highest and most powerful levels.

That is, essentially what happened with Watergate where a simple B&E brought down Nixon. It's also what happened, almost 2,000 years earlier with the Conspiracy of Cantoline.

If you are tuned to it, like The Paper, it's not just about corruption, but about ripple effects and that is pretty cool.

And, it's really well acted, well enough to make you lament that Cusack and Pacino aren't paired more often."
13685.0,Bottle Rocket,"Upon his release from a mental hospital following a nervous breakdown, the directionless Anthony joins his friend Dignan, who seems far less sane than the former.

Seeing the sub-70% rating on this website nearly broke my heart. And since there were no reviews of the film, I decided it was my duty as a _Bottle Rocket_ stan to make a feeble attempt at evangelizing on its behalf.

People complain about how twee and pretentious Anderson's movies come across. Yet, somehow, as one of his movies that largely sidesteps those pitfalls, Bottle Rocket usually gets shit on the most. Part of the ""problem"" is that there's a subtlety to the humor and the storytelling that is unmatched in Anderson's filmography. It's not as ""mainstream quirky"" as a _Moonrise Kingdom_, nor does it have the flashiness (relatively speaking) of a _Rushmore_ or a _Life Aquatic_. It's much more than that -- to me, at least.

It's a very low-stakes film, something which I always appreciate in my fiction. It's just a bunch of morons who want to be criminals. Why? Because they're morons and they have names like Dignan and Applejack and it's funny. You want a compelling plot, go watch _The Royal Tenenbaums_. You want to laugh at Owen Wilson dressing up in a banana-colored jumpsuit and riding around on a tiny motorcycle, _Bottle Rocket_'s ya boy.

Luke Wilson's Anthony is, ostensibly, the star of this film. His struggle with his vague mental illness really resonates with me because I, too, am nuts. Owen Wilson is the main attraction here, though. He brings a sort of low-key freneticism to Dignan that always makes me smile. Look at that little guy go. I honestly don't think Wes Anderson has ever written a better character, though I know that I'm, inexplicably, the only person in the world who thinks that.

I don't know what I can say to make people like this movie more. It's good! It's fun and cute and sweet! It's very Wes Anderson without being too Wes Anderson. You know? I would think more people would appreciate that. If this were made today, Timothee Chalamet would undoubtedly be cast as one of the two leads, so let's be glad it lives forever encased in 1996 carbonite. || <em>'Bottle Rocket'</em> felt like it was running on fumes for me, the conclusion is an improvement on what procedes but it doesn't quite do enough to salvage my feelings towards this Wes Anderson feature directorial debut. With that noted, I didn't explicitly dislike it either.

Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson make their acting bows, quite interesting that the brothers don't actually portray brothers; kinda refreshing to see, actually. Robert Musgrave and James Caan are also involved. Owen is the standout in my opinion, though the main trio are on a similar-ish level.

It coulda done with more laughs, but that's obviously a personal thing - no doubt many will find it funny, just not me; albeit with a few chuckles scattered in there. It also isn't the most Wes Anderson-y film, with his signature MO evidently not quite fully developed yet (as expected, tbf)."
406.0,La Haine,"After a chaotic night of rioting in a marginal suburb of Paris, three young friends, Vinz, Hubert and Saïd, wander around unoccupied waiting for news about the state of health of a mutual friend who has been seriously injured when confronting the police.","How far you fall doesn't matter, it's how you land…",Drama,98,1995-05-31,fr,8.086,4242,4.8397,"Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé, Saïd Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili, Solo",Mathieu Kassovitz,"neo-nazism, police brutality, hip-hop, paris, france, socially deprived family, breakdance, ghetto, male friendship, racism, black and white, xenophobia, day in a life, aggressive, paris suburb","Matthieu Kassowitz's <i>La Haine</i> (Hate) is a portrait of youth disenfranchisement and the ensuing rage set in the public housing projects outside Paris. Before this film was released, many foreign viewers knew only the well-dressed, white, reserved and educated France depicted in e.g. films of the 1960s New Wave. Even many French people were unaware of the darker undercurrents of their own society, as no film had dared to handle this subject matter before. <i>La Haine</i> was a bombshell. While shot in 1995, it remains entirely topical today, as riots have continued to make the news in recent years.

<i>La Haine</i> follows one day in the lives of three young men of different ethnic backgrounds all born and raised in one particular housing project: the aggressive Jew Vinz (Vincent Cassell), the insecure, clownish Arab Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui) and the more level-headed, pensive sub-Saharan African Hubert (Hubert Koundé). The film opens on a spring morning, in the aftermath of a riot which has rocked these youths' housing project. Some cars and buildings are destroyed, and the news reports that a police officer has lost his gun in the chaos of the night before. During the 24-hour period before the film's shocking ending, this trio tours the bittersweet environment of their housing project (violence and poverty on one hand, loving families on the other) and, in an effort to pick up money owed to them, they navigate the alien environment (rich, educated, white) of downtown Paris.

This is not only a revelatory film in showing viewers a side of France they had never seen before, but it is also extremely entertaining. The performances by these relatively unexperienced actors are totally convincing, Vincent Cassell in particular. Kassowitz shuns his country's own film tradition and instead sculpts the action under inspiration from the USA. However, the ""urban"", ""hip-hop"" aesthetic he employs does not lower the film to the more vacuous Hollywood productions but instead is at the level of Spike Lee and Scorsese. The director's decision to print the film in black and white has imbued it with a gravitas that makes it timeless. That said, in spite of the fine acting and ethnographic detail, the plot itself is rather mundane, which holds me back from giving this too high a rating. || It's not so much the individual acting with this that stands out, it is the collective effort of all concerned to demonstrate to us just how perilous life can be on their Parisian suburban housing estate. Riots the evening before we arrive on the scene have left the area in a state of almost acute nervous exhaustion. The police are treading on egg shells and the community is a tinder box. To add to the volatility, a police officer lost his gun the night before and one of the locals ""Vinz"" (Vincent Cassel) has vowed to avenge himself on another officer should his currently hospitalised friend ""Abdel"" die. It transpires quite quickly that ""Abdel"" was severely injured as a result of an interrogation at a police station, and is now in a coma. You can just imagine the effect that has had on this otherwise mistrusting and suspicious community. Director Matthieu Kassovitz has created a monster here. It's poignant and angry, evocative and terrifying. As this fateful day turns to night and ""Vinz"" with his two friends ""Said"" (Saïd Taghmaoui) and aspiring boxer ""Hubert"" (Hubert Koundé) head downtown things take a turn for the worst with yet more tragic results. It is not an easy film to watch this, but it is compelling and as a sad indictment of urban living and (in)tolerance, it is very effective. || Very, very good movie!

<em>'La Haine'</em> is interesting slice of life viewing, I was intrigued across the whole 90 or so minutes as it tells its tale nicely. Some of the cinematography (b/w, smart choice) and editing is particularly impressive, while the ending is stark and unforgettable. The intentions of the film come across loud and clear.

I didn't overly connect with the main trio, aside from Hubert. I could also sense that something was on the horizon (didn't see it going exactly that way, mind) from early on, so you kinda are just sitting there waiting for the penny to drop - but there's no doubting the film successfully keeps you on tenterhooks.

The characters are a bit meh in terms of wanting to watch them, though the actors who play them are excellent - without question. Hubert Koundé is the one I'll likely remember most, even with still noteworthy performances from Vincent Cassel and Saïd Taghmaoui; two actors I have seen in a few English-language flicks down the years."

The purpose of that story is why I enjoyed Happy Gilmore so much, it takes fun pot shots at the sport whilst daftly proclaiming that any dude can play in his own style. This is an absolutely no brain movie of course, with a plot as daft as it sounds - a failed/angry ice-hockey player takes up golf to earn money to save his granny's house from being repossessed - and of course he becomes a cause célèbre to the golfing curates.

RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by Clint Eastwood, “The Bridges of Madison County” details what happens in 1965 when a world-traveling photographer for National Geographic (Eastwood) inadvertently meets an Iowa Farm wife (Meryl Streep). 

This is a drama about the nature of eros love and potential infidelity that will only be appreciated by mature viewers. It consists of two people meeting, getting acquainted, discovering something profound and then forced to make decisions that’ll determine the rest of their lives, as well as the consequences for those linked to them. 

Some questions addressed include: What if you’re married and you meet someone you genuinely romantically love? What if you’re single and you meet a married person you profoundly love? How far do you (or can you) wisely take the relationship? What about others who would be negatively affected by pursuing the relationship?

These are all honest questions that most people have to consider at one time or another in their lives. The movie’s not corrupt for asking them or featuring a certain questionable act any more than the story of David & Bathsheba makes the Bible corrupt (or, arguably worse, the story of Judah & Tamar).

One character is too loose with morals, which he justifies by criticizing all the “borders” in life. But there are boundaries everywhere: National, state, county, city, school, government, business, social and… marital. The bottom line is: You’re either married or you’re not. If you’re married that means you have a committed lifelong covenant with your spouse. That’s what taking vows is all about. The movie tries to have its cake and eat it too by supporting such loyalty while flirting with the temptation to discard it in the name of true love. Regardless, the picture smacks of real life, real people, real (hard) decisions and is very well done, which is to be expected with Eastwood at the helm.    

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Winterset & Adel, Iowa.

GRADE: A- || A bit too cheesy for me to overly enjoy, but <em>'The Bridges of Madison County'</em> is a sweet romantic drama.

Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are a strong pairing and produce very good performances, with Streep particularly standing out... even if her acting Italian doesn't always feel convincing, to me anyway. The parts of the story told via Annie Corley and Victor Slezak aren't the best, though the eventual pay-off with their characters is worthwhile."

Porn obsessed loner, Travis Bickle, is a cabbie in New York. The story tells of his gradual descent into madness brought on by his inability to relate to those around him and a feeling of a lack of worth. Travis is essentially invisible - of no importance. Walton's self imposed isolation preferable to getting along with the scum around him. One day he decides to change all of that and become _a somebody_ by murdering a politician.

This _nobody_ with the superiority complex has gone off the rails, for certain and it can only lead to bloodshed. A lot of it will be his own. || Taxi Driver has had many things said about it, and I don't wish to add to all that but it is the yardstick I measure all other films by, it is by far my favourite of all the films I have ever watched.

It's brutal honesty and use of themes such as paranoia, mental health issues, and society degradation make it a film that has been imitated, and referenced since its opening in cinemas back in 1976.

Robert De Niro puts in a tour-de-force performance as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam War veteran with symptoms of PTSD and paranoia, who becomes a New York City taxi driver because of his inability to sleep. Travis is one who is at odds with society, fed up with pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, and all the other scum of the earth, he slowly works himself in his sleep deprived and drugged state to become a one man army ready to kill anyone he believes to be part of the problem.

His interactions with other cabbies, Betsy (Shepherd) a Presidential Candidate campaign worker, Iris a teenage prostitute (Foster), and her Pimp “Sport” (Keitel) fuels his destructive mission to rid New York City of its problems. His attempt at normalcy with Betsy, by taking her on date to a movie that disagrees with her sensibilities ends in disaster, mostly due to Travis’ supposed naivety about what is considered appropriate and tasteful entertainment.

While plying his nightly trade as a NYC cabbie, he has some unusual encounters, including a fare from a fairly psychotically jealous man showing Travis the place where the man’s wife is cheating on him, and then a short encounter with Iris who gets in his cab, and then forced out by Sport, who throws Travis a dirty crumpled up twenty dollar note for the trouble, Travis then makes it his mission to rescue Iris from her situation while also making a menace of himself to the visiting Presidential candidate.

This film is still relevant in these times, as social media, and other such technological & society advancements have brought about a new degradation of values, with many wanting their fifteen minutes of fame by any means necessary, which now brings with it many who sell their souls to attain notoriety.

I love De Niro's performance as Travis, its one that has many facets to it, in it is a man who is angry, naive, sleep deprived, lonely, a sociopath, and a killer.

A scene in the Presidential campaign office where he is rebuffed by Betsy due to the terrible date experience, and ushered, and menaced by the opportunistic & snotty campaign co-worker Tom (Brooks), shows the range of De Niro's performance as he goes from apologetic, and sheepish to angry, and ready to fight. De Niro was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for this role.

The presentation on blu-ray is a solid one, PQ is nice, skin tones not waxy, and the AQ allowing the score, and surrounding noise subtleties to really shine through, it's very well handled for a source filmed in the mid 70's || Robert De Niro is outstanding in this dark and gritty depiction of former marine ""Travis Bickle"". He spends his time, alone, driving his cab at night then watching seedy movies during the day. This relentless cycle is broken when he takes a shine to ""Betsy"" (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign worker for a would be US Presidential candidate. There is a glimmer of hope for him, as she agrees to go out with him for a movie - but when he takes her to his usual haunt for a Swedish film that perhaps wasn't quite Ingmar Bergman, he ends up back at square one. Simultaneously, he takes a more protective interest in the young ""iris"" (Jodie Foster) - a teenage hooker who is being used abused by her pimp, and to that end he acquires some firearms with which he is perfectly proficient, and so finally starts to see a purpose for his hitherto rather rudderness existence. Director Martin Scorsese and veteran scorer Bernard Hermann have created a wonderfully convincing and evocative scenario emphasising the seediness of a night time New York in which De Niro is able to thrive as few other actors could.

Although I know the actor from other movies, this was the first Jackie Chan movie I saw. He brings to life a friendly young man from Hong Kong who comes to the USA for his uncle's wedding, who has lived in the Bronx, New York, for many years. During his stay, he will see his uncle sell his shop in order to retire and spend his old age on a ranch, and he will also have to face a biker gang and a mafia organization that has lost a bag of diamonds that end up in the power of the character played by Chan. Of course, it's all going to end up in a beating.

The film is quite good at its simple and direct task of entertaining the audience. There's a nice, well-measured mix of humor and action. The jokes are quite naive, but they work and give the film a familiar and friendly touch that is pleasant without turning it into a tear-jerking comedy. The fight scenes are the strong point, and it is worth seeing the highly choreographed fights that Chan fights with ten or twenty opponents simultaneously, and in which he uses all his knowledge of martial arts. However, let's not have any illusions: the film shows the fight scenes a little faster than in reality, which amplifies the effect, but takes away the verisimilitude of what we are seeing.

Chan is likeable and perhaps one of the most palatable actors in the vast universe of stars whose careers were based on thuggish films (Van Damme, Chuck Norris and others). He deserves a good grade, both for his acting and for his fight scenes. Unfortunately, he's the only actor worth mentioning because the others are all pretty amateurish. But let no one think that Chan gives us a lesson in acting! He does what he's supposed to do: be funny and kick ass. It's Jackie Chan, not Lawrence Olivier. Anita Mui and Françoise Yip are here simply because the film needed some pretty faces.

The script is quite weak, a mere excuse for high doses of comedy and beatings for all tastes. The poverty of the script is such that, halfway through the film, we already forget the names of the characters and why Chan came to the US. These are questions that we soon feel are irrelevant (or rather, that were considered irrelevant in this film). The villains are really weak - the mobsters look scared, and the biker gang is ridiculous. However, all of this is relatively forgivable when we think of the poor editing work that went into this film. The cuts couldn't be more obvious and misplaced. There are scenes that seem to be inserted with a hammer, others appear suddenly, or end suddenly, just like the film itself, which ends so suddenly that it feels like an episode of a TV series and not a film for the cinema."
197.0,Braveheart,"Enraged at the slaughter of Murron, his new bride and childhood love, Scottish warrior William Wallace slays a platoon of the local English lord's soldiers. This leads the village to revolt and, eventually, the entire country to rise up against English rule.","Every man dies, not every man really lives.","Action, Drama, History, War",177,1995-05-24,en,7.944,10486,10.6551,"Mel Gibson, Catherine McCormack, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Angus Macfadyen",Mel Gibson,"epic, england, scotland, loss of loved one, idealism, based on true story, medieval, war","Being Scottish, this movie really does a good job at showing off the scenery in and around Scotland. The story line of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through the movie. Mel Gibson does a really good job with the accent and plays a great role as William Wallace in the movie.

I cant help by want to stand up and shout FREEDOM! once the movie is finished. Could watched this movie another 1000 times and not get board of watching it. It's a must watch for any one who has not see it yet. || Historical flaws aside, Braveheart is a rousing spectacle.

So it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart, a film that is historically bent in the extreme, that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation, and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.

It's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made, perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were, surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love, loyalty, honour, dishonour, treachery, death & heroes and villains. In short it ticks all the boxes for the genre it sits in (clinical bloody battles superbly full on). Gibson is William Wallace, and although he may struggle to nail the Scottish accent to fully convince at times, he more than makes up for it with his verve and vigour when delivering his lines - with the Sons Of Scotland speech at Stirling a particular iconic highlight.

Patrick McGoohan is pure egotistical villainy as Longshanks, King Edward I, and the supporting cast also do sterling work (or should that be Stirling?). Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece, and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle, Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture.

So yes, damn straight, flaws and all, pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times, but as it does so, it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone, but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10 || When i saw this I was 15 and it was one of the greatest movies I had ever seen. Fast forward to today, I'm 41, and degrees and history and... the battle of Sterling Bridge is like fingernails on a chalkboard whenever I see it.

I watched it with my wife and, ""no, she was like 3 and living in France.""

So I don't know. It was dramatic and moody and stylistically beautiful. It was a typical Gibson gore fest and that is always fun. It was well acted, the score added to the drama, and it spawned a movement in Scotland that they are still dealing with today...

... so it is still a really good film.

It just, well... where the heck is the bridge?"

I wanted to let it sit with me for a bit before watching it again and giving it a proper response.

Films like this, which are hyped to an unbelievable degree, end up sending an audience to end up watching it with elevated expectations, only to be ultimately disappointed afterwards. It’s a fact that many films suffer considerably from this aspect of our cinephile culture, I’ve experienced it with many films before.

_Chungking Express_ has a reputation that I think may be beyond what it intended, with it being an Out-of-Print title at Criterion, the prices for the Blu-ray being obnoxiously high, and the constant barrage of exuberant reactions from many who’ve seen the film. This kind of superficial intrigue alone can set me up with expectations that are likely to not be met. Every film that is being made does not intend to create this façade of a reputation, it’s just a film. Most creators are not there to make this kind of reaction happen out of their films, and yet, we somehow continue to do so…

I’m rambling, aren’t I? I think this is just my criticism with film culture regarding the hyping of certain films.

And yet, somehow, despite my attempts to condense these (potential) hyperbolic reactions, _Chungking Express_ may have exceeded my expectations. Perhaps that makes me a hypocrite regarding this issue, but then again, if I enjoyed the film to the extent at which it met my expectations (or surpassed them in this case), am I to be negatively looked at for criticizing these actions, but essentially having them work on me specifically with _Chungking Express_? If so, then let it be I guess. Regardless, this film was one of the best experiences I have had in a while.

It is surprisingly easy for me to connect with this film and its characters. All of them have a certain struggle they must deal with, whether it’d be relationship problems, not being able to move on, or even simply failing to accomplish a certain task. It’s all relatively simple if I think about it, there isn’t much in terms of characterization for many of the subjects in the film, and yet, I don’t believe there needs to be that much. Simply leaving it the way it is works extremely well, and I’m willing to believe that Wong Kar-Wai understood this.

There are statements that explain how Wong Kar-Wai essentially wrote scenarios for the film the morning of and shot the scenes later in the day. Easily, this could lead to a jumbled mess of separate ideas thrown together in the editing room at a feature length time. And yet, he stays consistent in the thematic ideas he proposes. Shot chronologically, the ideas set up through the first half of the film, have threads that continue onwards towards the second half.

One of my favorite directors, Krzysztof Kieślowski, uses the elements of interconnectedness within his films. Regardless of how different the stories might be, there is something there that connects each story together. In _Chungking Express_, that idea is essentially brought out brazenly, to the extent at which it initially shocked me. That one moment at the half-way mark of the film, comes at you so fast, that afterwards you’re left gasped for what the film turns into. It’s a brazen switch of narrative, and yet, it’s still leaves the film to be connected altogether.

The expectations for love are very much tricky in it of themselves, as is shown with each character that one sees in the film. It’s not simple, it isn’t black and white, but rather a spectrum that one must align itself with, and possibly adapt to if necessary. To deal with the aspects of love in a film can either be hokey and misguided, or it can be meticulous and interesting. _Chungking Express_ finds a middle ground between these two, not dealing too much towards the intellectual side of these issues, but not straying away too far towards the clichéd. Wong Kar-Wai doesn’t treat these characters as caricatures. Sure, there are some humorous; sometimes childish, moments with Faye, but it doesn’t take away from her character. As with every subject in the film, there is something to latch on to. All around the thematic ideas of love, or the lack thereof, worked together so well, that it leads to these characters feeling authentic. Not simply words on a script.

I really don’t know what else to say. I was awestruck the first time, and I feel even more so now. This is a film that really hit it home with me. More so than other films in the past.

I’ll say this, by the end of the film, I had similar vibes to when I finished _Lost in Translation_ for the first time. Soon afterwards, that film was my favorite of all time for years.

Film culture is fascinating, it may lead to disappointing outcomes based on hyperbolic expectations, or it may lead to a film experience that you never thought were possible.

I’m beginning to lean towards the latter with _Chungking Express_.


What a difference a day made, what a difference a film makes.

---

But then again, it all comes down to personal preference, so for all I know you may hate this film. I don’t know. You do you, and I’ll do me. Got it? || This is probably my favourite film from Kar-Wai Wong. It tells the stories of two Hong Kong Police officers. The former, the dashing Takeshi Kaneshiro, who is struggling to come to terms with his recently ended relationship of five years. By way of a means to closure, he purchases a tin of pineapple each day with the expiry date of May 1st (then he will be 25 years old). Either they will have reconciled by then, or he must look for a new love - and perhaps an enigmatic, somewhat shady, lady in a raincoat and wearing a blonde wig might offer a solution? The second features the slightly older regular with this director, Tony Leung, who has also split from his long-term partner only to find a new girl working at the stall he gets his meal from in the evening. She is equally enigmatic - and has a penchant for ""California Dreamin'"" played very loudly too. Both stories are throughly enjoyable to watch, the humour is plentiful and subtle - and we are never quite sure how anything is going to pan out, or even if the two stories are going to end up over-lapping - right until the end. The hand held photography helps the personalities develop well, offering us intimacy and also an opportunity to become more immersed in the two gently developing character studies that are imbued with the colours and culture of this bustling urban landscape. || Filmed into the post production of two years of filming the Wuxia epic ""Ashes of Time"", with low resources, this movie is another example that we don't need millions of USD to make a masterpiece.

Wong Kar-Wai have a personal style of using melancholic characters distorted stories, using elaborate soundtracks in the background. This movie show two drama and crime stories about two lovesick policeman and their search over his relationship with a woman, always in a 0,01cm encounter of distance between them. 

The first story stars Takeshi Kaneshiro as a cop obsessed by his breakup with a woman named May (replaced emotionally with letters and old pineapple cans), and his encounter with a mysterious drug smuggler. The second stars Tony Leung as a police officer roused from his gloom over the loss of his flight attendant girlfriend by the attentions of a quirky snack bar worker called Express - referred in the title (Faye Wong).

Both stories circles around Chungking Mansions, a 60's complex of buildings supposed to be residential, but that is made up of many independent low-budget hotels, shops and other services, filled with stores and stalls in the building cater to wholesalers shipping goods to Africa and South Asia, and amid the gigantic Central–Mid-Levels escalator with a length of 800m and one of the two highlights locations of the movie.

Both sequences have a unique visual approach sometimes intimate, sometimes frenetic with a beautiful use of color among the chaos that reminds me of the works of the photographer Saul Leiter.

On the unique soundtrack using ocidental musics we have the use for the first story is Dennis Brown's ""Things in Life"" and ""Baroque"", composed by Michael Galasso, can be heard twice during the first part of the movie.

On the second ""California Dreamin'"" by The Mamas & the Papas plays in the key scenes in the second story, which also features Faye Wong's Cantonese cover version of ""Dreams"" by The Cranberries.

In the plans of making there was a third movie but since it was too long it was released as a separate movie, Fallen Angels in 1995.

Another must watch classic with a unique style that differentiates it from other Hong Kong productions - I gave it a 8,7 out of 10,0 / A rate."

To be honest, though, it didn't bore me as much as it should have.

<em>'The NeverEnding Story III'</em> is a mess, in short. It barely resembles the ace original and doesn't even feel that similar to the average 1990 sequel. The story is all over the place and doesn't hold any sorta magical feel, with it more being a 'fish out of water' sorta movie.

Still, it went by quickly enough for me to avoid leaving a negative taste. It's a bad movie, no doubt, but is more watchable than it ought to be. The cast do alright. I was not expecting to see Jack Black appear, even with the name in the opening credits I kinda still thought it'd be a namesake - but no, Mr. Black is indeed in this (his fourth movie!) and is OK.

Elsewhere, Jason James Richter is decent, I don't have any issues with the actor directly - just the writing etc. for his character. Away from him, the voices are a further downgrade when compared to the preceding entries; though Kaefan Shaw is almost good. Tony Robinson, who I know more of as a television presenter here in the UK, is possibly the standout of the cast as Engywook.

This film also ruins the Rockbiter character(s), however that scene of them travelling to ""Born to Be Wild"" is actually minorly amusing - the only scene of the movie that comes close to being entertaining. Overall, this trilogy shouldn't exist given that first film is an obvious one and done thing. Oh well!"

In April, 1970, the Apollo 13 mission to the moon is aborted after an explosion causes internal damage. The three astronauts and Mission Control must now focus on merely surviving and getting back alive, if possible. 

Directed by Ron Howard, “Apollo 13” (1995) is a solid account of the real-life events and obviously influenced “The Martian” twenty years later, which is even better, albeit not based on historical events. 

I suppose this zeroes-in on the weakness of this movie: If you’re familiar with the account you know how the story ends, which diminishes suspense. Nevertheless, I found it interesting to observe the living conditions and challenges of real-life astronauts, as well as the resolve and ingenuity of the people at Mission Control to work with what’s available and to figure out how to get the astronauts home.    

The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes. CAST: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan.

GRADE: B/B- || This does take a while to get going, but once space-bound, it proves to be quite a compelling tale of three astronauts who find themselves stranded in their spacecraft after an oxygen tank blows up. Ron Howard now presents us with a potently claustrophobic couple of hours and the men - Lovell (Tom Hanks); Haise (Bill Paxton) and Swigert (Kevin Bacon) must work with their ground control colleagues led by Mattingly (Gary Sinese) and Kranz (an excellent Ed Harris) to try to calculate some way of getting them back to safety before their remaining oxygen and fuel runs out. Meantime, we also get a sense of the mortality of these travellers from their partners left on Earth - not least from an on-form Kathleen Quinlan (Marilyn Lovell). The screenplay is based on the book by Lovell, and reeks of authenticity. There is little need to embellish it with special effects; the sets adequately convey the dangers and sense of confinement as the clock ticks down. The dialogue is strong - pithy and lively but also well based in science. That enables Hanks to turn in one of his more convincing, less quirky performances which gels well with his acting co-stars. History tells us the ending, so it is not that the film has jeopardy - it hasn't, really. What is does have is an accumulated sense of peril and it demonstrates well how adaptable and innovative the human brain can be when facing almost certain death. The production is top drawer - understated but effective, and the score from James Horner is one of his lesser known, but none the less effective for that. A really well photographed example of a well directed, strong story with an equally strong cast that is well worth a watch."

Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub.

Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows £1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born.

Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different and more reflective type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department as well. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats - even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish...

Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for being dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, and thus Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. However, it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new there? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. Yet they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10 || _**Featuring One of Cinema's Greatest Villains -- EVER**_

""Rob Roy"" came out in 1995 with a couple other heroic swordplay films: ""Braveheart"" and ""First Knight."" I prefer ""Rob Roy"" to ""Braveheart,"" even though the two films shouldn't really be compared since ""Rob Roy"" focuses on the conflict of individuals in Old Scotland and ""Braveheart"" focuses more on whole armies battling.

The location cinematography of the Scottish Highlands is breathtaking (and superior to ""Braveheart""). Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange are fine in the roles of Rob Roy and his wife. The sword-fighting (between individuals) ranks with the best in cinematic history. The film also possesses a very realistic vibe -- no anachronisms or campy humor here; the pic really helps one realize what life was like in rural Scotland 300 years ago.

What works best, to my mind, is Tim Roth's exceptional performance as Rob Roy's foppish-but-deadly nemesis. This is a villain you love to loathe. The Roth character is so foppish that he appears somewhat effeminate; but this is merely disguise as he's actually a ruthless master swordsman. Surely this is one of film's top villains ever (It doesn't sound right to say ""good villain,"" does it?).

On the downside, the story doesn't have a lot of drive from beginning to end unlike, say, ""Last of the Mohicans."" Your attention may wander at points. Of course this may not be an entirely bad thing in light of the schizophrenic editing of many films post-""Armageddon"" (1998). In other words, the leisurely pace can be refreshing.

There are aspects not appropriate for children: Sexual brutality (a rape scene) and vulgarity (a man shoves his fingers up a woman's nightgown); as well as blatant love-making. There are also overt scenes of, believe it or not, urination; many may regard this as needless, but (for me) it helped drive home the point of what everyday life was like back then, e.g. Where do you pee if you're living in a shack out in the hills? Or, in the middle of the night, if there's no upstairs bathroom?

The story's lack of drive prevents ""Rob Roy"" from attaining true greatness in my mind, but the positive aspects noted above certainly achieve greatness and there are several memorable scenes.

The film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot entirely in Scotland.

GRADE: B+ || As a Scot, I tend to look upon the Hollywood treatment of our national history with considerable disdain at the best of times - this is not a film that encourages me to change that philosophy. The general heather and whisky sentiment; the unsophisticated but honourable Scots versus the evil, occupying English is all way to simplistic to be anything more than a romantic adventure drama along the lines of the ""Master of Ballantrae"". Sure, it's grittier than that - the language more course/authentic (take your pick) but both John Hurt as the turncoat Marquis of Montrose and Tim Roth (who perhaps thinks this is a ""Three Musketeers"" romp?) camp it up to the point where you wouldn't have put much money on them escaping from a Parisian brothel unscathed; much less raping, pillaging and ruthlessly scheming to supplant Scottish traditions in favour of their new Hanoverian masters. Eric Stolz and Brian Cox's casting is just bizarre! Andrew Keir, wooden as ever, makes some effort as the Duke of Argyll - another supporter of King George. It has the benefits of some stunning scenery and a cracking score from Carter Burwell, but otherwise it is a mediocre costume drama with a cursory nod to a great Scottish hero."

Batman takes on a new side kick as he fights to keep Gotham City out of the clutches of Two-Face and The Riddler.

""No thanks, I'll get drive-thru""

Thus these be the first words out of Val Kilmer's incarnation of Batman and thus setting the standard for what Joel Schumacher's two Batman movies would be like. Gone is the dark undertone from Tim Burton's visions, and the tight action sequences that marked Burton's debut out as a genuine genre piece of work, in their place comes sexy campery and ropey action set pieces. The casting of both Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin is a big mistake, Kilmer easily being the most boring actor to don the suit out of all of them, whilst O'Donnell simply can't act outside of Robin's cartoonery bravado. Nicole Kidman looks positively gorgeous as Chase Meridian, but that's all that is brought to the party, it's a waste of the very talented Kidman's ability and a waste of the audience's time.

It's not all bad though, a comic book adaptation is only as good as its villains, and here we get a perfectly cast Jim Carrey as The Riddler, and a wildly over the top Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Carrey steals every scene he is in, it's almost too much, but as maniacal and exuberant as it is, it is the film's highlight and actually the film's saving grace (Tommy Lee Jones was reportedly unhappy from having his thunder stolen in the movie by Carrey). The script does work enough to make the story accessible to all ages, and there are enough crash bangs and wallops to entertain in that brain left at the door kind of way.

This was the biggest hit of 1995, so the paying public lapped it up and paved the way for another Schumacher film in the franchise, but with all that star power wasted, and nipples on the rubber suits, it's hard to see now why it was so popular back then. 5/10 || There are some great **things** in _Batman Forever_. Val Kilmer I think cops a bit too much flak for his go in the cape & cowl, he's certainly no sort of definitive Batman but I thought he did a fine job. The city has a crazy cool design, the Batmobile is updated in a wholly original way, and that neon street gang is some of the coolest shit I've ever seen put to screen. But this a **bad** movie. Burton might not have had a 100% source-material-faithful interpretation of the character, but it took Joel Schumacher (who usually I'm a big fan of) to ruin _Batman_ altogether.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || I absolutely hate Val Kilmer as Batman. Out of everybody that's played batman, he's the worse I've ever seen. Otherwise the movie wasn't that bad considering."

 || The Addiction is one of the more thoughtful films about vampirism available today.

While the film is incredibly thoughtful, with loads of subtext at every corner, it borders, and sometimes crosses into, pretention. There are times where the narration is attempting to add subtext, but it's so heavy-handed that the film loses sight of the fact it's a horror film. I'd argue it's thought piece first and horror film second, honestly. Maybe that makes it even more frightening. 

Christopher Walken is wonderful, and Lili Taylor does a fine job, as well. The choice to shoot the film in black and white was a great idea, as well. There's a real focus placed on the ideas the film is pursuing. 

Even though the subject of the horror in this film are vampires, the movie is truly describing humanity."

Deneuve is great here as the classy hooker with fetish tendencies, as is Page as the sagely and businesslike mistress.

I wouldn't really call this a Spike Lee joint, because Scorsese produced it, it has a much more professional and serious feel than Spikes previous corny work. The 90's Brooklyn hip hop street reality feel is there but this film hits a much deeper note in the soul, skip the mainstream trailer, it might be the reason this failed in the mainstream, when it sours with true underground heads. || Thought this movie would've been better.

Russian rebels have seized one of their government's nuclear missile bases and are threatening to attack the U.S.A. A patrolling US nuclear submarine is ordered to fire, but almost straight afterwards an incomplete counter order brings uncertainty. The submarine Captain and the Executive Officer come into conflict as to which order to follow, and thus the subs crew are torn as to which officer is right or wrong.

Directed by Tony Scott, one could be forgiven for thinking that Crimson Tide would be an outlandish ball of explosions and slaughter, thankfully it isn't, as Scott gives us one of the best underwater thrillers going. Scintilating characters are cloaked in dynamic claustrophobia, and this coupled with the ever increasing unbearable tension, makes this a must see for fans of films that are scary because of what might happen, and not because of what many blockbuster film makers actually show you.

This is not a standard good vs evil plot piece, or even a good vs insane cretin film, this pitches old school stickler for the rules Captain Ramsey against the deep thinking common sense purveyor Lt Commander Ron Hunter. Ramsey believes that the completed order, which is basically to blast the Russians before they blast us type thing, should be followed, Hunter on the other hand feels that the second incomplete order must be clarified before any action is taken, because after all this could be nuclear war! The film then twists and turns as the sub is divided into two factions, mutiny is rife, but what will the outcome be? Can the radio be fixed to complete the order? Will it be too late? All these questions are tensely drawn out by Scott to get the maximum impact from what is an admittedly standard global crisis in waiting story.

No shortage of machismo here either, brutishly brilliant is how I find Gene Hackman in this, his Captain Ramsey is the quintessential leader of men. Then there is Denzel Washington as Ron Hunter, eloquently spoken and a voice of reason, his ruggedness coming to the fore as the submarine starts to implode. There are few better sights in 90s cinema than watching Hackman & Washington go at each other the way they do here, starting off as just a fractious relationship, it then explodes into a war of belief and wills. It's through these pair that the film's neutral stance shines bright, what would we do in similar circumstances? Who would we follow? Both men ethically right, yet both men accountable for probable disaster.

This is a wonderful picture, a lesson in tough tension building that is perfectly wrung out by a rousing Han Zimmer score, with the only weak point being a multi written script that tries to fuse pop culture references with technical lingo, something which doesn't quite sit right. However, even that can't hurt the excellently unfolding sequence of events that closes quite brilliantly with a written piece that all of us should take note of. 9/10 || Probably my favourite Tony Scott film, amidst stiff competition. The acting of both Hackman and Washington, plus the fine supporting cast, is top-drawer, and Scott keeps the suspense up, the film's as tight as a drum. It's rumoured that there were plenty of script doctors, including Quentin Tarantino, but that's no crime--especially when it works. One of my favourite submarine films--it's up there in my books with 'Destination Tokyo' (I haven't seen my DVD of 'Das Boot' yet). It's a great shame that Scott decided to take his life a few years back. He was a much better director than I used to give him credit for. I guess it's true that we don't realize just how good people are until they're gone. This film's essential for war film enthusiasts or those who enjoy suspense films or thrillers: It wouldn't be out of place in the oeuvres of, say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock or David Fincher, and would make a great double-bill with 'Lifeboat' or 'They Were Expendable'. || I'm a big fan of submarine thrillers, and on the face of it - this should have been good. Gene Hackman is the experienced Captain of the USS ""Alabama"", sent to sea with a new Executive Officer (Denzel Washington) amidst a crisis in Russia that could result in nuclear warfare. Once on their mission, the two men dance around each other, probing and testing until they get a message to launch their missiles. This is where it ought to have become more interesting. The captain determined to obey orders, the XO keen to verify. Tempers flare and when a rogue Russian sub opens fire on them, things pass a point of no return. Which man is correct, and will they fire or not? Sadly, at this point the drama becomes all to farcical as the tautly directed opening scenarios between the two men become absurdly tribal antics onboard - to the point where the last half hour or so just beggars belief. Hackman and Washington are efficient, but nether really convince before an ending that really let's the whole thing down badly. What could have been quite a thought-provoking drama about just how far people will go to follow orders or protocols when push comes to shove is just wasted. Shame, really."

A ghost-whispering paranormal expert and his daughter (Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci) move into a dilapidated mansion on the coast of Maine that’s haunted by a friendly ghost and three mischievous ones. Cathy Moriarty plays the venal heir of the mansion and Eric Idle her assistant.

“Casper” (1995) delivers the goods if you're in the mood for a ""spooktacular"" Goosebumps-like horror film that's fun & silly and not scary at all. It's like Scooby-Doo but without the dog and the teens are tweens. “Monster Night” (2006) and “Ghostbusters” (1984) are other reference points, but I prefer “Monster Night,” which has a similar plot, but is all-around more entertaining (even though it cost significantly less) and has a superior assortment of good-lookin' women, young and older. With “Caspar” there’s Moriarty, but she plays the biyatch antagonist. There’s also ricci, but she was only 14 during shooting, although she’s effective in the role.

The movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot at Universals City, California, with establishing shots of Rockport, Maine.

GRADE: B-/C+ || I remembered so much of this, and yet absolutely nothing of the plot.

<em>’Casper’</em> is a film I must’ve watched so much as a young kid on video, the opening few scenes are very nostalgic. As noted though, I didn’t recall anything serious from this 1995 flick though. It’s a little deeper than I remember, with some adult themes touched on - the concluding scenes stand out in that regard.

I did remember the cast, however. Malachi Pearson is perfect as the voice of the titular character, while Christina Ricci is good in the lead live-action role. Bill Pullman spearheads the rest of the onscreen talent well. One casting note: A young Devon Sawa has a part, I recently watched him in television’s <em>’<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chucky_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">Chucky</a>’</em> - which I’d recommend, fwiw.

Though I love his work on the Sin City films, particularly the first, his incredible earlier trilogy will always hold a special place in my cinephilic heart.

My recent project of coming to terms with classic Westerns has only further helped me enjoy these more recent contemporary releases. || **Action, shots, bullets and… “latinxploitation”?**

I confess that I expected something more from this film. I was left with the feeling that it has little to offer us other than two tons of spectacular action scenes, with explosions, hundreds of gunshots and some gratuitous destruction. Even more: it reminded me of those films from the 70s, which we call “blaxploitation” because they reinforced a series of stereotypes about the African-American community: if we pay attention, we have almost all the stereotypes attributed to Latinos and Mexicans-Americans.

In general, I'm not a fan of political correctness and I don't care about stereotypes! I deal with this well, being a proud Portuguese who was born and lives in a Latin country, but I am in solidarity with those who, especially in the USA, suffer from prejudices about the Latin community, a vast community that encompasses Castilian and Portuguese speakers, forgetting, interestingly, that Italian Americans are also culturally Latino. Robert Rodríguez is Latino and makes films that reflect that. I think he must be a man proud of his roots, and I think that's magnificent. We must have this pride. Therefore, I think he made this film in that spirit, but my doubts lie in this: a film with so much violence, with so much to do with drugs and crime, was it good or bad for Latinos?

António Banderas is one of the greatest Spanish actors of all time and easily transitioned to Hollywood, where his career took on stratospheric proportions. Here, he did an interesting job, mixing a bit of Latin lover with gangster and Zorro. He has the right profile and was a good choice. I also really enjoyed seeing Joaquim de Almeida, my compatriot, in what was the best North American film he has made to date (and I think that productions could really invest more in this actor, I think he has talent and ability). Steve Buscemi adds a friendly touch to the film, and Danny Trejo and Tarantino make brief, innocuous appearances. Salma Hayek, another good actress, unfortunately just has to be sexy and hot in bed. That's not enough.

I don't know what the production budget was, but it doesn't seem like a cheap film to me because the number of strong names in the industry in this project is considerable and no one, nowadays, works for free. We also have a good special effects department, with great capacity and creativity: the sets are very realistic and the film's action scenes are very well thought out and executed. As an action film, it works impeccably and is a delight for fans. The script, unfortunately, is much less interesting, with too many stereotypes, weaknesses, clichés and insipid dialogues."

This was great to see once again, and I STILL have nightmares with that wicked Katya (played by composer Sam Phillips) slicing my head off... || ***Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in New York City***  

RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by John McTiernan, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is the third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one, suspended New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) rejoins the force to tangle with a mad-but-genius German bomber named “Simon” (Jeremy Irons) while teaming up with a good Samaritan from Harlem (Samuel L. Jackson).  

This franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.""

The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" 

""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" evades that ditch because it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing scenes, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.

While all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because the original film took place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others, including this one, which was the best up to this point. 

It starts out a little shaky because Simon’s shenanigans are so contrived they’re unbelievable, but if you can persevere the story builds momentum and there are surprises. Even John and Zeus’ conflict-habituated relationship has a story arc with Zeus being bluntly confronted with his reverse racism. The sometimes contrary camaraderie of John and Zeus is great.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in New York City; Berkeley County, South Carolina; and Jessup, Maryland (ending). ADDITIONAL CAST: Graham Greene and Colleen Camp are on hand as cops while sharp Sam Phillips appears as an icy Euro-villainess.

GRADE: A-/B+ || Bruce Willis returns as ""McClane"", this time being used as a plaything by a telephone terrorist named simply ""Simon"". Unsure as to why this man has alighted on him, he is now sent on a series of missions around the city - fail and a devastating bomb could go off. Along the way, he manages to recruit the assistance of Samuel L. Jackson (""Zeus"") and together they they must stop more carnage - and thwart the perpetrator's ultimate intentions. It is a little repetitive at times, but there is plenty of on-screen chemistry between Jackson and Willis; their challenges are a little more cerebral and amusing and the plot builds well until quite an exciting, if just a little too far-fetched, denouement with a baddie whose voice we ought instantly to have recognised on the phone. This is just a simple, straightforward action adventure with no romance of familial nonsense to clutter it up and I quite enjoyed it."

Devil in a Blue Dress is written and directed by Carl Franklin, who adapts from the book written by Walter Mosley. It stars Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals, Don Cheadle and Maury Chaykin. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.

Carl Franklin had already laid down a considerable neo-noir marker with his searing 1992 thriller One False Move, here he goes more traditional but garners equally impressive results. Plot has Washington as a WW2 veteran who has lost his job and desperately needs money to keep hold of his pride and joy - his house. Taking on a job offered by shifty DeWitt Albright (Sizemore), to find a missing woman, Rawlings quickly finds himself in up to his neck in murder and deception, he must turn ace detective to save his skin.

Set in late 1940s Los Angeles, what instantly stands out is the period detail. The clothes, the cars and the establishments frequented by Easy and company. With voice over narration also provided by Washington, in dry and sardonic tones, it's every inch a loving ode to the film noir movies released at the time the pic is set. There's plenty of neon signs about the place, some bad ass cops, good sex, brandy and sharp suits, smoking and coolness and of course a psychopath in the classic mould (Cheadle excellent).

But of course noir dressage is only that if you haven't got a good pot boiling plot, thankfully this has one. The story takes unexpected turns, always remaining interesting, the distinctive characterisations breathing heavy, managing to off set the run of the mill stereotypes in the supporting ranks. It can be argued that Beals as the titular femme fatale of the title is under written, but the character comes with an air of mystery that serves Franklin's atmosphere very well. Tech credits are high, something of a given with Bernstein and Fujimoto on the list, while Washington turns in another classy show of subtlety and believability.

Lovers of film noir should get much rewards from Devil in a Blue Dress. 7.5/10"
6520.0,First Knight,"The timeless tale of King Arthur and the legend of Camelot are retold in this passionate period drama. Arthur is reluctant to hand the crown to Lancelot, and Guinevere is torn between her loyalty to her husband and her growing love for his rival. But Lancelot must balance his loyalty to the throne with the rewards of true love.",Their greatest battle would be for her love.,"Action, Adventure, Drama, Romance",134,1995-07-07,en,6.099,1253,3.4263,"Sean Connery, Richard Gere, Julia Ormond, Ben Cross, Liam Cunningham",Jerry Zucker,"camelot, betrayal, knight, king arthur, love affair, excalibur, knights of the round table, lancelot","***""You have to not care whether you live or die""***  

There were three medieval/British Isle films released in 1995 -- ""Braveheart,"" ""Rob Roy"" and ""First Knight."" Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" is certainly the most epic of the three at three hours, but I found it overrated; which isn't to say I don't like it, I just don't feel that it's as great as the hype would suggest (only about half of it is worthwhile). I liked ""Rob Roy"" better than ""Braveheart;"" it's very adult-oriented, violent, gritty and grim, however.

""First Knight"" is a believable take on the King Arthur/Camelot legend starring Sean Connery as Arthur, Richard Gere as Lancelot and Julia Ormond as Guinevere. They get tangled up in a bit of a love triangle. Ben Cross plays the villain, ex-knight Malagant. 

Being a relatively realistic portrayal of the folkloric story, the tone is similar to “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991), but without the witch and the campy Alan Rickman. So don’t expect any of that silly magical jive with Merlin, Excalibur, etc. This might explain why so many pan the film, but I don't get their beef. Aren't there enough cinematic depictions of the Camelot tale with supernatural elements for them to enjoy, like 1981’s ""Excalibur""? I'll put it this way, ""First Knight"" is to the Arthur/Lancelot legend what the film ""Troy"" (2004) is to the Helen of Troy chronicle, although “First Knight” is less gritty.

The film caught my fascination right away with the character of Lancelot. He is portrayed as an expert swordsman, drifter, loner and all-around lost soul. The beginning reveals something integral to understanding his character: Lancelot takes on an intimidating dude in a swordfight contest at a village he’s traveling through. After Lancelot prevails, the big guy asks him for advice on how to be as skilled a swordsman. Lancelot tells him that he needs a couple of obvious sword-fighting skills, to which the man confidently replies, ""I can do that."" Then Lancelot tells him the last quality he needs: ""And you have to not care whether you live or die.""

This is a powerful scene; Gere plays the character very convincingly (in fact, if you hate Gere, this film might give you a new-found respect for him). This character-defining episode reveals HOW Lancelot is the only one able to prevail against an incredible and decidedly deadly weapons gauntlet later in the story, which is a highlight.

The rest of the film is just a solid medieval/British Isle adventure with a noble folkloric tone, requisite forest scenes and all. What I mean by “folkloric” can be seen in Lancelot’s heroic rescue of Guinevere in Malagant's cave fortress, which is pretty implausible. But these are larger-than-life figures, right?

""First Knight"" more than satisfied my hunger for a medieval/British isles flick and surprised me with the intriguing character of the suicidally-brave Lancelot. If one doesn't have hang-ups regarding the absence of Merlin, Excalibur and the magical baggage that goes with 'em, this is an entertaining and classy heroic film.

On top of all this, the movie features a fascinating allegorical subtext: King Arthur is God, Camelot is Heaven, Malagant is the fallen Lucifer, his dark, cavernous ‘castle’ is the Underworld, Guinevere represents humanity caught in the epic fight between good (Arthur) and evil (Malagant), and Lancelot represents worldly temptation.

The film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Wales & England. 

GRADE: B || OK. First things first; this deviates substantially from any of the other depictions of Arthurian legend, so if you're looking for anything akin to the films (or books) you've come across before, then I'd stop now. If you're looking for a light and fluffy costume romance, then you might salvage something from it yet, though. Julia Ormond (Guinevere) is travelling to meet Sean Connery (King Arthur) with a view to marrying him and thus saving her beleaguered land of Leonesse from the frequent invasions of the evil ""Malagant"" (Ben Cross). On her way, though, she is attacked and only saved by the cunning wit and bravery of travelling swordsman Lancelot (Richard Gere). She is delivered safely to her beau, only to encounter Lancelot again as he wins the most lethal obstacle course known to man - and he gets his kiss! The remainder of the film dips in and out of the legend - she falls in love; gets kidnapped and there are as many shades of ""Robin Hood"" as there are of ""Knights of the Round Table"" as our intrepid Lancelot tries to keep her, and the kingdom safe. Cross isn't exactly menacing as the baddie, but Connery is quite good giving an impression of a king who can't believe his luck, and Ormond and Gere have a certain chemistry as their affair blossoms. The ending isn't up to much, though - perhaps if the knights had spent less time in front of the mirror, they may have made for better soldiers - and I thought the whole thing missed the characterisation of Merlin (the most interesting character of these legends, I thought). The look of the film is mischievous, colourful and breezy, and it's a decent if slightly cheesy and unremarkable family film that does what it says on the tin. || **I really like this movie, but it's a terrible movie.**

This film is, for me, particularly nostalgic because I really enjoyed watching it in my childhood and youth. It was one of those films that marked my imagination about the Middle Ages, and how it could have been. Obviously, the way I see it has changed with maturity, and studies have allowed me to perceive the enormous anachronisms committed by this film, on several levels. However, like almost everything that brings us good childhood memories, it is a film that continues to be very dear to me.

The screenplay does not deserve much consideration, being essentially a poor melodrama of questionable taste, created around the Arthurian legends. The legend, as we know, has a strong Frankish origin, and centers on a legendary king who ruled over Britannia, defending it from the Saxons, in a very early period of the High Middle Ages – yes, because the Middle Ages cannot be considered as a whole, it is practically a thousand years long and a lot has happened in that time. We see a Lady Guinevere enter into a marriage of political convenience with an aging King Arthur, at the height of his power and influence, even though threatened by the host of an enemy, Malagant. And we see how an arrogant young Lancelot pursues, and in effect harasses, the young queen, seducing her and causing her to fall in love with him.

Despite the affection I have for this film, which brings me so many good memories, I recognize that it is a weak and poorly made film. The story itself that is told to us is quite ugly, being, in essence, a moral tale of seduction, betrayal, adultery and abuse of trust, where the only character worthy of our sympathy is old King Arthur, in his excess of goodness, sense of justice and righteousness. Even though he is an old man, he honors his word to his bride's father and marries her (obviously a woman much younger than he is) to protect her and her feudal lordship. Committed to building an ideal kingdom, he ostracizes Malagant, who disbelieves in the project due to his own ambition and cruelty, just as he cannot see how he opens himself up to Lancelot, a total stranger, creating conditions for Lancelot to abuse him and betray him, seducing the young and ungrateful queen. A very ugly story, but one of strong humanity, where we learn what happens when we are too good.

Despite only appearing to us almost half an hour after the film has started, there is no doubt that Sean Connery is the great actor in this film. He was just the man to bestow strength and nobility on the old British sovereign. Moreover, his charismatic and aristocratic presence, and the impeccable way in which he acts and works his character, is reason enough to justify a revisit to this film, which has become quite popular on television. However, the rest of the cast is totally wrong. Either the actors weren't able to understand the characters, or (and I bet that was it) director Jerry Zucker was totally incapable of directing them and understanding how he should do it. Julia Ormond is very beautiful and elegant, but she doesn't seem to know what she's doing in this movie. Ben Cross is a shadow of himself and makes for an absurdly poorly written and poorly conceived character. Richard Gere is pompous, smug, braggart, irritating and perverse.

Production values ​​are high, and the film looks expensive. The cinematography is incredible and very beautiful, especially the night scenes, with torchlight and fire. The sets and costumes are very detailed, elaborate and visually impressive. The weapons and armor of Arthur's knights, with the blue and silver, are beautiful, and Camelot is one of the most beautiful medieval scenic cities I've ever seen in a movie. The big problem with this is that we are seeing a blatant anachrony! If the film addresses the figure of King Arthur and that king existed sometime before the Year A Thousand, the city of Camelot would never have that elaborate visual aspect.

- A duo of DJ/hackers named Razor and Blade (feel free to cry),

The fun is back. Willy's back. And this time he's brought his whole family to meet an old friend ... and take on a new challenge.,"Family, Adventure, Drama, Comedy",95,1995-07-19,en,5.938,596,2.1127,"Jason James Richter, Michael Madsen, Jayne Atkinson, August Schellenberg, Mary Kate Schellhardt","Dwight H. Little, John Mattson","whale, human animal relationship, killer whale","**It would be an excellent sequel, every bit as good as the original, if logic issues and plot holes didn't get in the way too much.**


If I can say that I really enjoyed the first film in this trilogy, I can't say the same for any of the sequels. The first film, even with all the flaws, was quite good and was so enjoyable that it became a milestone for many people's childhood and adolescence. This one, in addition to not bringing anything really new, has more flaws and problems than its predecessor.

The film's biggest problem turns out to be the script: the action takes place some time after the events of the first film, but we continue to see Willy, the released orca, playing a heroic role in saving several other animals after an oil spill resulting from an accident with a tanker that passed too close to the shore. Of course, as it is predictable in a film like this, there is life danger to the orcas, but in the end, everything goes well.

The script really ends up depending on each person's ability to turn off their brain and watch the film without asking questions. On the one hand, we are dealing with an orca whose release was amateurish, unforeseen and unprepared, as we saw in the opening film. In addition to this being something that goes against all the basic norms of those who deal with these animals, it increases the chances that a wild animal simply does not want its freedom, preferring the human contact it is already used to. It would help to understand how Jesse and Willy's relationship continues to be strong and important in this film, and the film that would follow.

However, believing that the orca could hear Jesse's harmonica, even if it were far away, is as foolish as believing in Santa Claus, and is simply forgetting that these animals travel thousands of miles, and that the orca is one of the few marine mammals that can be seen in any sea in the world. Willy would never hear the sound of his friend's harmonica if he was that far away. And although the film touches on an important ecological and environmental point – the damage caused by oil spills – the way it does so is far from realistic. Oil spills are a serious matter, they mobilize a lot of technicians and there are specific ways to contain and clean them up, as well as to save the affected marine life. A bunch of amateurs just couldn't do much.

In addition to the logic problems and holes in the script, the film has some very underwritten characters, although some of the heavy clichés of the initial film have been polished. And it is still pleasant to see the most important faces of the initial film return: Jason James Ritcher continues to work well as Jesse and is well supported by Michael Madson and August Schellenberg, who also return to the characters they already know. Francis Capra is doing very well, and Mary Kate Schellhart does what she can with the material she's been given.

Technically, the film continues to bet heavily on good cinematography and the choice of beautiful filming locations. As with its predecessor, it's a film that doesn't look the age it already is, and if we saw it without knowing when it was released, we wouldn't give it more than ten years. Good sound effects, good special effects, a realistic and effective animatronic whale, are some of the values that this film presents to us and that deserve a positive note. The soundtrack is pleasant, skillfully recycling material from the early film."

Unfortunately, when it comes to the film industry, the plot-link is kind of the most important one, so I can't really call Judge Dredd a success. And although the general premise is strong, this is not to the credit of the movie, seeing as it sources its material from the comic books of the same name, and 2000 AD.

Sylvester Stallone (the titular Dredd) and Rob Schneider (his offsider) are perhaps poor casting options. But they aren't so terrible as to make Judge Dredd unwatchable, especially seeing as there are a quite a few good choices to balance this out.

Despite being made in '95, it shares that intrinsically 1980's vision of a dystopian future, where all the buildings are black, all the signs are neon, and all the residents are androgynous punks and goths. Which to be honest I'm a huge sucker for, so this earns Judge Dredd some points (though again, not for originality).

It's perhaps not the sort of description you'd expect of a violence-heavy, guilty-pleasure dodgy sci-fi, but Judge Dredd is just so cute! The ABC Warrior I have a particular soft spot for, but even overall, the piece is enjoyable to not take seriously (though taking it seriously is probably impossible).

Yes it's true that Judge Dredd is enjoyable in a laughing at it kind of way rather than a laughing with it one, but that's still enjoyable in my books.

What a trip in the way back machine to see the inspiration for ""The Matrix"", maybe more of an homage to ""Lawnmover Man"", but very clearly they didn't have the capability to what they actually wanted to do with the movie.

The best things are clearly Dina Meyer (""Starship Troopers"": Dizzy) and the ""Hot Garotte"" lazer whip thing, why haven't more movies used that?

Clearly Keanu Reeves did his best to try to hold this thing together, but the writing isn't that great, despite have a pretty good story and world to it.  It's really dated, but it's good enough I would actually like to see a reboot of this.

There isn't a lot to say: the production and execution fell short and it's just not worth going back to watch this one. || Perhaps back in 1995 the year 2021 did seem like it was an aeon away, but now that we are all actually here, this film really does struggle to resonate on just about every level. Keanu Reeves is a good looking star, but that's about the height of it. The scenario is nothing new - mankind is dependent on technology and about to be subject to a criminally backed corporation's attempts to dominate us. This time, it falls to our hero and his semi-luddite pals to access a micro-chip embedded in his brain to save humanity from oblivion. It's quickly paced, to be fair, and the star does an adequate job trying to keep one step ahead of his deadly, if not terribly effective, Yakuza pursuers but the dialogue is flat (and not terribly audible) and the supporting cast - drawn from a collection of B-listers, musicians and featuring the discobolus-like Dolph Lundgren as baddie-in-chief just follows a join the dots pattern. Maybe it's unfair to look back on it after 25 years with today's eyes - but sadly, like so many of these films, neither the talent not the visuals really stand the test of time at all well.

It’s all about “Jeffrey” (Steven Weber) who is one of those actors-cum-waiters who merrily enjoys the fruits of his New York existence until the arrival of AIDS turn him into a sexually neurotic monk. No more nookie for him, it’s all about his career - and, yep, that just frustrates the poor man. Things aren’t exactly helped by his flamboyant pal “Sterling” (Stewart) who has a much younger and HIV+ boyfriend “Darius” (Bryan Batt) who keeps telling him that he needs to get laid more. Then he bumps into “Steve” (Michael T. Weiss) and they take to each other. Snag? Well it turns out that “Steve” is also positive and so “Jeffrey” is now faced with quite a dilemma. On the plus side, this drama does showcase the extent to which many gay people donned a psychological, if not actually a physical, suit of armour when the AIDS epidemic struck. Terrified of the consequences of their previous license and/or determined never to take risks again - however that “risk” might be defined or apply, practically, to their life and lifestyle. On that front, Weber does OK and at times the whole thing comes across quite touchingly, but sadly there’s too much emphasis on the stereotypes and the writing takes refuge all too often in the realms of that kind of gay comedy that Armistead Maupin might have written on a bad day. It’s all a question of living life to the full or living in fear, but somehow any semblance of sensible and responsible compromise is not on the agenda here and so it all rather falls between a predictable set of tram lines. It has it’s moments, but in the end it’s just so-so."

Laughed throughout even when the dialogue wasn't the greatest, but I have an appreciation for sarcasm so I gravitated towards Jason Lee's character the most. Not quite sure it's on the level of Clerks or Chasing Amy (have to re-visit those) but a solid comedy. **3.75/5** || **A comedy full of absurd jokes, which could work better if they weren't so aimed at niche audiences that most people don't really belong to.**

From the same hand that gave us “Clerks” (director and screenwriter Kevin Smith) came this bizarre comedy, centered on two teenagers who have just lost their girlfriends. It is already known that we are going to see a film that is, to say the least, unorthodox and full of light-hearted jokes, allusions to pop culture and elements that would be easy to identify for the youth of the time.

Maybe that's why the humor hardly works clearly: I could still understand most of the jokes minimally but, for example, I don't know anything about comics and all the jokes about that are unintelligible to me. I believe the same thing happens to a lot of people: we are not part of the target audience and the feeling is that of a somewhat dated, niche film that has not aged very well.

The script has its moments: there are several conflicting plots, some of which (the boy obsessed with a painting where everyone sees a sailboat, for example) are very stupid and seem out of context. In fact, there seems to be no possible context for them! The same cannot be said about the main plots of the two couples at odds. We can say that they are absurd, but this is normal in the case of a movie that uses absurdity for a jocular purpose. For the rest, and even considering that I've seen better, it's not a film that I can say I hated seeing, although I don't intend to see it again.

Claire Forlani, very young and beautiful, plays her role with panache alongside Jeremy London, Shannen Doherty and Jason Lee, three young promises who would not have a bright future as actors, even though they remain active and working. It's fair to say that everyone made their own effort and left a positive mark, but it's not fair to forget Stan Lee's contribution, in a very honorable special appearance, and the work developed by Ben Affleck, Michael Rooker, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith. It's one of those films where the auxiliary cast has almost as much weight and relevance to the final product as the four protagonists. In fact, a large part of what makes the film work after so many years is, precisely, the quality of the characters and the way they manage to please us."

What actually makes the movie is that the movie isn't centered on manipulating the information, but uses it as adversity that the protagonist can overcome.

He's one of those writers that come up with something unique each time he brings a script to the screen...he's also one of those writers that you just have to assume is on powerful hallucinogenic drugs.

Walken, of course, gets top billing, and he did do a very good job, who doesn't love it when he's a villein? He is always delightfully creepy and, in The Prophecy he balances that creepiness with a healthy does of humor. It makes him a lovable character, but then he does have a great sense of humor and one of the best deadpan deliveries in modern Hollywood.

Still...Elias Koteas. I don't think he means to do it, but he always takes center stage in whatever he does and The Prophecy is no different. The man just brings his A-game to every movie, every bit part he has ever played. And like his turn in Fallen, the one thing that lingers in your memory when the movie is over, is the Koteas performance. As usual he wields raw acting power with ease.

Stolz, as always, plays Eric Stoltz, but in this movie it works perfectly. He is the angel just following orders, and one that positively stinks of 90s era cool. You know from the first time you see him on screen that he was the perfect casting choice for Simon.

What makes it better is Adam Goldberg, the man that is always cast in the same sort of roles. That is the slightly dorky Jew. He's really the same character he was in Saving Private Ryan, only far more pathetic. But he also provides the comic relief as a walking, decaying, reanimated corpse forced back to life to be Walken's unwilling and lippy servant. The movie needed elements of relief to keep it grounded enough to appeal to the none Biblically inclined and Goldberg, well, he does his job and makes you laugh.

What you have here is a small film with a small budget and a great cast and it works. It works better than anyone can imagine, partially because the surreal quality of the script needed a small budget to keep it believable, and partially because the production quality forced everyone to relay on a very well written story and weigh it all on a cast that could turn it into something memorable.

The result is a film that is endlessly watchable"

The opportunities to illustrate and expose the superstitious and hypocritical standards of the day; of the population who lived in a male-dominated, god-fearing society are lost in a stodgy dialogue with repetitive scenarios that look good, but take the story forward with the speed of a rhino stuck in treacle. This suffered from too much resource, too long a filming schedule and a very weakly delivered narrative and at the end I may well have volunteered myself for the flames. || **_A glimpse of what it was like to live on the Northeast coast in the mid-1600s_**

Hester Prynne arrives at the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1666 (Demi Moore) to set up a homestead in preparation for her husband. As she gets to know the local pastor, Arthur Dimmesdale (Gary Oldman), they get word of tragedy concerning her spouse (Robert Duvall).

""The Scarlet Letter” (1995) is notorious for being one of the worst adaptions of a well-known novel ever made, but movies usually make significant changes, such as Coppola & writer James Hart adding a love story to “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” which didn’t hinder that movie from being a popular (modest) hit. Even films based on recent novels make notable changes, such as “Serena.” How much more so with a book from 1850? 

Adding details on how Hester meets Arthur and how their relationship evolves works in my book. After all, viewers need to know why the protagonists were susceptible to the moral transgression in question. Of course, the reason Hawthorne’s book delayed the revelation of who Hester committed adultery with was to create suspense and provoke shock when it’s revealed to be the minister.

Speaking of Arthur, he’s more noble here compared to the book where he’s an over-the-top hypocrite. They made the lumber baron in “Serena” more honorable as well. Or consider Roger Moore, who refused to portray James Bond as a woman-beater after his first movie in the role, which was a hit. Once actors gain an amount of clout, they’ll play the part the way they want to, not the way the book (or scriptwriter or director) technically says.

Other changes include the addition of a slave woman, Mituba, but her role is so marginal, it doesn’t matter. Expanding the roles of the Wampanoag and Mi'kmaq peoples (the latter referred to as the Tarrantines) is also so slight that it’s not a big deal. And, honestly, I feel their expansion enhances the proceedings. So, the biggest change, is the ending, which isn’t as downbeat as the book, but isn’t exactly Disney-fied either, if you pay attention to Pearl’s narration.

What I like most is how the movie successfully puts you into the setting of the Massachusetts Bay Colony of the mid-1600s and makes the Puritans & others come alive. While this is romantic drama within a historical setting, there are bits of adventure, thrills, moral complexity and theological ruminations, as well as tragedy. It comes across as a mixture of films like “The Last of the Mohicans,” “Rob Roy” and “The Crucible,” the latter not debuting until the year after this one.  

It runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, including areas around Campbell River. Other scenes were shot on the other side of Canada in Nova Scotia; specifically in the towns of Yarmouth and Shelburne, as well as the village of Saint Alphonse in Clare.

This film reminded me, in a certain way, of a polite version of “Clerks”, an unorthodox comedy where everything revolves around a convenience store, a video club and two employees from those same stores.

In one of them, by chance, the deceased wife of one of the store's customers appears who, after being saved from being run over by a boy, decides to help him.

The film is discreet, does not have great cinematography resources, nor visuals. Everything here revolves around the characters, their individual stories, the way they intersect and interconnect. The script is very important for the film, but the work of the actors cannot be overlooked either. Harvey Keitel does a very worthy and well-executed job, and William Hurt, Harold Perrineau and Forest Whitaker follow him closely, so we have a good cast working hard. The big problem with this movie is that it really doesn't have much more to offer. For those who like films that are very much based on characters, their behavior, their stories, and well-written dialogues, the film is wonderful.

This was a hit movie at the time, and other than the Xenos design, I'd say it is still a pretty good movie.  The ""anti-Jaws"" approach of showing the monster off is really cool as the premise is largely how detailed and dangerous the xenos is, but the approach removes a lot of the suspense in the hunting and subterfuge, almost humanizing her as ""hunted by the evil government entity"".

While it would be a much different, and arguably better, movie to do something more like ""The Thing"", that she only has one human mask sorts of outs her, making it more like a spy movie, and I think they did really well with that in mind.

It just lacks the level of nuance and hidden information that spy and thriller movies tend to have.

It's much closer to ""Aliens"" than ""Alien"". || _**Wiping out the ""galactic weed**_""

Released in 1995, ""Species"" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from outer space detailing alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. This gives birth to Sil, a girl (Michele Williams) who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blonde (Natasha Henstridge). Government agent Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).

I developed a bad attitude toward ""Species"" for years due to Roger Ebert's scathing review, but changed my mind upon giving it an openminded viewing. This is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin' woman, she doesn't do anything for me (she's not my type) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film's other attributes.

For one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there's more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA. Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as ""always pointing out the obvious"" when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we'd see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.

While snobby film critics love to hate ""Species"" it's a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like ""Alien,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator,"" ""Terminator 2"" and ""Predator"" you'll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2,"" but it's on par with ""Alien"" (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to ""Predator."" Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as I'm concerned, ""Species"" delivers the goods.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.

GRADE: A- 

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie) 

The theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a ""weed killer"" from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it. It's a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it. || Clearly, these scientists had not heeded Jeff Goldblum in ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) when he warned about stopping to think that just because we can do something, it doesn't mean that we should. If they had, then perhaps we could have avoided the mayhem and brutality caused when they create ""Sil"" (Natasha Henstridge). She is the product of alien and human DNA and can morph between a beautiful woman and a savage killer in the blink of an eye. Of course she escapes from the high security facility that couldn't keep a cow out, and is soon on the search for a man. Not any particular man, just one who can help her make a baby - and believe me, that's not a good plan! The scientists - led by ""Lennox"" (a rather charmless Michael Madson) and ""Baker"" (Marg Helgenberger) are on her trail but can they stop her before she finds a willing partner? To be fair, the visual effects - very ""Terminator"" (1984) style - are actually quite effective but the acting, especially from the always hammy Ben Kingsley, and the scripting are very bottom drawer. There's some imagination with the look of the film, but the delivery is pedestrian across the board before an ending that has an inevitability to it that I found a bit predictable. Not terrible, but a real missed opportunity that had it been cast better and just spent a little more time on the a more substantial story, could have created a better sense of menace and even a little (dark) humour."

I think I've seen at least twenty films about the Millennium where times are shown with great pessimism. In this specific case, the end of the millennium is a time of social and political chaos, in which society moves without a clear direction, given over to fleeting pleasures and criminal acts. And in the midst of all the dissolution of morals and values, a mechanism emerges that allows the recording of the memories and sensations of the person who uses it, leading to a black market in illicit recordings of crimes, sex and controversial acts: thus, a man who never stole, killed or cheated on his wife can experience all of this without necessarily having to do so. But what happens when a recording keeps evidence of a murder?

The film has qualities, and presents a story that mixes sci-fi, political thriller and a little romance, in a mix that has aged very well, even though we are now firmly into the millennium. The project began around 1985, and is one of the few results of the partnership (professional and loving) between Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron. He had the ideas for the script, and she assures us of the elegant direction, the impactful and suitably dark cinematography, effective visual and special effects and a costume and set design strongly influenced by punk and metal aesthetics. The film was named after a song by the “Doors”, and was a huge critical and commercial failure. Therefore, everyone involved preferred to forget it.

I can't help but consider the oblivion as unfair: it's not a perfect film, the story is too complex, it seems too stilted, like a hot air balloon, and it's excessively long (less than thirty minutes of dead scenes would have made things more dynamic). However, it is an immersive film that addresses, in some depth, people's appreciation for superficial pleasures and ways to escape a cruel and oppressive reality. This is still a very topical issue, as is the whole plot surrounding excessive police violence. And finally, I need to highlight the quality of the “first person” footage, when the mechanism is used, and we see things through the character's eyes.

Ralph Fiennes gives us one of the most complex and interesting dramatic works of his career, making the most of his character's multiplicity of contradictory feelings and emotions. Angela Bassett also shone in this film, in an intense and action-packed role. Juliette Lewis does a pretty decent job, especially when she sings, but I can't help but consider that the actress's nudity is somewhat gratuitous and exaggerated, perhaps to sexualize the character. Michael Wincott is an effective villain."

Taking pity on drag queen in training Chi-Chi (John Leguizamo), they sell the two plane tickets and buy a Cadillac convertible and drive cross country. They have a run-in with hick sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn), and Vita thinks she has killed him after he discovers her male identity. The car breaks down somewhere in the Midwest, and the trio must wait a weekend before the part can be ordered. In the meantime, they integrate themselves into the small town, solving everyone's problems, and giving the place a little pizzazz.

There are points in this film where my eyes rolled. No one in the town knows these three are men dressed in women's clothing. The dumb hick routine has been done before, and this film does not add anything. Vita, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi all have a heightened sense of fashion, have been rejected by their families, and can only rely on each other. Dollard is an insensitive bigot hunting the three down after being laughed at by other law enforcement officers. He is also a cliche, although Penn's scene in the bar talking about a man getting it on with another man is the highlight of the film. Despite all the stock characters, I am still recommending the film. Sure, the characters have been done before, but I still liked them all, even the villainous Dollard. The small town is populated by extremely good acting talent like Stockard Channing, Blythe Danner, Melinda Dillon, and Jeremy London, and that adds to the film. The writers never degenerate into the visiting trio trying to cover up the fact that they are men through weak slapstick or goofball chase scenes. After a while, I forgot Snipes, Swayze, and Leguizamo were actors dressed like women. There are no instances where the three ""slip up"" and reveal they are men, like ""Tootsie"" or ""Some Like It Hot,"" and I am not faulting those films for that. Those films had straight men forced to dress like women. Here, Vita, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi make no secret of their love for men, and don't care what others believe of them- unless they could get physically hurt in the process. The title of the film refers to an autographed photograph the trio takes with them, turning it into their shrine and reason for going on. With cameos by Robin Williams, RuPaul, and the actual Julie Newmar, I found I enjoyed ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar"" more than I probably should have. But like the three ladies, I just did not care."

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go_. || _**One-man army on a train in the Colorado Rockies with Steven Seagal**_

On a train trip through the Rockies with his niece (Katherine Heigl), Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) has to take on a band of ruthless terrorists who are using the train for a mobile headquarters as they hijack a destructive satellite weapon created by the head terrorist (Eric Bogosian). Everett McGill plays the lead heavy, looking like an evil Race Bannon.  

“Under Siege 2: Dark Territory” (1995) is a worthy follow-up to the 1992 film; it may not be as good story-wise, but it has superior locations due to it taking place on a train traveling through the mountains as opposed to the more one-dimensional ship at sea. If you’re in the mood for a train flick that’s streamlined and filled with action you can’t go wrong. Sure, the action is sometimes implausible, but it helps if you view Ryback (Seagal) as a superhero without the gaudy costume in the manner of John McClane, Rambo or James Bond. 

Comparing it to train thrillers, it’s not great like “Runaway Train” (1985), but it’s about on par with the horrific “Train” (2008), the Western “Breakheart Pass” (1975) and the realistic “Unstoppable” (2010).

Other than Heigl, the lovely Sandra Taylor and Brenda Bakke are featured on the feminine front.

The movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot mostly in the Colorado Rockies.

GRADE: B || This might have been a little better had there not been the irritatingly hammy efforts throughout from Eric Bogosian as the tech wizard ""Dane"". He has managed to assemble a gang of cut-throat mercenaries under the command of ""Penn"" (Everett McGill) to commandeer a train that is carrying the communications equipment that can control a deadly satellite. After some quick threatening of the passengers, he has the operating codes and is demanding $1bn from the US government. What he hasn't counted on are the ninja skills of train porter ""Bobby"" (Morris Chestnut) - oh, and of former SEAL ""Ryback"" (Steven Seagal) who just happens to be on the train with his niece ""Sarah"" (Katherine Heigl). With the odds stacked heavily against them, these two have to work together if they are to thwart the cunning plans of their antagonist before he decimates Washington DC. It's a decently enough paced action thriller with loads of combat but little by way of characterisation or dialogue that's worth listening to. Trains tend to work quite well as the venues for hostage thrillers and this one goes some way to keep the action flowing before the ending we all know is coming. Not as good as the first one, but it's not awful."

Waterworld is directed by Kevin Reynolds and jointly written by David Twohy, Peter Rader and Joss Whedon. It stars Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino, Michael Jeter and Gerard Murphy. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Dean Semler.

It's the future and the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth is practically covered by the sea. As civilisation is forced to live on the water, their only hope is to one day find the fabled place known as Dryland. A Mariner drifter may hold the key to Dryland's whereabouts...

It was by definition a troubled shoot, with sackings, difference of opinions, cost overruns, production set backs (hurricane destroying a hugely expensive set) and bad word of mouth generated by a film press intent on giving Kevin Costner a good kicking. Facts are, now that all the water has evaporated over the years, Waterworld is neither the flop or the bad film that many believed it to be. Should it be a better movie considering the gargantuan amounts of cash spent on it? Absolutely, without question! But Waterworld turned a decent profit in spite of its problems and mixed reviews, and now it firmly has a fan base willing to love it for the great sci-fi escapism that it is. Now readily available in 3 cuts (Theatrical, TV Edit and Ulysses), you can sample each to find the pros and cons of home format film tampering.

Even in its theatrical form the film is still a rollicking water based adventure, full of spectacular stunts (oh my those jet-skis rock), amazing sets (whoosh, the sci-fi grandeur of the floating atoll) and blood pumping scenes (the eerie journey and subsequent revelation of a city under water). Sure it's far from flawless as the pace is uneven at times and as plot narratives go it's pretty thin, but Reynolds and Costner have crafted an impressive world submerged by water. The cast, too, are delivering knowing performances. Costner's Mariner is indeed one note, unsympathetic and moody, this guy is a loner and a mutation after all, his sombre persona neatly playing against Hopper's cartoonish, satirical and maniacal villain. Tripplehorn (a porn star name if ever there was one!) beautifully shines in a film populated predominantly by males (there's another flaw for you), Michael Jeter scores favourably as a highly strung elder, while young Majorino is suitably winsome, neatly playing it as a device to mellow the Mariner's cold fishy heart. Take that and fill it out with the detail of the definitive cut (Ulysses) which showcases Reynolds' vision and it's fan nirvana all round.

If it was meant to be a serious picture in the first place, a sermon on topical destroying of the Earth, then it fails a touch because the characterisations are bound by cliché manacles. Yet collectively the inhabitants of this Waterworld share a common goal of survival, played out to the backdrop of Reynolds' excellent futuristic setting. When thrust together to make a good versus evil action movie, the characterisations work handsomely within that framework. That is ultimately the best way to enjoy Waterworld, let it wash over you (hrr hrr hrr) in a wave (hrr, OK I'll stop now) of water based action and heroics. It's a world where soil is currency and smoking is a marker for being a bad guy. From the opening shot of the Universal World logo becoming submerged in water, to the bittersweet finale, yes! Waterworld is indeed escapism in its purest cinematic form and becomes a high definition must in the process. 8/10 || You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen.

Waterworld is directed by Kevin Reynolds and jointly written by David Twohy, Peter Rader and Joss Whedon. It stars Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino, Michael Jeter and Gerard Murphy. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Dean Semler.

It's the future and the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth is practically covered by the sea. As civilisation is forced to live on the water, their only hope is to one day find the fabled place known as Dryland. A Mariner drifter may hold the key to Dryland's whereabouts...

It was by definition a troubled shoot, with sackings, difference of opinions, cost overruns, production set backs (hurricane destroying a hugely expensive set) and bad word of mouth generated by a film press intent on giving Kevin Costner a good kicking. Facts are, now that all the water has evaporated over the years, Waterworld is neither the flop or the bad film that many believed it to be. Should it be a better movie considering the gargantuan amounts of cash spent on it? Absolutely, without question! But Waterworld turned a decent profit in spite of its problems and mixed reviews, and now it firmly has a fan base willing to love it for the great sci-fi escapism that it is. Now readily available in 3 cuts (Theatrical, TV Edit and Ulysses), you can sample each to find the pros and cons of home format film tampering.

Even in its theatrical form the film is still a rollicking water based adventure, full of spectacular stunts (oh my those jet-skis rock), amazing sets (whoosh, the sci-fi grandeur of the floating atoll) and blood pumping scenes (the eerie journey and subsequent revelation of a city under water). Sure it's far from flawless as the pace is uneven at times and as plot narratives go it's pretty thin, but Reynolds and Costner have crafted an impressive world submerged by water. The cast, too, are delivering knowing performances. Costner's Mariner is indeed one note, unsympathetic and moody, this guy is a loner and a mutation after all, his sombre persona neatly playing against Hopper's cartoonish, satirical and maniacal villain. Tripplehorn (a porn star name if ever there was one!) beautifully shines in a film populated predominantly by males (there's another flaw for you), Michael Jeter scores favourably as a highly strung elder, while young Majorino is suitably winsome, neatly playing it as a device to mellow the Mariner's cold fishy heart. Take that and fill it out with the detail of the definitive cut (Ulysses) which showcases Reynolds' vision and it's fan nirvana all round.

If it was meant to be a serious picture in the first place, a sermon on topical destroying of the Earth, then it fails a touch because the characterisations are bound by cliché manacles. Yet collectively the inhabitants of this Waterworld share a common goal of survival, played out to the backdrop of Reynolds' excellent futuristic setting. When thrust together to make a good versus evil action movie, the characterisations work handsomely within that framework. That is ultimately the best way to enjoy Waterworld, let it wash over you (hrr hrr hrr) in a wave (hrr, OK I'll stop now) of water based action and heroics. It's a world where soil is currency and smoking is a marker for being a bad guy. From the opening shot of the Universal World logo becoming submerged in water, to the bittersweet finale, yes! Waterworld is indeed escapism in its purest cinematic form and becomes a high definition must in the process. 8/10 || **Rather poorly edited and cut, this film is downright forgettable.**

I've seen this movie twice, and I honestly can't believe it. It was truly the same as burning money. After being impressed by the poor quality of the film, I went to read and research about it, and discovered the eventual cause of this disaster: from the beginning, it was a project doomed to failure. Badly planned, it was filmed in a place where the weather conditions would cause problems. The ambition to do more and better is healthy, but in this case it caused an escalation of costs. To make things more difficult, the production was guided by Kevin's disagreement against Kevin, since the director, Kevin Reynolds, was contradicted several times by the main actor, Kevin Costner. The most blatant disagreement may have happened during post-production, with the actor and the studio demanding a straight cut of the film, which was lame and poorly edited. It had everything to go wrong...

I know, now, that there are extended versions of the film, but I haven't found a ""director's cut"" that would be able to reverse the changes and give us the version that Reynold initially envisioned. What I saw is the “canonical version” of about two hours, and I hated it. The script is based on a very apocalyptic and poorly explained future, where the entire world is flooded, and a myth has been created where, somewhere, there would be land, but which no one has actually been able to confirm. The few surviving people live on atolls and artificial islands, and on boats. The film never shows us a storm, a hurricane or anything that threatens the lives of those survivors, nor does it explain how they survived, or why no one properly explores the world to discover signs of earth. There are a lot of loose ends and absurdities, and the film will only work if we avoid thinking about it too much.

The cast rests solidly on Kevin Costner's back, and even those who aren't particularly fans of the actor will have to agree that he makes a good acting exercise, and is charismatic enough to ensure the role that is expected of him, especially if we're considering how indigestible and unsympathetic his character can be. Dennis Hopper is a likable villain, more cartoonish than truly menacing. Jeanne Tripplehorn is decent and satisfying.

Technically, the film stands out for its commitment to excellent production values, with the effort and financial expenditure applied being clear: the choice of filming locations is very good, despite having brought many practical and logistical difficulties to the production; the cinematography takes every opportunity to make the film beautiful and elegant. The sets and costumes, made extremely realistically, are excellent, and you can see that they were expensive and detailed. The action scenes were well-thought-out and executed, and could have been better had the film not been structured for such a low rating. Good effects and a soundtrack that satisfies without enchanting make up the overall picture of a rather forgettable film."

Also central to this story is the young ""Taplow"" (Ben Silverstone) who, alone amongst the student body, has a degree of respect for this teacher. Perhaps it's because he wishes to swap to science next term, or perhaps because he sees something of the vulnerable in the older, lonelier man? As that final day and it's speech gets closer, things come to an head that is poignantly inconclusive. Finney is on good form here as is Michael Gambon as the headmaster obsessed with the cricket team and with placating the snooty parents who the school afloat, and the young Silverstone.

This was the first time I saw a movie that had nothing close to a human antagonist, yet it kept me glued to the screen. Sure I've read a few novels of the kind but surely they weren't ""oh I'm glued"" stuff. Everybody at least once in their life dreams of something like this and this movie makes it believable. After watching the movie I really thought that Ethan & Julie must have dated 'cause their conversations were just flowing. Definitely a must see. || **A very simple but very human film, with very good feelings and dialogue.**

Contrary to what I like to do, I saw this film after seeing its sequel, “Before Sundown”. It's a very nice story about an American tourist who is enchanted by a French student he meets on the train on the way to Vienna, and invites her to spend some time with him. The rest of the film is an intense dialogue between the two through the streets of the city, as emotions and feelings develop.

The best thing this film has to offer is the surprising and intensely credible interpretation of the main actors. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both young, elegant and seem to make a nice couple (of course, the characters, not the actors). I don't know if I'm the only person to think this way, but it seems like the actors felt what the characters were feeling, to the extent that there was sympathy or mutual understanding between the two professionals, and a chemistry that permeated entirely to us. .

Directed and written with great skill by Richard Linklater, the film can summarize the first meetings of many young couples out there, and I have no doubt that there are many people who will easily identify with the two characters. Who has never chatted with someone cute on a train or bus? There are friendships that start like this, and I myself have a similar case in my life: I have a friend that I value very much, who is blind and who I met by chance on the train, helping her to sit down on more than one occasion (we were both regular travelers due to work). It's a very human film, full of feelings, and full of good dialogues."

T. Walsh, Nicky Katt, Lee Garlington",Guy Ferland,"alcohol, obsession, babysitter, parents","***How a beautiful woman affects men***

An attractive, but otherwise normal and decent teen girl (Alicia Silverstone), takes a short-notice babysitting gig in the Los Angeles area. She unknowingly stirs the fantasies of the middle-aged husband of the house (J.T. Walsh), the preadolescent boy, her current boyfriend (Jeremy London) and his wannabe Fonzie frenemy (Nicky Katt).

Alicia Silverstone was a hot item in the 90s, but the direct-to-video “The Babysitter” (1995) fell through the cracks. It’s not great like “Clueless” (1995) or “The Crush” (1993), but it’s still a worthy 90’s Silverstone drama/comedy with romance/thriller elements in the same league as “True Crime” (1995) and “Excess Baggage” (1997).   

As suggested above, the movie’s about how males of all ages react to a nubile female who’s not completely aware of her effect on males and therefore is indifferent to it. The story is helped by the fact that she’s a genuinely decent, ordinary girl unaware of all the raging male hormones she is unwittingly arousing.

“The Babysitter” successfully conveys the intangible world of fantasy that goes on in people’s mind, and not just guys (albeit mostly guys). This is a force that each individual is responsible to monitor and control. If foolishly left unchecked it can result in negative consequences. 

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in Pasadena & Ventura, California. Additional cast members include Lee Garlington, George Segal and Lois Chiles. 

GRADE: B- || Well, Alicia Silverstone does a good job. Have to give her that.

But, this is pretty much ""The Crush"" only with a much worse cast, a slightly different plot that still follows the lolita theme, and a the worst possible execution possible.

I believe the plot summary is that a man and his children all have a thing for the babysitter... and that is just about all you need to know.

Films like this you expect tension, something that keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes a knot in the muscles on your back. Tension that is both sexual and fatal.

Instead it pushes for an eroticism that is never really achieved and any feelings of peril are absolutely void. The cover suggests enough, but in the end the mood never gets there enough to make it an enjoyable watch."

An American man (Jeffrey Combs) inherits a castle about an hour’s drive north of Rome and brings his wife & daughter (Barbara Crampton and Jessica Dollarhide). The couple is troubled by the husband’s alcoholism, which caused the death of their young son. Meanwhile the teen daughter insists that someone else is dwelling in the castle. Havoc ensues.

I didn’t have high hopes for “Castle Freak” (1995) due to the blunt title and cheesy movie poster, but it’s surprisingly well done for a flick that only cost $500,000. I couldn’t help be reminded of HP Lovecraft’s “The Dunwich Horror” (1970) and therefore wasn’t surprised to find out the film was inspired by Lovecraft’s ""The Outsider.""

The tone and setting is similar to “Subspecies” (1991), just exchange the vampire for a contorted monstrosity. Speaking of the undead, the milieu also brings to mind Dracula flicks, like the most recent (at the time) “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992).

The first half takes its time to set up the characters, create some Gothic mood and milk suspense while the second half turns increasingly horrific and tragic. Psychologically, there are several gems to mine, like the consequences of abuse and folly, not to mention potential redemption and forgiveness in a fallen world. Culturally, this is a great flick to get a feel for pastoral Italy.

Raffaella Offidani appears on the feminine front as a chic courtesan and I couldn’t help thinking of Halle Berry. I prefer Jessica Dollarhide as Rebecca, but not enough is done with her (not talkin’ ’bout nudity or sleaze). Speaking of which, there’s some nakedness and a little passionate sex on display, as well as utterly gruesome bits. Just a heads up.

The ending was, incidentally, ripped off in “Cold Creek Manor” (2003). Meanwhile a reimaging was released in 2020 under the same title, but I have yet to see it (although the trailer is intriguing).

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Giove & Attigliano, Italy, including the castle owned by executive producer Charles Band. The region is 45 miles due north of Rome. I shouldn’t close without mentioning Luca Zingaretti’s significant role as the sheriff.

My cinephilic friends tend to dismiss his recent works, but this was very enjoyable. I like the influence he has had on independent cinema. 1994 certainly proved to be an important year for it, with the smash successes that independent studios had with 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I hope he sticks to directing films that he himself writes. I have the feeling he wants to expand his horizons but isn't quite sure how to go about it without alienating his huge fanbase. I have great confidence in him, and feel that if he puts his heart into it, he can be a great filmmaker, instead of a good one. I think for him to do so, he could do himself a great service and read a few less comic books and watch a lot more movies, particularly by the Hollywood greats from the Golden Age, such as Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Raoul Walsh and John Ford. It would be quite exciting to see what he comes up with, once his creative juices are recharged. || Quite a controversial movie, I would say, yet the very one from all by Kevin Smith I actually like.

I just saw this film, and honestly I was hoping for a slightly different comedy, with a more elaborate, more conventional structure and not based so much on endless dialogues. It is, however, an independent film, made a little outside of what traditional circuits and big studios are, and the budget is limited. If we consider all this, I think we can understand the film better.

The film basically accompanies a day in the life of two commercial employees who hate their jobs but need them, like any mortal. They work closely together and are friends, but the day promises not to be easy for either of them. The film is based on jokes of a very rude nature, sometimes also on the inelegant manners of the characters. There are a lot of allusions to pop culture throughout the movie as well, and I didn't always get that. It's not the kind of humor I really enjoy, though the film has its moments. Perhaps this style of humor works better with young people and teenagers than with someone more adult...

The cast features a number of actors that I don't really know. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson had their most relevant work in this film, from what I've seen. The film is quite restrained in terms of costumes and scenery, and I believe that real stores were used for the production. What can be considered a weakness, the low budget, was to some extent an advantage, taking into account the type of film they preferred to make here. The cinematography is very good and well used, and is perhaps the film's most artistic feature."

It's an interesting idea acted well by very good actors (a lot of people dismiss Marlon Brando's work here, but I don't think it's that bad, honestly). If anything, the problem here is the movie doesn't know where to go after it's decent start. || **He who says every woman is a mystery to be solved.**

One of the earliest films for Johnny Depp and very surprising. Thematically, the film is for the grown ups, but well made without too much sexual exploit. That means you can comfortably sit and watch with your family. This is not actually about Don Juan, but kind of 'The Fall'. I mean the flashback reveals everything and remains as a mystery.

The story follows a man who himself declares the real Don Juan DeMarco, the greatest lover of the world. So he ends in a psychiatric centre for the treatment after trying to commit suicide. A doctor who is on the verge to retire set to treat him and when the DeMarco narrates his life story, the doctor too inspires to reinstate his romantic life. The remaining narration tells how they work out to solve the issue once for all.

Not a masterpiece, but kind of interesting drama, particularly for how the film characters were drawn. And the story was built cleverly, till the final scene by giving out the viewers a positive message that worth living life to love and to be loved. So if you opt it for the title, not a bad choice, since the theme remains about the love, even the person you are looking for is not present. More like it is a metaphor, when it comes to the real Don Juan and the one in this film. Like people say god is everywhere, the love is as well and so the version/personality of Don Juan in every person.

Johnny Depp was so good, an ideal person to play the title role. Marlon Brando was too great, in a simple way. The rest of the cast was not bad, but the entire film focused on these two than anybody else. It's been nearly 25 years since it came out, but I feel a remake would be not a bad idea with changes in the script. Todays writer and directors are clever at doing that, but it should come from a big banner with big names. Maybe Johnny Deep to play the doctor in the modern version. I hope some filmmakers read this and consider that. Meanwhile, it is a worthy film, so it a try.

_7/10_ || **_Brando, Depp and Dunaway in an amusing and inspiring romcom_**

After a psychiatrist in New York (Marlon Brando) talks a young Lothario out of committing suicide (Johnny Depp), the supposedly delusional man is interned at a mental hospital for examination where his charisma has an interesting effect on the people. Faye Dunaway plays the doctor’s wife.

""Don Juan DeMarco” (1994) is a whimsical romantic dramedy with psychological insights highlighted by the three stars. Brando was verging on 70 during shooting and would only do four more feature films while Depp was a rising star who wouldn’t hit it big for another five years, as far as box office success goes. While the movie performed mediocrely in America, it made almost three times its cost worldwide and thus was considered a success for New Line Cinema. 

This was Marlon’s beefiest role since “The Missouri Breaks” (1976) and “Apocalypse Now” (1979) with the rest of his late-era films having minimal parts (for big bucks). While it’s criticized that he “coasts” through the role of the psychiatrist, mumbling, his performance fits the fun, insightful and inspiring tone.

Depp would team-up with Brando again for his dismal oddity “The Brave” (1997). 

The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal (Saugus, Los Angeles and Santa Clarita) with second unit work done in O'ahu and New York.

Now she has been accused of killing her employer, Vera Donovan, and this time there is a witness who can place her at the scene of the crime.

At least, in Stephen King’s universe. True to his (excessive) words, a lot gets stirred up, not all of it gets answered, and characters  get knee high in lots of details. Nothing wrong about that, except in this movie the details, and the melodrama that comes with them, tend to bog down what should be bonding of two women over the men that hurt them. What a depressingly masculine mess.

I love a good pulpy environment (hello film noir, which often has a mystery element to it like this movie) but someone how the pacing was just off. I think Kathy Bates does a pretty fantastic job as the the title character. Her daughter Selena though.. I don’t know if it meant more in the book but her talks about the story in Arizona she wants to cover doesn’t really anything interesting to the mix. Maybe it’s to show what bad decisions she’s made after having no family to turn to, but it’s belaboured. We get she’s a emotional mess without it. I also don’t think Jennifer Jason Leigh is all that great in the role, but then again she mostly just sits there to reveal plot points and be something Dolores scarified for. She’s a talking macguffin.
Much more interesting is the relationship between Dolores and Det. Mackey, played gravely by Christopher Plummer. Oh, and that odd looking John C. Riley as his deputy. His face always livens everything up. There’s a bit of destructive perfectionist streak in Mackey, wanting to close the book on the case he never solves to his satisfaction. At some points this runs into cop drama play by play (including  a[albeit mercifully short] courtroom scene. Were 90’s Hollywood films required to have those in at least one scene?), but it helped by little details, like throwing a full piss pan at the other.

But whose piss was that? Why the fermenting yellow liquid of Vera, a women we seem to think Dolores killed. We know that’s not true though, any two who exchange such old fashioned zingers (“Dolores, I insist that all women who have hysterics in my drawing room call me by my Christian name.”)  and share body fluids can’t hate each other. Maybe with only one, but both? Nay. Besides, it’s much more fun to tag team to doom a alcoholic sexual predator. Her husband; Am I spoiling anything by saying she did kill him? Then it would only be 95% special victims unit, not totally. Might as well cook up all that gravy, a full crock.
This does lead to two defining  moments for Dolores. The log back rub to milk cranium massage is pretty good vicious, but mere flower play before the eclipse.  After finding Joe has been stealing from her (by proxy of having a penis and the bank therefore believing his bullshit) and abusing a young Selena she plays to stuff him down a well, when everyone is watching the sun black out. This scene is certainly memorable, if not only for the almost baroque visual style (lot of key light) but where she seems to set an olympic record for long jumping, right over the hole. Frankly, this should have been the ending, it’s Dolores best movement, and since she really sets the stage for everyone else to ladle out in, it’s a wonderfully creepy way out. Instead we wait another quarter of a film to pass by.

Anything not Dolores tends to be too congested to be found appetizing. I wage she was more of  the center of attention originally, and the other parts were attempting to give the actors more to do, or give more speaking time to the men. This is dubious; King material tends to be overripe as it is, but imitation King (as practiced by director Taylor Hackford and writer Tony Gilroy) is even more stagy. Fine, she helped her daughter, who recognizes it nearly twenty years later, and she amused an entertaining old lady. But the real Dolores, and where Bates is at her best, wrapped all the pain she took from an abusive husband, and leaped over to stomp down someone who hurt her young, like a fierce chicken. A little more strut, a little more pecking, and we would have a fine character study between her and her golden egg. Guess you take what you can get, and go on with your day, especially in Maine. || This one tends to get ignored when people consider the 'classic' Stephen King film adaptations (the first 20 years), but it's very subtle, nuanced, and is basically one of King's finest and more mature works. If it was even possible for Kathy Bates to out-do her Oscar-winning work in 'Misery', she still did so, and nailed it. I'm a huge fan of John C. Reilly, Eric Bogosian (why 'Talk Radio is my favourite Oliver Stone movie and 'Under Siege 2' my favourite Steven Seagal film), David Strathairn, Christopher Plummer and especially, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and the Tony Gilroy script serves them beautifully.

Unfairly, I tend to joke about director Taylor HACKford, but it just may be that he's a more contemporary model of such versatile directors from the past as Norman Jewison and Robert Wise. That's fairly esteemed company--and here, he abides himself quite nicely in some of his best work. || Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto.

Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain.

Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present.

A terrifically well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly.

The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward - the latter of which is nearly unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan whom wants some intelligent emotional heft in the screenplay. 8/10"

This is one of those films that puts such a huge barrier between the audience and the screen that it seems like we're not even being taken into consideration by the producers. Despite the attempts, there is not a single sympathetic or palatable character, the script does not help and the feeling that hangs in the air is of a lack of connection and solidity in the final product that can only be explained if we think about the way the director wanted to be. abstract by force.

Everything takes place around a chic striptease club, Exotica, in Toronto. There is a dancer who enchants not only a client who goes to see her every day, but also the presenter, who is her ex-boyfriend and one of the most possessive and unhappy people we can imagine. Add to this an animal trafficker with problems admitting homosexuality who is forced to participate in a revenge plan, and we have a film that we probably won't want to see more than once.

Atom Egoyan gives us firm direction, but a much less secure and solid script. I like the way it addresses loss, trauma, the feeling of denial of reality and grief. However, to believe that a woman would set up an elegant strip club and her daughter would have the courage to take over the “family business” is to completely ignore the realities of these commercial establishments, where legality and illegality sometimes go hand in hand. A real luxury house would never hold private sessions on tables in the main room for a low price, but in separate rooms for a much higher price, and real strippers don't usually dance to the same music and use the same stage number constantly. There are also huge holes that the script never explains and that are left hanging. For example, why did Christina decide to become a stripper if it is clear, from the characters' words, that that is not the place she deserved to be.

Bruce Greenwood is the actor who deserves the most praise for his work here. He is the only one trying to break the ice and reach out to the public in some way, and that deserves an applause from us. Elias Koteas is not that good, but he also does work that can be considered positive. Mia Kirshner, on the other hand, seems to be disinterested and just trying to make some money without much effort. Don McKellar is no better, and Arsinée Khanjian has an absolutely ill-conceived and poorly made character.

On a technical level, it is an uninteresting film, to say the least. It is within the range of what one would expect to find in a film with aspirations to be commercial, but which seems to be more popular with festivals and film cycles than with the mass public. The positive highlight is the design of the strip club scene, something tropical I would say, and the soundtrack, which includes a good song by Leonard Cohen."

I've been wanting to see this for a while now, and the opportunity finally came. Very intelligently directed by Tim Burton, it is a brief biography that honors Ed Wood, reckoned as the worst director Hollywood has ever known (although that title is disputed by other more recent directors).

I already knew Ed Wood's work, I've seen one or two of his films, and I can guarantee that his fame is justified: the films are the most amateurish imaginable and the number of errors and problems is such that even the general public saw the director's inability and naïveté. I won't dwell on this point, just add that this film covers the filming of “Glenn or Glenda”, “Bride of the Monster” and “Plan 9 from Outer Space”. As is typical of Burton's films, there is a certain amount of bizarreness which makes the most sincere homage to Ed Wood's work. One notices, implicitly, a certain sympathy or admiration for the director, who never achieved fame (at least, positive) and to whom success has eluded. He is a man with a vision and a dream, but without any ability to achieve it and who, even so, never gave up.

Johnny Depp was a smart choice for the protagonist. The actor likes unusual roles and portrayed Wood in a very faithful way, emphasizing his incorrigible and absolutely blind optimism, as well as his habit of dressing like a woman and the problems that caused him in being taken seriously. There is, in the character, a certain bizarre fetish about angora fabrics that I don't know if it was real, but it fit very well. I also really liked Martin Landau, a very respectable veteran who fit wonderfully into the role of Bela Lugosi, the mythical horror actor who was forgotten by the industry towards the end of his life and succumbed to morphine addiction and depression, and Lisa Marie, who played Maila Nurmi, Finnish actress famous for her character Vampira. Sarah Jessica Parker also did an impeccable job as Wood's girlfriend. Jeffrey Jones does a good job as Criswell, a fake psychic famous for his TV appearances. Bill Murray appears little, but does a decent job whenever asked.

The film was very well shot in black and white, and I believe this fit better with the spirit of the film, and the way it was designed. There is a beautiful limpidity and the cinematography is very crafted and stylistically rich. The film plays a lot with the difficulties that Wood encountered in filming and promoting his films, and the total amateurism with which he did so, and this is funny and, at the same time, moving. The sets and costumes are excellent, convincing, and the reproduction of the films was well done and honors the originals. The soundtrack, written by Howard Shore, does the rest and gives the film a bizarrely delicious tone. Finally, a word about the opening and ending of the film, in a style magnificently suited to cheap horror productions of the time."

A well-to-do couple in the Seattle area (Jeff Goldblum & Christine Lahti) is struggling with grief and the challenges of parenting a beautiful teenager (Alicia Silverstone). When the man seems to die in an accident he is resuscitated by a revolutionary doctor (Alfred Molina). Yet coming back from the afterlife has a peculiar effect as he starts to have visions of a local serial killer (Jeremy Sisto).

""Hideaway"" (1995) is a psychological crime thriller with mystery/horror elements based on Dean R. Koontz’ 1992 novel. Dean hated the end results and wanted his name removed from the credits, but the gist of his story is intact (I guess the devil is in the details, as they say).  True, the movie changes Regina from a cool orphan into a typical spoiled teenager and omits elaboration on how Vassago (Sisto) becomes what he is, but so what? You can only fit so much of a book into 1 hour and 45 minutes; besides, enough detail is there if you read in between the lines.

The movie reminds me of a meshing of the future “Kiss the Girls” (1997) and “Bless the Child” (2000). It shares the tone and general locations of “Disturbing Behavior” (1998) with the story being influenced by flicks like “Body Parts” (1991) and “Eyes of Laura Mars” (1978). Obviously if you favor these kinds of flicks you’ll probably like this one despite complaints by Koontz and fans of the book.

The storytelling is a little confusing in certain ways (for instance, if the killer dies in the opening sequence, how can he be alive & murdering people?). Yet everything is explained by the last act. Meanwhile the colorful CGI depicting the afterlife is quaint (being done in 1994) and reminiscent of the dubious effects in “Bless the Child,” but that’s okay because the afterlife should appear amorphous anyway.

Silverstone was about 18 during shooting and quite fetching, but she’s not the focus; Goldblum and Sisto are. Speaking of Sisto, he looks & acts like Jim Morrison would if he was a psycho serial murderer. Meanwhile Lahti was 44 at the time and looks great.

The ending at the titular hideaway (in a defunct amusement park) is thoroughly comic booky, but the flick has effective atmosphere and delivers the goods if you can roll with it rather than against it.    

The film was shot in Britannia Beach, British Columbia, which is 20 miles north of Vancouver. Vassago's hideaway was constructed in the abandoned Britannia Mine.

A truly multi-talented Gary Oldman is on good form as Bernard Rose guides us through the life, and fairly frequent loves, of this genius. His flaws are writ large from the beginning; his, at times, quite brutal upbringing and his womanising certainly didn't make him the nicest of men; and as his deafness takes over his character becomes more irascible and unpredictable. The story is presented as a retrospective, starting at his funeral, and is largely described through the perspective of his friend Anton Schindler (a considered effort from Jeroen Krabbé) and we see how his nature could vacillate from kindly, cruel, passionate and loving to selfish and vile. There are strong supporting contributions from Isabella Rossellini and Johanna Reiss that help keep this film focused and engaging. There are also ample opportunities to hear some of his music played, quite possibly, in a venue he would have himself attended. The attention to detail is superb: costumes, sets and locations all looking excellent.

I expected a fair deal from <em>'Heavyweights'</em>, especially after seeing Ben Stiller was involved. Unfortunately, it never takes off after the initial joke becomes tiresome; the characters are fat, that's basically it. It needed more meat on the bones (pardon the pun), too mediocre.

Stiller isn't great either, in a part which is basically a watered down version of the role he'd play nine years year, White Goodman, in <em>'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'</em> - he, surely, used this character, Tony, as inspiration for White?

This film was the first jewel in the crown of Peter Jackson, a truly creative director, with clear vision. We're not worthy. || **An excellent film that shows the talent of Peter Jackson and the strength and commitment of a magnificent duo of young actresses.**

I really liked this film. Like the overwhelming majority of people, I didn't know about the real crime behind the story of this film, where the friendship between two teenagers turns into a sexual and romantic obsession and leads the two young women to kill the mother of one of them, in hope that they can run away or stay together.

Directed by Peter Jackson, still a long way from dreaming that he would be as successful as “The Lord of the Rings”, the film is excellent and does a great job in terms of recreating the events and psychology of the two central characters. Of course, according to what I've read, the facts are not entirely clear as to the nature of the relationship the two girls had, but it seems quite clear that, at the very least, there was a very strong obsession between them and a certain dissociation from reality. , through the creation of a fantasy alternative world that functioned as an escape. The film shows us this clearly and manages to maintain a certain ambiguity where it seems most necessary.

This was the debut film for young Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynksey. None of them seem exactly like newcomers or inexperienced in the cinematographic art, which can only be a revealing parameter of talent, and of the great qualities that both have revealed since then, most especially Winslet, who has dedicated more time to cinema and achieved a different level of recognition. In addition to them, we also have the excellent performances by Sarah Peirse, Clive Morrison and Diana Kent, in the role of three of the paternal figures.

Technically, the film doesn't have any major problems. The pace is ideal, there are no dead moments or situations that seem to be too much or to have been stilted, and the editing is very good and well executed. The cinematography is excellent, with great color and light, particularly in the fantasy scenes, where we enter the fantastic world that these young women created for themselves. The sets are good and, together with the costumes, recreate the period portrayed with verisimilitude. The filming locations are magnificent, very well selected and used. The soundtrack is equally good. || I had no idea what this story was about. I had no idea what these girls were about. Great to put it all together and shocking to see them carry it out. And it happened. And one is an author...crazy. This is so crazy.

Everything about <em>'A Kid in King Arthur’s Court'</em> is just so poor, the whole feel of the film is extremely low-budget and limp. The writing is substandard, while the dialogue is actually terrible; it forces the 'present day vs. old days' theme way too much, it needed more to it.

The casting can make such a difference in how your film comes out, you can have a load of crap but if you get a strong cast you can still produce something good. This simply doesn't do that, though there is an interesting caveat - as both Kate Winslet and Daniel Craig incredibly appear, in just their third and second films respectively - huge credit to the Hubbards & Co., the UK casting directors.

The premise is just so dumb and uninteresting. Disney already adapted the Mark Twain novel in 1979 with <em>'Unidentified Flying Oddball'</em>, which I didn't love, so it's bizarre they chose to go back to it. As noted earlier, they try to make it noteworthy by colliding the two differing eras but it just comes across as lazy.

There's one, very minor, part I did like and that was King Arthur's little story with the Excalibur sword. It's nothing amazing, but I could appreciate what they were trying to do with that at the very least.

Based on  Louisa May Alcott’s classic 1868 novel, “Little Women” details the coming-of-age years of four sisters from 1862-1868, covering most of the Civil War and a few years afterward.

I love the rustic New England ambiance, especially the wintery parts, but the story curiously isn’t as compelling as the classic 1933 version with Katharine Hepburn, at least as I REMEMBER it being. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half when the forceful Jo (Winona Ryder) goes to New York City and develops a friendship with an amicable, but much older scholar (Gabriel Byrne). The ending is heartwarming.

It’s interesting seeing all these actors when they were younger: Trini Alvarado as the oldest sister Meg, who’s interested in a tutor that works next door (Eric Stoltz); Claire Danes as the sickly Beth; and Kirsten Dunst & Samantha Mathis as Amy, younger and older. Christian Bale plays the neighbor, Laurie, who becomes an honorary brother that loves the March family so much he desperately wants to be part of it. Meanwhile Susan Sarandon is on hand as the mother.

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in British Columbia and Deerfield, Massachusetts. While the movie opened rather weakly at the box office during Christmas, 1994, it went on to become a surprise success.

GRADE: C+/B- || **A tired and uninspired adaptation of a super famous novel.**

This film is yet another film adaptation of the famous novel of the same name by Louisa May Alcott, one of those classic books that is constantly being adapted and reread almost permanently. Therefore, I believe that even those who have never read the original book – like me, I admit – know the story at a minimum, which focuses on the difficulties and domestic troubles of a middle-class family in the North of the USA during the traumatic years of the US Civil War. With the family patriarch absent on the battlefield, it is up to his wife to be the support of the house, where she lives with four very different daughters.

The script really doesn't need any major introductions. Having not read the original book, I do not, however, feel like the best person to comment on the quality of the adaptation of this material, and I will limit myself to talking exclusively about what I saw in the film. And what I saw is moderately good. It's not an incredible film, it's not the best adaptation I've ever seen, it's not a flawless period film, but it's a good piece of entertainment that's perfectly suited to watching with the whole family on a weekend evening. And although the film is a few years old – it was released in 1994 – it hasn't aged a single day and remains as fresh and enjoyable today as it was thirty years ago.

The cast is undoubtedly one of the film's strongest points. Susan Sarandon is a safe and solid bet to bring Mrs. March to life. She is unlikely to be the favorite actress of a legion of fans and is reasonably discreet, but she has talent, ability and knows very well how to embody these strong, dignified and mature characters. Winona Ryder, who at this time was experiencing the height of her artistic career, is also excellent in the role of Jo. Claire Danes and Samantha Mathis were quite young, but they showed enormous willpower and talent in this work. Trini Alvarado is the most discreet of the quartet of sisters, but she does what is necessary to extricate herself from the task at hand. Kirsten Dunst played a minor but relevant role, and it would be unfair not to mention the solid and positive contributions of Gabriel Byrne and Christian Bale in the main male roles.

However, this film has a huge problem: it is absurdly lukewarm and soapy. It's not a film that stays in our mind for hours and hours after we've finished watching it, it's a film that we watch, we moderately like, and, a few hours later, it's already forgotten. The cinematography, editing and soundtrack are completely standard, with no surprises or clear investment on the part of the production. The recreation of the historical period is inaccurate to say the least, being full of factual errors, incorrect props, anachronistic costumes and hairstyles. The production simply didn't bother hiring some kind of serious historical consultant and was satisfied with a theatrical look at what the Civil War period could be like. Also, the dialogue and attitudes of the cast do not correspond to what would be expected from people of that time. Another serious problem with the film is Gillian Armstrong, a completely uninspired director who gives us a tired and slightly sad vision of Alcott's novel. It is therefore understandable that almost no one remembers this film nowadays. It's not really worth it... only for fans of the actresses or actors in the cast, and even they all had better works, before or after. || Moderately faithful to the books, this movie does well to maintain the magic in a 90s cinematography capsule. It has excellent casting and hosts very strong performances from all.

Well, it actually has a title, what the Darth Vader theme. And that title is ""The Imperial March"", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for ""Jaws"" - that legendary score simply titled, ""Main Title (Theme From Jaws)"".

Now, with that lil' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly ""Movie Date Night"" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema's briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.

From the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn't believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed.

George Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas's phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I'll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.

I don't personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn't suggest there are still a few people out there who haven't. And if you're one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you'll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you'll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. 😊 || A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...

Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.

Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.

As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.

It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10 || Star Wars (1977) is a true masterpiece of cinema, and is 
  definitely one of the best films ever made.

For me Star Wars (1977) is the best movie of all time,tied with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Star Wars (1977) it is for sure the most iconic film of all time everything in it is iconic. The direction, the script, the performances in this film are brilliant, all the characters are captivating and well developed. 

Anyway, this is a totally perfect film, I only have praise for it, it is certainly a masterpiece of cinema, and my grade for it is 10\10."

Near the close of the 19th Century, a disillusioned Army Colonel (Anthony Hopkins) sets up a ranch in remote western Montana with his Cree friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis). He nurtures a family of a wife & three boys, plus his loyal personnel. One son is sensible and “follows the rules (Aidan Quinn) while another is wild and well-versed in Cree traditions (Brad Pitt). After a harrowing involvement in WW1, the two brothers go separate ways during the Prohibition Era of the 20s and early 30s. Julia Ormond and Karina Lombard are on hand in the feminine department.      

""Legends of the Fall"" (1994) is similar to “A River Runs through It” from two years prior. Pitt basically plays the same character, just exaggerated here. Where these movies differ is the earlier one was based on Norman Maclean’s memoir and is therefore thoroughly realistic whereas “Legends” was based on James Harrison’s book and has a larger-than-life vibe. Like that earlier film, “Legends” effectively brings to life the era with its Model T's and bootlegging of alcoholic beverages. 

While I give the edge to “A River Runs through It,” this one ain’t no slouch. It begins mundane and tedious with AmerIndian mumbo jumbo (I’m talking about the eye-rolling spiritual gobbledygook, e.g. the “wild spirit of the bear”), but picks up when the boys go to Europe to fight. Like “A River Runs through It,” this is a character study of two contrasting souls, both generally likable and noble, but one functions successfully within the box of society whereas the other cannot be contained in this box.

Although neither trips my trigger much, Ormond is very attractive and Lombard is stunning. 

At the end of the day, “Legends” is a well-done artistic Western that takes place in the early 20th Century with commentary on the masculine nature, duty, bravery, death, love, rivalry, commitment or lack of commitment, searching for meaning, familial altercations, following the rules, living “free,” tragedy, acceptance, forgiveness and honor. It’s simply about life and every family will be able to relate, one way or another.  

The film runs 2 hours, 13 minutes, and was shot in Alberta, Canada (Ghost River, Morley & Calgary), and Vancouver, British Columbia (the Helena scenes), as well as Ocho Rios, St. Ann, Jamaica (the exotic scenes).

He has fallen for her while she was singing, and wants to know everything about her life. He finally gets her sad story, how the authorities took her four children (after one of them was  burned badly when she was out working), how the man she was with continously beat her. Her life was a tragic one, and of course she doesn't trust anyone.

George, by the way, is from Paraguay and has a tragic story of his own. He is a man with a strong will, and believes that he can change Maggie and give her the life that she deserves. Two times, Maggie and George makes a baby, and both times the authorities comes to take them away. Imagine how you would react to having 6 children removed from you, now imagine how Maggie and George reacts. It is a heartbreaking story, and sadly, a true one.

Ken Loach is a master of showing us how life really is. He doesn't want to sugarcoat anything, he just wants us to realize that these people are real, that they are our neighbours and friends, the people we pass on the street, see in the supermarket. He also wants to show us how wrong the system is (I think), and how little they care for the parents and, ultimately, the children. I mean, sure, if the kids were actually beaten or abused, they would need to be removed right away, but in this movie, there is no evidence to suggest that. So aren't the kids better off with their real parents? Throughout the movie, Maggie gets worse (only barely hanging on to her sanity), as the system strip her of all dignity, we even learn that she was abused as a kid, and placed at an institution.

You have to love a real life drama, to love this movie. There is no wonderland here to hide in, and even though the end suggests that Maggie and George finally got to keep three children (and become a family), there is no happy ending here. It is unbearable to watch at times, but only because the actors does a great job at making this seem real. Life can be unbearable.

This is not a monster movie in any shallow slasher sense. It probes and contemplates some eternal questions humans have been pondering for thousands of years, set in a time when so many things we know today were yet unknown, adding to the mystery and horror of the situations that occurred. This movie has pathos, sumptuous sets, costumes and screenplay, some utterly disturbing scenes and ideas, and culminates in classic tragedy. || ***Gothic mania with Kenneth Branagh, Robert DeNiro and Helena Bonham Carter***

Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version of the oft-filmed Frankenstein story was the most faithful to Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel up to that point, which explains its name. It features fine actors and looks great (sets, costumes, locations, etc). There are several quality scenes, like the creature's time spent with the peasant family where his unseen help is taken for a ""good spirit of the woods.""

The first time I viewed the movie I was a little turned off by its manic style. People are introduced, scenes flash by, times shift and the soundtrack blares, which struck me as overdone. The characters seemed so melodramatic at times, emoting, yelling, running, confronting, fighting, dying: ""Ahhhhhh!!"" ""NoooOOOOOoooooo!!!"" I just wanted them to stop, take their meds, and chill for 5-10 minutes. I’ve since read Shelley’s book and watched the even more faithful version, Hallmark’s “Frankenstein” (2004) with Luke Goss playing the creature, which runs almost 3 hours.

Seeing this version again I appreciated it more and was able to see how Branagh provides a nice balance between the hyper moments and more subdued sequences. If it sometimes seems too manic it’s because Branagh tried to cram the bulk of the novel into 2 hours. On the positive side, this makes it play better for those who prefer constant thrills, melodrama, etc. The 2004 version has almost another hour to play with and is more subdued and brooding. This one’s more of a “blockbuster.”

Speaking of the 2004 rendition, the creature is more faithful to the book (with long black hair and white teeth), but he’s also too handsome in a dark gothic way, resembling Type O Negative’s Peter Steele. The creature in this version removes the hair and opts for a more gruesome depiction, which fits Victor’s description of the creature as “hideous.” In any case, De Niro does a fine job in the role. 

My favorite part is when the monster finds sanctuary with the rural family, unbeknownst to them. It helps the viewer get to know the creature and have compassion on his plight, but soon all sympathy is pretty much lost. On the other hand, he IS a 'monster’; and he has an interesting discussion with Victor in his remote glacial dwelling in the high country, which helps explain his actions. The locket-framing sequence is lame, but that was a weak point of the novel as well.

While this version and the 2004 one are the most faithful to Shelley’s book, they each omit parts and change certain things. For instance, both omit Victor’s traveling to Scotland and, later, Ireland, which was a good call. This version alters a certain character’s death to a lynching while in the novel it was court-ordered hanging. Regardless, I enjoyed the surprise plot turn in the last act, which I’m not going to give away. And the tragic ending is well executed. 

""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" is similar to ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) in that they both look awesome and were produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Any problems are due to translating convoluted 19th century gothic horror classics to modern cinema. 

The film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in England (Shepperton Studios) and the Swiss Alps.

GRADE: B+ || Kenneth Branagh made quite an artistic hit with his first film **HENRY V**. Next, he had great critical and financial success with his popcorn flick,** DEAD AGAIN**!  The success of both of those films meant he could take on any project he wanted.  He chose **MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN**.  He would return to direct and star as Victor Frankenstein.  He would bring along many of his friends including Patrick Doyle to add another aggressive and bombastic score. Because of his newfound clout, he was able to bring in Oscar winning screenwriter Frank Darabont (**THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION**, **CRASH**).  Maybe his greatest display of the young directors status was bringing in Robert DeNiro to portray the creature!  The resulting film with all of this incredible talent is...

_silly._

I didn't have any good memories of the film in theaters in 1994.  Especially awkward was DeNiro's creature spinning toward the camera and yelling _""Frankenstein!!!""_ which brought nothing but laughter from the crowd.  I hoped my re-watch in 2022 would bring me a new perspective.  While there were there things I noticed that I now appreciated, the flick is still silly. 

It must be said that Branagh's vision for the film is strong and clear.  Darabont's script is very clever and multi-faceted.  The music is excellent wall to wall support and some of the performances are noteworthy.  Unfortunately, much of the subtlety in Darabont's script is lost in the big, loud film.  Branagh's decision to showcase the birth of the creature as quasi-erotic is interesting, shirtless and sweating under firelight.  His decision to have the brilliant doctor, when exposing his feelings of guilt, loses his ability to speech clearly and seems to mimic the creatures meter.  We get it... who is actually the monster? Again, clear but over-the-top. Mostly missing are moments of circumspection and quiet.

With its big budget and generally beautiful lighting and cinematography, it would seem this would be the type of bad movie that is fun to watch.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work on that level either, as the film bounces between high art pretentiousness and lowest of gross out humor.

I believe Branagh succeeded in getting his vision onto the screen and he has no reason to look down on his achievement. But as a big fan of his, I won't be with him with this monster."

Trouble is, King George is not well any more. In his head. What we can diagnose to be likely porphyria today, was simply madness back then.

The Madness of King George has its aspects of tragedy, family drama, intrigue, comedy; but always present are the reflections about politics, power, monarchy and what it is, can be, should be (and whether at all).

It presents itself as a period piece, but written as a theatre play in 1994, it is at the same time a contemporary deliberation, with some jibes and jokes about things which seem to never change... in the UK, at least.

Viewers in The Colonies might enjoy it as well.

I sure did, not least because of the great Nigel Hawthorne, who won the Best Leading Actor BAFTA for this, and plays Mr. King in a very touching way. The not-only-supporting cast is both well known, and gives excellent performances throughout.

Very much recommended, if the genre doesn't put you off. || A little like Keith Michell in ""Henry VIII and his Six Wives""; this was a role Nigel Hawthorne had perfected earlier (he won an Olivier award for the stage play) and so he took to the cinematic version like a duck to water. This telling of his ""madness"" is superb - ably reflecting the unpredictable and vacillating behaviour of the King in a plausible and engaging manner. Rupert Everett, Helen Mirren and Ian Holm lead a very capable supporting cast and the incorporation of Handel's wonderful, rousing, Georgian themes adds to this sumptuous, if at times a little overly theatrical, production."

Another Disney film from the 1990s that I and other reviewers evidently disagree on; an average rating of 2.2 on Letterboxd is very harsh, in my opinion. I found it charming and suitably acted.

However, that doesn't affect my overall feelings. Another thing I see mentioned is the Native American stuff, I don't think it's fair to say it's ""racist"" - insensitive? potentially - if anything, it mentions a few times the negative depictions; somewhat surprisingly, for a 1995 release anyway.

Nothing to say with Ed Harris,he did is best with very little to work with because we have to admit it that the Dad is a very flat and boring character.

The character of Anne Heche was supposed to be comic it was'nt instead you were wondering what the hell she was doing in that movie,the same go for Malcolm Mcdowell.

the film turns around the relationship between V and Frank which is well played by both Mickael and Melanie. Of course their is some annoying scenes with Frank's Friends and Heche/Macdowell but I think the film is what it was meant to be, a heart warming family film and I had quite a relaxing one hours and a half watching it. || _**Doesn’t deserve the bad rap**_

In the Ohio suburb of Middleton three boys gather their ‘milk money’ so they go to the nearby city, Cincinnati, and see a prostitute naked. One of the boys, Frank (Michael Patrick Carter), befriends the woman (Melanie Griffith) and wants her to meet his single dad (Ed Harris), a teacher who’s trying to save the nearby wetlands. Malcolm McDowell is on hand as a heavy while Anne Heche appears as a kept woman in the city. 

""Milk Money"" (1994) is a modern day fairy tale that’s part pubescent coming-of-age dramedy and part romantic-comedy. Critics reviled it, obviously because the subject matter made it an easy target but it has a lot of heart once you look beyond the prostitution component. For instance, Frank really just wants a caring mother, as well as a wife for his lonely, workaholic father who needs a good woman to rock his mundane world. The question is, can a call girl possibly be a ‘good woman’? In other words, is there redemption for a soiled sex worker and what is the key to that redemption? Not only is love the answer it’s also the element necessary for bringing out submerged love in the one being redeemed.

There’s also a lesson about objectifying a woman. The boys only see the prostitute as an object to appease their curiosity and blossoming lust, but soon discover she’s a human being with feelings and value beyond her body. Even more, the woman clearly wants OUT of the empty, repugnant lifestyle she fell into since she was 14; she craves love, wholesomeness and respect. Say what you will, but these are some heavy morals for a farce about some boys wanting to become men, a nice father concerned about the condemned wetlands and a pretty sex worker. 

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in Cincinnati, Ohio, including the Wheeler house and the school, while the ice cream parlor & town scenes were done in Lebanon, about a 20 minute drive northeast of the city. Some shots were also done in Pittsburgh.

A young lawyer (Christian Slater) defends an inmate of Alcatraz (Kevin Bacon) accused of murder in 1941, but argues that the cruel treatment in the notorious prison is what drove him to it. Gary Oldman plays the heartless Warden (technically associate Warden) while R. Lee Ermey is on hand as the judge.  

""Murder in the First"" (1995) is a prison/courtroom drama that says its “inspired by true events,” which means it’s NOT a biography of the real Henri Young, but rather uses Young’s basic story as a microcosm for unveiling several of Alcatraz’ dubious and inhumane doings during the 30s. Look up the real history after viewing the movie, yet not just Young’s story and the trial, but also the ‘Dungeon’ and how prisoners were treated in solitary confinement during the early years of that infamous ‘Rock.’

The movie successfully brings the viewer back to the 30s and early 40s, but the filmmakers laid it on too thick in regards to how ee-vil the prison authorities are, not to mention how supposedly innocent Young is (he wasn't), which smacks of agenda. But, like I said, Young _represented_ several issues/cases at Alcatraz, so it can be overlooked.

Nevertheless, this is cut from the same cloth as “The Shawshank Redemption,” the surprise hit from a year earlier (not that it was a hit at first, but it eventually became one). I’m not saying “Murder in the First” is as good but, if you liked “Shawshank,” you’ll probably appreciate it.

Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick and Mia Kirshner show up on the feminine front. Davidtz really shines in the biggest role of the three.  

The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in San Francisco & Alcatraz Island with the courtroom scenes done at Triscenic Production Services Inc. in Los Angeles area.

Paul Newman is effortlessly great in this, and he has a superb supporting cast. Jessica Tandy, Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis head up the ensemble cast. They even have a young Philip Seymour Hoffman, in my opinion one of the best actors ever at disappearing into a role.

Oliver Stone is not one of my favorite directors. What happens when he teams up with Quentin Tarantino? This. The script written by Tarantino is an authentic carnage that massacred not only a random number of extras but also popular culture.

Ever since the mass media appeared, alarmist and high-sounding voices have occasionally emerged to warn of the enormous dangers they pose. Over the decades, criticism has echoed around the appreciation for what is violent or has sexual connotations. I agree with some, if not most, of the criticisms, although I cannot accept people being considered stupid enough to start carrying out massacres or sexual orgies just because of what they see on certain TV shows. The vast majority of people do not allow themselves to be influenced in this way, and those who allow this already have, a priori, an imperative need for psychological support.

The film starts from this premise to create a bizarre story in which a terrible couple of killers, bloodthirsty and sadistic to an extreme point, end up being transformed into authentic “pop” superstars, with legions of fans, interviews and a public frenzy around them. their violent acts, and the heartless hunt that the police carry out against them. I appreciate the satirical tones given to the film, which shows a society where everything that in a normal world only deserves to be execrated is worshiped. However, by taking this path, it is part of the “problem” and is so extremely violent that it bothers any human being with a minimum of compassion.

Everything in this film has Tarantino's touch, implicit in a latent hysteria present in almost everything: the direction is raw, rude, the soundtrack is intrusive, and the editing uses brutal, fast cuts and scenes that an epileptic would not be able to handle, including sudden cuts of black-and-white films, TV news and other materials. The visual effects are of excellent quality, but eye-catching. The fast-paced action transforms the film into a race through a world of extreme violence, histrionic and unpleasant characters, and incessant noise. The dialogue is written to be shouted rather than spoken, and the heavy use of swear words may make some people's ears ring.

There is a very strong cast in this film that deserves to be highlighted for the superb work it gives to the audience. Woody Harrelson is convincing and appropriately sadistic in his role, which is one of the most brutal and impactful of his career to date, and Juliette Lewis, despite not being particularly “sexy” as required by the character, is believable, intelligent and pleasantly naughty. Robert Downey Jr., who was still far from the stardom he achieved in recent years, is truly devastating in the final part of the film and Tommy Lee Jones, an always competent veteran, is suitably crazy, as if he no longer has a sense of reality and had no fear of abusing the powers with which he was invested. Tom Sizemore ends up being the most restrained actor among those that the script most favored. || I am a little suspect to talk about of this one - was on my bucket list for ages and finally I could see the director's cult version of it. It simply wasn't anything that I was expecting... and it was way more. Normally this would be a 3 star max, but I took in account the movie editing and the 30y gap.

Maybe if I watched it 30y ago it would be a different sense - it deal with the over glorification of serial killers by (old - and now we have again that trend) media shows and that many serial killers have difficult family backgrounds  with child abuse (but not all turn to killers and ice-versa, I think the main dialog here is about mental disease in the family).

If no one said to me that it was Oliver Stone Behind the camera's simply I couldn't tell. It looked simply a Tarantino movie, and guess what? The screenplay was of him, and ""heavily"" (?!) edited by Oliver Stone.

Sorry for the fans but I am not one of the Tarantino Movies, they rely too much in violence and puns to hide little if any talent for screenplays. I expected way more of the screenplay after Oliver Stone revised it.

Some aspects of the movie can be said positive: the acting of the Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) as a modern version of Bonnie and Clyde and Robert Downey Jr. as the show presenter.

The cinematography by the talentful Robert Richardson (that works constantly with Tarantino, but with other huge names as Scorsese and Oliver Stone himself) is frenetic and psychedelic and so is the editing that is huge in between scenes, done by Hank Corwin and Brian Berdan (Tree of Life, Don't Look Up, Vice, etc) and the music score is perfect by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails (especially Cowboy Junkies ""Sweet Jane"" and Jane's Addiction ones).

Otherwise even the tone of violence is just comic by today standards - but the visual of the killer couple is very aesthetic and some scenes like the opeding and the wedding ones. 

I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.0 / B"

This was the first New Zealand film I saw, at least as far as I remember and am aware of that. It's a violent film, with a raw brutality that shocks us by how authentic it sounds. Domestic violence? Child rape? It's not something you only see in the movies. It's something you see in a newspaper. That's what shocks us the most: knowing it's something real. And I warn you now: there are violent films, but this one is really intense and shocking... a lot.

The film takes place in Auckland, in a poor suburb built by the State for people with very low incomes. There lives an overwhelmingly Maori population, apparently on the margins of Anglo-Saxon, white and elegant society. This country ceased to be a colony a long time ago but, as happens in many places in the world, the dominant ethnic group is still that of European descendants and there is a certain dominant racism. In the midst of this, this Maori population seems lost, aimless in the midst of vices and crime. Will that be reality? I don't know, but a quick search of some New Zealand newspapers indicates that the problem is real.

Lee Tamahori did a good job of preventing this film from becoming something it shouldn't be, that is, a tearful drama or an anti-racist manifesto that is no longer given the attention it deserves. Instead, the director starts from this base and makes a blunt and sincere affirmation of the importance of searching for cultural roots and the way in which this changes our way of being and our attitude in life. Why does Jake Heke do what he does? Because he cut all ties with his culture and roots after he ran away with his wife in order to get married. In doing so, he took refuge in violence. The children would also suffer from this, and only a reencounter with their roots can give them the guidance in life that they so badly need, and that they instinctively seek.

The film has excellent cinematography and visuals. Personally, I don't really like the graphics that were used for the opening and ending credits, I think they are out of character for the movie, but that's just my opinion. Discreet in the effects, soundtrack and sounds, it is a film that seeks to be effective but discreet, in order to give the story and the actors all the space to have our full attention. Even so, the settings are worth seeing, particularly the Heke house and the wrecked car where Toot, a homeless young man, lives.

The film has an excellent direction, screenplay and sets, but none of it would work well without competent actors. Rena Owen largely fulfills this requirement with a work worthy of being studied by aspiring actors. The actress is extraordinary, she does such a good job that it's hard to understand why the film wasn't considered, at least, for the Oscar for Best Actress (is it because she didn't have that week in Los Angeles that the Academy demands?) . The work of Temuera Morrison and Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell also deserves a note of praise."

She doesn’t care for any of these people except her brother. One day, she returns home from getting the groceries to find corrupt DEA agents have killed her entire family. Key amongst those agents is Stansfield, played by Gary Oldman. Seeking refuge in the flat of a neighbour she had befriended earlier, Léon (Jean Reno), she learns that he is a hitman. She makes a deal with him: she will look after the flat by doing the domestic chores if he will teach her how to get revenge on the men who killed her brother.

Strange though the synopsis may be, the relationship between Léon and Mathilda is kept innocent, and the scenes between the two are believable. Mathilda’s sexual awareness is at a nascent stage and her exposure to the sordid side of life with her recently deceased family (her step-father worked for drug-dealers) means she is perhaps not as innocent as most 12-year old girls; however, Léon is unwilling to take advantage of the situation. This means the story can focus on the platonic relationship between the two, the bond that develops between them, and how each affects the other’s life.

Although it may seem a little far-fetched that a young girl would accompany a hitman during his work, Léon ensures that her assistance is required only on fairly routine hits that follow a well-defined pattern. For the more complex hits he leaves her behind.

There is a thread of humour running through the film, but you must bear in mind the film is framed in the world of corruption and greed and all is not sweet and light, and graphic violence is depicted.

Jean Reno is wonderful as the extremely good but placid hitman, whose whole outlook on life is changed by the young Mathilda, played wonderfully by Natalie Portman in her first film. I’ve not read it, but I understand that Eppie has a similar effect on Silas Marner, as described in the book of the same name. I found Gary Oldman’s performance histrionic, the only let-down in the film, albeit not something that spoilt the film as a whole.

After a deadly incurable African virus is brought to a Northern California coastal town via a monkey the military moves in to quarantine the village. While Dustin Hoffman seeks to find an antidote, the two generals in charge of the quarantine (Morgan Freeman & Donald Sutherland) strangely decide to annihilate the town. Can Hoffman find a cure in time? And, even if he does, can he stop the firebombing?

Wolfgang Petersen's ""Outbreak"" (1995) is an outstanding drama/thriller, which I suppose you could designate as a disaster flick. Although viruses are so small they're invisible, they have the potential to be the biggest monsters of all. Certain deadly viruses, if let loose, can wipe out an entire town in a couple days. This is the scenario in ""Outbreak."" It COULD happen and is therefore realistic, which naturally makes the story more horrifying than most horror flicks or monster movies.

But ""Outbreak"" is more than just a scary what-if story, the second half involves a military cover-up and is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, all the way to the final minutes. It's like an avalanche that slowly builds momentum.

Cuba Gooding Jr. is also on hand in a significant role as Hoffman's partner in the race-against-time. And, for those who care, there's a romantic subplot about Hoffman’s character and his ex-wife, played by Rene Russo. Will they get back together?

The locations are magnificent, filmed in the coastal towns Eureka, Arcata and Ferndale, California, all in the extreme Northern part of the state, just south of the Redwoods and West of Bigfoot territory (i.e. Willow Creek). The African sequences were shot in Hawaii.

BOTTOM LINE: This is top-of-the-line cinema — equal parts scary, dramatic and suspenseful.

The film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.

GRADE: A- || I found this a far better disaster-scenario movie then most, as Dustin Hoffman plays a military doctor on the hunt for the source of a lethal virus that could potentially eradicate life in the USA in a matter of days. Hoffman has to convince his boss - Morgan Freeman and his boss Donald Sutherland that he is up to the job and after a few false leads is soon on the trail of an African monkey that may hold the solution. Denied sufficient resource from the Army, he enlists the help of ex-wife (and expert in disease control Rene Russo) to help him grapple with his predicament.The story is tautly delivered with Sutherland rather good as the slightly unhinged general whose almost ""nuke 'em"" strategy leads for an uncomfortably strained relationship with the scientist. There is a smattering of plausible science and plenty of action - Cuba Gooding Jr. is his sort of ""Mr. T"" sidekick and Kevin Spacey and Patrick Dempsey add a bit of collateral too. Given the April 2020 Covid-19 situation, ""Outbreak"" has an added poignancy as to just how simply these things could occur!"

RELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).

The lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.

I put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let ’em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God’s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn’t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.

Both Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).

BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with ""Pulp Fiction."" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.

GRADE: A || Insane movie! 
One of the bests(if not the best) Tarantino's movies! || Ving Rhames (""Wallace"") is the kingpin who provides the loosest of templates for a couple of inter-twining tales that are amusing, bizarre and sometimes down right dangerous before we get a sort of alignment at the conclusion. ""Winnfield"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and ""Vincent Vega"" (John Travolta) are a pair of dapper enforcers, despatched to retrieve a stolen briefcase. Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of ""Mr. Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel). ""Vega"" is also charged by his boss with looking after his cocaine-loving wife ""Mia"" (Uma Thurman) and that flirts with dancing and disaster too. Meantime, ageing boxer ""Butch"" (Bruce Willis) is supposed to help the boss by taking an early dive in a fight. Instead he manages to kill his opponent! Soon he is intent on fleeing town, well at least he tries before he and ""Wallace"" end up being the playthings of some interesting characters who keep their own leather-clad gimp locked in a box... It's really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between ""Mia"" and ""Vega"" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and his pal ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry. The dialogue is cleverly targeted, with wit and pith but also used sparingly when the first rate soundtrack is allowed to let everyone come up for air. Tarantino himself features towards the end as just about everybody gets their just desserts. This is a classy and sharp piece of enigmatic and enjoyable cinema held together well by a creative and visionary director who appreciates how to get the best of a cast that know how to entertain!"

Before I start writing my review, I think I should leave a note of personal context: I am a Catholic, a regular practitioner, and I live in a country where almost all the population also declares themselves Catholic, although with fluctuating regularity in the mass, a youth increasingly strange to faith and spirituality (or permeable to different ways of living it) and a growing number of foreign immigrants with other beliefs. Therefore, I see this film with the eyes of someone who belongs to the Church and who knows it deeply.

The film brings us a very intense and dramatic story where, after replacing another older priest, a reasonably orthodox and rigorist young priest is confronted with an older coadjutor who has radically different ideas. In addition to this ideological clash, the young priest will have to fight against his own homosexual impulses, ending up falling into temptation and disgrace with his superiors and community. In between, there is also an issue about the celibacy of one of these priests and another, involving a minor sexually abused by an incestuous father.

I can understand how uncomfortable this film was for Catholics in 1994. Even though the film was released thirty years ago, its story could not be more current. In 1994, the Church was still guided by John Paul II who, despite the merit of having traveled, faced complex political and social issues and opened the corridors of the Vatican to the world, was also ultra-conservative in moral matters. Today, Pope Francis invites us to adopt a more open and understanding position, as we see in his most recent encyclical, “Fiducia Supplicans”, where he invites the acceptance not only of homosexuals, but also of divorced and remarried people. Remembering the unifying role of the Church, where everyone must find a place to speak with God regardless of their sins, the Pope invites us not to condemn them, which does not mean that homosexual acts have ceased to be a sin in the eyes of the Church. What the Supreme Pontiff reminds us is that it is God who must judge sins, not us. Of course, there has been a lot of controversy around this, and if the Pope's words of tolerance can still scandalize the faithful and clergy today, imagine what this film would have done thirty years ago! In addition to this, we have the confrontation between pure orthodoxy and the socialist ideas of Liberation Theology, which in the 90s still existed among some theologians and priests in South America and some African countries, in addition to a strong “nip” at the issue of celibacy, mandatory for Catholic priests and increasingly contested, including by themselves, given its unnatural nature. Not being a moral or dogmatic issue, the Pope can change this rule whenever he wants, but Francis is not that liberal.

The script, as we can see, is very rich and raises very complicated questions, not only from an ecclesiastical point of view but also from a moral point of view. However, I felt that the film, by going off in so many directions, ended up not exploring any of them and focusing more on the “gay friendly” plot, which would be easier to sell at the box office. Remember that it was at this time that the homosexual movement took its first steps in Europe, imported from the United States. The second part of the film is particularly poorly done, with excessive melodrama and weak solutions to all the problems previously created.

Technically, the film is quite good: the cinematography is average, but the sets and costumes make up for it, as does the careful way in which the liturgy was recreated and staged. The pacing is pleasant, considering things as they are, and the nude scenes are reasonably tolerable in the context in which they are found. Linus Roache heads a strong and competent cast, and does a very worthy job. However, Tom Wilkinson seems stronger and more impactful, and steals the spotlight whenever they both work together. Cathy Tyson and Robert Carlyle give us good supporting performances. || “Fr. Greg” (Linus Roache) arrives at his new parish determined to look after the spiritual well-being of his flock in a more traditional sense than his fellow priest “Fr. Matthew” (Tom Wilkinson) who adopts a more user-friendly and free-thinking approach (especially with their housekeeper “Maria” (Cathy Tyson). Initially, there is a well-ordered conflict between the two men, but gradually an element of mutual respect creeps in which might prove useful for the new lad as it turns out that what he wears from the back of his wardrobe takes him into a life that isn’t exactly approved by his church. A meeting with “Graham” (Robert Carlyle) soon challenges his hitherto set-in-stone priorities and some subsequent police involvement leads to a reckoning with himself, his church and it’s congregation. Roache delivers well as his character has to try and reconcile his true self with that of his faith but I found Wilkinson to be the more impressive as a man who took a pragmatic view of teachings that hadn’t moved with the times, of hypocrisy, double-standards and naïveté. There’s also a rather disturbing sub-plot that gives us some indication of just how tough the job of being a confessor could be - and that’s well exemplified by the trio of Robert Pugh, Lesley Sharp and a poignant effort from Christine Tremarco as we head to a denouement that is quite thought-provoking in a 1990s where tolerance had little to do with legality, and where forgiveness, compassion and understanding could be in very short supply. It’s sparingly scripted, but there a few scenes where the punchy dialogue tests attitudes across the community and though it probably spends a little too long getting going, it’s cinema that rocks the boat a bit, and that’s a good thing."

The Western is a tough genre to tackle in the modern age, more so when it's post Dances With Wolves and  Unforgiven's masterclasses 101. But tackling both these challenges is nothing to the one which director Sam Raimi asks of the audience in his stab at the genre. 

A female gunslinger is here played by a Hollywood beauty, Sharon Stone, but she isn't right for the lead role. She obviously looks gorgeous and she broods and pouts better than most of her modern day peers, but she lacks a menacing streak, a bit of believable nastiness that just might have lifted the film to better heights. We understand and expect the vulnerability she shows, but to succeed here in the testosterone fuelled town of Redemption, she's going to have to convince as a tough gal. And Stone just isn't up to the task.

The film does have good points to enjoy though, very much so. The story, although gimmicky, works well as an entertaining popcorn munching tale, while the cast list reads like a whose who of solid and quality thespers,  (Gene Hackman wandering in from Unforgiven to play Little Bill's ghost, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DeCaprio, Keith David, Pat Hingle & Lance Henriksen). Also into the plus column is the always impressive cinematography from Dante Spinotti, and there is no denying Sam Raimi's keen eye for detail, with his zooming shots a real treat during the shoot out sequences - his Spaghetti Western leanings further enhanced by Alan Silvestri's pasta influenced score.

Yet in spite of this bravado attempt, and acknowledging that the makers have tried something different, The Quick & The Dead isn't quite quick enough on the draw to outlive the leading lady misstep. 6/10 || Now I saw this in the cinema in 1995 and had somehow managed to completely forget all about it - until I saw it again just last week and realised why. It's not that it is awful, it's just that it is so very derivative and very, very dependant on Gene Hackman (""Herod"") who walks a fine line between menace and ham in a none too convincing fashion. He is running a to-the-death gun slinging competition - almost like one of the chivalric jousts of old - with the winner having to face him in the final shoot-out for an huge poke. Sharon Stone (""Ellen"") arrives in his dingy town just at the start of the process determined to avenge her father's killer; Russell Crowe is ""Cort"", a preacher who also has a pretty violent past and ""the Kid"" (Leonardo di Caprio) who has the clear belief that his youth and skill make him all but immortal are all coaxed, cajoled and threatened into participating in this game of death. Sam Raimi has all the ingredients of a great little western adventure, but the cast don't work well together at all. Stone is well past her potent best and the usual guy-with-a-grudge theme is now so hackneyed as to render this little better than a series of gunfights with characters about whom I could not care less. The cinematography and some of the photographic styles are interesting, though - the film has a classy look to it and Alan Silvestri creates some tension with his slightly untypical (for a western) score; but the whole is nowhere near the sum of the parts leaving us with something that now, more than ever, just looks like it's been made for telly. || **_Mythic Western about a quick-draw contest in a town with an all-star cast_**

Sharon Stone stars as a grim, nonchalant woman who, curiously, enters a dueling contest in a remote Southwest desert town ""ruled"" by outlaw Herod (Gene Hackman). A pacifist preacher is forced by Herod to participate in the contest, but he ain't no conventional minister (Russell Crowe). Other notables include: Leonardo DiCaprio, Lance Henriksen, Tobin Bell, Keith David, Gary Sinise and Pat Hingle.

""The Quick and the Dead"" (1995) was co-produced by Stone and she was responsible for getting the youthful & skinny DiCaprio in the cast, she even paid his salary (?!). Stone also apprehended New Zealander Crowe with this being his first American feature. When dressed in her tight leather pants Sharon was unable to sit down (lol). Interestingly, she fired her hottie stand-in because she was getting more attention from the crew on set (!). She later confessed that Crowe was her favorite on screen kisser, but kissing DiCaprio was like kissing her arm (lol).

The tone is mythic in the manner of those spaghetti Westerns of the 60s, but with superior production values and obviously seminal to Tarantino Westerns (""Django Unchained"" and ""The Hateful Eight""). While the vibe isn't exactly realistic, the cast members take the material seriously and ham it up with gusto. You can tell they all had a great time. The movie's town bound and comic booky with larger-than-life characters, but it's not campy or comedic, although it's somewhat silly.

The film's title is presumably taken from 1 Peter 4:5 of the KJV translation of the Bible, which details how Christ ""is ready to judge the quick and the dead."" The phrase also appears in the Apostle's Creed with the same meaning. In both cases 'quick' is an Old English term for ""living."" The movie's title clearly plays off both the modern and archaic meanings in that there are two kinds of gunfighters in the Old West: those who are quick (that is, fast and alive) and those who are dead.

It runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot completely in Arizona (including Old Tucson).

This is the last film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's “trilogy of colors”, and focuses on the unusual friendship between a young and beautiful catwalk model and an elderly retired judge who entertains himself by listening, illegally and without no one knows, the telephone conversations of the neighbors. Why? Out of sheer cynicism. He is a man alone, bitter and unhappy. What follows is a trip in which both characters will go through very similar situations.

The film continues to have notable points in terms of cinematography, sets and costumes. As in the previous films, the title color is present in all scenes and is persistently part of the sets and props. Despite being elegant, the music is intense, almost a prop for the scene, and contributes to the overall harmony of the work. As in the previous films, the duo of central actors is responsible for an interpretive tour de force, which is absorbing and impressive: Irene Jacob is an excellent actress, but it turns out to be Jean-Louis Trintignant who stands out the most.

The script is quite interesting, for the way it explores the cynicism of the judge's character, and for the way it addresses interpersonal relationships, the honesty and sincerity of love and relationships, the application of the law and the moral and philosophical consequences of judgments. humans. There are some details that are a little unbelievable, like how the judge's character evolves from someone resentful and intractable to a more human person in a short period of time. However, it is a film that is really worth it. || Aspiring model ""Valentine"" (Irène Jacob) is driving home one evening when she runs over a dog. Luckily, it's not seriously injured and after a trip to the vet she repatriates it with the ""Judge"" (Jean-Louis Trintignant).

He listens into all the private conversations of his neighbours, records their chats and their peccadillos - all of which is, of course, illegal. Caught between her disgust at his behaviour and her gradually developing affection for the man (and the dog) she finds herself in a bit of a catch-22 scenario. How will that play out when someone reports him to the gendarmerie and his own court appearance looms? Their's is not the only relationship we see here, and using ""Valentine"" as a conduit, we are exposed to a couple of other people whose issues with loyalty, trust - and fidelity - are there for us to observe and to challenge. Of the three of these entertaining Kieslowski films, I probably preferred ""White"" - but this is a close run thing. This is quickly paced with humour and pith in the writing and featuring a strong and amiable performance from an on-form Jacob. I did not love the conclusion - even if it did serve to pull the threads together with the previous two films, but if you can see all together in one (marathon) go then I think you cannot fail but to be entertained in a thought-provoking fashion by these stand-alone but interconnected themes of humanity and personality."
108.0,Three Colors: Blue,"The wife of a famous composer survives a car accident that kills her husband and daughter.

It took me three tries to get through this movie in its entirety. As someone who is currently going through a very difficult grieving process, it was particularly hard for me to watch the film.

It all starts with a serious car accident where the main character, July, loses her husband and daughter. She, like myself, feels a need to escape, to isolate herself from others, and she almost annuls herself by not bearing the pain and absence of her lost family. As the film is a kind of metaphor around the concept of freedom, to what extent is it liberating to have these attitudes? I sincerely do not know. As much as we run away, our pains don't stop confronting us, we never stop being who we are.

In the midst of all this, the film also launches considerations on the hopes and paths of the European Union project through the troubled completion of a symphony, commissioned by the Union and left incomplete upon the death of July's husband, who was its composer.

I didn't know the director Krzysztof Kieslowski, and I believe that few people will. He is one of the directors who never leaves the festival circuit due to his enormous erudition. I don't believe, in fact, that he made films of a more commercial nature. This film won't please everyone, being relatively indigestible and uncomfortable, cold and depressing like the color that gives it its name. The cinematography is very talented, it is full of artistic resources, frames of great visual value and beauty, cold colors where blue predominates and is omnipresent in almost the entire work.

We cannot fail to highlight the excellent interpretive performance given here by Juliette Binoche, in one of the most intense, poignant and strong cinematographic works of her career as an actress. Benoit Regent and Charlotte Véry didn't do a bad job either, and each in their own way give a very important support to Binoche's work, but it is the main actress who, due to her enormous merit, sustains the film and really plays.

I didn't want to stop writing a few lines about the soundtrack of this film: the film is not particularly sound, as the insertion of music is quite punctual, thought out and meticulously articulated with what we are seeing. And instead of using several melodies, or ordering a vast array of incidental pieces, the film uses only one song, which is called “Song for the Unification of Europe” and was composed by Zbigniew Preisner. Made in the period after the Treaty of Maastricht, the film is very ""Europeist"", which is ironic given the prevailing Euroscepticism nowadays, thirty years later. || Juliette Binoche is on fine form here as ""Julie"". She is driving her composer husband and their daughter along a country road when - next thing they have an encounter with a tree. Now the audience can expect this - we are shown the leaky brake fluid at the start, but we are not necessarily prepared for what is to come as she has to reconcile her own injuries and the difficulties (and opportunities) of her new life. That involves her taking herself deep into the anonymity of Paris - but she is soon to realise that her need for much desired isolation is not reciprocated by her friend who have no intention of letting her disappear under a rock. Things truly come to an head when she re-encounters old flame ""Olivier"" (Benoît Régent) and there might just be light at the end of her tunnel? It is quite an observational piece of work, this, and Binoche is well capable of demonstrating just how the trauma and drama of this incident and of her subsequent choices impacts on the character - a reaction that could resonate with many, I suspect. The dialogue is sparing and the pace of this rather potent depiction of grief and it's consequences moves in a measured fashion with no obvious conclusion to draw upon. The supporting cast do exactly that, they provide brief moments for us to recalibrate and adjust as ""Julie"" herself has to adapt, and though I could have been doing with just a little humour to relax the plot at times, it's still a great example of a well considered story and an actor at the top of her game."

Of the three films in Krzysztof Kieslowski's “color trilogy”, this is perhaps the closest to comedy. The plot begins with a couple's divorce: he is Polish and went to France because of her, who is French. Both got married, set up a common life, but the truth is that the couple's sex life is nil, he is not capable of consummating the act. He's not impotent, he's not homosexual, he just seems intimidated by the moment. Not satisfied with that, she keeps the goods, takes everything from her misfortunate ex-husband and threatens him. Living on the street, with no money and no life prospects, he decides to return to Warsaw in his own suitcase. After a while, he is a rich man. He's not an honest man, he didn't make his money in the most innocent way, but the movie ignores the morality around that. It's time to make the little Frenchy pay for what she did to him, and pay dearly.

Let's go first to the points that I liked the most about this film: on a technical level, it's an impeccable work of art. The director is meticulous, he thinks of the smallest details and wants everything the way he envisioned it. The color white is omnipresent throughout the film, as it was in “Blue”. The cinematography is remarkable, and the construction of the sets and costumes is quite good. Despite being elegant, the music really accentuates the dark comic vein of the film, which works very well. The work of the two main actors, Zbigniew Zamachowski and Julie Delpy, is also very good. He, however, gains more visibility not only for being the protagonist, but for the very ironic and pleasantly funny way in which the character was developed. Delpy's role is not as rich, nor as interesting, but the actress manages herself well.

The biggest problem I had with this film is the near-absolute unlikelihood of the script. In addition to the protagonist making money very easily without apparently any problems or harmful consequences, he is very much torn between love and revenge. On the one hand, it's obvious that he's never forgotten his ex-wife, that he loves her, despite all the bad things she's done and all the difficult situations he's been through to him because of her actions. He just doesn't seem to be able to hate her. On the other hand, he hates her enough to make her pay for everything, and in a very original way. What are we left with? Revenge without hate? || This is my favourite of the Kieslowski trilogy - even if it might make you wonder about the efficiency of airport security in future! It all centres around ""Karol Karol"" (Zbigniew Zamachowski) who is facing divorce from his glamorous wife (Julie Delpy) - on the grounds of non-consummation - and that is going to reduce him to poverty. Luckily, on the Metro platform, he encounters ""Mikolaj"" (Janusz Gajos) and the two concoct a plan to smuggle him back to his native Poland where he can make his fortune (maybe) and get some revenge on his wife. His journey doesn't quite go to plan, but he eventually manages to get a job working security and when he overhears the plans of his bosses to buy up some land, he jumps the gun and is soon on the road to riches.... It's funny, this film. Not in a ha-ha sort of fashion, but the writing and the characterisations create an enjoyable series of scenarios - some, admittedly, less plausible than others - as the adaptable and quick-thinking ""Karol"" carefully plots his vengeance. The supporting cast deliver well - his hairdressing cousin ""Jurek"" frequently stealing his scenes but not in a way we might expect. Short and sweet and well worth a watch."

The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10 || Make way for the best film ever made people. **Make way.**"

...Forgetting, of course, that their god enslaved them all.

I am further to the left than most people I've met and...I just don't buy that this has ANYTHING to do with politics.

I think this flick was pitched as ""Indiana Jones meets Star Wars"" and I am 100% certain that it was made to be Indiana Jones Meets Star Wars.

And of course they can't name it that so they called it ""Stargate"" And I am going to review it like it was meant to be reviewed.

This film is Indiana Jones meets Star Wars. It was made to be a hit, in fact, it should have been a far bigger hit than it turned out to be.

I mean, just the concept makes me want to watch it all over again...It's the same concept as ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" except they remembered that Indiana Jones has no place in the world of Aliens.

In fact I would have even loved the TV show if, you know, all the Alien worlds they visited didn't look a lot like Canada.

All you have here is a really fun action adventure sci-fi movie that doesn't try to make any statements. It is just fun.

Stop putting politics into pulp trash. || Ok, this movie is pretty dated compared to modern sci-fi movies, but try to keep in mind it was first released back in 1994.

There is no reason to put yourself through the plodding pretentiousness of _The Specialist_ unless you, like I was, are on some sort of quest to watch the entire 80s-90s Stallone filography.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || _**Explosive comic book crime thriller with Stallone, Stone and Woods**_

An ex-CIA demolitions expert (Sylvester Stallone) is hired by a grim beauty in Miami (Sharon Stone) to take out the mobsters who murdered her parents when she was a girl. Rod Steiger and Eric Roberts play high society gangsters while James Woods is on hand as the specialist’s rival, who works for the mob.  

""The Specialist"" (1994) is a competent Stallone action flick set in Miami, albeit seriously comic booky with Woods really hamming it up; Roberts too, to a lesser degree. 

Stallone was 47 during shooting and in exceptional shape. Not that I care, but he and Stone are shown totally nude in a shower scene (in a tasteful way). She looked great at 35, but this flick doesn’t beat “King Solomon’s Mines” (1985) where Sharon’s shorts kept getting shorter as the story progressed. Her character in that film wasn’t ultra-bitter as she is in this one; she was all-around vibrant.  

It’s kind of glaring, but the movie borrowed music from the 80’s Bond films; obviously the producers wanted that vibe. While it lacks the globetrotting of 007, it’s basically a mix of 80’s Bond and “The Punisher” (1989). 

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes and was shot in the Miami area, Florida, with the opening done at Great Falls Dam, Rock Island, Tennessee. 

GRADE: B-/C+ || Decent action can't overcome thin characters plus Stallone and Stone didn't have much chemistry together. At the very least James Woods, once again, goes over-the-top as the villain so he was entertaining. **2.75/5**"

Identity is the crisis can't you see - X-Ray Spex 1978

Suture is an unusual film that on the surface hangs its chief premise on a most ridiculous concept. Yet what is most striking about the film's heart and soul is that it embraces a number of staple film noir narrative threads. Photographed in spanking monochrome, and featuring an unnerving musical score, this surreal like play works with a cheeky glint in its eye as it challenges the viewer's perception of the unfurling story.

Wrapped around a suggested agony of identity, Suture revels in films and styles of film making it is influenced by. Name checking them all is folly, but as the amnesia angle blends with surgical reconstruction, and the murder plot betrayal sidles up to the voiceover, other potent pics spring instantly to mind. And yet in a piece heavy on identity, Suture, in spite of its reliance on influences, does have its own identity, very much so.

It's quite a debut from McGehee and Siegel, one that begs the question of why they didn't go on to greater things? Here they have great camera craft, with close ups, overheads and frame blends in action, while there's some striking imagery and noirville shadow play to take in as mood setting accompaniments. It could be argued that much of it is highfalutin, and that the philosophical probing is overkill, but the film remains unique and intriguing, if not as remotely thrilling as one hoped. 7/10"
9905.0,Shallow Grave,"When David, Juliet, and Alex find their new roommate dead with a large sum of money, they agree to hide the body and keep the cash. However, this newfound fortune gradually corrodes their friendship.",What's a little murder among friends?,"Crime, Thriller",93,1994-12-22,en,7.0,1054,1.2812,"Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston, Ewan McGregor, Ken Stott, Keith Allen",Danny Boyle,"distrust, scotland, roommates, overdose, dark comedy, edinburgh, scotland, money, shallow grave, exploitation of friendship, neo-noir, grim, mischievous, cautionary, absurd, tense, witty, friendship comedy, ambiguous, dubious, wry, boundaries of friendship","**An interesting film, with qualities, but it could be much better.**

I think that, at this point, anyone who reasonably knows cinema already knows that Danny Boyle's films are not for all audiences. Perhaps “Slumdog Millionaire” is his most commercial film, capable of reaching more easily the general public, but we only need to think about “Trainspotting” to get an idea of how raw and intense he can be as a filmmaker. He seems to enjoy it, and there's no denying that there's a niche audience for these films.

The script takes us to Edinburgh, to the apartment where three young friends live. As often happens among impoverished youth, they divide the rent between them so that they can remain there, and they are looking for a fourth companion because there is still space for another roommate. However, after about a week, the guy they have chosen is found dead next to a huge suitcase full of money. And they are left in a dilemma: should they call the police and tell them everything? After all, they didn't kill him! Or would it be better to hide the body somewhere and keep the money? They really need it… is it worth it?

As you can see, the film explores the themes of greed and pettiness, friendship and the way in which something can transform the way people relate, putting an end to friendships and leading to brutal paranoia that feeds on the unconfessable fears of each one. There's something that reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock here. I believe this would be enough for the film to be interesting, but Boyle added a subplot where a group of criminals knows about the money and are looking for it, leaving a trail of bodies wherever they go. The film didn't need this, and it would have been better to invest in the central plot.

The biggest problem with this film is that it is not beautiful nor does it have likable characters. On the contrary! They are petty, cynical, unsympathetic and their friendship seems artificial, forced by circumstances. However, this is exactly what the film could explore to the limit. It tries to do so, the tension gradually increases as this happens, but the sub-plot I mentioned introduces itself blatantly and ruins things a bit.

In the cast, Chris Eccleston and Ewan McGregor stand out with inspired and slightly insane performances. Their characters called for this expansiveness and both knew how to rise to the challenge, although they sometimes exaggerated. Kerry Fox is not that good and just exaggerates. Boyle has style, but he is not a director skilled at guiding his cast. In addition, we have Keith Allen, who has very little to do, and Ken Stott, relegated to a secondary position and of no great interest to the plot.

Technically, the film has frankly positive notes: the set is very well-thought-out, with the production looking for every means to cope with the Franciscan poverty of its budget. The cinematography is good, but not enchanting, and the camera work has its moments of creative inspiration, with original perspectives and some unusual framings. The fast pace reasonably covers up the weaknesses, making the film more fun and palatable. The ending is an effort, but the twist was predictable. || Three flatmates are having some fun recruiting a fourth to share their spacious Glasgow apartment. ""Juliet"" (Kerry Fox) is a doctor; ""Alex"" (Ewan McGregor) is a tabloid journalist and finally ""David"" (Christopher Eccleston) is an accountant. Despite their differences this trio quite effectively rub along together. It's the doc who first meets the enigmatic ""Hugo"" (Keith Allen) who convinces the gang - thanks largely to his large wad of cash - that he is their perfect fit. He disappears into his room and after a few days of radio silence, they have to break down the door for a vision of him dead on a bed with a suitcase full of loot underneath it! Should they call the police or should they do a bit of DIY body disposal and keep it all? That's the premiss as they take the latter route and find themselves amidst a series of increasingly perilous scenarios that will change them and their relationship for ever. Yes, it's totally far-fetched but the characters work well together as the simplicity of their ideal becomes compromised in a sea of mistrust, greed and kitchen knives. It's the understated Miller who steals this for me, and there's a fun contribution from Colin McCredie as their would be sharer ""Cameron"" and Ken Stott's policeman ""McCall"" who has a pretty quirky approach to policing. There are a few plot holes but they don't really matter as this amiably comedic assessment of human nature races along entertainingly for ninety minutes."

I can see WHY some don't like ""Generations"" (1994) or don't 'get' it: This seventh Star Trek film has some (false) plot holes and some things aren't spelled-out or explained very well (So what? Doesn't mystery intrinsically come with the territory of space adventure?); plus the story is a bit convoluted, particularly for those not familiar with Star Trek up to this point, both generations.

Regardless, ""Generations"" is ambitious, high-concept sci-fi of the highest order; it leaves the viewer with many interesting questions to ponder long afterwards. Although the Nexus has been criticized as a mere gimmick to get Kirk and Picard together, I find the concept utterly fascinating: No matter how much we want it, an illusory paradise is just that, an illusion. As far as I'm concerned, the concept of the Nexus and its implementation into the storyline is nothing short of brilliant. Who created the Nexus? Why, who else but the Talosians, the 'antagonists' of Trek's very first episode, ""The Cage""! Think about it.

Besides this, there are multiple highlights (some SPOILERS follow): The usual Trek humor, Data's amusing experiences with the emotion chip, Malcolm McDowell's outstanding performance as the Soran, his believable obsession and justifications, B'Etor & Lursa and their ""wild bunch"" Klingons, the startling obliteration of them and their vessel, the thrilling crash-landing of the Enterprise-D, the meeting of Kirk and Picard in the Nexus, the final showdown with Soran and Kirk's death. Needless to say, ""Generations"" does far more than offer mere juvenile space battles.

BIGGEST PLOT HOLE (OR MAYBE NOT): Picard's purpose in leaving the Nexus is to stop Soran from annihilating the Enerprise-D crew and the entire Veridian solar system, including the 230 million people that live on Veridian IV. Since Picard can leave the Nexus and ""go anywhere any time,"" as Guinan pointed out earlier, why go to Veridian III about A MINUTE before Soran launches his rocket? Why not go back to when Soran was a guest on the Enterprise-D and apprehend him then and there? Writer Ronald D. Moore defended Picard's decision on the grounds that he didn't want to risk the dangerous and unexpected consequences that can occur when tampering with the timeline; hence, his journey back in time from the Nexus is only a matter of a minute or so. It's a good explanation.

Speaking of explanations, some have criticized the fact that Guinan is simultaneously present in the real world and in the Nexus. How could this be? It's simple: It is repeatedly established that the reality experienced in the Nexus is not real; one experiences what they desire in the Nexus, not what is necessarily real. For instance, Picard has no children in the real world, but because he DESIRED to have them he was able to experience them in the Nexus. Hence, the 'Guinan' portrayed in the Nexus may walk, talk and act precisely like Guinan, but she's not real. She's only there because Picard desires her to be there for the purpose of explaining the nature of the Nexus. That said, many of the people in the Nexus are real, like Picard and Kirk. 

COMMENTARY ON THE NEXUS: Although the Nexus should simply be taken at face value as a strange space phenomenon (likely created by the Talosians), you can also regard it as an analogy. At first glance the viewer might get the impression that the Nexus is a type of heaven, but this can't be so since it is repeatedly emphasized in the film that the people and events experienced in the Nexus are NOT real (for the most part). 'Heaven,' a term theologians and ministers traditionally use to refer to the eternal abode of the redeemed (technically referred to as ""the new heavens and new earth"" in the bible, as shown in 2 Peter 3:13), is always depicted as real in the bible, not an illusory paradise. If the Nexus is not analogous of heaven, what could it be a type of? The Nexus corresponds to any addiction a person ""tastes"" and embraces to escape reality (e.g. pipe dreams, drugs, alcohol, computer games, TV, porn, fishing, shopping, golf, etc.). Some, like Soran, are unable to flee its clutches and waste their lives and talents OBSESSED by it. Others, like Picard and Kirk, are able to see the truth and escape; they therefore ""make a difference"" in real life.

BOTTOM LINE: This ""passing-of-the-torch"" installment requires an attention span and an appreciation for high-concept sci-fi; it will likely bore those for whom Star Trek only means neato spacecrafts and superficial space dogfights (don't get me wrong, they each have their place in Trek). ""Generations"" has the courage to make bold changes -- killing off an iconic character, and fairly prominent support characters as well, not to mention destroying the Enterprise-D. In short, ""Generations"" is science-fiction for grown-ups and youth with advanced cerebral development. All others should stick with juvenile space fantasy flicks (giggle).

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes.

GRADE: A || I'll be honest, I really hated Star Trek The Motion Picture. I mean, I REALLY hated it and I am a Star Trek fan...

... so it's sort of fitting that I hate Generations as well.

I mean, it doesn't do the first generation or the Next Generation justice at all does it? Kirk shouldn't have been in it. The OG Enterprise crew shouldn't have been in it.

It felt like it robbed TNG of their first outing on the big screen while insulting the original crew of the Enterprise. || I've seen this one a few times over the years and while not great and the plot was something akin to a two-part episode of TNG, I still was mildly entertained even if Malcolm McDowell's role was underdeveloped with us being told of his motivations with the death of his family versus being shown it via flashbacks. But the selling point was seeing the two iconic Captains together, even if only for 25-minutes. **3.0/5**"

It features a great ensemble cast who seem to mostly share a screen rapport. Leonardo DiCaprio previews his future star career with a stellar performance as the difficult Arnie.

I thought the scene where husband Mr. Carver comes home from work and obsesses over the burnt cookies and the unused swimming pool was silly and a bad fit for the film, especially consider what came after the scene. Meanwhile the two sisters were great characters: they were emotional when the situation called for it, but gave an even and restrained performance. I would have like to have seen more of them. || **A rather conventional and average family drama, where DiCaprio and Depp's performances turn out to be the only truly worthy note.**

Sometimes, what makes a film remarkable is the extraordinary performance of an actor, and that becomes even more admirable when that actor is extremely young. That's what we have in this film, a conventional family drama, where a young adult tries to live his life as normally as possible while having to take care of everyone around him, particularly his mother, who is morbidly obese and depressed, and his younger brother, who has a mental problem that the movie never really specifies.

In fact, I didn't find the script particularly interesting. Cinema is full of family dramas, and this one has nothing really new or fresh to add. And if the script doesn't seem remarkable to me, the production values ​​and technical aspects deserve even less attention, with the film betting on very conventional and average visuals, and a pace that sometimes slows down and falters, the result of an editing not always well executed.

What makes the film more interesting is the cast, which includes two young actors, then very promising, called Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. Depp is older than DiCaprio, and his career was relatively established when he agreed to star in this film. DiCaprio, on the other hand, was still an unknown young man and was beginning to emerge. However, the collaboration between them, in this film, is remarkable, and it seems that both knew how to get the best out of each other, to our benefit.

Although today we know Depp through a wide range of peculiar characters, what he did in this film is the complete opposite, and his character is one hundred percent ordinary, responsible, mature and strong. DiCaprio, however, stands out the most, even more than Depp. Playing a mentally disturbed teenager, DiCaprio had a lot of leeway to study and design the character and his mannerisms and tics. The result is truly credible and surprising.

Mary Steenburgen and Darlene Cates provide very effective support and give us the best female performances. In absolute counterpoint, Juliette Lewis doesn't have much to do, while Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt practically disappear when they're on the scene. || So, I had no idea who Leonardo was when I saw this back in the 90s, it was before Titanic, before he made it big, and I thought they hired an intellectually disabled man to play the part.

And it dropped in '93 so that would make Dicaprio about 19? Maybe 18 when they made it?

I doubt they would give an Oscar to a kid that young, but see that he's CLEARLY not Intellectually Disabled and how believable he was, well, that's probably one of the best performances I've seen. That was Oscar worthy.

Besides that, it was really a Johnny Depp vehicle... as much as a 90s indy film can be, and he played a calm, low key, and utterly charming role in a film about a man that had to maybe grow up too fast and deal with too much at too young an age.

And, of course, a charming little love story. A charming story about family. About loyalty.

There is honestly absolutely nothing to criticize here, except, it's certainly a 90s story, a 90s movie, and if you are removed from Gen-X, it might not have the appeal. This isn't the over-the-top FX sort of films that are a hallmark of the Millennial generation...

...but beyond that, KUDOS to Leo for nailing it as such a young age, and a cheers to everyone else involved for making a brilliant and entertaining hidden gem of a film"

This feels like a classic watch, like a movie that started a trope...but I can't think of a single other movie that did what this movie does.  Sure there are movies about comas, amnesia, lying, but they don't do it in the same way, and I honestly believe it's because this movie did it so well that no one wants to risk copying it and do worse.

This is also a great example of good situational comedy without bleeding over into abuse humor: at no point is she ""suffering"", she's not attacked, or wronged, but she's in a difficult situation that doesn't lend towards pleasantness in a ridiculous fashion, mostly because the family is insane, in the best of ways.

Every single actor in this really brings it too.  There are plenty of notable names, but as much as Sandra Bullock elevates the quiet, reserved character of Lucy, there are so many other good actors and characters throughout the movie, it feels extremely balanced, despite all the different story angles happening.

The other thing happening is that this is sort of a reverse mystery.  Instead of information that other characters know being hidden from the audience to be revealed later, the audience is almost the only one to know the truth until aspects are slowly revealed to the rest of the cast.

If you haven't see this yet, put it on your list, I promise it still holds up: even if there are no smart phones yet, you'll barely notice. || Insanely cheesy and overtly sentimental... yet, I kinda like 'While You Were Sleeping'.

Sandra Bullock is probably the main reason for the latter, as she gives a near perfect performance for this sorta role. The rest of the cast are good too, from Bill Pullman to Peter Gallagher to Jason Bernard. The story is paced finely, it's really just the strong cheese that brings the rating down for me. Still: 7/10.

It's the sixth Jon Turteltaub film that I've seen: I'd class each one as good. Reliable director! || **While You Were Sleeping is about more than just romance. It’s about finding family and, in this case, an adorable but crazy and entertaining family.**

While You Were Sleeping is a heartwarming romantic comedy with the lead falling in love with a quirky but sincere family as much as their charming son. The script isn’t perfect, with a couple of cliche and stereotypical rom-com moments, but the cast of goofy but not completely outrageous characters keep you engaged and want to see more of their antics. Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman are a fun couple to watch and laugh with, and the whole premise of the film presents plenty of fun moments of awkwardness to laugh at. While You Were Sleeping is a funny, heartfelt, and wholesome rom-com from the 90s that my parents watched 100 times while I was growing up, which was way too much, but I have to admit… it’s a good one."

While this is a trip in the way back machine, I think this going to remain a favorite of mine.

Akin to ""Back to the Future"", seeing what people thought the future would be 20 years ago is really interesting, and what's more is that we've pushed boundaries where something like this movie could happen.

We're probably still (2021) a ways away from digital silicone DNA, we're creating robots that are more and more life-capable and could have A.I. loaded into them to run a muck.

It's an interesting mix of sci-fi, action, and true crime style entertainment that I think should hold interest for most audiences. || Three Oscar winners- Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, and Louise Fletcher- are completely wasted in this high tech shoot-'em-up.

Parker Barnes (Denzel Washington) is a cop convicted of murder and serving time. He becomes a guinea pig in some virtual reality testing involving capturing SID 6.7, a computer combination of over 200 criminals. SID's evil programmer releases SID (Russell Crowe) into the real world, and Barnes is released long enough to track him down. He must also drag along Madison Carter (Kelly Lynch), who spends most of her screen time trying to keep up with Barnes. Barnes finds out SID is also programmed with the behavior of the man really responsible for Barnes' family's demise, making the entire thing ""personal."" Carter's daughter is kidnapped by SID, and the finale takes place during a live TV/internet broadcast in a high rise building.

Louise Fletcher is not given anything to do as an executive with the company that created SID. Crowe has the right physical look, but the screenwriter unwisely gave SID a bunch of unfunny one liners to utter during all the mayhem. A mass killer has not made this many stupid comments since the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" series. Washington, trying to corner the market on 1990's serial killer trackers (see also ""Fallen"" and ""The Bone Collector""), is okay as the killing cop. He tries to turn this into more than an action film, but his character is not there. Brett Leonard, of ""The Lawnmower Man"" and the bad ""Hideaway,"" finally finds another movie to use his trademark computer special effects in. The effects are okay, but are constantly undermined and drowned out by all the bloodshed. The screenwriter makes bad plot decisions just so he can move his story along, not because they make sense- SID's programmer releases SID because he is mad. SID can regenerate himself with glass, SID is not really drawn to any of the other real-life killers he has been programmed with, just the one Barnes has flashbacks about. I thought SID would be like a superhuman serial killer, leaving other real life killers' clues in his path, but we get a passing Charles Manson mention, and that is it.

There is more broken glass in this film than ""Another 48 HRS"", the previous broken glass film champion. Some fun almost comes in the climax, as Barnes pursues SID, and in turn is pursued by the cops for a crime SID framed him for. The film is ten minutes too long, as we must sit through Carter's daughter's scenes, which feels tacked on to the end. Yes, the computer effects are pretty good. Crowe is as good as he can be considering the script, but Leonard does not build any momentum in his direction. His camera is everywhere, but he wastes his talents on a screenplay that lumbers toward inevitability in every scene. In the climax, as SID takes over a TV broadcast to kill on the air, we see the viewership increase- one medium telling me how awful another medium is. I do not need a violent film to tell me there is too much violence on TV and the internet. That would be like a porn actress telling me women are used as sexual objects in strip clubs.

Take away all the bells and whistles, and carnage and explosions, and you have an average film dressed up with a good cast."

This has been one of the most beloved films among the transsexual community, even though it seems obvious to me that being a transvestite and transsexual are not identical things. A transvestite is anyone who wears clothing belonging to the opposite sex to look like that. A transsexual is anyone who believes that they should have been born with the opposite sex to the one they have, and who, not infrequently, begins to undergo medical treatments in order to achieve the physical appearance they desire. What do they have in common? Both are minorities of little expression within the “gay” movement and, despite being visible, they have demands that sometimes contradict those of the homosexual movement, leading to some internal friction.

None of this really matters, but it helps to understand why the group keeps this film on their favorites list. Filmed in Australia, it shows us the bumpy journey of a troupe of transvestites through the Australian desert to a remote town, where they are supposed to have some shows. The film has an intelligent script, where the adventures and misadventures of the trio intersect with other caricatured characters and, of course, with the intolerance and homophobia of isolated rural communities, where the “gay friendly” film takes the opportunity to make certain criticisms of these attitudes. Unfortunately, the film doesn't give us more than this, the characters are poorly developed and the feeling that remains is that of a project made to please a niche audience and not to tell a good story.

The cast has three strong names at the front who ensure consistent protagonism: Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce. The three actors are solid bets and do a very decent job with the material received, with Pearce, more extravagant and bizarre, being the one who least satisfies me. The character he offered us is a caricature and not a credible human figure. He is the one who purchases the tourist bus that will be used on the trip, and which he bizarrely names Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.

On a technical level, the film does not present great quality scores, for which it deserves special praise. With a couple of exceptions: the first is the design of the costumes worn in the film by the trio of main actors, full of bizarre details that allude to the world of the show; The second is the cinematography, very well conceived and crafted, and to which the exquisite choice of desert filming locations and, also, the good filming and lighting work largely contributed. || Drag queen ""Tick"" (Hugo Weaving) gets the offer of a gig in Alice Springs and suggests to fellow artiste ""Bernadette"" (Terence Stamp) that they both go. How to get there? Well that's where their headstrong young pal ""Felicia"" (Guy Pearce) comes in. He has no compunction in using a bit of emotional blackmail to extort cash from his mother. Next thing, the three have an old (soon to be pink) bus and are winging their way from Sydney at the start of their 1700 mile trip north. Like any trip in a confined space, tempers flare and these three, already near the top of the histrionics chart, provide us with some entertainingly profane language that make you smile and wince at the same time. As they travel, they tentatively explore more of each other's foibles and personalities as well as a terrain which isn't always the most hospitable. En route, they encounter ""Bob"" (Bill Hunter) who might just offer an hint of romance for the trans ""Bernadette"" who is suffering from a bit of ennui with life in general. Their eventual arrival tops a journey of discovery for all of them, but especially ""Tick"" who's in for quite a surprise! A great soundtrack and some earthy and witty writing help out enormously here, but it's essentially the three men whose ridiculously exaggerated characterisations and temper tantrums of an existence that make this a journey you'd love to watch but are very glad you're not actually on. There were a few popular films made that challenged the global stereotype of Australian machismo and bull-headedness but by taking this into the outback, this offers everyone a chance to contrast the open-mindedness of some with the opposite in others - all whilst keeping sight of the fact that this is a comedy, and a satirical and delightfully sarcastic one at that."

Jim Carrey is one of the great comic actors of the 90's, and this film is one of those that opened the doors of stardom for him. He already worked with comedy before, of course, as an actor and stand-up artist, and he took advantage of this background to build Ace, an animal detective with eccentric habits and manners.

In general, this type of comedy is not to my liking, but I have to recognize Carrey's enormous qualities and talent. In cooperation with director Tom Shadyac (I don't know if it was the first, but there were several throughout their career), the actor did a truly inspired job that gives the film all its strength and originality. Imagining this movie without Carrey is impossible. Sure, there's a lot of exaggeration, and the rest of the cast is driven to exaggerate, trying to keep up with the protagonist's bizarreness, but that's a minor problem, in my opinion.

The film also has good cinematography, which makes good use of the scenarios and chosen filming locations. The pace of the film is quite fast and the feeling that remains is that the film could have gone on longer and a lot of things would have been cut on the editor's table. For me, the great weakness of this film turns out to be the script, involving the sudden disappearance of the mascot of a baseball club – a dolphin. The strength of the protagonist actor and the originality of his character end up transforming the whole story into a detail without much force, a mere pretext for Carrey to do all that."

The third outing for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan - and the second with Harrison Ford in the lead - is a tightly constructed political thriller. Condensing Clancy's door stoppers is no easy task, but the makers here, headed by director Phillip Noyce, have manged to keep the pic brisk and intelligent for entertainment worth.

Plot essentially boils down to America's war on drugs and the Colombian cartel at the helm of such operations. Naturally all is a bit suspect in the American corridors of power, leading to corruption and abuse of power that puts Jack Ryan firmly at the front to sift and destroy the bad eggs staining the American Star Spangled Banner.

This very much plays out for those who like a bit of politico subterfuge, whist being ok with long passages of like minded chatter is also a requisite. That we have a fine cast playing out the screenplay (Donald E. Stewart, Steven Zaillian and John Milius) is a big plus that gives credibility to the shifty machinations.

There's a nagging annoyance throughout that this still should be a better film, especially given the overstretched run time of 2 hours 20 minutes, and the computer sections are dubious and the finale is something of a damp squib. However, we are in the company of great pros, both in front of and behind the camera - and also on the page (Clancy's brain superlative).

I hadn't seen it for about ten years and as the full moon came beaming through my apartment window late last night, it just felt right to indulge in some Proyas Gothic excellence. 

The question still taps away at all our doors, namely would the film be the cult classic it became without the Brandon Lee tragedy? That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord. 

The Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skilful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills. 

All told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10  || **The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2011.**

In the vein of films like _The Punisher_ and _Mad Max_, _The Crow_ first hit my screen only four years ago, way back when my DVD collection consisted of only about 40 films, (now it is around 500). I had $10 to my name but I was intent on expanding the thing, a girl I'd met only that day, suggested I buy it from Sanity, when there used to be one in Civic. Since that day, when I was well and truly blown away by it, we've always intended to make our tradition of ""Crow and Coffee"" (wherein you watch _The Crow_ and drink several litres of Ice Coffee & Bailey's) a repeated thing.

I feel as if this one should have been known to me for far longer than it has. It's quite a point of shame in the Goth community to have none been raised on the shit. And I can tell why. The film blends some of the most incredible bands out (The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Violent Femmes, Pantera), is filled with great actors, it's based on one of the best comics I've ever had the good fortune of reading, and it's overshadowed by the death of the actor playing lead protagonist Eric Draven, Brandon Lee, son of martial arts master Bruce Lee.

_The Crow_ is filled with the dark and ominous. Towards the end, Draven fights using a martial arts move that was performed in honour of Brandon Lee's father, Bruce Lee, when he used an identical style in _Enter the Dragon_, the last film his father ever starred in, before his untimely death. In another scene, Draven can be seen filling a gun-barrel up with metal, and shooting them out into a pawn shop, Brandon Lee was killed on set during filming, when a metal casing became lodged in a gun that was then expelled by a blank, fatally wounding Lee in the torso. Behind the scenes, on the first day of shooting a carpenter suffered sever burns on set after his crane hit power lines. Later, a grip truck caught fire, an angry sculpting employee crashed his car through the set's plaster shop and another member of the crew accidentally impaled his own hand with a screwdriver. According to the biography of Bruce Lee, Brandon's death was predicted by his father after awakening from a coma, he foresaw Brandon's death long before he had even considered taking up acting, supposedly.

By no accounts is _The Crow_ unpredictable, it's rather the opposite, but it makes up for this in so many ways! It notches up some of the best quotes in film history, as well as being badass, and yet so utterly convincingly emotional. There is essentially no demographic I can think of that wouldn't enjoy (at least a little) this dark film's gothic atmosphere, gritty hopelessness, world-changing special effects, riveting action, and well-deserved cult status.

-_Gimly_ || Well if you though it was wet on ""Blade Runner"" (1982) then welcome to a ruined city where the torrential rain never seems to stop. A series of flashbacks tells us that two graves hold the bodies of a young couple about to be married. That's before local kingpin ""Top Dollar"" (Michael Wincott), who had designs on their building, sent his henchmen to ""coax"" them out. A year after this tragedy a crow alights on the grave of ""Eric"" (Brandon Lee) and enlivens his corpse so that he may avenge the brutality visited on his fiancée and himself. What now ensues is a dark and menacing revenge thriller that, though fairly predictable, sees this former rock musician develop some astonishingly lethal ninja skills as he identifies and then rather entertainingly despatches a variety of drug dealing undesirables whilst retaining a sense of the decent by befriending local cop ""Albrecht"" (Ernie Hudson) and re-connecting with the young ""Sarah"" (Rochelle Davis) whose mother is another of the addicts in this dismal and hopeless city. It's the enigmatic ""Myca"" (Bai Ling) who spots the Achilles heel of our hero and so sets a scene with her menacing beau as ""Eric"" hones in on the final stage of a challenge that will hopefully allow him to return to his own grave in peace. Lee is really is in his element here and Alex Proyas and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski use the grim, sodden and ruined environment to depict as physical a corruption as the story does a societal one. What dialogue there is is largely left to an engaging contribution from Hudson, who has his own mini axe to grind with his police colleagues who saw him busted from detective for trying to investigate the activities of ""Dollar"" before. When you watch this film, you can't help but think on the number of other characterisations it has spawned, and it shows how revenge horror can work without resorting to endless special effects and jump-scenes. A cinema screening is best - a big dark room that makes you hear that relentless rain fall all around you."

While critics love to bash this live-action cinematic version of ""The Flintstones"" and the rating here at IMDb is surprisingly low, the movie was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because this is a great movie for what it is. Speaking of which, this explains why ""The Flintstones"" is such easy prey to incessant panning – it's a movie based on a cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, does it work for what it is and the answer is a resounding ""yes""! Movies should be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve. For instance, ""Godzilla"" is a colossal-creature movie and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original ""Apocalypse Now"" it's dreck, but how does it stack-up to other gigantic-monster movies? It's the same thing with ""The Flintstones."" 

Roger Ebert criticized the film on the grounds that ""the story is confusing, not very funny, and kind of odd, given the target audience of younger children and their families. Do kids really care much about office politics, embezzlement, marital problems, difficulties with adoption, aptitude exams and mothers-in-law?"" For one thing, the film IS funny if you're familiar with The Flintstones and, more so, if you're a fan, which I am. I've seen the movie four times now and, without exception, laughed from beginning to end. Now the laughs may be more giggling at silly humor than uproarious laughter, but laughing nonetheless. 

As for the criticism that the story's confusing and misses the supposed target audience because of adult-oriented elements, this just shows that the ""target audience"" wasn't just kids. ""The Flintstones"" is for kids AND adults equally, which was true of the original cartoon as well, but more so with the movie, and I'm glad. The live-action version of ""Dudley Do-Right"" (1999) made the mistake of aiming solely for kids – real little kids -- and it seriously bombed and justifiably so because it's a complete dud. It's impossible to watch that movie as an adult and stay interested. ""The Flintstones"" doesn't make this mistake and that's why it was such a hit and remains thoroughly entertaining to this day.

The cast is great, even Rosie O'Donnell as Betty (who I didn't think would work), but John Goodman as Fred is so good it's like the cartoon come to life! Furthermore, the sets and F/X are top-of-the line and surprisingly hold up to this day. In addition, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.

The bottom line is that ""The Flintstones"" is entertaining from beginning to end for all the reasons noted above and it wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.

The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Sun Valley, California, and Snow Canyon State Park, Utah.

Hugh Grant is the best thing about <em>'Four Weddings and a Funeral'</em>, he gives an amusing performance. The plot is obvious and speaks for itself, it does lead to a few interesting shenanigans. Some of the dialogue is iffy, as is some of the editing though.

None of the cast behind Grant stood out to me, with the exception of Rowan Atkinson; but that's only down to how well known he is in general, as here he is underused. I found Andie MacDowell's performance very wooden. I appreciate them not going the obvious route with Kristin Scott Thomas' character, even if it makes her Fiona redundant throughout.

Just about serviceable, worth watching if only once. || Whilst this largely centres around the persona of ""Charles"" (Hugh Grant) it's really more the compendium of characters that makes this comedy work well. He is late for the first of the weddings, but that doesn't really matter except it's where he first espies ""Carrie"" (Andi MacDowell). A one night stand ensues and both seem to like the other, but nothing comes of it and we proceed to the next wedding, then the next. It's this third one that turns out to be her's - to a laird a little older than she. ""Charles"" is crestfallen but what to do? Might it be best to settle for someone else - even is she's not the one? Richard Curtis has written a gem of a comedy here, allowing a slew of characterful personalities to slot into the life of ""Charles"". The underused, brightly waist-coated, Simon Callow is probably my favourite. He and boyfriend ""Matthew"" (John Hannah) have an habit of exposing the more preposterous and yukkie sides of the wedding; the twee folk singers and the guests who overdo the free bar or think they are god's gift. Indeed, as much of this takes a swing at the whole symbolism and ceremony of marriage as it plays on the foibles and flaws of ""Charles"" and his friends. Rowan Atkinson's bumbling vicar ""Gerald"" has the pews in hysterics and Charlotte Coleman is great as the maybe a bit too frank ""Scarlett"". It pieces together a bit to serendipitously and I maybe don't need to hear the Wet Wet Wet song again any time soon, but it showcases a range British acting talent in an amiable and enjoyable fashion for two hours."

That's where he meets ""Lt.

Soon on the American ping-pong squad in China, he manages to get an endorsement that allows him to reunite with the hippified, now paraplegic and disillusioned ""Lt.

""Jenny"" (Robin Wright). They've been friends since childhood, but she has a wandering spirit and though his love was requited, it wasn't what he needed. Might there be a future for them, ever? Robert Zemeckis uses a chronology of events in the USA, starting in the 1950s, to create a template for the story of a man who lived through racial tension, war, bullying and emerged the stronger; the more honourable and despite his low IQ was quite capable of putting those more intellectual around him to shame. The photography that cleverly superimposes him into television broadcasts works entertainingly as he gazes bemusedly out onto a audience that is increasingly warming to him. I will admit, I struggled a bit with the running segment towards the end, but Hanks epitomises determination and integrity with Eric Roth's adaptation of the Groom novel allowing plenty of philosophical food for thought whilst having a laugh at scenarios both serious and ridiculous. Like life itself, this film is like a box of chocolates and though I didn't love them all, there were plenty to enjoy and reflect upon."

I wasn't sure what to expect from this 1994 version of <em>'The Jungle Book'</em>, though I'm pleased to say it exceeded my expectations. It's a very different telling of Rudyard Kipling's work from what I've previously seen, which actually gives it a fresher feel. If we're comparing film adaptations, the 2016 remake is the better film.

I still thoroughly enjoyed this one though. I liked the switch-up of events, while the death scenes are excellent. Cast-wise it's strong, with Jason Scott Lee (Mowgli), Cary Elwes (William), Lena Headey (Katherine), Sam Neill (Geoffrey) and John Cleese (Julius) all appearing. Lee and Elwes are the standouts, but I rate all five of them.

The score is mostly alright, but some moments of it are superb; one part in particular reminded me, somewhat randomly, of television's <em>'The Crown'</em>. There are a few things that I can understand being deemed as downsides, those include the silent animals (voices wouldn't have worked here, imo) and obvious nature of the plot.

Pleasant film, one of the best adaptations of TJB that I've seen. || _**Mowgli Jones of the Jungle**_

From 1887 to the turn of the century a boy is raised by wolves in the jungles of India where Shere Khan the tiger dwells and threatens. With assistance from Baloo the bear and Bagheera the black panther, Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee) learns the ""Law of the Jungle” before going back to civilization and learning the strange ways and corruptions of humanity, as well as love. Sam Neill, Lena Headey, Cary Elwes and John Cleese are on hand.

""The Jungle Book"" (1994) mixes the sweet innocence of Rudyard Kipling's fables with “Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan” (1984) and Indiana Jones. Don’t expect talking animals as this is a relatively realistic adventure with some cute animal reactions, but not overdone. While I prefer “Greystoke” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” it’s at least on par with “Temple of Doom” and “The Last Crusade.” It needed more human interest to keep the attention of adults, but has enough I reckon.

Some people have complained that Jason Scott Lee was miscast, but it’s assumed Mowgli’s mother (whom we never see and died when he was born) was of Asian descent. Keep in mind that, geographically, Southeast Asia is right around the corner from the Indian subcontinent, not to mention Nepal/China to the north, and so mixed marriages weren’t exactly unheard of. Meanwhile Lee himself is a mix of Polynesian & Chinese blood. For the movie, making Mowgli part-Asian made him an outsider to both the British and the Indians, which works for me.

The beautiful Lena Headey does well in her role while Elwes is effective as the odious Brit snob. Lee, of course, kicks total axx while the live-action animals and spectacular locations are worth the price of admission. 

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in Jodhpur in northwestern India (scenes featuring monkeys and elephants), as well as Bombay (Mowgli's urban interaction scenes), Tennessee (Fall Creek Falls & Ozone Falls) and South Carolina (Fripp Island & nearby Beaufort).

So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!

I rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.

And I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.

During the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again!

The animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today.

The songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.

Nevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.

It’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.

Rating: A+ || Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son ""Simba"" born to the king ""Mufasa""; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend ""Nala"" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo ""Zazu"". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother ""Scar"" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - ""Nala"" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it."

It's been many, many years since I last watched <em>'The Mask'</em>, hence why I hadn't had it logged on here before now, and while it isn't as funny or as quotable as I thought it would be (I remember really liking it as a kid), there is still enough in there that I got much entertainment from.

Jim Carrey's performance is superb, without him you'd have a very cringe and ultimately disappointing flick. Interesting to note that he did this, <em>'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'</em> and <em>'Dumb and Dumber'</em> (which I gotta see at some point!) all in 1994 - quite the year! Peter Greene and Peter Riegert are also involved, though it's very much the debuting Cameron Diaz that is the best of the rest behind Carrey.

Apparently this had a sequel released in 2005, <em>'Son of the Mask'</em>. On paper it should be awful, so therefore I gotta go check it out! || Jim Carrey is the drippy bank-clerk ""Ipkiss"" who is always looking for love but who never seems to make much progress. Then one night he spots something floating in the river. Thinking it's a man, he goes to the rescue but it turns out to just be a mask that we know has recently been released from a locked casket deep beneath the waves. He takes it home, and whilst inspecting it soon realises that it can attach itself to his face and turn him into a suave and witty character (albeit with a bright green face) who has no difficulty exuding the charm. That's handy because we are now introduced to the charming ""Tina"" (Cameron Diaz) so maybe the mask can help him woo her? The thing about this mask, though, is that it has a mischievous streak - it's enables it's users desires both good and bad, too, and of course it isn't long before the police ""Kellaway"" (Peter Riegert) are on the case as the mask brings out the conflicting side of it's owner's personality and some trouble beckons. It's an adequate vehicle for Carrey and he owns the show from start to finish. He's charismatic and entertaining but I just never found him funny. His presentation of humour is just too brash and in your face. There's nothing remotely subtle or sophisticated about it, and though it is lively and really doesn't hang around at all, I found it just a bit too repetitious and after about twenty minutes it reminded me of ""Bugsy Malone"" (1976) only without the custard pies. Like Steve Martin, Jim Carrey's style of comedy just didn't hit the spot for me, and though this is certainly one of his better efforts and Diaz adds a star quality to the affair, it's all just a little too pantomime slick for me."
9359.0,Maverick,"Bret Maverick is a gambler who would rather con someone than fight them, and needs an additional $3k in order to enter a winner-takes-all poker game beginning in a few days.

And re-fried beans.

Maverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. 

After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos.

Nope, the Queen is not making another state visit - it's ""Rocco"" (Fred Ward) and it looks like he wants to save Chris Rock any future embarrassment by blowing up the Oscars ceremony. What now ensues is a by now routine sequence of frying pan to fire scenarios, straight out of a Laurel & Hardy film. Sadly, that humour is all a bit passé now and though an appearance by Anna Nicole Smith must have given every budding actress from Tallahassee to Timbuktu a sense of hope that if she can make it, they can - the rest of it falls pretty flat! It is well enough made, the quips are quickly delivered and some of them still raise the odd smile. In the main, though, it is 80 minutes that almost looks like out-takes from the first two films with a thinly constructed plot by way of a template to hold it all together. It is watchable, but just not a patch on the earlier iterations. || **A fitting end to one of the great comedy trilogies of the 90s.**

This is the third and final film in the “Naked Gun” trilogy. Throughout the film, one can smell farewell and conclusion, and it is undeniable that, among them, this is the weakest and least interesting. Even so, the film does what it needs to do to please its audience, who already know perfectly well what they are going to see and have a certain level of expectations. Although his style of humor may displease many people, we cannot deny that the three films were a notable success in the 80s and 90s, and that they had a major impact on Leslie Nielsen's filmography.

In fact, the strength of Nielsen's work and charisma is what makes the film work. Without him, or with another actor, nothing would make sense and the final product would have no value. Even so, we must also highlight the work developed by O. J. Simpson, Priscilla Presley and George Kennedy, actors who put a lot of effort into their respective roles and found, in this film, time and material to match their talent. In fact, compared to its predecessors – and in these cases comparisons are inevitable – I thought this film gave more space to the secondary actors and gained additional quality as a result.

It's not worth talking too much about the technical aspects, as this is a comical film that invests little in them and puts all its chips on humor and the main actor's performance. Even so, we can say that the film manages to maintain the quality that the trilogy has accustomed the public to. The script continues to be a problem, however, and is seen only as a vehicle for successive comic sequences and slapstick humor routines. || <em>'Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult'</em> is the weakest of the trilogy, though fair amusement is still produced.

Leslie Nielsen is so good in the lead role that I don't think it's really possible for these films to drag, at least alongside the decent gags and short run time. Admittedly this third entry does meander a tad, though my interest in events never waned into negative territory. The ending is the strongest part, that facepalm scene (which I knew of before) is gold.

Overall, this is a good franchise. I'm quite looking forward to hopefully checking out Liam Neeson in the 2025 remake, as long as the writing is suitable I think he can absolutely make it work."

A slick neo-noir that helped revive the genre. || All Roads Lead To Intrigue.

Red Rock West is directed by John Dahl who also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Rick. It stars Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, J. T. Walsh and Timothy Carhart. Music is by William Olvis and cinematography by Marc Reshovsky. 

When a promised job in Wyoming fails to materialise on account of an injury sustained in combat, Michael Williams (Cage) drifts into the town of Red Rock and is mistaken in a bar for a hit-man hired to kill an unfaithful wife. Tempted by the high cash on offer, Michael plays along and promptly finds himself in a web of intrigue from which escape is looking unlikely 

Welcome To Red Rock/You Are Now Leaving Red Rock. 

The studio didn't know what to do with it, a neo-noir flavoured with contemporary Western spices. Put out on cable in America and thriving on its limited release in Europe, it started to gain a cult fan-base. More so after a theatre in the Frisco Bay area started showing it and it made considerable coinage. Today it still remains more of a cult piece than anything else, which while it deserves more accolades and exposure, is still kind of nice for the fans, because it's like we have our own little neo-noir treasure all to ourselves. 

Red Rock West is essential for the neo-noir heads and well worthy of inspection by the average modern day crime film fan. Plot wise it's a bit, shall we say iffy? Yet the twists, turns and characterisations are so deftly constructed and performed, it matters not a jot. Cage's ex- marine is an honest and decent guy who whilst down on his luck - punished for his honesty - finds himself in a vortex of mystery and murder that he can't escape from. His companions in this scenario are film noir staples, the femme fatale (Boyle) with a smoulder as big as her secret, the hit-man (Hopper) with a glint in his eye to accompany his callous leanings, and the shifty bar owner (Walsh) trying to off his wife whilst keeping his shady cards close to his chest. 

As the tricksy plot unfolds in a haze of bad judgements and untruths, further pulsed by the vagaries of fate, it becomes apparent that Dahl wants us to know it isn't taking itself too seriously. There's a glorious scent of dark humour hanging in the air, an unpretentiousness about the whole thing that's refreshing. The look and feel is perfect for the narrative, the colour is stripped back to create a moody atmospheric surround, while the score and sound-tracking immediately brings to mind country and western tales of woe. Dahl knows his noir onions, but this is not just a homage hat tipper to the past, he understands what works in noir, be it the blending of the quirky with the edgy, or scene setting in locales such as a colourless bar and a foggy cemetery, Dahl gets the key ingredients right to deliver the goods wholesale. 

The small cast come up trumps. Boyle as Suzanne Brown is weak if her femme fatale is pitted against the likes of Matty Walker or Bridget Gregory, but it's an adequate performance that doesn't hinder the picture. She is helped enormously, though, by having to share most scenes with Cage who brings his ""A"" game. Consistently inconsistent throughout his career, Cage, when on form is a joy to watch, here he gets to thrive as a put upon hero, shifting seamlessly between confusion and boldness, where incredulous looks are the order of the day with a side order of eccentric intensity. Hopper does what he does so well, amusing villainy, while Walsh is effortlessly menacing and suspicious. In small secondary support Carhart and country star Dwight Yoakam leave favourable impressions. 

This is not an edge of your seat thriller, or a cranium bothering piece of dramedy, it's neo-noir done right. Where morality is grey at best and money is the root of all evil, it's slick, playful, cold blooded and absorbing. Hooray! 9/10"

Still, plenty of fun and seemed like Hopper was having a great time as a cackling, maniacal villain. **3.75/5** || _**Get off the bus!**_

A SWAT officer in Los Angeles (Keanu Reeves) tries to save the lives of people on a bus from a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has the vehicle rigged to blow up if it goes under 50 MPH. Sandra Bullock plays a passenger on the bus while Jeff Daniels is on hand as another SWAT officer.

""Speed"" (1994) is a disaster/action movie that delivers the goods as a thrilling popcorn flick. While it’s not great like “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991) it’s arguably on par with “Under Siege 2: Dark Territory” (1995). 

Although a top-of-the-line production, it lacks the human interest of “Terminator 2” and “Runaway Train” (1985) and the story is unbelievably contrived. But, if you can roll with it, it’s a dynamic blockbuster, just kinda forgettable in the grand scheme of things. 

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area, including Mojave Airport. 

GRADE: B- || For my money, this is Keanu Reeves' best (and hottest) performance. He is ""Jack"", an LAPD officer who finds himself embroiled in a bus-hostage situation. Not any ordinary kind of scenario, though - the bus is atop a bomb that will detonate if it slows below 50mph. He must track down the bus and figure out a way of ensuring, in a gridlocked and pedestrian-riddled LA, how to make sure it doesn't explode and how to evacuate the passengers. Luckily for him, Sandra Bullock (""Annie"") is on board so perhaps he has a fighting chance? We know from the start that it's explosive expert Dennis Hopper pulling all the strings - boy has he got a grudge - so the rest of LAPD (and his partner Jeff Daniels) have to try and track him down. Mark Mancina's score and some really intense action photography keep this gripping drama racing along really well with loads of (ok, pretty implausible) engineering acrobatics. The dynamic between Bullock and Reeves is effective, she plays her role really entertainingly too as it turns out the bus has it's fair share of quirky passengers too, and she ends up doing all the driving (without a driving licence!). Almost 30 years on, it hasn't really dated at all - indeed, there is an authenticity to the whole production that helps keep it enthralling all the way to an ending that sustains momentum really well."

And it's not because it isn't my type of movie either, Schwarzeneggar as a secret agent in an explosive 90s action movie is absolutely my jam. But I don't love _True Lies_, maybe I saw it too late in life (I was 25 the first time I saw the whole movie) and either I aged out of it or the movie aged out of society, but whatever the case, I just can't really understand why it's so beloved. I would never take it away from anyone, and there's absolutely stuff I like, but I can't really recommend it based on personal taste. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Cameron and Schwarzenegger team up again for a riot of an action movie.

True Lies sees Arnold Schwarzenegger play Harry Tasker, to his wife Helen (Jaimie Lee Curtis) and daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) he's a safe husband and father working as a computer salesman. Away from the family home he's a top spy for one of America's highest secret services. When Harry is prompted to believe that Helen is having an affair, it signals the start of a sequence of events that will out Harry and lead them both to a confrontation with a deadly terrorist. 

To hell with misogyny and stereotypical Arab terrorist (Art Malik so OTT he's off the chain man), Cameron's True Lies really isn't concerned for political correctness. His aim, aided by his on form cast, is to chase, caress and explode stuff whilst having a laugh at every turn. True Lies, if anyone was in doubt prior to its release, shows Cameron to be supremely gifted at action set pieces. No expense spared of course, but you still gotta utilise those Harrier Jets, helicopters and horse carrying elevators to great effect. And so it proves. Throw in a tremendously funny script that gives Tom Arnold & Bill Paxton comedy gold roles to revel in; and what you get is a Worldwide box office profit of nearly $264 million. 

It knows it's nonsense, but it's the good kind of nonsense that Hollywood has to offer. Ever re-watchable, True Lies is undeniably great fun. 7.5/10 || The zenith of Arnold's career... ""True Lies"" not only represents the singular moment in the actor's pre-governor acting career where he played more than a one dimensional action hero. In an homage to the secret agent genre, the film opens with an action / glamour set-piece that is more James Bond than a 21st century 007 film.  From there the story breaks into what would a few years later become the mold for numerous of Jackie Chan's ""goofy secret agent"" movies, although Chan would replace the cutting-edge CGI special effects set-pieces with a variety of more economical but just-as-exciting acrobatic, complex choreography hand-to-hand fights.  There is one mano-a-mano beat down scene where Arnold takes down his enemy by flushing his head in a urinal, complete with his attempt at a trade-mark one-liner: ""Cool Off"".  (It's a set piece worth comparing to the more recent scene in ""Mission Impossible: Fallout"".)  Along with that, it shifts smoothly back and forth from a rather straightforward super-spy/terrorist story line and exploring the practical troubles of living of the life of a secret agent while having a wife and kids.  This film also represents the movie that put Jamie Lee Curtis back on the map after a stint in a slew of flops following her role in ""A Fish Called Wanda"".  ""True Lies"" put her acting range on display and put to rest any lingering question of whether she was anything more than a scream queen.  One of the most hilarious moments she pulls off flawlessly is falling flat on her face while attempting to pole dance, and then getting getting back up and acting like it didn't happen.  Without her screen presence, the film would be just another entry in the list of Arnold action films scotched with a twist of comedy.  One could go so far as to conclude that the difference in the enduring appeal of ""True Lies"" vs. the mis-matched partner straight-man, funny-man film ""Red Heat"" is the degree to which Jamie Lee Curtis caries the fish-out-of-water funny-woman role in contrast to Jim Belushi's semi-funny, street-wise American cop. But, unlike the cold war, the regimented soviet style vs. the fast-and-lost American way, the contrast in ""True Lies"" derives from the ahead-of-it's time idea of adaptable, underrated woman and her somewhat over-inflated male counterpart.  When the secret agents attempt to arrest Curtis's character, she fights back fiercely, with a well placed nut-shot that made women and men alike erupt with cheers and laughter in theaters, something not so likely contemporary Hollywood's constant browbeating with girl power - male buffoonery film after film."

Take Wyatt Earp as a biopic and it is a superb and fair film. Compare it to Tombstone which was more of a Western and it's lacking the flair.

However, it ends abruptly, and it is miscast. Cosner (and i am a fan) doesn't really make a good Earp. Dennis Quaid who I am also a fan of, doesn't make a good Doc. This was 1994, in the 80s I might have a different opinion, but they both looked a bit old for their characters and the time.

However, I did like the parts of the Earp story that they added, I did lament the absence of Luke Short (who needs his own movie), and I liked how the story unfolded.

40480.0,Bad Company,"CIA operative Nelson Crowe is tasked with a deadly assignment: infiltrate a highly secret industrial espionage firm. Once inside, he teams with Margaret Wells, a master spy and seductive manipulator, in a plot to overthrow the organization's sinister president, which leads them into a darkly mysterious web of intrigue -- and shocking murder!",Bribery. Blackmail. Murder. Specialities of the house.,"Action, Crime, Romance, Thriller",108,1995-01-20,en,4.836,67,0.8837,"Laurence Fishburne, Ellen Barkin, Frank Langella, Michael Beach, David Ogden Stiers","Damian Harris, Ross Thomas","central intelligence agency (cia), judge, blackmail","Bad Company is basically the neo-noir version of Deep Cover, released three years earlier; both films star Laurence Fishburne (reminding us that his best work came before The Matrix) as an undercover agent who infiltrates a criminal organization on behalf of a federal agency , only to have the line between the two sides blur, if not downright disappear. 

The biggest difference between the two movies is that in Deep Cover the hero's inner conflict is what drives the plot, while Bad Company is all surface — which is exactly what a noir should be like. 

Former CIA agent Nelson Crowe (Fishburne) is hired by Vic Grimes (the ever-effective Frank Langella), who runs a company he calls ""The Tool Shed."" Grimes' firm employs people with intelligence backgrounds to sell their talents for extortion and corporate espionage to domestic and foreign corporations. Grimes's second-in-command, Margaret Wells (Ellen Barkin), begins working with Crowe and seduces him, luring him into a plot to assassinate Grimes so they can take over the company.

During a secret meeting, it’s revealed that Crowe is a CIA mole, albeit against his will. Crowe was fired from the agency on suspicion of stealing a $50,000 bribe intended for an Iraqi colonel. Crowe's former boss, William 'Smitty' Smithfield (Michael Murphy), threatens him with jail for the missing bribe as leverage for Crowe to infiltrate the Tool Shed. 

The CIA intends to acquire the company and use it as a clandestine operations center with Smitty in charge. Meanwhile, Todd Stapp (Michael Beach), the fourth and as far as I can discern final member of the Shed, discovers Crowe's cover, but instead of going to Grimes with this information, he decides to help Smitty and Crowe take over the Shed.

All of this makes exactly zero sense. Why would the CIA, for all intents and purposes a clandestine agency itself, want to take over another clandestine agency? According to Smitty, “we get our own private, self-sustaining special operations boutique at no cost to the taxpayer” — but after a little research I learn that the Director of the CIA is the only federal employee who gets to spend government money without having to save the receipts, so to speak; thus, I doubt he gives a flying f--- about “the taxpayer” (this also makes it rather suspicious that Smitty asks Crowe to sign a receipt for the $1 million intended to bribe a Supreme Court justice; turns out this is just a scriptwriter ploy to give Crowe something he can use against Smitty later).

Stapp's motivation is also fuzzy. Crowe tells him that “the Agency wants the Tool Shed … Margaret and I will run it … I guess that makes you No. 3”, and while this is mathematically correct, it's not a very attractive proposition, considering that, with Grimes out of the picture, there will only be three people left in the Shed. 

Overall, this film directed by Damian Harris and written by Ross Thomas follows a very winding path to arrive at a very simple conclusion: no one is innocent and everyone gets got. This is actually a win/win situation, though — it’s the journey that matters and not the destination; that the destination is morally sound is an added bonus.

Like I said, noir — and, indeed, Fishburne and Barkin's relationship is reminiscent of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck's in Double Indemnity; like theirs, their passion seems more like a pretext, and it vanishes after Grimes's murder. 

When Crowe tells Margaret that she is “the girl of my dreams. Because if you’re not, then nothing we've ever done makes any sense, does it?,” she might reply, like Phillys to Walter Neff, that “I never loved you … I used you, just like you said. That's all you've ever meant to me. Until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot” — except that Margaret has no trouble whatsoever with the second shot."

Released in 1965 and conceived & directed by Russ Meyer, ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" is a campy melodrama/crime thriller starring Tura Satana as a sneering vixen who, along with her two go-go dancing pals (Haji & Lori Williams), entertain themselves in their spare time by hot rodding in the desert. After a mishap wherein the trio apprehend a winsome bikini girl (Susan Bernard) they smell easy money at a remote ranch in the desert, inhabited by a rich old man (Stuart Lancaster) and his two sons (Dennis Busch & Paul Trinka). Ray Barlow plays a ""nice boy"" desert racer while Michael Finn is on hand as a gabby gas station attendant.

The movie has a big reputation as a cult flick and Meyer's definitive film, along with 1970's ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"" so I was very interested in finally viewing it. The first 20 minutes or so are fun and entertaining in a swingin' 60s kind of way, highlighted by the voluptuous female cast in which Meyer takes full advantage in illustrating their beauty (no nudity). The music, cars, apparel and thrills are additional highpoints.

Unfortunately, once the women happen upon the ranch with the mad ""Ben Cartwright"" and ""Hoss"" & ""Adam"" (sorry, no ""Little Joe"") the lousy writing and corresponding eye-rolling histrionics manifest. It's as if Meyer and fellow writer Jackie Moran were attempting to make a mid-60s desert version of one of Tennessee Williams melodramas, but didn't have the writing expertise or professional cast to pull it off. As such, the story loses the viewer's interest and you're left to laughing at the exaggerated antics and trying to enjoy the attractions noted above. Being shot in B&W doesn't help matters.

For a better movie that treads similar terrain (albeit with a wholly different plot) I suggest the contemporaneous ""Village of the Giants,"" which was released a mere 2½ months after ""Faster"" and is in glorious color. The women are just as good, if not better, and the music is superior, not to mention it lacks an utterly scornful one-dimensional she-devil (don't get me wrong, Tura's great, but her character is so one-note disdainful it gets old after 25 minutes and you just want someone, ANYONE, male or female, to knock her silly). ""Village"" also doesn't pretentiously try to be a serious 60's tragedy à la ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" in the desert.

The movie runs 83 minutes and was shot in the Mojave Desert (Lake Isabella, Lake Cunniback, Johannesburg, Randsburg & Ollie Pesch's Musical Wells Ranch) and Van Nuys (The Pussycat Club), California.

Sometimes, even the most innocent and naive movie lover can understand that a movie is going to be a huge failure. That must have happened with “Highlander II”, since it is almost certainly one of the worst sequels ever made. After deciding to make this film, the producers and director Andrew Morahan were aware of this, and they corrected it by deciding to pretend that this film never existed, returning to the original and building on that foundation. The result wasn't a success, but at least it wasn't an insult either.

The script for this film shows us what happened after Connor MacLeod left Scotland, still wounded by the death of his first wife. He goes to Japan, where he seeks out a wise sorcerer named Nakano. It turns out that there was another immortal warrior interested in going against Nakano, to kill him and absorb his magic and power: Kane. The fight ends in the sorcerer's death. In the present day, his cave is discovered, along with bones and remains that point to the Scotsman's presence, which intrigues archaeologists and historians, as Connor, now a respectable antiquary, prepares for the ultimate battle with Kane.

All right, the script is really a mess and admits very silly possibilities for the eyes of anyone who understands and studies history. However, it is a much more decent script and much more in keeping with the original film, which can be said to be a positive point. Nevertheless, it doesn't bring anything really new or fresh, except for a few scenes that are set in the Baroque period and Revolutionary France. Even the villain is, at heart, a retelling of the villain from the first film.

The cast does what they can, but only Christopher Lambert deserves to be given the thumbs up for a satisfying job. There are a lot of cliché situations or scenes where we get the feeling that the characters are not acting intelligently. Mako tries to be very genuine and gives his character a certain authenticity, which was positive, but everything else is forgettable. Mario Van Peebles seems to bet everything he can on his voice, the huskiest and most cavernous he can get, and Deborah Unger is just the pretty face of the moment.

Technically, the film also sought to recreate the look of the first film. There are some points to highlight, namely the good work of the cinematography and the visual and sound effects, which manage to give the film some of the spectacular effects of the first one, without the freshness and authenticity. I also liked the period scenes in general. While not brilliant, they were a welcome addition that shows us a little bit of the main character's backstory. The soundtrack again bets on heavy rock, but is generally forgettable."

The children are sent to one of those horrible summer camps run by the kumbaya brigade where they don't quite fit in with the curriculum of the nauseatingly gloopy ""Becky"" (Christine Baranksi) and her abundance of twee students straight out of ""Little House on the Prairie"". Scene set for some deliciously dark antics as the kids must escape from the monstrousness of their retreat - causing a maximum of damage and delivering quite a potent assessment of the plight of the native American en route - and deal with their domestic interloper. Speaking of interlopers, it's also clear that nanny has quite a malevolent streak of her own - and ""Fester"" might soon be destined to join her long list of deceased spouses. As ever, it's Huston who steals the show here - she barely features, but when she does she imbues the whole thing with a certain menacing dignity. The rest of the ensemble work well together and the story is peppered with plenty of daft (adult) humour, a little bit of gentle slapstick and ""Lurch"" (Carer Struycken) is there to keep order. There's plenty of attention to the detailed look of the film and in the end I was was probably with the siblings about the young ""Pubert""!"

Though he does it well enough, this story of New York high society takes a very long time to get to exactly where we expect it to get to, and along the way the tedium of it’s, frequently unrequited, love triangle(s) make heavy going to watch. It’s all about lawyer “Newland” (Daniel Day-Lewis) who is affianced to “May” (Winona Ryder) but seemingly way more intoxicated by her cousin, the “Countess Olenska” (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has fled from an abusive marriage in Europe as the nineteenth century comes to a close. Though it may not actually be set in Victorian Britain, it’s fair to say the the societal expectations, snobberies and double-standards are just as prevalent and hypocritical here too and though a countess she may be, a divorced one will still be shunned and shamed by the likes of matriarch “Mrs. Mingott” (Miriam Margolyes). “Newland” initially feels obliged to stand in her corner a little - out of a sense of loyalty to his future wife’s family, but of course the more they interact the more a predicable relationship develops. “May”, meantime, isn’t impervious to her beau’s change in affections but is not entirely sure in which direction they are now pointing, and so the seeds are now sown for a story of love, lust, betrayal and quite possibly sadness, too. It does look good with all the costumes, stately houses and production design delivering a classy product - but for my money, a product is exactly what it is. There isn’t a scintilla of chemistry between DD-L and anyone, really, and Pfeiffer delivers her lines as if she were rehearsing for an Oscar Wilde stage play. Ryder only features sparingly but she does inject a semblance of decent vulnerability to the proceedings and both Margolyes and Geraldine Chaplin add a little extra class to the proceedings, albeit in rather set-piece scenes, as it trundles along - but this is a story we’ve seen or read many times before, just transferred to a new city where the elite behave just as they would in London or Paris or Vienna, only without the titles and the provenance. Perhaps because we Brits are weaned on period drama, it’s harder to see the wood for the trees but for me this is nothing at all special and the arrival, towards the end, of Richard E. Grant really sums up it’s gorgeous blandness. Stick with the 1934 version. "

Guests, like the fish, start to stink on the third day.” 
“In fact, I think you'll find that I start to stink on the first day.”

This exchange exemplifies the good and the bad about Barcelona; it’s full of acerbic Johnsonian sarcasm beautifully channeled by Chris Eigeman, but the third act feels more like the third day, with all that this implies.

The film, about two young American cousins ​​and their misadventures with the female fauna of the titular city, has another problem. The cousins, Fred and Ted, are skillfully and competently played by Eigeman and Taylor Nichols, respectively — Nichols's forced verbal tics only manage to make him seem like an ersatz Woody Allen (unusual for for writer/director Whit Stillman, who tends to evoke favorable comparisons to the legendary filmmaker), although he makes up for this with a scene described by Fred as “some weird religious ceremony based on Glenn Miller” — but the Barcelonans they get involved with are played by Australian, English, or American actresses; this is particularly jarring when it comes to the character played by Mira Sorvino, who is neither Spanish nor has the acting ability to pass for one.

Applying the Italian neorealist approach, literally any randomly selected passerby on a Barcelona sidewalk would have done a better job; on the other hand, it’s possible that my complaint is irrelevant, especially considering that the females in the story are practically interchangeable. 

Even though he spends most of his time courting Marta (Sorvino), Fred ends up falling in love with Montserrat (Tushka Bergen); according to him, “I've seen her in all sorts of different situations and contexts” — situations and contexts that must have occurred in scenes written but not shot, or shot but ultimately cut (the script simply shrugs it off, mentioning towards the end that “We spend hours together on the phone, and she is so fascinating and charming”). Meanwhile, Ted ends up marrying Greta (Hellena Schmied), a late addition to the plot with whom Ted doesn't share much more quality time than Fred does with Montserrat.

But perhaps this is precisely the point; as Ted says, “you see a beautiful girl and immediately you’re subject to all these emotions … you haven't even talked to the girl, and you already want to get married and spend the rest of your life with her”. 

He suffers from ""a real 'romantic illusion' problem,"" and yearns, ""instead of a fantasy built on the pretty slope of an eyebrow or the curve of an upper lip, to see the real person. Maybe even look into her eyes and see her soul."" 

In that sense, the film is a true reflection of, as Roger Ebert put it in his review, ""a vast yearning which can only be filled by a girl"" that most of us experience before we reach the age of reason; sadly, Fred doesn’t seem to outgrow this juvenile yearning during the course of the film, and there is no indication that his relationship with Greta is less based on ciliary sloping and/or lip curvature than on the ""real person."""

Bad Girls is directed by Jonathan Kaplan from a screenplay by Ken Friedman and Yolande Turner. It stars Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore. The plot sees the four girl actors playing prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and a hanging escape. Suffice to say that they get into scrapes & double crosses whilst being pursued by the Pinkertons.

Being asked to suspend disbelief is one thing, being force fed drivel masquerading as pro-feminism is entirely another. Bad Girls is a mess of a movie, an insult to the Western genre, to the fans of the lady actors, to the lady actors themselves, who simply deserve much much better and arguably worst of all - to women in general. The script is laughable, serving only as an excuse for the gals to sling those guns and hips when possible, whilst being abused and saved by ""men"", while the plotting is by the numbers as everything falls into place readily. There's even slow-mo shots where they serve no purpose of enhancement. Throw into the mix that three of the ladies look nothing like on the run outlaws, all shine and span and make up with nice hair (Masterson the exception as she has a modicum of believability about her), well it's rather a depressing experience all told. Sure, as a red blooded guy I'm not going to be turned off by Barrymore's shapely thighs adorned in white stockings, or Stowe's truly gorgeous face, but when the highlights of a ""girl"" Western is something that's only aesthetically sexy for men, then they clearly have got it wrong.

So what's the justification for it being so bad? Well the back story offers up the answer. Film was meant to be directed by a woman, Tamra Davis (erm-Billy Madison & Crossroads), but she was jettisoned a couple of weeks into production. The plan with Davis at the helm was for it to be a Western told from a female point of view. However, Kaplan (The Accused/Unlawful Entry) was brought in quickly and the screenplay rewritten in a hurry. And boy does it show. Technically it's a duffer too, Jerry Goldsmith's score is cheap in texture and Jane Kurson's editing is choppy to say the least. There's no eye catching cinematography (Ralf D. Bode), while the acting away from the script hindered girls (ie: the men), is either a waste of time them being in it (Nick Chinlund) or badly directed (James Russo). While Dermot Mulroney seems only to exist as being a link to Young Guns - the ""boy"" version that this is clearly trying to ride the coat tails in on. If you want a good Western about the girls fighting the good fight then seek out George Marshall's 1957 film The Guns Of Fort Petticoat. It's a fun movie that at least has believable women fighting back under duress. Bad Girls, tho, is just bad in every department. 2/10 || _**Not so bad cowgirls**_

In 1891, four prostitutes in Echo City, Colorado (Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Mary Stuart Masterson and Drew Barrymore), flee the law with Pinkertons hot on their trail. Eventually they have to tangle with a band of Hispanic outlaws to retrieve some money.

""Bad Girls"" (1994) is a Western with cowgirls as the protagonists rather than cowboys. It combines the tone of ""Silverado"" (1985) and the later “The Mask of Zorro” (1998) so anyone who likes those flicks will probably like this one even if it’s arguably the least of ’em.

The Western staples are checked with a saloon brouhaha, a lynch mob, a posse, Pinkerton detectives, a swimmin' hole scene, steam locomotives, a handsome hero (Dermot Mulroney), magnificent Western vistas, a bank robbery, a mirthful Latino bandit (James Russo) and the four heroes grimly walking side-by-side to the showdown. Yet there are a few original elements as well if you look closely.

While all four of the stars are beautiful in their unique way, young Drew stands out and is just stunning. Speaking of the females, occupations & freedom were limited to women in the Old West, and the movie effectively drives this home. 

People usually cite the available professions as marriage, school-marming, prostitution and old biddy-hood. But what about clerking of one manner or another? What about entertainment, like at local saloons, traveling troupes and Old West Shows? What about writing, like Harriet Beecher Stowe? What about ranch-owning? In other words, there were more options, but women had to use their imagination and take a bold step. The four heroines in “Bad Girls” are up to the task.

Like the two Westerns noted above, this one takes the larger-than-life, mythmaking approach rather than shoot for anything very believable. If you can roll with that, it fills the bill, just not as well as “The Mask of Zorro” or “American Outlaws” (2001).

The opening act wrongly paints the Christians marching in Echo City as enemies when, in real life, they would be the very people trying to help the protagonists out of the miserable bondage of prostitution, which all four wanted free from in the first place. While I understand people’s issues with life-stifling legalists, depicting the trampling of the Bible is gross ignorance. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot at Alamo Village, Brackettville, Texas , and nearby Del Rio, as well as Red Hills Ranch, Sonora, California, and nearby Sierra Railroad, Jamestown.

Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is an expert climber, but after a tragic incident leaves a girl dead, he leaves the mountains to get his head together. After his self imposed break he returns in the hope of rekindling a relationship with Jessie (Janine Turner). Whilst at the rescue centre he is called to help a group who are stranded in the mountains, he agrees to help out this one last time, unaware that the group in the mountains are heavily armed murderous thieves and they need help of another kind...

Directed by Renny Harlin, this is one of those films that shows that Stallone once had box office clout as big as his bodily frame. It's a delightful no brain action film that delivers royally to those with a bent for the action genre. What really lifts Clifhanger above average is the wonderful use of suspenseful situations. The film opens with a quite breath taking sequence and then kicks on to literally have us hanging on by our fingernails. The bad guys are deliciously over the top, none more so than the bullishly nasty John Lithgow as Eric Qualen, whilst Sly gets beefcake support from the ever reliable Michael Rooker. Cinematography by Alex Thomson is gorgeous as he brings to life the Cortina d'Ampezzo area of the Dolomites in Italy. Score is by Trevor Jones, who keeps it orchestral as he lifts from his own work for Last of the Mohicans, which in turn is mixed with what sounds like the lead theme of Alan Silvestri's work on Predator.

Apprehending their would be saviours, the gang use tracking technology to hunt their missing suitcases, but of course we just know things are not going to go smoothly. This has the scenario to be exciting: the cold and rather beautiful wintry scenery sets a scene nicely but the acting is very poor. Lithgow is hopeless, no other word for it, and Stallone just goes through the motions as the tortured soul trying to reconcile with ex girlfriend ""Jessie"" (Janine Turner), his friend and his conscience. Rex Linn's ""Travers"" - a duplicitous FBI man is no better and after about half an hour you are certain just what is going to happen - it's now all about pyrotechnics, helicopters and avalanches. It was nice to see ""Pa Walton"" (Ralph Waite) on screen again but Craig Fairbrass? No, sorry. This is just well photographed mush up a mountain. || **Action with some humor and a dose of exaggeration.**

The best thing about an action movie is that it's usually easy entertainment and doesn't make you think too much. The film that brings me here today is reasonably enjoyable for that reason, and for being honest in what it does, that is, it is not one of those films that deceives the public by saying it is one thing and being another. The film is exactly what it says it is, and delivers what it promises.

The script isn't particularly smart, and the story has enough improbable points to make us really doubt it. However, it serves the purposes of the film perfectly, even having some moments of humor. The film is far from being good, but it has a cast of good actors: Sylvester Stallone is good at acting, but he was never good at playing characters, and that doesn't change in this film. Even so, he's good enough to handle the role and have the lead. John Lithgow also does a satisfying job, but the rest of the cast is average. The villains are… likable, to be honest.

Technically, the film takes advantage of the generous budget for very good and well-executed action scenes, with great physical demand from the stuntmen and great commitment from the special effects, visual and sound sectors. There's an exaggeration that makes everything feel sensational, kitschy and a little silly, and the dialogues are absolute clichés, but they add fun and some more witty moments to the film. Of course, there's plenty of pyrotechnics, judging by the amount of stuff that gets blown up."

'Coneheads' undoubtedly has the strongest supporting cast of any of them, and while director Barron has hardly become a household name in terms of movies (only this and 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' really hit the radar), his prowess on some of the greatest music videos of all time (ie., Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing', Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean' and A-Ha's 'Take On Me') was picture-perfect for the comedic set-pieces here. Definitely worth at least a watch, here in the 21st-century. || _**Fun shenanigans with the Coneheads on Earth and Remulak**_

RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Steve Barron, ""Coneheads"" chronicles events when a couple from the planet Remulak, Beldar (Dan Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Jane Curtin), are mistakenly ditched on Earth, during a reconnaissance mission for planet takeover. Their misadventures include: Dodging the INS (Michael McKean & David Spade), moving to suburbia and having a kid (Michelle Burke) and meeting all kinds of colorful people (Sinbad, Jason Alexander, Chris Farley, etc.). In other words, there’s a constant string of guest stars that were popular at the time, mostly comedians. 

I had my doubts about this movie because I didn’t think they could take an amusing 9-minute SNL skit and effectively make it into a film ten times longer. But the flick’s funny from the get-go and the writers wisely change settings & peripheral characters so regularly that the story never gets dull. The third act features a well-done sequence on the Conehead homeworld, Remulak. 

On the female front there’s Lisa Jane Persky as a voluptuously winsome neighbor and the mind-blowing Michelle Burke as the Conehead daughter, Connie (a role that Laraine Newman fulfilled on TV, but she was considered too old for the role in the film at 40). The creators wisely showcase Burke’s beauty without resorting to tasteless sleaze.

Critics may have hated it, but “Coneheads” competently entertains and amuses on several levels.     

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 28 minutes and was shot in New York City; Paramus, New Jersey; and Cerritos, California.  

GRADE: B || Coneheads, yeah, it's one of the FEW SNL movies that turned out right, especially since it came so long after the Conehead sketches stopped airing.

But then it was back before SNL made it's downward spiral to the dust bin.

It has an all star cast, and in even the small roles. It has a cast that was, more or less, the who is who of comedy in the early 90s, and is executed in way that actually tells a story... and that is what sets it apart from a lot of SNL movies (more modern movies in general), it actually tells a coherent story and takes the time to develop the characters.

Because of that, you have a sense of real family and their plights have a meaningful resonance that only comes with the well developed mind of a skilled writer and director."

Color of Night isn't just bad: it's bad with raisins in it.
 
 If you were one of the few who saw Color of Night in a theater, you probably remember the plot, but for those millions and millions who missed this gem, let's recap.
 
Bruce Willis stars as a psychologist. (Are you laughing too hard or can we go on now?) Willis is having a crisis of conscience/ confidence because one of his patients leaped out of a window after applying lots of lipstick. (We all know, don't we, that applying lots of lipstick is a sure sign of suicidal depression?) Anyway, Willis goes out to L.A. to visit fellow shrink Scott Bakula, who takes Willis to his group therapy session so that the fun can start in earnest. Remember ""The Bob Newhart Show"" from the '70's? His group therapy meetings weren't nearly as funny as these: we have a nympho, an obsessive-compulsive, a split personality, the Professor and Mary Ann -- well, you get the idea. Bakula gets killed in a scene that looks like Psycho directed by Mack Sennett. The sad part is that Bakula is the most talented and attractive member of the whole goddamn cast and 30 minutes into the picture he's been bumped off.

Willis stays on in Bakula's grandiosely modern home (crammed with screamingly bad art) despite the fact that someone keeps stalking him and leaving snakes in the mailbox. (Are hotels in L.A. that expensive?) It's like the TV movie where that devil doll keeps chasing Karen Black around her apartment going, ""Yanni yanni yanni,"" and it never occurs to her to just leave.Instead of ruining the horribly implausible and helter-skelter plot for you, We'll just point out some of the more outrageous lapses of sanity: a) Willis's patient jumps out of a Manhattan office tower, causing pedestrians to scream and run, whereas real New Yorkers would have lifted her purse; b) Three days after famous psychologist Scott Bakula is killed in an exceedingly colorful way in his midtown office, his patients still don't know about it -- okay, we've already established that there are no reasonably priced hotels in L.A., but surely there must be at least one newspaper or TV station; c) The whole plot hook -- Willis goes color blind after seeing his patient's blood -- goes nowhere. Period. You keep thinking there has to be a reason for it or a plot twist that depends on it -- but nothing ever happens.

The film is a laugh riot and we don't want to give away all of the jokes. When we saw the film in the theater, the audience laughed all the way through the first sex scene, which took place underwater and was about as erotic as an Esther Williams movie. Oh, yes, we do get to see generous portions of Bruce Willis, though not as much as he'd have liked.
Then there's the acting. Even the extras overact. Keep your eyes out for one unbilled woman playing a hooker in a police station. She only has one line, but she gives it such gusto that she will leave you stunned. Even formerly respected actors lose all sense of self-control; Lesley Ann Warren (decked out in a Shelley Long wig) twitches and twitters like a road company Billie Burke, and Ruben Blades does what appears to be a Jose Jimenez imitation. Willis actually seems like a model of intelligent understatement compared with the rest of the cast, but the truth is, he just wasn't acting at all.

And then there's Jane March. Ever so much of Jane March. Watching her try to match wits with Bruce Willis really makes you appreciate the bang-up job Cybill Shepherd was doing all those years. Jane spends half the movie dressed in disguise as a teenage boy. (How hard is she to spot? She's got teeth like Bucky Beaver! This gal could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence!) It all just gets sillier and sillier until the grand finale, which tried to come off as Hitchcockian but reminded us more of silent film legend Harold Lloyd. Judging by the guffaws from the audience, we weren't alone. So, watch Color of Night if you're feeling down in the mouth. Just don't try to eat popcorn during it -- unless you know the Heimlich maneuver. || Rare is the movie that benefits from addition. Color of Night is almost but not quite the exception that proves the rule. According to TV Tropes, “The director’s cut [which runs 20 minutes longer than the theatrical release] restored … much of the film’s humor.” Not nearly enough of it, though; if the movie had truly embraced its comedic potential, it could have been the Naked Gun of erotic thrillers. 

Less than three minutes after he has been accused of being figuratively colorblind, psychologist Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) goes literally colorblind. To call this foreshadowing is an insult to prefixes. Bill loses the ability  to see the color red when one of his patients defenestrates herself (the dummy that takes the fall is so stiff it looks like it might start gliding away at any second). 

When the woman crash-lands on the street, we are treated to a shot of her bleeding face — from below; it’s sort of like the Sunset Boulevard pool shot only instead of looking through water, we are somehow looking through pavement.

A distraught Bill goes to visit his colleague and best friend Bob Moore (Scott Bakula) in Los Angeles. Bob invites Bill to sit in on a group therapy session, where one of the patients notices with amusement that Bill is wearing one red sock and one green sock — which of course looks only slightly more ridiculous than if either color actually matched.

Bob is soon stabbed to death in a scene that wouldn’t be entirely out of place in the first Scary Movie, and that culminates with Bob crashing through a glass door — well, he actually doesn’t so much crash through it as leans gently on it, at which point the door collapses like it was made of sugar glass as opposed to glass-glass, except for one particular shard that’s bigger and sturdier than the rest; so much so, in fact, that poor Bob can’t help impaling himself on it.

All five members of Bob’s therapy group are suspects, though sadly only two are blatant red herrings. Now, if the film had taken itself much less seriously, a joke about Bill’s inability to detect a red herring would have written itself; it would also have been funny if the entire group were composed of Usual Suspects (why not, for example, Ted Levine and Tom Noonan to complement Brad Dourif and Lance Henriksen?).

Bill takes over Bob’s duties and in the process becomes the subject of a couple of unintentionally hilarious assassination attempts, including a rare Car Fu/Fallacy of the Predictable Tree hybrid — and who could forget the ol’ Rattlesnake in the Mailbox?

As for the intercourse scenes, the norm is that you couldn’t make sex funny if you tried; then again, director Richard Rush wasn’t trying, and that’s how come we get, among other things, a toy tank used as a sex toy (doubly weird because this occurs in a bathtub, so shouldn’t it be a toy boat?), and a scene in which, even though he’s off-screen, you can hear (and then can never, ever un-hear) the exact moment when Bill grunts his way to climax.

Oh, and there’s also a sardonically wisecracking homicide detective played by Rubén Blades who, in a moment of self-awareness bordering on self-parody, mercilessly mocks the other characters for being so dumb (“How in the name of God could all of you be going out with the same woman and not know? Not have a clue? … I’m gonna call the Guinness Book of World Records because I think this woman deserves credit. And I’m gonna make sure that all of your names are included so you can all share in the glory”). That’s precisely what this movie needed; more Hudson Hawk and less Striking Distance."

Now, think “Man in the Iron Mask”, only this mask is one of public relations as she and “Dave” start to realise the potential for themselves and their country from this situation. As he does so often, Langella steals his scenes - especially as the plot thickens and his lucidity comes into comedy question, but there are also quite a fun series of scenes from Ben Kingsley as the hapless VP “Nance” and from Ving Rhames as his no-nonsense body guard.

I only saw it once. I dare not watch this again. For some reason it was playing at a dingy burlesque-haunted cinema on old Granville Street in Vancouver on a Sunday afternoon in 1993 where wasted men usually shuffle in to deposit their sperm. (Not enough credit goes to internet porn for cleaning up the streets). Richard Linkater wasn't a story at the time. The guy who made Slackers. The bastard love child of Jim Jarmusch and Chrissie Hynde for all I knew. No clue he'd be the chosen one to eventually deliver us to _Boyhood_. I went in with a friend on a lark and floated out on a psilocybin cloud of joy. I was awestruck. I know these guys! I wanted to endlessly sing its praises but my friend didn't get the same charge out of it. (Although months later at a Christmas party of wayward misfits, he couldn't stop playing the sound track). Maybe it was me. But this was exactly how I remembered High School in the 70's. Was I hallucinating the whole thing? Indeed I was stoned much of the time, but all that was brilliantly accounted for. All that was missing was a bit of Pink Floyd and a whole lot of Led Zeppelin as alluded to in the title. _Dazed & Confused_ isn't merely the best movie about High School in the 1970's. It is the best movie about High School, and the best movie about the 1970's, and perhaps the best movie about male adolescence (yes, yes, IMHO, of course, what else). I dare not watch it again for what if I burst the bubble of such virgin memories to forever spoil my love and admiration for it. Or was it the dingy cinema I have fond nostalgic feelings for? Something. I'll have to watch it again, probably soon, once Linklater finally gets the grand red-carpet treatment along with the golden trinkets he so long deserves. || Really solid sophomore effort by Linklater.

Loved his Hitchcock homage, especially. || **The final day of the school, but it's just the beginning!**

I won't lie that I watched it after I saw 'Everybody Wants Some!!' from the same director. Because I liked that film and I heard that was a spiritual sequel to this one. So there goes my reason. I usually love the 80s and 90s teen films, you can't compare them to what they make now. The film was from the edge of before my generation began, but I'm very related that time than the other end. So I felt very familiar and enjoyed it thoroughly.

The film focused on the final day of the high school. It opened in the afternoon during the final class and followed by night where a party was arranged by the seniors that does not take off after their parents suspected it. Between the freshmen and the seniors, a tradition follows. Some of them escape, but those who got caught, struggles to way out. Not everyone, some make it their best time in high school. So who gets what and how everyone's night turns out revealed in the remaining.

We can see some of the big names of the today's cinema in this 23 year old film. Matthew McCanaughey, Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck and many more. Though the film never focused one particular character, it was neutral and stayed that way till the end. But it told the story of the final day of the high school about the individuals and their intentions. You do not have to be a youngster to enjoy it, it will work for everybody. So I hope you watch it, especially before to try 'Everybody Wants Some'.

I was really curious to see this movie, because as far as I can remember it was the first Chinese movie I saw. Before I saw it, I read a little about it, and I was quite impressed to see how the film did well in the West, and managed to infuriate Chinese Communist censors. However, I fear that I was not fully prepared for what awaited me.

In fact, the film is truly brutal, in every sense of the word. Director Kaige Chen took a well-known and respected book for his film, but put all the focus on an almost visceral realism. The film is an epic that spans a large period of time, between 1924 and 1977, that is, very troubled years in Chinese history, which includes the entire period of war against Japan and the invasion of Manchuria, as well as the cultural revolution. Maoist.

At the same time, it reveals the backstage of Cantonese opera, a traditional Chinese cultural style. In the film, two young apprentices live a cruel and unhappy life at the opera school, with daily beatings and various abuses, including sexual abuse. One of them will play the female characters in the stories, like a transvestite, since women are not allowed on stage. Throughout the film, there is a lot of confusion between life and art, and we often feel that these actors are mixing things up, living their characters in real life and transposing their real life to the stage.

I don't know any of the actors in the cast, but I really liked their overall work, and the way they play opposite each other. The film also has extraordinary scenarios, full of realistic details, such as the construction of buildings, the lanterns. The actors' costumes also deserve applause, especially the characters in the opera, with all those fabrics and those strong face paints. Finally, a word for the wonderful cinematography, excellent opening credits and soundtrack."

RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Sydney Pollack based on John Grisham’s novel, ""The Firm” is a crime drama/thriller starring Tom Cruise as a top Harvard grad lawyer who desperately wants to leave behind his working-class origins and takes a high-paying job at a firm in Memphis. He and his wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn) are ecstatic in their affluent new world until clues mount up that the firm has a sinister side. Gene Hackman plays his mentor at the firm while Ed Harris appears as an FBI agent. Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn and Gary Busey are also on hand.

This has long been one of my favorites from this genre. You really feel for McDeere (Cruise) & his wife as their utopia morphs into an inescapable hell. In the Washington DC scene you grasp how limited their choices are as they’re caught in a crossfire between the Mob and the FBI. McDeere must use his wits, his knowledge and “golden connections” for them to get out unscathed, if possible. 

I always favored the piano score by Dave Grusin, which some have described as “bouncy.” While you could call it that, it has different tones depending on the sequence. For instance, during the closing city chase it’s driving and portentous. There’s also a melancholic component when suitable. The positive side of the piano score is that it makes the film timeless. Consider quality movies from that general era which were horribly dated by conventional scores, like “No Way Out” (1987).        

THE FILM RUNS 2 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in Memphis, Tennessee; West Memphis, Arkansas; Cayman Islands; Washington DC; Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts. 

GRADE: A/A- || **An excellent film, full of tension and suspense.**

In my country there is a popular adage that probably also has an equivalent in other countries and that says “there is no beauty without a flaw”, that is, if something is too good, it must be wrong. And despite the excellent education and academic evaluations, the lawyer of this film seems not to know this simple truth.

Based on a novel by John Grisham, the script follows Mitch, a young lawyer who has just been hired by a large and important law firm in Memphis, Tennessee. The job is irresistible: a high salary, several perks, a car and paid trips, everything a young yuppie and his wife could want. What he doesn't know is that his new bosses are heavily financed by mafia groups to whom they provide protection and legal advice, and that lawyers who seek to leave the firm end up mysteriously dying. When he finds out, he will have to decide what to do: either maintain his loyalty to the firm or collaborate with the FBI and frame his colleagues.

The film has an excellent suspense that works wonderfully, and keeps us hooked until the end. The direction, in charge of the excellent Sydney Pollak, is really good and there is a certain similarity between this film and “Eyes Wide Shut”, another intense suspense film in which Cruise and Pollak work together again. And I have no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork also had its influence on the way Pollak conceived his film. The script has many twists and turns and may demand some attention from the audience, but I guarantee that this will not be a problem if the spectator allows himself to be involved and absorbed by the suspense and tension that are gradually imposed.

I'm not a fan of Cruise, but I recognize that he is a solid and sympathetic protagonist, making the character someone for whom we can have a certain empathy, oscillating between naivety and wit. There are a good handful of well done action scenes that the actor was more than cut out for. Gene Hackman, in turn, gives life to a mature, bohemian lawyer who seems to be more interested in traveling and swimming in the Caribbean than in working with his clients. However, he was also a sympathetic presence, and I really hoped that his character would get away with it somehow. Jeanne Tripplehorn doesn't seem to have much to do, and I thought, at first, that she would just be the protagonist's shy and fragile wife. However, the script gives us a twist that refocuses the character and gives her a much more active and intervening role than we could guess in the first half-hour length. One can also mention the good performances of Ed Harris, Steven Hill and Wilford Brimley, in roles that are tougher and closer to an action movie. Holly Hunter also appears here, but in such a minimal character that it seems inconceivable to me that she was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

Technically, the film has many qualities that we can point out: the cinematography is good and gives us an elegant look and good colors, so that the film does not look as old and dull as other films of the same year. The settings are excellent, in particular the offices and the paradise hotel in the Cayman Islands, where some beautiful and very colorful underwater scenes were filmed. The film passes through Memphis, Washington and other places, always with a careful eye on the choice of filming locations and the best framing. We don't have a show of visual and special effects, but the little that is done works very well. What definitely deserves a mention is the excellent soundtrack, based massively on the piano, and which is really effective in the task of accentuating the environment, deepening the suspense and gradually making things more exciting."

This is certainly one of the films that made an impression on people during the 90's, and that maintained its popularity and sympathy for many years. Today I think it has been forgotten, and in part I feel sorry for it. However, I believe that the film has already done its job: not only did it entertain those who saw it and continue to see it, but it also had a certain social role in the way it awakened in younger people (but not only them) a certain awareness of ecology, for the preservation of endangered animals and species. I also believe that the film had a certain responsibility for changing the thinking of zoos and places that keep animals in captivity: instead of being “animal deposits” for public entertainment, they became institutions with ever greater relevance in the preservation of animals: today, they are essential for the survival of species whose natural habitats have been destroyed and which are only perpetuated in captivity. They also take the lead in the assisted reproduction of many animals, such as the Giant Panda Bear, for example, as well as in the rescue, veterinary treatment and preparation of animals that, having been illegally hunted or lived many years in human company, need to return to wildness.

Thus, this film turns out to be more relevant for the effect it had on people than by itself. Analyzing it in a simple way, it is a rather sugary film, loaded with clichés and without great artistic quality. A family entertainment film, excellent to watch with the kids and which, for years, was almost institutional on television during the Christmas season. The script is quite simple, and takes a rebellious and angry teenager to regenerate when he begins to have contact with an orca that has lived in captivity for years. The friendship between them is touching and sincere, as well as the boy's efforts, and the friends he makes, to release her to the seas, in a race against time and against the action of the villains, the owners of the park where she is kept, and who don't care about her at all. It is an extremely predictable film, which excessively romanticizes the release of animals kept in captivity, making the public forget that a whole previous preparation is necessary, taking several years, and that we never know if the animal, after years depending on humans, is it really going to adapt. Keiko, the orca that the movie used (and who lived in captivity for years after the movie), would eventually be prepared and released to the sea, but as we know, she never adapted to the wild.

The film has a good cast, but a terrible conception of characters. None of the characters are really good and all are clichés: the heroic teenager, the Native American full of ancestral wisdom who knows animals like no one else, the arrogant capitalists with no respect for anything or anyone... Excluding the orca Keiko, it's Jason James Ritcher who will stand out as an actor, in the role of the teenager who saves the day. He does what it takes, and I think he was relatively credible in his effort. Michael Madsen also deserves praise for his work, in a film that, incidentally, will be one of the most popular of his artistic career. Lori Petty and Jayne Atkinson are pretty good, August Schellenberg does what he can with the cliché given to him. The rest simply doesn't matter.

Technically, the film stands out for its good cinematography. A lot of '90s movies seem ancient when we see them now, but this is one of those laudable exceptions that deserves to be mentioned. The filming locations, as well as the sets, also deserve a positive note for their visual beauty. The sound effects are very good, and the visual and special effects deserve praise, in particular the animatronic whale, which is quite realistic. Finally, a note to praise the quality of the main theme of the soundtrack created for this film, which is one of the most beautiful of its time. || I guess Free Willy depends on how old you were in 1993.

For the most part, I really like Family Friendly, if they are done right they can be entertaining and uplifting. And, the kid in me can still see how people would love it, and still love it, if they saw it as a little kid.

But I was 13 when Free Willy came out, and, honestly, it's not E.T., it's not The Goonies, it's not even Radio Flyer let alone Sandlot.

It's a little too trite, a little too earnest, a little too childish and it lacks the fun and sense of adventure that films like Flight of the Navigator and The Explorers still hold.

In other words, for a family friendly movie, it's more kid friendly and not family enough, and it doesn't age well. I think if you are older than 10 when you see it, you're likely to throw the 1 star out there because it honestly doesn't have that much to offer to people much older. And, if you are under 10 when you saw it, year, it's probably a nostalgia classic to you.

It's just one of the family friendly movies that forgot it's supposed to be fun for the whole family, and that makes it age dependent."

Released in 1993 and based on the TV show from 30 years earlier, “The Fugitive” stars Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, an innocent fugitive framed for murder. As he pursues the one-armed killer & those who pulled his strings, a determined U.S. Marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) hunts Kimble down from wilderness regions to the streets of Chicago.

The first 40 minutes contain the most action, hooking the viewer with an exhilarating bus wreck/train wreck followed by a phenomenal dam sequence. The rest of the movie is an intelligent and suspenseful cat-and-mouse chase with Kimble zeroing-in on those who framed him and why.

“The Fugitive” was a deserved box office hit, costing $40 million and raking in $369 million with $184 of that domestically. To realize just how well-done it is, check out the sequel, “U.S. Marshals” (1998), which features the same basic plot, but without most of the magic.

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot in Illinois and North Carolina; the dam sequence, for instance, was filmed at Cheoah Dam, Tapoco, North Carolina.

The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain is directed by Christopher Monger and written by Ivor Monger. It stars Hugh Grant, Ian McNeice, Tara Fitzgerald, Colm Meaney and Kenneth Griffith. Music is by Stephen Endelman and cinematography by Vernon Layton.

Set in 1917, plot finds Grant and McNeice as two English cartographers who arrive in the Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw to measure what the locals proudly proclaim to be Wales' first mountain. However, it turns out that the ""mountain"" is 16 feet below the required 1000 feet requisite so therefore can only be classed as a hill. This news causes disgust amongst the locals, who then set about stopping the cartographers going home whilst they attempt to build atop of the hill to make it over 1000 feet.

A film with a big title that is matched by the size of its heart, Monger's film owes much to those fun community based pictures that filed out of Ealing Studios back in the 40s and 50s, Re: Whisky Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt. We can also safely place it the whimsy category where something as wonderful as Local Hero sits, while the old British comedy staple that encompasses an obsession with size (The Mouse That Roared) watches over the film like an approving British cinematic angel.

Homespun humour marries up with the utterly engaging view of quirky village life to provide us with just under 100 minutes of entertainment. Although clearly simple in plot and structure, to simply dismiss it as such does not do justice to the fine work of the ensemble cast and the writing of Ivor and Chris Monger. With Grant doing what he does best, the amiable nervous fop, picture has a lead actor fully comfortable with the tone and texture of the production, while around him there are a number of fine character actors putting delightful meat on the comedy bones of oddball characters with names such as Morgan the Goat, Johny Shellshock, William the Petroleum and Betty from Cardiff! Best of the bunch is Griffith as Reverend Jones, a grumpy, stubborn eccentric who underpins everything so wonderfully skew-whiff about life in Ffynnon Garw.

As for the writing? The screenplay has a wonderful ear for small village dialogue, while in amongst the value of community spirit theme, sits a near sombre observation of the effects of war on such a community. The production design is appealing, with Layton's photography around the Powys locations a visual treat, and Endelman's music has a suitably warming and jaunty feel; even if it starts to get a touch repetitive later in the piece. It doesn't have widespread appeal, it's clearly a film aimed at a small portion of film fans that love those films mentioned earlier. But in an era when film is being smothered by CGI and visual gimmickry, revisiting something like The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain offers up a most refreshing and diverting experience. 8/10"

Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich is a great line-up and both are entertaining in this, the latter is just terrific at playing a loopy bad guy. There's a fair few well known peeps behind them, including John Heard and Gary Cole - it's a fairly strong cast.

The story is an interesting one, though given that you'd expect the film to move along at a better pace but it kinda just walks through its 128 minute run time. It's not a drag or anything, but I definitely wasn't on the edge of my seat unfortunately. It's still a film I'd recommend, though. || **Action, entertainment and verisimilitude together in a film that is better than many others, more regularly remembered.**

This is a conventional American-style action film, where everything revolves around the unassailable and sacrosanct figure of the President. There are loads of films like this, such as “Air Force One” or “Olympus Has Fallen”, which may help to explain why it ended up so forgotten, despite being nominated for three Oscars (Best Editing, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay). It's not a new film, but it guarantees action and entertainment, and looks very appealing to televisions and home market. In this case, the script focuses on the threat of a madman who is willing to do anything to assassinate the American president, and on the attempts of a veteran Secret Service agent to discover and prevent him.

In a film where the plot does not reserve any surprises or innovation, predictability can be a problem. In fact, there's nothing here that we haven't seen before. However, everything is done very competently and the commitment of all those involved is quite evident. The whole story is fairly well written and, apart from a few minor flaws, comes across as solid and credible. Wolfgang Petersen's direction also makes a decisive contribution to the positive outcome of the final product.

The cast contains several well-known names, but, unsurprisingly, it is Clint Eastwood who secures the lead role. And once again, the veteran shows us all the charisma he has. He really manages to balance his usual tough guy image with a fragility that his age accentuates and justifies. John Malkovich also did a good job. It's not the best of his career, but it was honest, credible and done with great professionalism. Rene Russo is the female standout, but in a movie with so much testosterone, she has little to do other than appear tough enough to keep up with those men and be the love interest of one of them.

Technically, the film has several points of merit that deserve to be highlighted and analyzed. When I read a little about this film (I have this habit, to be able to understand certain details and clear up some doubts that arise when watching), I discovered that there was, on the part of the production, a concern with the details. To make things more credible, they even asked the Secret Service for advice. And whenever a film production takes into account the relevance of details to the verisimilitude of the film, we have a duty to commend such efforts. Cinematography is the dominant standard in films of the time, and the sets and costumes are also what was imagined. There are many well-executed action scenes, and some good special effects and visuals. Editing is also very good."

Though **Daniel Day Lewis'** character is not your typical role model from the start, you know that the Heart within isn't black (more so from a scene just before he says 'In all my godforsaken life, I've never known what it was to kill somebody until now')..The transformation of Day Lewis' character from a man who wasn't responsible enough to take care of himself to a man who vows to fight for his father's name is brilliantly heartwarming!

It just pains me to see how cruel 'WE' as a species can be to not accept our mistakes, even when we know that it can make someone's life miserable than HELL!!

In all the movie is good till the time you don't think of it as someone's life being played out in front of you.As soon as you realize that,it transforms into something you cant just think of as just another brilliant movie.Instead your heart goes out to the people who actually had to go through all this..

Well directed, superbly acted, brilliant,heart breaking and heart warming at the same time !!

Those who found it beautiful can go for Hillary Swank's 2010 movie **Conviction** as their next choice of another heartwarming 'eye treat' ! || **A low-key, much-forgotten but well-executed film.**

This movie is totally forgotten these days. Well, actually, if you're not native or very close to Ireland, I think the very existence and action of the IRA seems like something that ended many years ago, and it doesn't. It was a recent thing, and it still has marks on people and society. The film focuses, in particular, on the case of the “Guildford Four” and the “Maguire Seven”, which was a group of people who were accused of a bomb attack and of collaborating with the IRA, later proving to be if they were all innocent. The acquittal, however, came too late for the family patriarch, who died in prison. The accused were, almost all, related to each other, family or friendship.

I don't know the facts very well, although I did read something about the attack and the real case the film was based on, in order to better prepare myself to understand the film and be able to talk about it. As far as I can tell, the film obviously took a lot of liberties to make the story more appealing and dramatic, but nothing that is shockingly out of line with what happened.

Daniel Day Lewis was still relatively young here, but he was already showing signs of great talent. He is a focused actor and very responsible with his work, who dedicates himself to what he does and commits himself to the character. And we can see how he adapts to the character, and makes it real and believable and human. I also really enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite's work. I think it's particularly notable the way he allowed himself to age in order to play an older, physically impaired character.

Technically, the film is very worthy in its effort to portray the ordeal to which the convicts were subjected, and it does so in a very convincing and credible way. The choice of sets, filming locations and costumes contribute a lot to this. The film works very well on the environment and psyche of the characters, resulting in a dense drama, which may not please those who want a lighter film, but which works very well. The opening credits were well-introduced, even though I don't like the theme song. || **Oscar for Best Duo Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite**strong text****

The movie tries to convey the horrors of injustice, investigation, and rulings under the pretext of emergency laws and terrorism, but the details of these laws make us laugh by today's standards, even not when the film was shown in 1993. The film exposes us to the shock that the terrorism law at this time could have exposed any innocent person for 7 days without charge, and I believe that it is still present in many countless countries on the globe.

The film talks about the true story of the Quartet of Guildford and the Seven of Maguire, a very painful human rights story whose chapters begin with the arrest of the Irish young man Gerry Conlon in England and accusing him, along with three others, of carrying out a terrorist attack to bomb a bar in Guildford.

Although Jerry is reckless and has criminal tendencies already, but through the events of the film we realize that Jerry and those with him are innocent, but the investigation and interrogation process shows that it has many impurities and corruption in how to accuse these innocent people.

In the Name of the Father, on the surface, talks about justice and the feeling of oppression in the face of injustice. The events of the film are dramatic, revolving around other topics, the most important of which is the relationship between the son and the father and how it develops, as well as how an ugly place such as prison can constitute an opportunity for Jerry to mature in a way that would not have happened if he had not been subjected to injustice.

The multiplicity and diversity of the dimensions of the film, in addition to manifestations outside the capabilities of the planet in two scenes and the performance of two actors, who gave the film great importance and a special place for me.
 
If there was an Oscar for best acting duo, the Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite partnership would have given them blindfolded.

The character of Giuseppe Conlon has no faults. Even the story of his name, which allowed a wonderful scene to be told, was charming and incredible. He had a strange state of coherence in light of the circumstances in which he was, and in light of his background full of downwardness, which made him follow the rules and laws strictly so as not to violate the law. This flatness made his son Jerry view him as a weakness. But when Jerry realized when he tested himself in facing the same challenges his father faced, he saw his father, Giuseppe Conlon, gain ground and respect in every situation.

This movie is incredibly wonderful. It dazzled me and made me follow the events without getting bored."

Even those who don't like her, I think, have the honesty to recognize the impact and relevance of Tina Turner's music. She doesn't please everyone (nobody pleases everyone) but it is still a reference in 20th century music. Owner of a record that is hard to match, she has several awards, several Grammys and two stars on the Walk of Fame, among other honors. The film we have here, heavily based on the singer's autobiography, shows us a little of her personal life, how she became famous and her difficult marriage to Ike Turner.

I never read the original book, but I believe the movie omits a lot of information and data to try to focus on the main thing. Brian Gibson ensures an efficient direction and the script is quite good, mainly because of the way it sticks to the story and facts, avoiding melodramas and cloying sentimentality. Of course, not everything goes smoothly: the film is quite predictable, and its pace, although pleasant, goes through several bumps that are basically musical pauses.

The most relevant point in favor of this film is the excellent choice of the cast and the impeccable way in which it acts. Lawrence Fishburne has the difficult task of bringing the truculent Ike to life (and there aren't many characters more disgusting than an abusive husband), but he put in such effort that he manages to capture our attention with magnificent charisma. Beside her, the great Angela Bassett never seemed so powerful and electrifying. Incidentally, the resemblance of the two actors to the real figures they embody is truly remarkable.

The film has excellent cinematography and good scenery. The costumes, props and even automobiles play an important role in building the atmosphere of the time in which things are happening (between the 50s and the beginning of the 80s). The soundtrack is also good and, predictably, it's basically based on songs by Tina Turner and Ike Turner. || Andrea Bassett provides quite a compelling interpretation of the early life of Tina Turner here and Laurence Fishburne is also on good form as the brutish Ike. Born Annie Mae Bullock, she grows up in a community where singing is important and where her voice helps her to stand out. Pretty swiftly she attracts the notice of local band leader Ike Turner who gives her a start fronting his music before she becomes his wife and a mother. Success begins to follow but as that happens he turns into a monster. She is beaten regularly and feels more and more intimidated and fearful within her own marriage. Her society just wasn't geared up for a woman to leave her husband, however violent, and so with their business and family lives so completely intertwined any chance to break free was always going to be dangerous for this woman. Peppered with some well staged performances of their songs, and concluding with the birth of a legend, this is one of the more honest biopics that spares us little of the detail of a relationship riddled with turmoil and little respect. Fishburne presents us with a man who is odious in the extreme, but also one who exudes a degree of vulnerability as he clearly takes to drink and drugs to compensate for her success and his perception on how that impacted on his manhood to some extent. Not to excuse the behaviour - it seems commonplace for many African American women to have been the victims of domestic violence, but it does humanise the man a little and that does help to illustrate both the boldness and determination of an hugely talented and strong woman to do what she had to to break free of his magnetically toxic influence. It's based on her own book, and that adds a considerable degree of authenticity and richness to a depiction that's tough to watch at times, but well worth it."

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || ""Life finds a way… to let us enjoy dinos in theaters""

Filthy rich millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is about to open a dinosaur theme park. He invites a couple of experts to satisfy his investors. During a preview tour things go awfully wrong.

While ‘Jurassic Park’ is too simplistic to be a perfect movie it is blockbuster cinema at its very best. Spielberg grabs you by the throat from the get go and you instantly know you’re in for quite a ride.
The story is simple but effective. Author Michael Crichton did his very best to make the cloning dinosaurs part plausible. When you have living giant meat-eaters in your amusement park it’s not hard to come up with something which causes things to go south so fast before you can say T-rex.

The movie works because it doesn’t take itself too seriously. The characters are somewhat underdeveloped but their main purpose is to serve as dino treats. The Ian Malcolm character (Jeff Goldblum) is of little use but he’s funny. Grumpy Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) is the perfect counterpart. You can’t help but root for these characters.

What makes the movie stand out are the ground-breaking special effects. Even to this day it’s remarkable what ILM and Stan Winston’s crew achieved. Although a 'Jaws' approach would have perhaps worked better (Love the shot of the T-rex’ leg in the mud) the dinos look so realistic.

What ‘Jurassic Park’ does have in common with 'Jaws' is John Williams’ score. Although not as ominous and iconic as 'Jaws', Williams went for wonderment this time around. Perhaps not regarded as his most famous work it’s amazing. When the experts travel to the island Williams’ score does indeed give you a sense of wonderment. The scene where the visitors first lay eyes on the dinosaurs is movie magic.

Rereleased for its 25th anniversary it’s safe to say we rarely have had more fun in the cinema than while watching 'Jurassic Park'."

Lightning Jack is directed by Simon Wincer and written by Paul Hogan. Hogan stars as the title character and he’s supported by Cuba Gooding Jr., Beverly D’Angelo, Pat Hingle and L.Q. Jones. Music is by Bruce Rowland and cinematography by David Eggby.

Having burst onto the scene in movie world with Crocodile Dundee in 1986, Paul Hogan it seemed was set for a tilt at being a fully fledged film star. As it transpired, in spite of the first Dundee sequel proving popular, Hogan didn’t have much of a film career at all. So it’s with great interest to revisit his non Dundee films.

Lightning Jack is a comedy Western that pitches Hogan as outlaw Lightning Jack Kane, an Australian in the Old Wild West of America. He hankers to be more well known, to be wanted with a big reward on his head, so after (mis)fortune pairs him up with mute Ben Doyle (Gooding Jr.), they promptly go on an adventure of becoming criminally well known.

It’s really as simple as that, and if we break it down to the bare facts, it’s really just a chance for Hogan to play Hogan in a Wild West setting. But this is harmless comedy fare produced by an engaging comedy actor, okay so it may not be uproarious or have the fresh comedy finesse of Crocodile Dundee, but did it really deserve the scorn it got from critics?

Well it’s very thin on plot leaving us with a film that’s more a stitched together job of funny set-ups (your comedy barometer needs setting at amiable), but it is fun and likable due to Hogan and Gooding being easy to engage with. It also boasts gorgeous scenery, the locales sparkling thanks to smart work by Eggby (Mad Max/Quigley Down Under).

D’Angelo gets to be more than a token hooker with a heart, and is lovely into the bargain. Elsewhere, the presence of L.Q. Jones (Ride the High Country/Major Dundee) and Pat Hingle (Nevada Smith/Hang 'Em High) gives some Western solidification, and interesting cameo appearances by Roger Daltrey and Roger Clemens remind us that it’s just a bit of amusement after all.  

Not up to the standard of the criminally under valued Almost An Angel, and of course the first two Dundee movies are on a different plane to this. But it has its moments and is a decent time waster for genre fans in need of a gentle perk me up. 6/10 || **_Crocodile Dundee in the Old West_**

When Cole Younger’s gang is involved in a robbery-gone-wrong in a town in the Southwest, the lone survivor, Jack Kane (Paul Hogan), acquires a mute newbie partner (Cuba Gooding Jr.). He wants to make one last big score before moving to New York with his saloon lass (Beverly D'Angelo).

""Lightning Jack"" (1994) is an amusing Western starring Hogan, but it’s not an all-out comedy like, say, “Blazing Saddles.” Ball-park comparisons include “The War Wagon,” “Sam Whiskey,” “Something Big,” ""Cattle Annie and Little Britches,"" “Maverick” and “The Lone Ranger.” “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” is another, but that one’s a little more serious.

While not great and relatively slow-moving, the locations are excellent and the developing relationship of the antiheros is entertaining. Beverly is another highlight.

While the opening bank job is similar to the doomed 1876 real-life raid in Northfield, Minnesota, Cole Younger was only wounded and ended up in prison in which he worked on a newspaper as a printer’s devil. He was paroled in 1901 and ended up writing a memoir, lecturing and touring in a wild west show with Frank James. A couple of years before his death in 1915, he became a believer and repented of his criminal past. By contrast, Cole’s brother, Jim, was paroled with him in 1901, but couldn’t adjust and so committed suicide fifteen months later in a hotel room in Saint Paul.

At the end of the day, if you liked the Crocodile Dundee flicks, you’ll probably appreciate this.  

The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot in Santa Fe; Tucson and Page, Arizona; Moab, Utah; and Colorado; with some interiors filmed in the studio on the Gold Coast, Australia.

""The Man without a Face"" was Mel Gibson's 1993 debut as director. Gibson stars in the eponymous role as McLeod, a man whose face is heavily scarred. The story takes place on coastal Maine during the summer of 1968. Several years earlier McLeod moved to the area to live in seclusion and do his unconventional work with the requisite privacy. Unfortunately, but to be expected, rumors about the mysterious recluse circulate amongst the locals, who callously refer to him as ""hamburger head."" A fatherless 12 year-old, Chuck (Nick Stahl), wants to go to a military school and therefore enlists the aid of the outcast and a good relationship develops. Margaret Whitton plays Chuck's oft-married mother while Fay Masterson and Gaby Hoffmann his half-sisters. Geoffrey Lewis is on hand as the town's police chief.

I saw this movie years ago and, despite it being a decent drama, it left a sour taste. Why? Four reasons and they all have to do with the third act: 

**1.** It introduces the rumor of a hideous crime where someone is falsely accused (LIKELY falsely accused) and plots like this infuriate me for obvious reasons.
 
**2.** The crime in question is sexual molestation, which is always an uncomfortable and awkward topic, to say the least. 

**3.** There's a scene where a character is given the opportunity to affirm or deny the wicked allegations and he refuses; instead he answers by asking a rhetorical question. This is also frustrating. If someone didn't commit a crime then he (or she) should JUST SAY SO. 

**4.** Another scene struck me as stoo-pid simply because intelligent, discerning people are careful (and responsible) to make sure that what they do doesn't have the ""appearances of evil"" even though it's not evil, if you know what I mean. The character in question fails to do this and it was, again, infuriating.

Watching the film a second time, I have much higher respect for it because I now see what it's really about. The plot reveals the surface meaning – a fatherless kid finds a much-needed father-figure and a lonely outcast is blessed with human acceptance and the opportunity to fulfill his calling (teaching) – but the movie goes much deeper than this, which explains the existence of the third act and why everything else leads up to it. The subtext is a condemnation of gossipy lowlifes found in every community who destroy lives with their wicked tongues; that is, IF they're not called to account. They're judge, jury & executioners of innocent people. Their prey-of-choice is unconventional types or those perceived as a threat due to their figurative strength. Such slanderers are arrogant fools who love tearing others down, particularly those outside of their group. They feed on creating strife through lies, half-truths, negative spinning, unjust criticism, name-calling and mocking. THEY are the true monsters, not people like McLeod.

The more extreme the nature of the accusation the better, which is why these scum shoot for the most hideous of lies, such as sexual molestation. Such ignoble gossips are literally everywhere and their slander will spread and poison others' minds IF someone doesn't boldly put a stop to their lies. There's an effective scene at the end where the accused person approaches an elderly couple with whom he had a good relationship, but it's clear that the rumors had gotten to them and their minds are now poisoned because they refused to hear his defense before drawing a damning conclusion. There was nothing he could do and it's heartbreaking. Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens all the time.

While the drama of the film is solid, not great, it's the movie's subtext that breaks the threshold of greatness. The awesome coastal locations are a plus, as is the peripheral cast. While the movie's laden by the sexual molestation subplot it's justified because it ties into the picture's potent theme.

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot on coastal Maine and Nova Scotia.

GRADE: B+

**SPOILER ALERT!** Don't read further unless you've seen the movie.

I've heard some seriously erroneous claims about the movie, like McLeod really did have a sexual relationship with Chuck. Nonsense. These people didn't pay attention because the movie itself thoroughly disproves such claims: First of all, there's no scene where sexual abuse is even hinted at. Secondly, when the mother asks Chuck if McLeod ""touched"" him he responds with a shrug, ""Yeah, why?"" In other words, he touched him only in appropriate ways, like a pat on the back and so forth. ""What's the big deal?"" is essentially his response. 

Furthermore, Chuck tries to find out the truth about McLeod upon hearing the gossip/rumors and then steals his mother's car and goes straight to McLeod's house in a frenzy to confront him. McLeod's not the type to TELL people what to believe so he asks Chuck (paraphrasing), ""Have I ever done anything remotely questionable or abusive when you were around me?"" It's a rhetorical question and the non-verbal response is ""Absolutely not."" 

This explains why McLeod had no worries when the police officer came to his house earlier in the story looking for Chuck after he was missing for a night. He nonchalantly responds, ""Yes, he's here; he's sleeping upstairs."" He had no worries BECAUSE nothing improper was going on. Be that as it may, their friendship ends for legal reasons and McLeod moves away, but he secretly attends Chuck's graduation 7 years later at the military school where they happily wave to each other from a distance, hardly the appropriate behavior if McLeod committed an atrocious sex crime against the youth years earlier."

“Executive Decision” (1996) is an airliner-in-trouble flick from the angle of “Under Siege” (1992) directed by the editor of “Die Hard 2” (1990). I bring up the latter because this one’s very similar except that it takes place in the air rather than an airport.

I didn’t expect to like it because it’s basically “Die Hard” on a plane and I didn’t think a worthwhile movie could be made with such a cramped setting, but work it does. Sure, a lot of the runtime involves rescuers strategizing in the bowels of the airbus using hi-tech equipment, like hidden cameras, but the creators respect the intelligence of the viewer and there are several innovative bits along with great suspense.

It was obviously prescient of 9/11, filmed six years prior to that infamous attack.

The movie runs 2 hours, 13 minutes, and was shot in SoCal at Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino, but also Chino Airport, Mojave Desert (crash scene), Sierra Madre (Chechen Mafia House). The wedding kidnapping sequence was shot in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

He chose Shakespeare's farcical comedy **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**.  I knew one thing going in... Shakespeare's comedies are rarely that funny.  I knew something better coming out.. I could not have been more wrong. This film is not only funny and sexy, it is a treasure.

This is the first Branagh film that he utilizes stunt casting - bringing in Hollywood talent into  roles normally filled by Shakespearian actors.  And while it isn't always perfect, there is no complaint.  In fact Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves and Denzel Washington shine some bright light toward the American talent pool.  Of course, many of Kenneth's _'Shakespeare'_ friends are still along for the ride - Brian Blessed is amongst my favorites.

Branagh's first major achievement with this film is on his screenplay treatment.  Like his **HENRY V**, he has cut the screenplay down to a much more manageable Hollywood film length. It is taut and efficient. Nothing is missing for the casual Shakespeare fan. Of course the obsessed will find - or _won't_ find a lot of stuff.

Branagh's second major achievement is shared by others in the cast, especially Emma Thompson.  Their handle of the language and poetry of Shakespeare shifts what is often muddy and confusing dialogue to crystal clear and modern understanding.  In fact you will find yourself smiling through most of their scenes together as they torture each other until their love takes over.

In high school readings of any Shakespeare plays, students often get confused as to the social aspect of the stories... They would question why there is a party and why is everyone in the town celebrating it? Why do battles seem to be fought and won amongst only 10 soldiers? Why does it seem that marriages are performed on the same day that the couple first met?  So many questions confuse students and the adults who grow from them.  Branagh's most masterful achievement here is in answering these questions.
 
During his **HENRY V**, Branagh used an incredibly impressive tracking shot through the death and destruction on the field of Agincourt.  Just as impressive is the finale of **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**, including the audience in the celebration moving through the community and finally, up into the sky with a grand view of the love and excitement of all that are alive to experience it.

It is obvious that Kenneth Branagh is a major fan of Shakespeare.  I would venture to say that he is more than a fan, he is an artistic peer."

The film does rather fall off a cliff for me during the last half hour in the restaurant, though, where the comedic surrenders to the slap-stick and the joke comes crumbling down leaving us in a well of cringing sentimentality that I didn't particularly enjoy. That said, it's ground-breaking cinema that illustrates just what a dad will do to to be with his children and it takes a huge great swipe at sexual stereotyping too. There's a gentle chemistry between Williams and Field and there are some lovely, vicious, one liners thrown in for us to savour. Not great, but very good."

""Mr. Wonderful"" (1993) is a solid enough romantic drama with some amusing touches set in the Big Apple. It’s a great movie to see Manhattan in the early 90s, big hair and all (e.g. Sciorra). It successfully establishes the main characters and you buy into their story.  

On top of this you get Parker at the height of her beauty, which the director doesn’t fail to tastefully display on a few occasions.

It is distinguished by its remarkably lifelike characters. Most of the film was worked out in improvisations for several months before shooting began. Leigh wanted his actors to create elaborate back stories for their characters, fully living inside of them so that when the cameras started rolling they would be completely convincing.

As the film opens, Johnny (David Thewlis) has to flee Manchester after a sexual encounter with a married woman turns into rape and she threatens to set her husband after him. Stealing a car, he heads to London to crash at his ex-girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp), gets involved with her flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge), and spends a couple of nights homeless in London. Interspliced with this are scenes of Jeremy, a rich real estate broker whose sexual conquests serve as an upper-class counterpart to Johnny's own. Naturally the viewer is led to wonder what will happen when these two men meet.

Something is wrong with Johnny, he answers anything said to him with a rambling torrent of words, a logorrhea that is a form of intellectual bullying; this deeply wounded man seems to feel the best defense against the cruelties of the world is a good offense. Only 27, Johnny is so wasted that he is taken for much older. In this, Thewlis's performance is one of the masterful screen portrayals of an eccentric or mentally ill person, like Dustin Hoffmann in RAIN MAN or Peter Sellers in BEING THERE.

But all of the characters here are memorable, and my thoughts have often gone back to them in the time since I saw this film. I do have reservations about the plot, inasmuch as the last scenes of the film (which were decided only late in the filmmaking process) too suddenly change the tone and may seem anticlimactic. Nonetheless, I would recommend this film and believe it a great one in spite of its undeniable flaws. || **Unpleasant and uncomfortable, often highly appreciated by critics, it is understandably forgotten by the public.**

Mike Leigh directs with skill and intelligence a film that is far from pleasing everyone and that doesn't mind being uncomfortable: it tells the story of a man who hides in an ex-girlfriend's house to avoid being prosecuted for rape, and which we will follow through various adventures and dialogues that oscillate between nihilism, the “nonsense” and the deeply philosophical. He's an unpleasant man with somewhat sadistic touches, but the film is full of unpleasant characters in a dark story. The film was a considerable success among critics, winning major awards at Cannes and being nominated for a BAFTA, but it is one of those films that is so philosophical and perverse that I can understand why it is so forgotten.

The film's greatest strength, for me, is the enormous performance of David Thewlis, one of the most competent and consistent British actors, a veteran with a career worthy of envy and who has already shone in a multitude of projects, but who has not been particularly noted or esteemed as he deserves. I don't dare say this is his best film, but it's clearly in his top five. The remaining cast, in which we can positively highlight the efforts of Lesley Sharp and Greg Cruttwell, is much less interesting, but manages to give us good moments and good characters.

Technically, the film presents a very well-crafted cinematography which emphasizes shadows, half-light, and indirect lighting. This could not be more appropriate for the environment that the director wanted to create, and ends up being the great technical point of honor: the sets and costumes are well done, but without merit notes, and the effects and soundtrack are so discreet that it are limited to the essentials.

Moving through the dark, misty and dense environment of the London underworld, there is nothing particularly friendly, cheerful or flowery. There is an effort to expose with a certain rawness the moral nakedness and dark weaknesses of each character. In between, there are several sex and nudity scenes, including an explicit frontal nude of the protagonist. However, there is no intention of beauty, sensuality or eroticism here. This is a grotesque, ugly and clumsy nudity that bothers us. It is, therefore, not a film that I plan to revisit one day or that I can say that I liked, even though I recognize its merits and quality ratings. || Yikes, but this is a depressingly bleak story. David Thewlis is a rather dissolute and violent Mancunian who arrives in London with nowhere to stay. ""Johnny"" makes his way to the home of his ex ""Louise"" (Lesley Sharp). They briefly hook up again, but he soon tires of what he can get on a plate and sets off back onto the streets for a series of encounters with the nocturnal types who inhabit the city and provide us with a series of quirky short stories. Whilst ""Johnny"" is out philandering, ""Louise"" and her flatmate ""Sophie"" (Catrin Cartlidge) are being bullied by their landlord - the sadistic ""Jeremy"" (Greg Crutwell) who takes sexual brutality to an whole new level. In the end, the streets take their revenge on ""Johnny"" and he must return to her home where things finally come to some sort of an head. It's got something of the observational documentary to it this. The style of photography allies well with the angry (and ripe) but sometimes quite potent dialogue to create a cast of characters that vacillate between the obnoxious and the needy, the violent and even the loving - in a perverse sort of fashion. Thewlis is on great form, as is the rather unpleasant Cruttwell who spends much of the film in his underpants exuding a menace that ought not work so well - he's a small and underwhelming man - but it does. Lesley Sharp also works well, though quite what she'd ever have seen in the scrawny and odious ""Johnny"" is anyone's guess. That's ultimately maybe what makes this film rise above the grottiness of it's grittiness. It's not a nice film to watch, nor do I think it has any profound or telling underlying message to impart - but it is worth a watch."

I quite liked this one.

There may not be anything outstanding, or even massively good, about <em>'The Next Karate Kid'</em>, but I actually felt content with what I had just watched when the end credits came along. It turns into a sweet story, even after a fairly rocky start.

The villains are meh, a little iffy but fine... far better than those from <em>'The Karate Kid Part III'</em>, that's for sure. Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) is a little cliché-filled but still super endearing and likeable. A young Hilary Swank, in her first major film role, brings a solid performance as Julie. At first I wasn't convinced, but by the end I felt like I saw a positive journey with the character.

In my opinion, it's the best sequel to 1984's <em>'The Karate Kid'</em>. That's a big surprise, considering the downward trajectory of the preceding two. Don't get me wrong, it's close to being a not so good film. However, for me, it just about floats above the required marker. I like it, can't lie. || **Despite the heavy reviews and the public's disinterest, it's not as bad a movie as they say, and it was able to end the franchise on a positive note.**

After three very interesting films, the “Karate Kid” franchise had to continue, and a fourth film was made, this time with a young girl in place of the apprentice (Ralph Macchio was too old for the character, and he had no interest in calling more his image and career to the universe of martial arts films). It was a risky move, but necessary if they wanted the franchise to continue... but the public didn't buy in, despite the movie itself not being as bad as they say. In fact, I even consider it to be better than its immediate predecessor. With a weak box office result, largely as a result of the public's loss of interest in karate films, the film killed the franchise for a few decades, but I have no doubt that it was able to end it on a positive note.

The script is simple, but not without its flaws: Miyagi attends a military ceremony honoring the dead of his military unit, and ends up meeting the daughter of an ex-comrade-in-arms, Julie. She is a withdrawn young woman, with problems and angry due to the death of her parents in an accident. He decides to take her as a karate apprentice, it being obvious that she has a series of problems with other violent teenagers and will have to use martial arts to defend herself, but predictability is an agenda present throughout the film, which is not brings anything substantially new to the franchise. The film basically contains the same ideas and structure as its predecessors. The end of the movie is pretty hard to believe.

Despite the problems, the film brings back Pat Morita, who has already won us over with the friendliness and good humor of his character, and with an always very committed interpretation. He has always been fundamental to the success of the films in this franchise, and his funny and charismatic presence is even more important here, in a film where he assumes even more presence and protagonism. Hillary Swank is still extremely young in this film and is a long way from the glory days she will live in years to come, but she shows charisma and presence, and a latent talent that needs to be polished. The film also has the participation of Michael Ironside and Michael Cavalieri, in the role of the two main villains, both of which are predictable, flat and underdeveloped, but still worthy of our dislike.

Technically, it is a very discreet film, which invests more in discreet effects and in a clear sound and image than in more flashy things. The movie's pacing is slower than its predecessors, and that takes some of the fun out of the movie, makes it more sleepy, but it's not a serious problem. The cinematography and editing are good enough, as are the choice of filming locations, the design of the sets (in particular the monastery) and the costumes. Finally, but just as importantly, the action and fight scenes were good enough and very well choreographed, and while some thought they were too sparse, I thought they were more interesting than the two preceding films in the franchise. || Well, let's be honest, this one does clean up the problematic white patriarchy exhibited in the three other films, but it still stereotypes Asian people as....

....I fooled you didn't I? Yeah, I'm not at all one of those people.

Whatever, no one is going to read this anyway.

I do, however, feel the need to give this two stars on principle. I mean, I did remember that they made this film when Part III was (possibly) blocked from my memory to save myself the horror of it all... but that I don't think it deserves that.

When I was a kid, actually a Freshman in High School, I kind of had the attitude that no Ralph Macchio meant it wasn't a real Karate Kid film. I'd rather not see it made and I went out of my way not to watch it until I caught it on cable.

I'd like to think I've matured since, but they are rebooting Blade and...no Snipes. The same attitude applies. I guess I haven't grown.

At any rate, it's not just the lack of Macchio, it's the addition of Ironside doing his absolutely best impersonation of Michael Ironside and over-acting to the point where I'm actually shocked the rest of the cast made it through without groaning. He's kind of like Nicholas Cage without the charisma isn't he?

Moving on, Swank does an OK job of selling it physically. I mean, I'm a pretty big guy, I was certainly a big guy in High School, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she could kick my behind from here to kingdom come. Unfortunately, as much as she does sell the physicality of the role, it doesn't take a trained eye to see she doesn't know the fundamentals of even a basic street brawl.

She made up for it later in here career, but it still leaves you with the impression that she never threw a real punch in her life.

And that, combined with Ironside is enough to really make this movie a flop, even if it had Macchio in it... which it doesn't, and I'm still going to be juvenile and insist it can't be a Karate Kid film without him."
9300.0,Orlando,"England, 1600. Queen Elizabeth I promises Orlando, a young nobleman obsessed with poetry, that she will grant him land and fortune if he agrees to satisfy a very particular request.",,"Drama, Fantasy",90,1992-12-11,en,6.9,342,1.597,"Tilda Swinton, Billy Zane, Lothaire Bluteau, John Wood, Charlotte Valandrey",Sally Potter,"london, england, based on novel or book, queen elizabeth i, breaking the fourth wall, androgyny, woman director, nobleman, women's rights, ottoman empire","**Based on a somewhat controversial novel, it tackles gender issues and other deep subjects quite well.**

“Orlando” is perhaps one of the most interesting and controversial novels by the equally controversial Virginia Woolf. The details of this writer's life are known: the sexual abuse she suffered in childhood, the depressive crises, the existential doubts she experienced all her life, her bisexuality. And “Orlando” was born in this context: it is the result of the relationship between Woolf and Victoria Sackville West, an aristocrat who maintained an open marriage, in which she could live her sexuality with other women. To what extent have Victoria or the author herself, at certain moments, not wanted or fantasized about an eventual sex change? I don't know, however, I assume that Woolf's novel may be one of the first literary works to explore the possibility of transsexuality.

The film doesn't do much more than transport Woolf's words to the screen, recreating a story where a young androgynous English aristocrat of the Elizabethan court, Lord Orlando, finds himself the object of the affection of the old queen, who gives him various goods and perks. on condition that he can never grow old or die, which actually happens! Thus, “blessed” (the eventual negative consequences are never addressed) in this way, Orlando crosses the centuries without aging a day, lives in love and gets to know other countries. At one point, he is possessed by a sleep he cannot wake up from, and when he finally wakes up, he has mysteriously become a woman, and spends the next two hundred years proving that not only did he never die, he changed sex. And the years go by, with the film ending in our days.

The film is responsible for boosting the film career of Tilda Swinton, a British actress who, even before making this film, was already pursuing a somewhat androgynous aesthetic look, perhaps due to having spent her childhood as the only girl among several male brothers. . The truth is that the film contributed decisively to the actress's career. She dominates the film and gives us a superb performance. John Wood and Quentin Crisp also do great value work.

Technically, what stands out the most about this film is the cinematography, very careful and beautiful, and the smooth but consistent pace of a film that can take a while to convince viewers, but manages to do it and keeps our attention until at end. Filmed largely on British soil, it makes good use of various aristocratic houses as part of its set, and all the costumes, for each historical era, were really well done. || Tilda Swinton is superb in this story of the eponymous Tudor noble who obeys a command from the enamoured Queen Elizabeth (Quentin Crisp) and refuses to grow old. The film now follows the adventures, loves and ultimately depicts how the character adapts - quite literally - as England becomes Britain and eventually he becomes free! The experiences as an ambassador in the middle east, the determination to retain the family property when the authorities begin to smell a rat, the arrival of a child - all build upon this wonderfully enigmatic Virginia Woolf creation that defies typical analysis. This is story of humanity and of it's own reluctance to embrace meaningful change as events and the environment relentlessly changes around it. Historical figures from Othello to King James I appear throughout this quirkily engaging chronology that is colourful, vibrant and enjoyably imaginative with this particular adaptation taking a little liberty with the book by extending the timeline into the more modern era. Whilst ""Orlando"" may evolve with some Hermaphroditic characteristics, they serve as a conduit to this story and are not overtly central to the action. It's that very gender ambiguity that becomes gradually better defined as if the immortal is emerging from a fog - and Sally Potter keeps that remarkably well focused for the ninety minutes of screen time we are presented with here. It is an hard film to evaluate, it may or will mean many different things to many different people, and that's what makes it very watchable indeed."

The reason that I'm split is because of how it portrays the lead character. I completely get the angle the filmmakers were going for, I'm just not convinced they pull it off. It's fun to watch, but I never once felt a connection to root for Kevin Costner's Butch.

There are many a time where I was just like ""Huh?"". It shows a number of events that you can tell are supposed to make you connect to Butch, but I just couldn't - he is super unlikeable, like the very first thing we see him do 'on the outside' defines him and the whole film.

As their unlikely friendship develops their courage overcomes the prejudice and corruption of their powerful adversaries.,No one would take on his case... until one man was willing to take on the system.,Drama,126,1993-12-22,en,7.717,4383,3.9457,"Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen, Antonio Banderas","Jonathan Demme, Ron Nyswaner","philadelphia, pennsylvania, court, jurors, aids, pennsylvania, usa, homophobia, lawsuit, partner, hiv, lawyer, dying, lgbt, discrimination, angry, judiciary, 1980s, somber, courtroom drama, anxious, loving, gay theme, cautionary, provocative, suspenseful, critical, antagonistic, celebratory, comforting, empathetic, hopeful","What do you love about the law, Andrew?

Andrew Beckett is a gay lawyer infected with AIDS, who in spite of being his law firm's rising star, is fired on a trumped up charge of negligence. Refusing to accept defeat, Andrew manages to enlist the help of homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, whom it's hoped, can prove that the firm acted disgracefully out of fear of Andrew's illness. But can Joe throw off his own prejudice? Can Andrew keep it together as AIDS starts to take a hold? 

Philadelphia was the film to really bring the horrors of AIDS to the masses. Though certainly not the first film to deal with the subject, films such as ""An Early Frost (1985)"" and ""As Is (1986)"" had led the way, Philadelphia is certainly the most memorable of all the mainstream films dealing with the subject. 

As the years have rolled by, the film's standing has waned some what, gays have renounced the film as over sentimental gloop and various other cinema critics have accused the film of confusing its aims. The truth is that Philadelphia is only really guilty of playing it safe. Andrew Beckett is clearly wronged, and he's clearly a lovely and special man, supported by a complete and loyal loving family. It's the character set up that never really puts the film in any real danger of becoming edgy, even the strand dealing with homophobia is only briefly given credence. However, where the makers do achieve their aims, is with the emotional aspects, something that lifts Philadelphia to a far higher plain in the pantheon of emotional kickers. 

The tone of the film is set courtesy of Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning ""Streets Of Philadelphia"", which acts as a sombre portent of things to come during the opening credit sequence. From here on in the story is content with gnawing away at our heart strings and breaking down prejudice barriers in the name of fair play and adult fallibility's. Part court room drama and part human tragedy, Philadelphia is never found wanting in the engrossing department, something that is in no small amount due to the work of a firing on all cylinders cast. 

Tom Hanks is always pretty safe company to be in as a rule, but tackling the role of Andrew Beckett required much more than merely charm and a homely appeal. Hanks, winning his first Best Actor Oscar, steps up to the plate here and delivers one of the best performances of the 90s. As AIDS ravages his body and soul, Hanks as Andrew reaches deep down within and has the audience with him all the way through his ordeal. Alongside Hanks is Denzel Washington as Joe, who if anything has the more prickly role to contend with. It's probably not much of a surprise to most followers of his to say he's on his usual great form here, with a shift in his character's fortitude showcasing the best of the New Yorker's ability. Rounding out the cast, and with equally fine performances are Jason Robards, Joanne Woodward, Robert Ridgely, Mary Steenburgen and Antonio Banderas. Then as surely as Springsteen's opener had set the mood, Neil Young closes the film down with his own heart achingly brilliant ""Philadelphia"", playing alongside some video footage that finally seals the deal as to why Philadelphia as a movie exists. 

Revisits to the film show up its minor flaws, but as someone who remembers how he, and the other multi sexed audience reacted on leaving the cinema back in 1993, it's the kind of impact that to my mind can never be understated. 9/10 || Yet another of those movies I watched close to when it came out umpteen years ago, and only recently watched again.

For entertainment value, it hasn’t aged particularly well for me. I am not sure I can even describe why, except that it seemed to lack energy. There are a lot of good small moments, but its big moments struggle to live up to their potential. The courtroom scenes slow the story down in places, and the climactic scene that decided the case wasn’t convincing to me. 

Still, this was an important movie addressing the AIDS when it came out, and the two low lead actors, even though they both give an understated performance, carry the film quite nicely. || Compelling performances by both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington.

713.0,The Piano,"When an arranged marriage brings Ada and her spirited daughter to the wilderness of nineteenth-century New Zealand, she finds herself locked in a battle of wills with both her controlling husband and a rugged frontiersman to whom she develops a forbidden attraction.",,"Drama, Romance",120,1993-05-18,en,7.4,1556,2.74,"Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill, Anna Paquin, Cliff Curtis",Jane Campion,"adultery, secret love, beach, jealousy, love triangle, isolation, culture clash, sexuality, arranged marriage, strangeness, violent husband, new zealand, maori, settler, wilderness, mute, pianist, playing piano, woman director, sign languages, piano, 19th century, severed finger, mother daughter relationship","Jane Campion's third feature film, THE PIANO is a historical drama that tells of a Scottish woman, Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter), who is married off to a colonist in New Zealand that she has never met. Ada is mute, a development that mysteriously came upon her in childhood, but she is a virtuoso pianist and her cherished instrument is one way she communicates her feelings to the world. As Ada and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) land on the shores of New Zealand's South Island sometime in the mid-19th century, her new husband Stewart (Sam Neill) ignores her sign-language entreaties to carry her piano inland along with their other belongings. Feeling no love for this man she has been forced to marry, Ada is drawn into sexual bargaining with another colonist, Baines (Harvey Keitel) who offers to get her the piano back if she does what he wants.

The first half of this film is an interesting study in sexual power and the tragedy of a woman's lot during this historical era. Neither Stewart or Baines are admirable men; Stewart is uncaring of Ada's true passion for the piano, but Baines exploits her distress and powerlessness to get what he wants and he doesn't respect consent. Unfortunately, as the film develops, Campion decides to ultimately turn this into a straight-up romance novel, where the heroine willingly gives in to the roguish bad-boy. I realize that Campion might go for the common desire of a woman to feel desired, but that shouldn't come at the expense of glorifying a creep as she does here.

To better serve as a foil for Baines, Stewart's squareness is played up, and the two characters are reduced to crude cutouts of a ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". This extends to a critique of 19th-century colonialism and racism: naturally, as the man who audiences are supposed to feel is disgusting and unattractive, Stewart is keen on stealing land from the indigenous Maori people. Baines, on the other hand, as the cool heartthrob, hangs out with the Maori and respects their culture even to the point of learning their language and tattooing his face.

Well, even if the actual plot is a ridiculous pulp fantasy, the production values are fine. New Zealand's wild shore and rainforests are memorably captured by cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh. The film has a distinctive blue cast that unites the thick cover of the forest and the depths of the sea. While some controversy remains about the depiction of the Maori people here, they are still given a great deal of screen time and the ability to speak their own language on film. The piano-heavy soundtrack by English composer Michael Nyman is deservedly celebrated: deliberately anachronistic, its saccharine, minimalist feel of the 20th century represents Ada's innermost thoughts.

There is good acting as well. Anna Paquin, of course, won an Oscar for her depiction of Flora, and one wouldn't expect such mature composure and convincing emotions from a child of this age. Holly Hunter has to convey everything through gestures and facial expressions and she does this marvelously. One of the delights of Campion's feature debut SWEETIE was Genevieve Lemon, and here in a supporting role she turns in here a mildly comedic performance that adds some levity to the severe sexual drama.

Seeing it again some two decades after it came out, THE PIANO feels like a rather slighter film than I remembered it, and it is difficult to understand what drew critics to the time to rave about it. I would really only recommend this to people with a specific interest in New Zealand or Michael Nyman's soundtrack, but I don't see this as an all-time classic. || **A great movie.**

For me, this is one of the great films of 1993. The story is not pretty, and we could almost call it “love in times of mud”, not only because of the continuous rain and the amount of mud on the set, but mainly because of the rudeness and brutality of the male characters. However, the film is very good, it's engaging, captivating and really deserves to be brought back these days. Winner of three Oscars (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Screenplay), I believe it just didn't win more due to fierce competition from ""Schindler's List"". The film also won the prestigious Palme d'Or for Jane Campion in Cannes.

Set in the mid-19th century, the film begins with the marriage by proxy of Ada, a young, single mother, to a middle-class farmer settled in New Zealand. The British colony was still developing, there is a tense relationship between the whites and the native Maori, and Ada's new husband is trying to buy more land on the island. We never understand what he does or what he intends to use them for, and the film ignores these details and focuses on the couple's relationship. Ada is mute, but she has a special affection for her piano and plays very well. However, the new husband is not happy about it: the piano is large, it is heavy and the journey to his house is long, which is why he leaves the piano on the beach and ends up selling it to George Baines, an illiterate who, in a rather indecent proposal, allows Ada to play it on the condition that they become sexually involved, under the guise of alleged piano lessons. However, they end up falling in love and this will shake up Ada's marriage.

This film is really the most beautiful work of Jane Campion, who brilliantly assures the direction and the script. Ada is a character we easily sympathize with, and Flora, her daughter (the name is never mentioned in the film), is endearingly tender and naive. It's the way they hold us that supports the entire film. The melodrama, for me, is like the weakest part of the film: in addition to Ada marrying a brutal and indigestible husband, she ends up falling in love with a man who is equally unpleasant and who starts by taking advantage of a situation to satisfy his own sex needs and an unbelievable passion. Today, I think it would be very difficult for Campion to present a story like that without being shot in the public square by the most wary feminists.

The cast deserves an applause. Holly Hunter gives us the performance of her career playing Ada. Moving, suffering and unhappy, the actress managed to give her a strong personality and a great deal of obstinacy. Anna Paquin, still extremely young, is beautiful in her role and the way she plays with Hunter is truly touching. Due to her innocence and innate sense of justice, her character protects her mother, but, at the right moments, condemns her for her untimely and thoughtless attitudes. Sam Neill is effective and very good in the role of Ada's husband. The actor manages to make his character detestable. Harvey Keitel is also very good in the role of Baines, and it was a surprise for me, since I tend to associate him more with action or thriller roles.

Technically, the film has an epic, melodramatic feel that instills depth, which was nice to feel. There are certain moments where it feels like the film is doing some self-importance, but I handled that well. The cinematography is truly excellent, and is beautifully shot. The filming locations were well-chosen, and shows us a wild and inhospitable side of New Zealand, a place that, for many of us, is unknown and arouses curiosity. I didn't know, for example, that it was such a rainy place, but that makes sense, considering the location and the mountainous topography. A word of praise, also, for the costumes, very historically accurate. Finally, a word for the grandiose soundtrack, based naturally on piano, and composed by Michael Nyman. || Holly Hunter is on good form here as ""Ada"", a mute who is adept with her piano. Soon to be married to a Kiwi farmer, she sails with her daughter to his remote home where he ""Alisdair"" (Sam Neill) seems to be rather indifferent to her presence. The same cannot be said for their neighbour ""Baines"" (Harvey Keitel) though, and he engineers a land for piano swap with her husband as a prelude to inviting her round to his home to play. After a few meetings they work out a peculiarly unique bartering system that might see both get what they ultimately want from the arrangement. It's at this stage that ""Alisdair"" feels frustratingly cuckolded and things take a turn for the violent and the brutal. It's a beautiful film to look at, the cinematography and the costumes are perfect for the period and despite a fairly sparse dialogue, the performances - especially from Keitel and the young Anna Paquin (""Flora"") are quite compelling to watch. To be honest, Neill adds very little of value and I did get a little fed up with the repetitious refrain of Michael Nyman's theme but as the story develops, we are introduced to some thought-provoking issues of ownership - and not just of the piano. A big screen does this better justice, but it is a good watch on the television too."

It's told by way of a retrospective as he takes some time off from his work as butler to American millionaire ""Lewis"" (Christopher Reeve) and goes for a drive to meet the former housekeeper ""Miss Kenton"" (Emma Thompson). The theme has two threads. The first concerning the peer for whom he worked for a great period of his career. This is a man who believed in what turned out to be a flawed gentlemen's code of honour and decency when it came to dealing with the rise of the Nazis. The second featured a more personal take on his life, reconciling his duties with the failing health of his now under-butler father (Peter Vaughan) as well as his relationship with a determined and new ""Kenton"". The attention to detail on this production is meticulous; the characterisations are convincing and engaging - the unconditional loyalty of ""Stevens""; the decent naivety of ""Darlington"" and finally, the strong performance from Thompson that acts nicely as a conduit from the days of old to the more modern times where the deference and service culture that gave ""Stevens"" his purpose (and comfort blanket) are now gone. This story offers a wonderful illustration of the how the consequences of WWI started the now inevitable process of change to a social structure that had endured for centuries, exposing the leadership class - which took such a dim view of their underling ""sheep"" as out of touch and, for all their education, no longer fit for purpose: any purpose! It's a gently paced affair and that helps us to engage with this fine adaptation of the Ishiguro novel that, though applied here to the last days of Imperial Britain, could apply to many a nation in what was still a largely family run Europe. || **It is an excellent film, even if I disagree with the thesis on which it was made.**

In the period between the two world wars, the world tried to make sure that there was never again something as destructive and traumatic as the First World War. However, such decisions, very commendable but chimerical and contrary to human nature, failed, as we know: the Second World War will occur just a few years later, almost as a direct consequence of the mismanagement of peace, so hard achieved. However, the UK (and other countries) sought to avoid the new conflict by choosing to ignore everything that was happening in Germany: price inflation, the brutal economic crisis, popular dissatisfaction, the rise of Nazi radicalism and an increasingly brutal, extreme and violent rhetoric.

Lord Darlington, the central figure of this film, is the archetype of a well-bred and intelligent British political class, deeply traumatized by the First World War and more than determined to avoid another one like it. Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain and a number of other politicians thought alike and sought, by various means, to appease and reach an agreement with Hitler, after which they were heavily criticized for the way in which they did so. Honestly, I can't criticize them. Only those who have never experienced a war can afford not to try to prevent another one from happening in every way, however justifiable and even laudable the reasons behind it may be. Therefore, here begins the fundamental disagreement between the way I think and the way this film was thought and conceived.

Many, in fact, would think that the butler of Darlington Hall is the key figure in this film. Indeed, he is the protagonist and the main character, impeccably played by the always secure Sir Anthony Hopkins. However, this character's actions and thoughts are strictly determined by her canine loyalty to her aristocratic lord, and the house where he serves. So if His Lordship thinks a certain way, he must be right. And although the film criticizes this loyalty and lack of moral and intellectual independence, I prefer to refrain from doing so. Like Lord Darlington, I also have people who serve me, and I learned to appreciate and value that devoted loyalty, not least because we cannot, nowadays, put anyone to serve inside our homes. Loyalty, honesty, respect and good understanding between servant and master are, more than any contract or payment, the basis of a good relationship in such a situation.

In addition to Sir Anthony Hopkins, the film features an excellent work by Dame Emma Thompson, who makes a good counterpoint with the butler: if one is reason and traditionalism, the other is innovation, breaking conventions, emotion. Therefore, they complement each other and create a good friendship, despite being very different and often not agreeing. The film takes a nice approach to this relationship, making the subplot between the two a highly important point in the overall story. The film also features good interpretations by James Fox, Christopher Reeve and Hugh Grant.

On a more technical level, we must highlight the choice of filming locations, which built a fictional Darlington Hall from some of the most beautiful and significant English manor houses, which makes the film an authentic tour of these unique pieces of heritage and culture. Inside some of them, you can still feel the British spirit, with its chivalry, sobriety and stoicism. Cinematography is the standard used in 1993 and does not bring any surprises, although the camera work deserves a positive note. The sets, and especially the costumes and props, deserve to be carefully looked for the way they recreate the period. The soundtrack is another point that also deserves to be highlighted, being emotional and striking without imposing itself in a strident way."

He enjoys immense love and justified appreciation. It’s not just a rumour, but his name transcends to million footfalls to theatres and multiple OTT replays. But this movie is special because as a Jew Spielberg felt the pain of Holocaust and thus this was personal. Spielberg’s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine. I really hope things cool down very soon in Ukraine and somebody someday make a film on the crisis in Ukraine.

After watching “The Kashmir Files” I felt like watching the list because I wanted to see how we can make better movies without the propaganda. The Kashmir Files is necessary minus the very few political flaws and propaganda it subtly injects into its viewers. Asking the questions is not anti-national and not all JNU people come with an agenda. Kashmir Files tells many truths and ought to be told but also hides a lot of the actual/factual truths. Just like a dictator it blatantly shows only the side they want to without any iota of balance.

But Schindler’s List is different because it never lets the bleakness of the Holocaust overwhelm its important theme of fighting for the common good. The director says, “My primary purpose in making Schindler’s List was for education. The Holocaust had been treated as just a footnote in so many textbooks or not mentioned at all. Millions knew little if anything about it. Others tried to deny it happened at all.”

Keneally’s best-known work, Schindler’s Ark was published in 1982; also known as Schindler’s List and film released in 1993, tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than 1,300 Jews from the Nazis. . Liam Neeson plays very well Schindler however shows his true side that he was a playboy and so on. He was not a saint. He cheated on his wife, drank excessively and spied for Abwehr, the counter-espionage arm of the Wehrmacht (German army), in Czechoslovakia.

But the true characteristics of human beings cannot be spliced even in the most fascist regimes. Sometimes character flaws bring in real joy, excitement and belief. Steven Spielberg’s movie, Schindler’s List, while important, impressive and admirable in many respects, tries to show the true face of propaganda and mass bullshit and how an entire nation can be mass brainwashed to fuel hatred amoung it’s people and bring a great nation down. Something India and Indians need to really ponder upon.

After Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Oskar Schindler sets up an enamelware factory in Krakow that used a combination of Jewish workers interred by the Germans and free Polish workers. His initial interest, of course, was to make money. But as time went on, he grew to care about his Jewish workers, particularly those with whom he came into contact on a daily basis. In addition, helping Jews became a way to fight against what he viewed as disastrous and brutal policies emanating from Adolf Hitler and the SS. Oskar Schindler convinced German authorities his factory was vital and that he needed trained workers. But Schindler did not author or dictate the list instead, Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish “clerk” compiled it. There is a line in the movie which goes like, “That’s not just good old fashioned Jew hate talk. Its policy now” and it hits hard and makes us aware that nothing has changed in present too. Itzhak Stern, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley was one of the most powerful character more of culmination of lot of people at that time. Oskar Schindler was a great man publicly and a not so great man privately but he saved the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust and that’s why a movie has been made on him. The imperfections in his character and the nuances in the historical record only make his story more remarkable.

The movie’s budget was just $22 million. No one had ever made a profitable film about the Holocaust. Spielberg himself didn’t take a salary, calling it “blood money.” Something Vivek Agnihotri and makers of “The Kashmir Files” should ponder upon. As I write this Kashmir Files has already touched 250 Cr. Such sensitive films should come with not just spontanity but also empathy which is found in Spielberg and lacks in Agnihotri’s.

This movie reminded me of another Spielberg movies which moved and caved in Bridge of Spies. Bridge was about the fine art of negotiation and the List is about the fine art of “Gratitude” you will hear this word a lot in the Schindler’s List. I felt both the movies very similar and fantastic.

The use of black and white cinematography also makes me think of “KOTA FACTORY” both shot in black and white to resemble the dark and hollowness of the subject material. Art does make you uncomfortable and that’s it’s Dharma and Karma but propoganda does give you only the bigoted narration with giving the example that his master is always a good guy.

In one scene, Schindler implores Goeth to spray water into the cars on a hot day to help the dehydrated Jews inside. Goeth tells him that to do so would give false hope—a clear implication that the trains deliver Jews to their deaths.The lists become increasingly ominous during sorting exercises to determine who is fit to work or who is “essential” and who is not. Those deemed “unessential” are placed on the list to be evacuated to extermination camps. Stern’s name appears on a list sending him to Auschwitz. When Schindler saves him, an SS officer mentions that it doesn’t matter which Jew gets on the train, and that keeping track of names just means more paperwork. This disregard for names and particularity symbolizes the extent to which the Nazis dehumanized Jews. Schindler’s list is one that saves lives. The Nazis’ lists represent evil and death, but Schindler’s list represents pure good and life. In an ironic twist, the final list in the film is a list that Schindler’s workers give to him—a list of their signatures vouching for Schindler as a good man, to help him if Allied soldiers catch him. The saved in turn become saviors.

The one-armed man who thanks Schindler for employing him and making him “essential” is shot in the head by an SS officer as he shovels snow the next day. Blood flows from his head, staining the surrounding snow. In a later scene, Goeth orders the execution of a Jewish woman engineer who tells Goeth of a fatal construction error. Her blood, too, pours from her head and darkens the snow around her. The blood pouring from the victims’ heads is both literally and metaphorically the lifeblood being bled out of the Jewish race. In yet another scene, Goeth attempts to execute a rabbi working at the Plaszów labor camp. The rabbi stays kneeling as Goeth again and again attempts to shoot him in the head. But the gun jams, and the rabbi is spared, symbolizing the tenuous protection the Schindlerjuden had and the fine line between life and death.

The film talks about the corruption of not just money but hearts and minds too. It shows us privileges and different aspects of life while keeping humanity before profits and ideologies. Intricacies of personal and professional lives are intertwined here for the good sake.

The film ends with – “WHOEVER SAVES ONE LIFE, SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE.”

The actual Oskar Schindler died in 1974 and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. He is the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honored in this way. He and his wife Emilie were named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1993, something that would be hard to believe could happen without the film highlighting his life. 

As we all know, Spielberg and the film went on to win several Academy Awards for Schindler’s List, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also won for Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing. Spielberg would win another Best Director Oscar for Saving Private Ryan five years later, but for him what happened with Schindler would be his crowning achievement. 

Schindler’s List is a rare movie whose legacy is just as important as its existence.

Perhaps the lasting legacy of the film, aside from tolerance, is the image of the girl in red. During the liquidation of the ghetto scene, we see a little girl wandering. She serves as the person Schindler and the audience fixate on. The weight of the atrocity that we carry as viewers.When prompted to talk about one of the only color moments in the film, the girl in red, Spielberg told USA Today, “In (Thomas Keneally’s) book, Schindler couldn’t get over the fact that a little girl was walking during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. While everyone was being put on trucks or shot in the street, one little girl in a red, red coat was being ignored by the SS.”


For Spielberg, that came to symbolize the blind eye world leaders turned to the murders going on in Europe. “To me, that meant that Roosevelt and Eisenhower—and probably Stalin and Churchill—knew about the Holocaust… and did nothing to stop it. It was almost as though the Holocaust itself was wearing red.” Same repeats in Ukraine too.

Spielberg helped develop and found The Shoah Foundation. It furthered the education and established “The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation” to document the testimonies of thousands of survivors. For Spielberg, he wanted future generations to have these eyewitness accounts to serve as a permanent record. He hoped that there would never be a time we saw Nazism and fascism on the rise again. The project has collected the testimony of more than 55,000 survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust as well as other atrocities. “It wouldn’t have happened without Schindler’s List,” he said. “The Shoah Foundation wouldn’t exist.” Something the Hypocritic Vivek Agnihotri should think about. I still stand by that “The Kashmir files” should be shown to everyone without propoganda and only one agenda that this atrocities and “Genocide” should not be repeated on any one anywhere.

The film is available on Netflix. Go, watch, think.

 || There's a powerful little low-budget effort with Ralph Richardson called ""The Silver Fleet"" (1943) that illustrates just how difficult it was for those in the occupied territories to continue to do what was right without looking like a collaborator and/or ending up against a wall of Nazi bullets. Well here, Steven Spielberg takes that dangerous occupation and scales it up somewhat as the eponymous Czech industrialist and arms manufacturer (Liam Neeson) finds his increasing revulsion to the brutality of their new occupying power driving him, with the able assistance of his Jewish factory manager ""Stern"" (Ben Kingsley), to find ways to keep them from being routinely slaughtered. Getting them out is not really an option, so he invents ways of convincing the authorities that they are more useful alive and decently fed/housed - even suggesting the usefulness of children's small fingers to polish shell casings - to avoid them being deported to the now fully functioning Auchwitz extermination camp. The story is history but the manner in which it is delivered here is poignant and potent. Schindler's gradual shift from a venally induced indifference to one of active concern is well handled by Neeson's considered performance and Kingsley works well as his low-level but crucial co-conspirator. Plaudits must also go to Ralph Fiennes with, I think, the best portrayal of his career as the odious Commandant Goeth who combines just about every element of the worst in human nature into one ghastly individual eliciting a palpable degree of loathing. Does it need to be 3¼ hours long? Well I'm not so sure about that, and there are times when the repetitive oppressiveness of their gruelling environment risks de-sensitising the message a little, but for the most part the abusive and terrifying lives led by the Jewish prisoners and the increasingly perilous path being taken by those trying to help is well held together with some stunning cinematography and an untypical John Williams score. It's definitely a big screen occasion - somehow television reduces it's impact, so if you can see it in a cinema. Either way, it does offer some salutary lessons in man's inhumanity, and humanity to our fellow man! || Emotionally powerful and historically very important. This film deals with possibly the hardest topic in human history, and it does it with class, purpose and excellent filmmaking. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Schindler; Fiennes is utterly horrifying as the terrible Goth and all the other character actors hit the mark brilliantly. The decision to make it black and white makes Schindler's List stand-out and feel distinct, it is a piece of genius. In the end this film is about the utter depravity that humanity is capable of, and the utterly brilliant heroism humanity is capable of, WW2 and the Holocaust in real life brought out the worst in us as a species and it bought out the best of us, this film captures that, but it also captures the complexities of the people at the heart of the most dramatic events in world history, no other film does this as well. Top quality and a very good start point for people who are unfimilar with the nitty-gritty of the Nazi regime."

There is, in the world of sport – and for all intents and purposes, competitive chess turns out to be like a sport – a certain obsession with the stars, and their replacement when they go away. This is perhaps most visible in football: Messi has often been described as the new Maradona, to give you an example of what I'm talking about. This film follows a bit of the same logic: after having a chess grand master who won an important world tournament against the unbeatable Russians (and in the middle of the Cold War), the film takes us to the world of junior chess, following the steps of a young prodigy who could eventually be the “successor” to that famous player, Bobby Fisher.

Little note: being a genius doesn't mean being a good person or a person you'll like. Bobby Fisher is already dead, and he died relatively young, but he guided his public life and his career by unpredictable behavior, enormous eccentricity and statements to journalists that are controversial, to say the least. He held quite radical world views, he was, it seems, anti-Semitic and a Holocaust denier. Fisher's statements about the US, his home country – which he left many years ago – are truly incendiary and critical. All it takes is a little internet research to verify this.

I don't know how popular chess is nowadays, but here in Portugal it is common and very popular at school level, more as a recreational activity, not as a competition. I remember, in my school days, leaving the classroom and spending almost every break playing chess against my friends. And we took the game seriously, with pleasure and enthusiasm. We were aware of the complexity of the game, but we never worried about being ferociously good, just having fun. But I think anyone who knows how to play chess understands how challenging a game it can be.

The film has an excellent cast. Max Pomeranc, despite being very young, is a likeable protagonist who seems torn between genius and normality. It makes him approachable and gives him a fascinating weakness for someone so obviously smart, and the young actor had the ability to understand the character in this way, and balance himself in this rich personality. Next to us, we have two great actors – Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna – who give us very successful jobs. For me, this film is one of Mantegna's best. Joan Allen also does a satisfying but less interesting job, and Laurence Fishburne could have been better used.

Steven Zaillian had the brains to give us a film filled with intellect, intelligence and good feelings. The script is well written, and the dialogues are quite good. The choice of filming locations, sets and costumes, all help to build a familiar, friendly, very elegant film. There are no great effects, the film doesn't require them, but there is an effective soundtrack, very discreet, and reasonably well done cinematography."

To be honest, I remember seeing previews of this movie way back when it came out (in 1993) and thinking to myself, ""WHY would anyone want to see such a film and why would anyone make it?"" Well, about five years later it appeared on TV one night and I started watching, fully expecting to turn it off within 20 minutes or so. WOW -- was I ever wrong!

What I saw was beautiful and captivating, artistic and entrancing -- filmmaking of the highest order. ""The Secret Garden"" is a movie of such artistic quality that it ranks up there with the hallowed original ""Apocalypse Now"" (although they're totally different genres). It's no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola had his hand in both pics -- he was, of course, the director of ""Apocalypse Now"" and he's the executive producer of ""The Secret Garden.""

In any event, the cinematography is breathtaking and the score is awe-inspiring, ranking with the best in cinematic history.

***PLOT SPOILER***

The story's about a spoiled 10-year old English girl, orphaned in India, who comes home to live on her uncle's vast estate in the early 1900s. The girl, Mary, finds herself trapped in a mysterious, colossal manor -- almost a castle -- tyrannically managed by a life-stifling witch, Mrs. Medlock, in the frequent absence of her uncle, Lord Cravin. Because Mary is intelligent, independent and sly she is able to reconnoiter the manor and learn its forbidding secrets. The biggest secret is that her aunt died ten years earlier and her son, Colin, still lives there, albeit confined to a bed, sickly and unable to walk. Her uncle never healed from this heartbreak.

Mary discovers another secret in her explorations, a hidden garden, closed off and neglected since her aunt's death. After meeting the sickly and sad Colin, Mary inevitably finds a way to sneak him into the garden along with her pal Dickon. She senses that Colin isn't as sick as everyone is convinced; she knows the best thing would be to get him out of the dreary castle and the oppressive clutches of Mrs. Medlock. Mary and her secret garden are the keys to restoring health, life and freedom to Colin, Lord Cravin and the gloomy manor.

***END SPOILER***

""The Secret Garden"" is sort of a 1990's version of the outstanding ""Pollyanna"" with Hayley Mills (1960). Both pics involve a young girl restoring a spirit of joy and liberty to a lifeless community. The difference is that Mary is not even remotely the ""glad girl"" Pollyanna. In fact, look for the hilarious line from the old gardener who responds to Mary's puzzlement concerning her lack of friends.

""The Secret Garden"" is no doubt labeled a ""children's film,"" which is a shame because it transcends such a limiting category. The ending's too quaint for my tastes but, nevertheless, this is a beautiful work of wonder and deep mystery, which can be enjoyed by people of all ages -- children and adults.

The film was shot in England and runs 101 minutes.

The nicest neighbours can have the darkest secrets of all and the most hospitable and unassuming people can also be the most abominable monsters. Beverly Sutphin is a case in point.

The Shadow is directed by Russell Mulcahy and is based on the character of the same name created by Walter B. Gibson. It stars Alec Baldwin in the title role and support comes from John Lone, Penelope Ann Miller, Peter Boyle, Ian McKellen & Tim Curry. It's written by David Koepp who was a fan of the radio show that was re-run when he was a child. The plot basically sees Lamont Cranston (Baldwin) gain an alter ego (The Shadow) in mystical Tibet and with his new powers sets about fighting crime back in the states. All is going well until Shiwan Khan (Lone) shows up. He's the last descendant of Gengis Khan, and in keeping with that particular family tree, he's intent on global domination.

There's a lower tier of super hero movies that have either been poorly received in comparison to the big hitters like Bats, Supes and Spidey, or simply forgotten on account of how bad they are. The likes of ""Daredevil"", ""The Phantom"", maybe even ""Darkman"" and this here 94 piece, ""The Shadow"", are rarely mentioned by the super hero fan. Perhaps rightly it could be argued? But in spite of the tepid and unimaginative plot, ""The Shadow"" is an above average time filler that's at the least visually impressive. The 1930s Manhattan setting is excellently brought to life by the makers, and a pat on the back is due to them for not over doing the special effects. It looks and feels pulpy, and really there's nothing wrong with that at all. The cast in truth are just about OK, either under written or merely swamped by the production design, they turn up and play the movie as best they can.

Hardly ground shaking and not really pumping the blood as an action movie should. ""The Shadow"" does however have a dreamy quality that makes it worth a watch. Perhaps a sequel or a remake with a better story may just arrive one day? 6/10 || _**Genghis Khan’s descendant intrudes upon The Shadow’s urban world in 1930**_

After some kind of epiphany and receiving training in Tibet in the 20s, Lamont Cranston (Alec Baldwin) fights corruption in New York City in 1930-31 as the mysterious Shadow. When the last descendant of Genghis Khan comes to town (John Lone) Cranston sets out to stop his diabolic plans. Penelope Ann Miller plays a socialite, Ian McKellen her father, Tim Curry a mad scientist, Peter Boyle the Shadow’s cab-driving partner and Jonathan Winters the police commissioner.

""The Shadow"" (1994) is a worthy enough cinematic version of the radio/pulp/comic character that debuted in 1930. The movie obviously borrowed from “Batman” (1989), which is ironic since The Shadow partially inspired the character of Batman, who debuted almost nine years later in 1939. Anyone who likes the Batman tetralogy, “Dick Tracy” (1990) and “The Rocketeer” (1991) should appreciate this.

The best parts beyond the superb recreation of New York City circa 1930 are Alec Baldwin as the shadowy crime-fighter and the authentic look of the Shadow. Baldwin was still lean & mean at the time and has that dark side to his personality to pull off Lamont Cranston. Meanwhile the look of the Shadow is perfect (with a prosthetic nose).

While I liked the movie, it would've been better if they removed the campy elements (e.g. Tim Curry) and shot for the more serious, darker air of the future ""Batman Begins"" (2005), which was obviously influenced by this movie. Don’t get me wrong, the flick is serious and dark to a point, but there’s some eye-rolling comic book camp that plagues the proceedings. 

Since Cranston/the Shadow is easily the most interesting character, more focus needed spent on him. Instead we get this jarring supervillain when the story would’ve worked better with a more mundane rogue akin to Marvel’s Kingpin.

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot at the Universal backlot in Hollywood on five sound-stages with a five-day mini-unit tour of location shooting at Ambassador Hotel & Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles, Mayfield Senior School in Pasadena and Alabama Hills in Lone Pine, California.

While there's no cinematic equivalent to the Mona Lisa, I submit a list of the top ten American movies of the last 50 years in no particular order:

The _Godfather_, _Apocalypse Now_, _Raging Bull_, _Pulp Fiction_, _Blade Runner_, _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, _Mulholland Drive_, _Tree of Life_, _Boyhood_, _Short Cuts_.

Whaaaaaa... _Short Cuts_? Is it even Altman's best work? Well, everything unique and original in the other movies on this list was done before... by Altman. (Is there anything the man hasn't tried?) And everything Altman achieved in his career can be summed up in _Short Cuts_.

Five of the entries on my list are genre intact: gangster, war, bio, sci-fi, adventure. Lynch is a genre of his own (a master of hook and subvert), _Pulp Fiction_ is pomo-noir with a swagger, _Tree of Life_, an audacious and transcendent poem, _Boyhood_, literally an epic achievement of dedication and commitment. _Short Cuts_ doesn't seem to fit in as it is merely an observation of lives and love. But what observations! What lives! What heartbreaking affection. All underscored with a resonating heartbeat patching into so many paths, teetering on the brink of disaster and threatening to explode, which it does, in the form of a climactic planetary stroke. Nothing brings people together quite like a natural disaster. An earthquake, tremoring just enough to inform us of our place in history on the cosmic map. Enough to bring us down to earth, reboot our egos, and put multiple perspectives in perspective. Enough to appreciate the simple state of being. 

A larger-than-life baroque master is at the helm, warbling out contrapuntal narratives and swirling themes orchestrated to perfection. Multiple story-lines wavering under one very singular umbrella. And under Altman's protective cover the talent runs free and easy, playful and experimental, ironic and sincere. The key characters in one story become walk-throughs in another, paradoxically tethered and disconnected from the self, from family, community, and life. Boundaries are crossed and souls get lost. We're all the same if only by not knowing what our needs are or why we're even here. With nothing to say except everything is exceptional, infinite and empty. And life is short. Shorts Cuts of scenes stories words actions desire love loss lies lust faith wonder and devotion. Heck, I'd see it again only to watch Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin shack up.

Some movies claim to be infinitely entertaining, some maintain they can be viewed repeatedly without losing their initial charm, some insist they never age, I know only one that can lay claim to all such conceits. _Short Cuts_ is like falling in love. It delivers quietly, wonderfully, naturally, tenderly, simply and deeply. || **A huge cast full of familiar names, where each one does their job very well… but without commitment, without emotion and under a script so intricate that it leaves anyone lost.**

I'm usually very critical of movies with bad or weak scripts. It's a recurring problem in cinema. This film, however, makes the opposite mistake: the script is excessive, it has so many characters and so many interconnected sub-plots that it is almost necessary to make diagrams and schemes on a board to be able to follow what is happening. I got almost halfway through the movie and I didn't really know who was who.

The film begins with a fleet of helicopters spraying something over the skies of Los Angeles. I, who was very young when the film was made, had to do some research to realize what they're doing: spraying an insecticide to fight flies, something I had never seen in the middle of a city. Then the film begins to introduce us to a multitude of characters and their everyday stories: we have several middle-class couples, each with the problems of their lives, we have a limousine driver married to a cafeteria worker, the pilot from one of the helicopters, an erotic line operator who has a husband and children… and we follow the daily problems of these couples and families. The film tries to give us a portrait of ordinary people and their lives, but it does so in an excessively dispassionate and uncompromising way, failing to convey the emotions of the characters, with whom we have no particular connection. The only sub-plot that tries to go through the most emotional way (that of the child) turns out to be so melodramatic that it loses credibility.

Technically, this film is low-key and doesn't bet too much on anything flashy. The cinematography is the standard used at that time, the special effects and visuals work reasonably, but not surprisingly, the sets and costumes are regular. The editing work was well done, but the film, with its three hours long, becomes a little tiring, mainly due to our inability to truly connect with the characters and what we see in the film.

What saves this film, in a decisive way, is the enormous cast of great actors, and the way in which each one, in a very individual way, does an excellent dramatic work. The film, in fact, looks like a showcase of the best Hollywood had in the early 90s. Bruce Davison, Fred Ward, Lily Tomlin, Tom Waits, Anne Archer, Andie MacDowell, Chris Penn, Robert Downey Jr., Lily Taylor, Madeleine Stowe, Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Julianne Moore, Peter Gallagher, Matthew Modine, Frances McDormand… say a name, and he's there! Each one in their role, each one trying to do the best, but each one for themselves. The film works very well as a dramatic exercise and allows each actor to show the best that he knows how to do. Even so, it lacks emotion, lacks commitment, lacks intensity."

Lewis, a world-renowned writer and professor, leads a passionless life until he meets spirited poet Joy Gresham.","He distanced himself from love as he distanced himself from pain, until one woman got close enough to open his heart to the world.","Drama, Romance",131,1993-12-25,en,6.902,282,0.7764,"Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger, Edward Hardwicke, John Wood, Michael Denison",Richard Attenborough,"stroke of fate, england, brother, christianity, literature, bachelor, marriage, based on play or musical, oxford, author, writer, falling in love, 1950s, children's author","**Hopkins and Attenborough in an emotional and feeling-filled work.**

When I decided to see this movie, I knew little about the life of the writer C. S. Lewis, who I only knew from having written the books ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". And I confess that, in order to fully understand the film and also be able to write something about it, I had the curiosity and interest to read one thing or two about him. For example, I was very impressed by his deep connection to the university and his closeness to J. R. R. Tolkien, who is also the author of a great work of fiction. In fact, thinking about it, it is interesting to see how their works share a lot of points of contact, subtle similarities. But that's a thing for another review.

The film focuses on Lewis' life and, especially, on his love relationship with his American wife, Joy Gresham. Lewis was an academic, philosopher and theologian who left many works on these topics, and who unexpectedly decides to marry a recently divorced American, in a union that only later gave way to love between them. The film was inspired by a play, which in turn was inspired by the texts that Lewis wrote about what he experienced and felt.

The best thing about the film, for me, is the direction and the cast performance. The director, Sir Richard Attenborough, was known for his attention to detail, cinematography and choice of locations. Considered by many to be one of the great British film directors, this film leaves us with a work full of elegance and beauty, but which seems to be largely forgotten these days, undoubtedly deserving more attention.

The cast, in turn, is expertly led by Debra Winger and Sir Anthony Hopkins, a duo of actors of great quality and talent. Hopkins does deeply emotional work, in which we can see that he tried to employ a lot of feeling as well as intellect. Winger didn't impress me that much, but the great quality of her work is undeniable, especially in the moments when she plays with Hopkins or with her fictional son, played by a young boy, Joseph Mazello, who also deserves praise for a job well done. The rest of the cast gives the protagonists the necessary support, but does not stand out or stand out.

The film was filmed in Oxford, and we can see how Attenboroug tried to take advantage of the original places, where Lewis would have been and that he surely knew, such as the university and academic spaces. The film gives us an aroma of the atmosphere of the old and renowned institution, and of some of the ceremonies and traditions that take place there. The cinematography is very beautiful and makes the best use of light, close-ups, landscapes and the beauty of old buildings. There are no great effects here, nor does the film need that, but we have an effective soundtrack."

Based on a theatrical play, this film makes an interesting mix between comedy and sharp and blunt social criticism by allowing a very rich couple from New York to be very easily deceived by a tramp who, using the right knowledge, manages to enter and sleep at their house.

Despite not being perfect, and being a reasonably still film, dependent on dialogues that never seem to end, the film works quite well if we are open to giving it the opportunity it asks of us. It is not, however, an easy film: the reliance on dialogues, and the intelligent, almost intellectual, way in which they are conceived, will scare away audiences who are not so willing to tolerate it. For the most part, the film feels a lot like a play or something you'd see in the theater, and that can get a little tiresome.

Will Smith is the great actor who dominates the film, with a superb performance. It was a film that helped a lot in his artistic career, and that opened the doors for him to better and more recognized works. However, it is still one of the actor's best films so far. We cannot, however, ignore the inspired and successful performance of Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing, in the role of the two millionaire art dealers that Smith so easily deceives. In a more discreet position, Sir Ian McKellen is positively supportive of the main cast.

Technically, it's a film that doesn't seem to have been very expensive to make, as almost half of the action takes place inside the rich people's apartment, and that all the action seems to have been limited to a relatively small geography. There are no visual or special effects that stand out, the sound has minimal intervention, and the soundtrack consists of songs that we know relatively well and that are cleverly used. The cinematography is basically 90's standard, which makes this film a bit of a dated piece."

This is surely one of the most famous romantic comedies that came out during the 90's, and one of the films that helped to popularize Tom Hanks, showing the world that he could be a serious actor and do more interesting things besides comedy. The film begins with a man and his young son moving to Seattle to deal with a mourning process. There, the child begins to pressure his father to find a girlfriend, to the point of calling a radio program where the father tells his story, touching a young journalist from Baltimore who is about to marry a man she doesn't love.

The script relies heavily on Platonism: the two main characters do not know each other, and only the radio broadcast and the exchange of letters truly connects them. Neither has any real reason to look for the other (Hanks' character sees physical distance as an obstacle, and Ryan's character is already committed). In the end, it is the tenacity and stubbornness of a child that leads them to find each other. Based purely on instinct, which is an illogical and irrational argument for an adult to make his decisions. For that reason, and despite recognizing the film's qualities, I didn't particularly appreciate it. I see and understand the attempt to create a contemporary romantic fable here, but fables don't really seem to work these days. For me, this one didn't work.

The film's great strength is in the excellent performances of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The two are still quite young, trying to take advantage of the opportunity to achieve higher flights in more profitable and attractive projects for their careers. Hanks had mostly done comedy up until this point, and was determined to showcase his abilities in other projects. There is no doubt that he knew how to do it and show a deeper, more sensitive and emotional side that was not evident in his work so far. Ryan was also very competent in her role. Ross Malinger was also pretty good.

The film is not a great visual spectacle. It's a 90's movie that hasn't aged well and doesn't put much effort into the visuals. Proof of this are the graphics on that US map, which look like an arcade game. The cinematography is dull, and the colors washed out, but that was commonplace and routine in films of this era, and I take that reasonably well. The film tries to compensate us with excellent scenery and cityscapes of Seattle and New York, which is always effective, and with an excellent ending on top of the Empire State Building. The soundtrack makes a smart bet on songs by Sinatra, Nat “King” Cole, Celine Dion, Carly Simon, Roy Rogers and others. Most of the songs are well known and popular. || I can't say I had a fun time with <em>'Sleepless in Seattle'</em>.

Post-watching, I was unsure how I felt about it. The whole set-up and how the story is portrayed is weird, the fact that the two characters in what supposed to be a romcom don't even properly meet until the final act is an odd choice, like don't get me wrong I can see it working but here it didn't for me... especially with one side giving stalker vibes, which adds to the weirdness.

I also wasn't convinced by the two leads, in both their performances and in their suitability - obviously the latter is hampered by the fact we barely seem them together so they cannot show any chemistry. Tom Hanks is the standout but only just, Meg Ryan tries though her character is just a bit mundane; and is in my opinion better suited to Bill Pullman's Walter, even though the film attempts to show us the opposite. No-one else onscreen sticks out, though credit to youngster Ross Malinger.

It's a nae from me, both Hanks and Ryan have thankfully done much better. || “It’s easier to get killed by a terrorist than to get married at over forty!” Maybe a bit of an overstatement, but it’s the sentiment here as recently widowed “Sam” (Tom Hanks) moves to Seattle with his son “Jonah” (Ross Malinger) to start again. Unable to shake off the effects of his grief, it falls to the young lad to galvanise his dad into meeting someone new, and so he arranges a late night radio catharsis which is heard by “Annie” (Meg Ryan). She is entangled with the nice but dull “Walter” (Bill Pullman) but as she begins to let romantic fantasies about “Sam” take over she revisits her favourite Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr film “An Affair to Remember” and comes up with the idea of writing to him asking for a rendezvous atop the Empire State Building. Meantime, following on from his heart-rending broadcast, “Sam” has had plenty of correspondence from ladies but he is bent on a more traditional courting approach and so again it falls to his young son to expedite matters with one “Uncertain from Baltimore”. Can he play Cupid and even if he does, is their any chance that dad will like her, that she is actually “Annie” and that someone might wonder why an unaccompanied eight year old is flying across the USA? It’s like a short story that’s been stretched to feature-length, and though the premise is quite engaging the rather pedestrian execution from all but the young Malinger actually made me realise just how good the Kerr/Grant combo actually was. Some of the writing has an observational realism and wit to it; it does benefit from a classy soundtrack with some Jimmy Durante topping and tailing the romance, and there are lots of shots of an attractive New York skyline, but these two characters didn’t really do anything for me and as the scenario started to contrive it’s fairly obvious conclusion I lost interest. It’s an easy watch but like almost everything with Meg Ryan in, is fairly bland."

I declare _Blade Runner_ the best sci-fi movie of all time. Arguments? No? Okay. So long. Please upvote the guest book on your way out.

WAIT! There's more. At the risk of whistling conspiracies and setting off inappropriate vibrations in your slacks, you see, this Ridley K. Dick concoction is going on right now. While we're all transfixed by the endlessly goofy droppings from the web, forever staring down and swiping things on our smarty-pants phones, retweeting selfies of infinitely mirrored  selfies; proliferating at light speed, every aspect of humanity is being replicated, perfected, mechanized, optimized, upgraded, fortified, robofied, Googlized, quantumized, DNA'd and NSA'd and will soon converge to fall upon and supplant us, and Harrison Ford, despite looking trim for his years, will be too old to stop it! And the irony to end all ironies is that we, as the irresponsibly arrogant, over-infested and narcissistic caretakers and consumers, and the colossal defecators of this broken-down, flea-bag of a planet, are entirely fundamentally responsible. No, the irony of all ironies is that a world exclusively dominated by self-correcting technocratic cyborgs with zettabytes of artificial intelligence will be a vast improvement. The androids are saving the planet! AHHH, run for your life! Blade Runner is both an expired cautionary tale and emerging utopian fantasy.

Oh, you knew this already? Very well. Carry on. Enjoy your self-driving cars and virtual nature tours. || Retirement - Replicants - Resplendent. 

Blade Runner is one of those glorious films that has gained in popularity the older it has gotten. Ridley Scott's follow up to the critical and commercial darling that was Alien, was by and large considered a flop and damned for not being a science fiction action blockbuster. There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently. 

Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched... 

Anyway, that's by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott's masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It's a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers... 

A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure! 

Ridley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film's most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it's forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses. 

Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. 

Mood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn't here to perk anyone up, he's here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it's surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it's there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets. 

Tears in the Rain. 

As Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography brings Scott's masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement. A number of cuts of the film are out there, and all of them have fans, but Scott's Final Cut is the one where he had total artistic control, and the scrub up job across the board is quite literally breath taking. 10/10 || The movie's story didn't do much for me, however I did find parts of it confusing. After watching it I found out that I watched the ""Final Cut"" which has a completely different ending and different implications from the theatrical release. I didn't understand those implications...I needed to look up the ending online. Whether that's because the movie is confusing or I'm dumb, I can't say. But my friend I watched it with didn't understand it either.

After looking up the end's meaning, I did find it a bit more satisfying. But the main reason this movie is worth watching is the visuals. Not sure I'd watch it again any time soon though."

RELEASED IN 1993 and written/directed by Rowdy Herrington, “Striking Distance” stars Bruce Willis as Tom Hardy, a Pittsburgh detective who's demoted to river rescue. A serial killer returns after a two-year absence and bodies of beautiful women start turning up in the river, all women whom Hardy used to date! Sarah Jessica Parker is on hand as Hardy's partner on the river, Jo Christman.

The movie has a bad reputation. Roger Ebert tore it to pieces, basically saying it was too derivative and by-the-numbers, and Willis himself said he hated it. I can understand criticism to a point. The story has a melodramatic comic-book vibe, which is obvious in the opening act, almost like a TV production except with a superior cast and action scenes. But, and this is an important “but,” I found myself drawn into the story & the characters and greatly enjoyed the rare Pittsburgh locations, as well as the (melo)drama and thrills. In other words, the movie is entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.

This is a cop thriller in the manner of the Dirty Harry series, especially “The Dead Pool” (1988), except it’s more comic booky and taking place in Pittsburgh rather than San Francisco. It's also reminiscent of films like ""The General's Daughter"" (1999). Although not technically as good as the Dirty Harry movies or ""The General's Daughter"" due to its cartoonish-ness, ""Striking Distance"" nevertheless pulled me into the lives of the characters and, for the most part, furnished the requisite thrills.

The generically-named movie (also akin to the Dirty Harry franchise) was originally called ""Three Rivers,” a much better title simply because it's more specific, but was changed at the last minute because the marketing department feared people would think it was a sports movie due to Three Rivers Stadium, so they switched it to ""Striking Distance."" Why “Striking Distance”? The first hint is at the beginning of the movie when the title card shows two electrical bolts coming out from either side of the title. Later we observe the mysterious killer using a stun gun before killing his victims and, with a stun gun, you must of course be within... striking distance!

Speaking of the killer, one element of the plot I haven't mentioned is that this is a whodunit. Someone is charged with being the killer early on but Hardy knows it's the wrong guy; he and others are sure it's a cop or ex-cop doing the killings. There are a few suspects, including Hardy himself, but I honestly was unable to guess the right person. There's another twist late in the story that also took me by surprise.

""Striking Distance"" may not be exceptional and is marred by cartoonish exaggeration, but it entertains as a cop thriller and that's what's most important when it comes to these types of flicks. Plus it was shot in Pittsburgh, a refreshing change.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 42 minutes. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Martin Kaplan.

GRADE: C+/B- || I'll be honest, I'm giving this 10 stars because my wife didn't like it... but she liked Hard Rain.  So it's a spiteful thing.

But it's not bad, sort of my the numbers, and Tom Sizemore actually does a really good job in it.  He's certainly the highlight of the film.  And you don't really see many police thrillers about boat cops. And Sarah Jessica Parker is super cute in the movie, so it's worth watching for that.

That out of the way, you now who the killer is almost from the opening scene.  That pretty much establishes more than it should, and then the bigger hints come just a little while later, so by the time you get into the bulk of the film, you already know who did it.

And by the way, did you know that you can blow up a car by shooting a flair into the back window?

It doesn't really work as a who done it sort of film, and there isn't enough action to be an action movie. 

Basically, you're waiting around to see how they solve it, sort of like Colombo, only you're doing it with the feeling that you're supposed to be guessing.  So it's like you're at a murder-mystery dinner and no one else really reads or analyzes movies, so you're sitting there being polite because you solved it an hour before everyone else and your only evidence for the solve is ""that's what most writers do."""

The gratuitous cleavage shots or the catchphrase?

I did enjoy <em>'The Three Musketeers'</em> - but boy is there a load of cleavage shoved in your face. The famous Musketeer phrase is also said <b>a lot</b>.

This film is a little bit of a weird one, in terms of how I feel about it. It's clearly enjoyable but I wasn't sure if it deserves the step above rating that I've given, by the end I think it just about gets there. I like the plot, the locations and pacing, but it took a relative while for the cast to grow on me.

Chris O'Donnell (D'Artagnan) and Oliver Platt (Porthos) would be my standouts, I liked both of them pretty much from the beginning; it's my first time seeing O'Donnell, away from his <em>'Batman'</em> appearances, though have seen Platt a number of times.

Charlie Sheen (Aramis) and Kiefer Sutherland (Athos) are the ones who don't work amazingly in my opinion. I don't love their acting styles here, while I didn't sense enough chemistry between the two - and Platt, for that matter.

Tim Curry, meanwhile, is always hit-and-miss to me - not helped by the fact that <em>'Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties'</em> is my biggest memory of him, I'm constantly hearing Prince XII whenever he talks - my apologies, Mr. Curry.

Lastly for the cast, it's also interesting (for me) seeing Paul McGann involved - I've very recently become aware of him through television's <em>'Luther'</em>. Funny ol' world.

Sorry for the few tangents there. My final thoughts on this film: It's entertaining. Worth a watch. || They say a hero is only as good as the villain. If, by the same token, a villain is only as bad as the hero, then The Three Musketeers has, proportionately speaking, the best villains of any movie. Tim Curry and the diabolical Michael Wincott are inspired choices for Cardinal Richelieu and the Count (for some reason Captain in this movie) de Rochefort. In contrast, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, and Oliver Platt as Aramis, Athos, D'Artagnan, and Porthos, respectively, are like the Three Stooges without Moe, Larry, and Curly (i.e., Shemp, Joe, and Joe).

Athos, Porthos, Aramis, d'Artagnan; for those who have read Dumas's Musketeers saga, these aren't mere mortals; they are titans, demigods, princes of the Universe. Even The Man in the Iron Mask – an otherwise bad movie – knew that the Musketeers demand actors who can throw their weight around; in that case, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gérard Depardieu, and Gabriel Byrne (no points for guessing Depardieu's role).

Sutherland is the only film actor among the quote-unquote heroes; the rest are glorified TV stars. Sheen in the role of Aramis is simply outrageous; it's true that both the character and the actor are fond of women, but Aramis likes ladies and Sheen likes whores, and it's safe to say that the actor and the character make their conquests in very different circles. Moreover, Aramis has class, grace, and elegance; Sheen, on the other hand, has exactly what he deserves (this film was released just six years after Wall Street, but Sheen's career even then was for all intents and purposes over). As for O'Donnell, what can you really say about him?

Dumas's original novel opens with one of the best father-and-son heart-to-hearts in literature (although the gold standard remains Polonius and Laertes in Hamlet). At the beginning of The Three Musketeers, though, D'Artagnan Sr. is already pushing daisies; “my father was a musketeer”, boasts Junior; “the personal bodyguard of the King”, to which someone, quite rightly, replies: “the King was assassinated. Your father was a failure"". If it's any consolation, at least he wasn't as big a flop as this movie (which ends on a very positive note, and not just because it's finally over; similar to its protagonists and antagonists, its official theme song is as good as the movie is bad). || Ok, first things first - this has nothing at all to do the Dumas' book. We ought to be clear on that before we continue through this Disneyfied interpretation of this classic story. A way too handsome Chris O'Donnell is ""D'Artagnan"" who arrives in Paris determined to follow in his father's footsteps and join the King's Musketeers. There is a fly in his ointment, though - the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry) has seen to it that this particular militia has been disbanded in disgrace. Through a series of mishaps, he finds himself facing three duels with erstwhile musketeers - Messieurs Aramis, Porthos and Athos who all end up fighting the Cardinal's guard and unite... Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Oliver Platt are his colleagues as they struggle to restore their legion and simultaneously avert an English invasion, and quite probably a coup to replace the infantile King Louis. It's quite well paced, there is plenty of action and Curry is clearly having a bit of a laugh as the evil churchman. Otherwise, however, it's an unremarkable remake lacking much of the charm and cunning of either the 1948 or Richard Lester's 1973 romp."

Add Val Kilmer, Sam Neill, and Bill Paxton into the mix and what you get doesn't exactly scream ""A list"" but what you do have is an ensemble cast that gels particularly well; this is one of those films that manages to be more than the sum of its parts. The bond of brotherhood and friendship between the Earps and Doc Holliday feels genuine and Kilmer clearly relishes the scene stealing part of sickly gentleman adrenaline junkie Holliday. Powers Booth and Michael Biehn also make charismatic villains, the scenes between Biehn and Kilmer being particularly sharp and the Peckinpah shoot outs extremely well staged. In fact the shoot out at the OK corral is one of the best versions yet filmed. It does occasionally slip into melodrama (Morgan's death being the prime example) and the climax is a little montage happy and feels a little rushed as a result, but it's a great slice of old school popular entertainment that's a lot more engaging than Kevin Costner's pompous yawn-fest released the same year. || Indeed, sir. The last charge of Wyatt Earp and his immortals. 

Tombstone is written by Kevin Jarre and directed by its star Kurt Russell, with credited director George P. Cosmatos ghost-directing. It also features a large ensemble cast that includes Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn & Powers Boothe. The movie is loosely based on historic incidents occurring in 1881-1882. The plot follows newly retired peace officer Wyatt Earp (Russell) as he and his two brothers, Virgil (Elliott) & Morgan (Paxton), arrive in the Tuscon town of Tombstone. Here they plan to make their fortune and gain themselves a share in a farrow game at the local saloon. Wyatt's long time friend, Doc Holliday (Kilmer), also joins the Earp's in town and it's not long before they encounter trouble in the form of The Cowboys - a ruthless bunch of outlaws led by Curly Bill Brocious (Boothe).

The back story to Tombstone is rather interesting, so without waffling on and boring the spurs off of any readers I'll try & keep this paragraph short! Willem Dafoe was slated to star as Doc Holliday but Buena Vista (Disney company) said no way on account of his appearance in the frowned upon The Last Temptation Of Christ. Since Buena Vista were the only company willing to distribute Tombstone, on account of Kevin Costner pulling rank and influence due to his own Wyatt Earp movie being on the go, they had the big say in things. Then when the screenplay was turned in by Jarre it was shot down by both Russell and the now on board Kilmer because it was deemed excessively too long. Jarre was then fired as director for refusing to cut down the characterisations. Enter Cosmatos to ghost-direct for Russell. Then Robert Mitchum (who narrates in the film) had to drop out of playing Old Man Clanton (subsequently dropped from the story) due to a riding accident. While genre legend Glenn Ford bailed out of playing Marshall White to pave the way for Harry Carey Junior to fill those boots.

In spite of all the problems getting harmony and cohesion to the screen, Tombstone ends up being a thoroughly entertaining genre piece. A love letter to the genre and boasting one of the best ever portrayals of an (in)famous Western character (Kilmer's take on Holliday is sexy, dangerous and utterly beguiling). Comparing it to Costner's movie is folly, for that movie (and I'm a big fan of it) is a telling of Earp's life and doesn't Hollywoodise things, this is about a short period in Earp's life, with bells on. There's some inaccuracies, but in the main the makers do a good job of covering the events leading up to the famous gunfight that occurred at the O.K. Corall - and the aftermath of said confrontation. Pic manages to have its cake and to eat it for a modern age made Western. It does all in all what old fans of the genre expect whilst having enough savvy dialogue and rah rah sequences to engage the more youthful viewers. There's not much art to speak of (for instance you wont go searching out for the cinematographer's name) and the sheer volume of characters at times threatens to bulge the piece over the belt buckle. Yet it always manages to keep us entertained with a high energy action sequence or a sharp quip delivered by the irrepressible Kilmer. Even the standardised romantic angle involving the beautiful, but superfluous Dana Delaney as Josephine manages to have its engaging moments. Sure we ache for the next scene of Kilmer being cool or Biehn being a cocky bastard, but the love blossoming between Wyatt & Josephine, and the inner conflict that it causes Earp, really fleshes out where Earp was emotionally at a time when he was trying to settle down for peace in his world.

Ultimately it's probably with the story of Kilmer & Russell insisting on a trimming of the story that Tombstone makes the most telling point. Critically it was recognised as being too bloated and that wasn't what was needed. For crying out loud the Western fan had had Eastwood's sublime Unforgiven the previous year, so who in their right mind would try and follow that? Tombstone thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, but still it has enough nous to keep the beans cooking on high and the splendid moustache's a twirling. All that Whilst simultaneously providing some of the most quotable lines delivered in the most splendid of film genres. Kilmer's Doc is our Huckleberry, and so is Tombstone the film. 8/10 || **A very well done western, which replaces glorification with raw realism.**

I really enjoyed this film, which is very centered on the notable figures of Wyatt Earp, Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp and Doc Holiday during their time as law and order in the town of Tombstone. In popular culture, they became famous due to a short but intense exchange of fire with a group of gunmen from the city, called the Ok Corral Shooting. The incident, which took place in October 1881, was widely romanticized in the early 20th century and became a symbol of the Old West.

In fact, the shooting, which appears in this film, was just one violent incident within a long feud between the sheriffs and the gunmen. The causes are still shrouded in mists that historians are trying, with difficulty, to penetrate, and the feud continued and resulted in the murder of one of the Earp brothers and the pursuit and death of some of the assassins, in a veritable manhunt. I'm a historian, but I'm not an expert on the period or the Wild West, but I felt that the film managed to put everything in its context and respect, minimally, what really happened.

If there is something in this film that deserves to be highlighted, it is the work of the actors. We have a magnificent cast, full of very competent actors who committed themselves to their respective roles. The effort deserves our praise. Of course, Kurt Russel will have a special highlight when receiving the character of Wyatt Earp, but the actor made good use of that role and managed to be very charismatic and friendly to the public. Sam Elliott, one of those veterans with a lot of attitude and personality, couldn't be better and is incredibly good in this film. Maybe it's the actor's best film. Val Kilmer is not one of those actors that makes me want to see a movie, but the truth is that he was also very good at his job, and managed to harmonize his character's fragility and charisma well.

Directed by Kevin Jarre and George Cosmatos, the film is one of those westerns that went against the classics by dismantling the glorified figure of the cowboy, the bravery and coldness of the gunslinger and the villain, and giving a more realistic and historically credible flavor to films of this genre. The script is very good, it is very well written, and the technical work of the visual effects, make-up, costumes and set design teams was truly exquisite. The cinematography does not let us down either and makes very clever use of all this, and the sets and exterior footage, with magnificent lighting and a warm color palette that is simply delightful. The soundtrack, despite not being memorable or worthy of particular attention, does a good job."

True Romance is directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Michael Rapaport, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Bronson Pinchot and Saul Rubinek. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jeffery L. Kimball. 

Comic book store clerk Clarence Worley (Slater) falls in love with call girl Alabama Whitman (Arquette) when she turns up at the movie theatre as one of his birthday presents. Marriage is quick but as the whirlwind romance gathers apace, complications quickly follow in the form of psycho drug dealers and the mob! 

It's still speculated on how True Romance would have panned out had Tarantino directed his own screenplay, but really in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. For True Romance is a wildly exciting fusion of lovers on the lam premise with violence a go go thrills. 

Director Scott did a bang up job bringing Tarantino's screenplay to life, even making a couple of narrative changes that suits (QT agrees) the picture no end. People often get hung up on the fact that Scott had previously helmed Top Gun, Beverly hills Cop II and Days of Thunder, citing these as reasons that Scott was wrong for the material, yet the film he did immediately before True Romance was The Last Boy Scout, a thrilling and muscular actioner that pings with sharp savvy dialogue scripted by Shane Black. It was the perfect trial run for True Romance, and Scott proved to be a wise and cohesive choice for the material. He also expertly marshalled a large ensemble cast, garnering career high turns from Slater and Arquette in the process. 

Almost everything clicks into place on True Romance, it never lacks for kinetic thrills or edge of the seat drama. In turn it likes to grab you around the throat with some wince inducing violence, cunningly drawing you in to root for a couple of lovers who will do anything for each other, while simultaneously causing carnage for all they come into contact with. There's odd ball characters galore (Oldman and Pitt excelling in this area), exquisite set-pieces and dialogue so sharp you could cut a steak with it. From conversations between Clarence and his imaginary Elvis (Kilmer) mentor, to iconography unbound with one of the 90s great sequences that sees Walken's mob boss verbally joust with Hopper as Clarence's stoic father, it's a film as rich in the art of vocal acting as it is in eye splintering gloss. All that and it's a clinically beautiful love story as well! 

A wet dream fantasy of QT for sure, and if you wanna be churlish? Then there should have been more room made for Sizemore and Penn's glorious coppers. Hell we could even complain about the editing being a touch too slam-bang at times…But nah! Small complaints be damned, the meeting of Tarantino the writer and Scott the director delivers neo-noir goodies galore. In fact it's a film that just gets better with age. 9/10 || Can't believe I haven't seen this movie until now. My neighbor could not believe I never saw this movie, and suggested I watch it A.S.A.P.! I did and loved it! This is a _**must see**_ Star-Studded movie.

“Chasers” (1994) is the last of seven movies directed by Dennis Hopper and, like his most popular flick “Easy Rider” (1969), it’s a road movie, except that this one has a sense of humor, which is mostly low-key and droll. I can’t believe it’s so obscure because this is easily one of the best road flicks ever made. 

Comparable films include “The Last Detail” (1973), “Three for the Road” (1987) and “The Lucky Ones” (2007). This is just as entertaining or better than any of ’em. There’s a great story element that’s reminiscent of the soon-to-come “Pulp Fiction” (1994).

The story captivates right from the get-go and never goes wrong. It has everything: drama, comedy, human interest, romance, action, redemption and beautiful woman. Speaking of the latter, Hopper knows how to shoot women without getting overly sleazy (no pun intended), although there is one steamy sex scene with some nudity (just a heads up for those who might be offended).

The movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in South Carolina as follows: Patriots Point in Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Columbia, Mount Pleasant and Yemassee; with some stuff done in North Carolina, such as Wilmington.

Her life is a mess, but it's a quirky mess and it's her's! Indeed, just about everyone's life here is a bit a shambles and I found it quite fun as we wade about through them all. It's a bit rough around the edges, and Coyote isn't the best, but it is an eclectic character study that I quite enjoyed."
