I'm extremely intrigued by the concept of <em>'Tuck Everlasting'</em>. That's not to say it's anything incredibly revolutionary, but it's a premise that they could've done so much more with.

Alexis Bledel (how the heck is that <i>not</i> Robin Tunney?!) is enjoyable as Winnie, while Jonathan Jackson does well as Jesse. Ben Kingsley is, at least in my opinion, the best performer on display - I love the look of his character, who is elusively only referred to as ""The Man in the Yellow Suit"". Huge potential there.

After the mysterious death of her niece Katie, journalist Rachel Keller starts to investigate an urban legend about a videotape which kills you seven days after watching it. With dire consequences coming her way if she can not solve the mystery....

The sentence, English language remake of successful foreign horror film has been known to instill fear of the wrong kind in many a genre fan. So when it was announced that Gore Verbinski was to remake Hideo Nakata's terrifying nerve shredder, Ringu, the reaction in horror circles was akin to someone urinating on your chips. Refreshing to report then that The Ring is a candidate for best American remake and proof positive that remakes sometimes can be a good thing.

Starring Naomi Watts (who is terrific) as Rachel, Verbinski and writer Ehren Kruger (adapting from Kôji Suzuki's novel) successfully transfer the atmospherics of Nakata's piece to a dank and eerie Seattle. It's with atmosphere that The Ring starts to play on your nerves, because after viewing the creepy and unsettling tape itself, we ourselves have been set up for the race against the clock theme that is driving Rachel on. So as the mystery starts to unravel, and sadness threatens to take a hold, the story quickly shifts direction to give horror one of its most baddest and cruelest characters. It's the kind of impact that crawls under your skin and refuses to move when you are trying to sleep at night.

Though the story has been streamlined from its source, The Ring still has a bit too much filler in its meaty structure. Feeling a need to give Watts a quest among quests, Verbinski almost over cooks the mystery essence of the plot. However, with much relief he reins it in to stop any sort of scooby doo like nonsense detracting from the creepy sense of dread that has been built up previously. The ending here works a treat, but it is a tone down from the source and with that it's not even close to Nakata's version, and just maybe it has something to do with Dream Works wanting to secure a PG-13 rating? 

What is left though is a truly suspenseful and unsettling thriller - come horror film. One that even on revisits manages to bother and keep one on the edge of the seat. It made an $80 million profit in America alone, ensuring that a sequel was sure to follow. Now was that one a bad idea! 8/10"
12779.0,Swept Away,"Stranded and alone on a desert island during a cruise, a spoiled rich woman and a deckhand fall in love and make a date to reunite after their rescue.",Paradise makes strange bedfellows.,"Comedy, Romance",89,2002-10-11,en,4.762,288,1.7271,"Madonna, Adriano Giannini, Bruce Greenwood, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Elizabeth Banks",Guy Ritchie,"adultery, island, shipwreck, romcom, remake, tropical island, entitlement","**_A romantic-comedy that's actually really good_**

A group of rich Americans take a private cruise from Greece to Italy where a spoiled middle-aged woman, Amber (Madonna), mentally abuses the crew, in particularly the first mate Pepe (Adriano Giannini) whom she constantly refers to as PeePee. The crew puts up with her pompous antics because she's the paying customer, but everything changes when Amber and Pepe are stranded on a deserted Island, putting Pepe in a position of control.

""Swept Away"" is a 2002 remake of the 1974 Italian film starring Madonna and directed/written by Madonna's (then) husband Guy Ritchie. Despite what you may have heard, it's fun and entertaining, but also thought-provoking and moving.

For the record, I'm not a follower of Madonna; I neither love her nor hate her. In fact, I almost didn't watch this film because she starred in it, but I gave-in because I'm a sucker for survival-on-deserted-island flicks. I'd also like to point out that I've never seen the original '74 film, so I have no nostalgic bias.

""Swept Away"" failed at the box office in 2002, but only because it was barely released to theaters and critics condemned it before it was even completed. It subsequently swept (away) the Razzies as the worst picture and a bandwagon effect developed with everyone jumping into the negative feeding frenzy.

Is it really THAT bad? No. Not even close. ""Swept Away"" starts as a fun, entertaining farce and morphs into a potent social commentary and, finally, a moving love story. The movie will make you laugh, make you angry, make you cry and ultimately move you -- no kidding. But it will only have this effect IF you refuse to listen to the drivel of the cookie-cutter critics and give it a chance.

As for Madonna, she's no Meryl Streep but she successfully makes you despise Amber in Act 1 and feel for her later on. She made me believe Amber was a real person. What more do you want?

I'm not an anti-capitalist but the film effectively points out the flaws of this system. It also effectively reveals how money/materialism can't of itself give true happiness, love or fulfillment. Amber had everything but was the most unhappy, loathsome person you'd likely ever meet.

One reviewer referred to the film as a ""wife beater's fantasy"" but failed to point out that it could just as easily be called a ""Man torturer's fantasy"" or ""Man emasculater's fantasy."" Let's be evenhanded with our appraisals.

I admit the physical abuse of Amber on the island (slapping, kicking and especially the faux-rape) is disturbing and almost tempted me to tune out, but then I saw what the filmmakers were shooting for, the filmmakers being Madonna and her husband.

In our society we've been misled to believe that mental abuse is less abusive because it's not physical. This film effectively shows that mental abuse can be just as bad, if not worse.

***SPOILER ALERT***

During the first half hour Amber horribly torments and emasculates Pepe (and others) because she's a spoiled brat and in control. When the tables are turned and she loses control on the island Pepe utilizes extreme measures to de-spoil Amber. In other words, Pepe realized that Amber was so far gone -- so utterly spoiled -- that she literally needed slapped back to reality.

This is in line with a biblical proverb ""Blows and wounds cleanse away evil and beatings purge the inmost being."" Let's face it, some people are so far gone (that is, spoiled) that they literally need the snot beat out of them -- that's the only thing that's going to wake 'em up to reality. Apparently Pepe realized this on the island and acted accordingly. Do I think he goes too far? Yes, but -- then again -- I wasn't the one mentally tormented for days on the boat and totally emasculated in front of others. Regardless, the story shows that his methods worked -- Amber was humiliated to the point of seeing life from a totally different perspective, a much-needed new perspective.

Pepe's discipline ultimately brings out spiritual character in Amber to the point where she refuses to call on passing boats to save her from her exile (two moving scenes, by the way). Why? Because she's been delivered from the bondage of selfishness, arrogance and materialism; she has experienced true love, fulfillment, team-work, companionship and independence (remember, she DOES learn how to fish for herself) for the first time in her life. It becomes more precious than gold to her and she doesn't want to let it go.

Again, I think Pepe goes too far with the physical abuse (in fact, I don't believe in physical ABUSE at all); he should've stopped with a couple of slaps, at most, but the filmmmakers are (evidently) saying she was so far gone that extreme measures were necessary. Besides, didn't she make her own bed, so to speak? Let her lie in it.

***END SPOILER***

The fact that Madonna -- one of the most successful women in history and the original ""material girl"" -- utilized this film to make this point speaks volumes. Is it a sign of weakness? No, it's a sign of enlightenment and spiritual strength.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Swept Away"" is much better than similar flicks like 1998's ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" with Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. Why? Because, not only is it fun and entertaining, it's also thought-provoking and moving. Really, what more do you want from a stranded-on-a-deserted-island romantic-comedy? Needless to say, those who go overboard with the negative criticism need to get real.

The film runs a short-but-sweet 89 minutes and was filmed in Sardinia and Malta.

The DVD features a 20-minute making-of piece with Madonna and Guy Ritchie interviewing each other. It's an entertaining, informative and revealing piece. The DVD also features 16 deleted scenes.

14112.0,Auto Focus,"A successful TV star during the 1960s, former ""Hogan's Heroes"" actor Bob Crane projects a wholesome family-man image, but this front masks his persona as a sex addict who records and photographs his many encounters with women, often with the help of his seedy friend, John Henry Carpenter.

Crane (Greg Kinnear) befriends a video expert named John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe) around the time he gets the gig for Hogan's Heroes. He is soon seduced by the temptations of being a big star; ""free sex"" is the sin du jour of the era and Crane can't resist the scores of beautiful women who want him. Unlike Crane, Carpenter isn't a star and isn't handsome, but he's able to continually pick up women simply due to his friendship with Bob. During and, especially, after his popular TV show, Crane experiences a downward spiral as he becomes entangled in the web of loose sex. By June, 1978, he was dead at 49.

""Auto Focus"" (2002) was based on Robert Graysmith's book ""The Murder of Bob Crane: Who Killed the Star of Hogan's Heroes?,"" which – believe it or not – depicts Crane's plunge into sexual immorality even worse than seen in the movie.

Director Paul Schrader is a writer or director of quite a few critically acclaimed films, like ""Taxi Driver"" (writer), ""The Mosquito Coast"" (writer) and ""Hardcore"" (writer & director). Speaking of ""Hardcore,"" that film also addresses the subject of sexual hedonism with focus on a fascinating father/daughter relationship that develops between a staunch Calvinist conservative (George C. Scott) and a young lost prostitute (Season Hubley). ""Auto Focus"" may not be quite as good but, if you can handle the sleazy aspects, it maintains your attention and the actors do a quality job.

Rita Wilson and Maria Bello are on hand as Crane's wife and mistress/new-wife respectively. Meanwhile Michael E. Rodgers plays Bob's somewhat nemesis, Richard Dawson.

The DVD features a documentary on Crane's death and the most obvious culprit, John Carpenter. It's an interesting case, to say the least.

I shouldn't fail to add that I know someone who worked as a waitress at an A&W in my area during the mid-70s when Crane was forced to do traveling theater work to earn a living, as shown in the movie. She waited on him & another guy and Bob was his typically amiable self, just with a decidedly smart-alecky edge. I guess my friend didn't act starstruck enough because he didn't leave her a tip!

It runs 1 hour, 45 minutes, and was shot in California and Arizona.

RELEASED IN 1977 and directed by John Badham, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a drama/musical detailing events in Brooklyn where a group of Italian-American youths led by Tony Manero (John Travolta) work dead-end jobs, rumble with Hispanics and meet babes at the local discothèque where Tony is a champion dancer. Donna Pescow plays his needy wannabe girlfriend while Karen Lynn Gorney plays his dance partner for a big contest. 

This was a huge hit in its day and the catalyst for disco fever throughout the world. To this day you’ll see people mimic Travolta’s iconic dance stance with one arm pointing upward and the corresponding leg out. John was in the prime of his life at 22 during shooting (a great inspiration for guys to get in shape) and already popular due to TV’s Welcome Back Kotter. “Saturday Night Fever” shot him to stardom, making him a household name. 

The movie’s hit status was deserved because of its emphasis on the ordinary, but interesting protagonists and their entertaining drama, not to mention the dynamic dance sequences and popular soundtrack featuring the Bee Gees. There are several quality scenes, including one with the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge as a backdrop. Watch for 19 year-old Fran Drescher making her acting debut in a glorified cameo.    

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 58 minutes and was shot in Brooklyn, New York City. WRITERS: Nik Cohn (story) and Norman Wexler (screenplay). 

GRADE: A-/B+ || I was but ten years old when this was released, so never saw it at the cinema at the time - but boy was it big news. John Travolta was fêted all around the world as the white-suited hipster ""Tony Manero"" who almost glided around the city streets - and the dance floor. Determined to improve his lot, he enters a disco competition which he thinks will change his life and what ensues for about two hours is his story. Sadly, it's not much of a story. He's not a very engaging fellow; treats women badly, has a mouth on him that could strip paint and is constantly at loggerheads with his hard working, decent, old man. Things take a turn for the more complicated when the apple of everyone's eye - his priest brother ""Frank"" (Martin Shakar) returns home announcing his intention to give up the priesthood for a life that doesn't require celibacy. Luckily, ""Tony"" teams up on the dance floor with the spunky ""Stephanie"" (Karen Lynn Gorney) - a woman even more ambitious for a clean start than him - and that is where the film eventually takes off. On the dance floor, with the disco ball working it's magic and a collection of superb Bee Gees tracks that cannot fail to get your toes tapping. ""Night Fever""; ""Staying Alive""; If I Can't Have You"" and the more slow tempo'd ""How Deep Is Your Love"" make the soundtrack way, way, more memorable than this otherwise tawdry, tacky look at life in New York in the mid 1970s. Travolta is the star, his walk and his cocky style stand him apart from the rest of this rather depressingly anodyne story - but in the end it's a film about aspiration, dancing and the Bee Gees, and the latter elements are well worth watching."

5917.0,Tom Horn,A renowned former army scout is hired by ranchers to hunt down rustlers but finds himself on trial for the murder of a boy when he carries out his job too well. Tom Horn finds that the simple skills he knows are of no help in dealing with the ambitions of ranchers and corrupt officials as progress marches over him and the old west.,See him before he sees you.,"Western, Action, Drama",94,1980-03-28,en,6.336,125,1.0735,"Steve McQueen, Linda Evans, Richard Farnsworth, Billy Green Bush, Slim Pickens",William Wiard,"hero, ranch, trial, shootout, one man army, brutality, justice, rustler","Someday, you're going to have to pay for your way of life, Tom. 

Tom Horn is directed by William Wiard and adapted to screenplay by Thomas McGuane and Bud Schrake from Horn's own autobiography. It stars Steve McQueen, Linda Evans, Richard Farnsworth, Billy Green Bush and Slim Pickens. Music is by Ernest Gold and cinematography by John A. Alonzo.

Plot finds McQueen as legendary army tracker - turned hired gun - Tom Horn, who is hired by Wyoming ranchers to see off cattle rustlers, only to see them turn against him when his methods threaten their reputation.

As a big fan of both Westerns as a genre and McQueen (in the process of getting the cancer that would kill him) the actor, it's tricky trying to review Tom Horn (and his final film ""The Hunter"") without the heart ruling the head. Fact is, is that Tom Horn is not the glorious hard hitting Tom Horn picture that the character demands. It looks fabulous, is very melancholic, and McQueen is genuinely affecting in his performance, but the production problems (various attached directors, rewrites etc) are evident and give us a film of what might have been. 

Nonetheless, this is no stinker, in fact, it's a very reflective piece dealing with a man out of his time - and he knows it. The narrative is strong on the end of the so called Wild West, a changing of the times, where law and order is about to finally become the dominant force. Horn was the man who helped bring in the mighty Geronimo, which gives the makers a chance to not only nod towards respect for the great Apache chief as a plot device, but to also let Horn, in McQueen's hands, show us a resignation of time being up for his kind.

One dodgy ""special effect"" aside, when the violence is required for the story it is an adrenaline jolt, this is because the tone of the piece is ultimately sombre. The hazy romantic thread between Horn and Glendolene Kimmel (Evans is fine in a thankless role) is suffering from flashback overkill, but the tender feel to it sits comfortably within the pic's earnest intention. The political aspects strike the required chord for narrative worth, and the key aspect of Horn's ultimate fate being based on fact or otherwise? is deftly handled.

Poor editing and a number of ""time filling shots"" grate a little, and if not prepared for a sombre pic then this will disappoint. Yet there's a lot of beauty here and if you be a fan of McQueen or not, his turn is brave, committed and very engaging. 7/10 || _**The passing of the Old West with Steve McQueen**_

The legendary Tom Horn was a cowboy, a scout, a stage coach worker, a soldier assisting with the capture of Geronimo, a Pinkerton, a range detective and he fought at The Battle of San Juan Hill with Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders. In 1901 he rides into the Wyoming Territory at 40 years of age where he is hired to kill rustlers, but is eventually accused of shooting a 14 year-old shepherd boy, a crime for which most authorities believe he was framed. 

""Tom Horn"" (1980) was reportedly a troubled production. Steve McQueen in the title role had a passion for the project, which took three years to bring to the screen. He did much research, but was diagnosed with fatal mesothelioma in late 1979. McQueen wasn’t able to work with several directors, including Clint Eastwood’s mentor Don Siegel and “A Man Called Horse” director Elliot Silverstein; he ended up unofficially taking the reins, although William Wiard is credited in the position.

While some critics say the movie comes across as a mess and base this on the fact that McQueen was working from two different scripts, I never felt lost watching it. The story’s pretty simple, really, with a few flashbacks to Tom’s relationship with a love interest (Linda Evans). The film’s fittingly funereal with flashes of great violence and a bit o’ low-key humor. It has authenticity in its favor, no doubt due to McQueen’s research. It just FEELS like the way it really was in the Old West at the turn of the century. Unfortunately, it wasn’t shot in Wyoming, but rather about 800 miles southwest of the real-life locations.  

In Jail, Horn wrote his autobiography “Life of Tom Horn: Government Scout and Interpreter,” which was published after his death in 1904.  Horn was one the few people in the Old West to have been executed by a water-powered gallows, known as the ""Julian Gallows,” which is depicted in the movie.

The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot entirely in Arizona (Patagonia, Sonoita, Portal, San Raphael Valley, etc.). The cast includes Western notables like Slim Pickens, Richard Farnsworth, Geoffrey Lewis, Roy Jenson and Elisha Cook Jr.

Two teen couples in SoCal go out to a remote lake for some summer fun, but experience something horrific. The only people who believe their story are two local old men that aren’t quite right in the head (Jack Palance and Martin Landau). Christopher S. Nelson and Tarah Nutter play the two protagonists. 

""Without Warning"" (1980) is an obscure horror flick that obviously influenced “Predator” (1987). Although “Predator” is technically the better film, I prefer this more modest production. It works up some quality spookiness along with an air of paranoia. 

As far as its f/x concepts go, it borrows from Star Trek’s “Operation - Annihilate” (1967) and “The Corbomite Maneuver” (1966), mixing in the geographical setting of “Tourist Trap” (1979) with elements of “Squirm” (1976). The inclusion of Palance and Landau as crazies also brings to mind the soon-to-come “Alone in the Dark” (1982).   

Whilst Tarah Nutter (Sandy) does well as the lead female, Lynn Theel (Beth) is notable in the feminine department.

Christopher S. Nelson plays a likable male protagonist and should have gone on to better things, but he was never able to breakout in the biz beyond TV work and minor movies.

My rating is kinda high for such a Grade ‘B’ horror that’s about 12-15 minutes too long, yet it delivers the goods by featuring the requisite staples in a respectable manner, including a moving piano-oriented score.

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California (main location), and nearby Agoura Valley Inn (bar scene), as well as Malibu Creek State Park (lake).

In a way, this is a thinking man’s revenge film, without the violence. The Paul Newman character attempts to use the ambition and the zeal of those who have targeted him against them.

Brian De Palma has always gotten a bad rap for his penchant for essaying his heroes and favourite thrillers, what often gets forgotten is just how great he could be in crafting said thrillers.

Blow Out has John Travolta as a sound engineer for low budget horror movies, who while out recording sounds one night witnesses a car crash and dives into the river to rescue the call girl trapped in the back seat (Nancy Allen). Upon listening back to the footage of the crash, he hears two noises which point to a gun shot being fired at the car. So with the dead man in the car turning out to be a big political mover, he quickly finds himself spun into a web of intrigue, peril, paranoia and conspiracies. Can he and the girl stay alive long enough to solve the case?

Blow Out finds De Palma at the top of his game, blending the twisty plot dynamics with virtuoso technical smarts. A number of scenes are striking, both visually and in execution and the garnering of acting performances. Pino Donaggio provides an unforgettable music score to marry up to the layers of sub-plots folding together, and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond sharpens the primary colours (pic is awash with lurid pinks and purples - true neo-noir style) to give the story a Giallo like sheen that runs concurrent with the emotional states of the major players.

A sprawling and bustling Philadelphia plays host to a conspiracy sandwich, with a corking side order of the film making process. Sometimes bleak and complex (how great it is to find a true noir finale), but never over stuffed, Blow Out is both thrilling and smart, while Travolta has never been better and John Lithgow is tailor made as the unstoppable crack-pot unleashed into our two protagonists' world. 9/10 || _**Colorful De Palma crime mystery with Travolta and Lithgow**_

A sound effects man in Philadelphia (John Travolta) obtains evidence that a fatal accident involving the governor wasn’t really an accident, which thrusts him into danger with shady characters. John Lithgow, Dennis Franz and Nancy Allen are all somehow involved in the nefarious conspiracy.

Written & directed by Brian De Palma, ""Blow Out” (1981) is a crime drama/thriller whose colors, artistic style, cast and Philadelphia locations make it worthwhile. It’s similar to Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Conversation” (1974) but more dynamic. Allen plays a ditzy character, yet is alluring and enjoyable, while Travolta is in his prime. Meanwhile Lithgow makes for a great shady character.

I loved the colorful, well-staged sequence under the Henry Avenue Bridge, but started to lose interest in the second half for some reason. The storytelling became increasingly contrived. Nevertheless, respectable critics rave about this flick.

The film runs around 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; with additional stuff done in New York City and Burbank, California.

GRADE: B- || This is one I've watched a few times over the years and it's still great with each viewing. John Travolta and Nancy Allen give great performances and although it's not one of these thrill-a-minute films, it still maintains the suspense throughout. It's one of the gems for Brian De Palma. **4.5/5**"
26560.0,Continental Divide,A hard-nosed Chicago journalist has an unlikely love affair with an eagle researcher.,When they met they heard bells. And that was just round one.,"Comedy, Romance",103,1981-09-18,en,6.071,119,0.657,"John Belushi, Blair Brown, Allen Garfield, Carlin Glynn, Tony Ganios","Michael Apted, Lawrence Kasdan","journalist, camping, rocky mountains, eagle, bear, love affair, cultural conflict, mountain lion, newspaper columnist","This is not a comedy; it's a drama-romance with amusing touches  

RELEASED IN 1981 and directed by Michael Apted, ""Continental Divide"" stars John Belushi as Ernie Souchak, a popular Chicago columnist, whose controversial reporting compels his boss to send him to the scenic Rocky Mountains to interview a bald eagle researcher, Nell Porter (Blair Brown). Souchak is a city man who chain-smokes whereas Nell revels in the wilderness and hates journalists. Do ya think a relationship will blossom?

This is not a typical John Belushi comedy, but rather a romantic drama with some amusing touches. ""Continental Divide"" is one of John’s only serious roles, and he does it well. It's also one of his last films; less than six months after its release John passed away from drug abuse at the too-young age of 33 on March 5, 1982.

I'm not a fan of romcoms, but I will occasional watch them if they’re unconventional enough; and ""Continental Divide"" fits that description. There are a few minor laughs, usually tied to Souchak's awkwardness in the wilderness, but that's about it. Although light-hearted, this is indeed a serious film. It's not only entertaining; it surprisingly has a few notable things to say.

The most prominent part of the film is the hour or so where Souchak goes to the Rockies and stays with Nell. Most men will likely become infatuated with Blair Brown as Souchak falls in love with Nell. I did. Blair was 35 years old at the time of filming and has a very earthy look; she never wears make-up and never reveals a lot of flesh. She doesn't need to. She has a strong, independent mindset and yet, at the same time, is winsome and alluring. Her body has the necessary natural roundish-ness and curves that attract red-blooded men.

I heard some reviewers complain about the mountain man part (played by studly Tony Ganios). They argue that this is a meaningless and unneeded sequence. Actually the story is making a statement with this subplot. See my commentary below, if interested. 

The first two times I saw ""Continental Divide"" I felt it was dubiously named. Much of the story takes place in the mountains near the Continental Divide, so what? The third time I watched it the title's meaning dawned on me (aduh): Souchak and Nell's lives are divided by half a continent; how could a long-term relationship possibly work? The ending is surprising and unconventional, but it works.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot in Chicago, Colorado, Washington and Los Angeles. WRITER: Lawrence Kasdan (observe how the kiss-his-wounds scene is reminiscent of the similar scene in Kasdan’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” which was released a few months earlier).

GRADE: B+

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don’t read further until you view the movie).

Although Nell would occasionally meet the macho stud as a sexual outlet in the lonely wilderness, it's obvious she doesn't love the dude in a romantic sense. Their relationship is superficial because it fulfills only one purpose and doesn't go any deeper. As the story progresses Nell falls in love with Souchak, a man who is the antithesis of the studly mountain man in every way. Souchak isn't macho-looking at all; he's only of average height, if that, and isn't in very good physical shape. He is, however, an intelligent and expert writer, amongst other things. The message we can glean from this is that men don't have to be ultra-masculine-looking to win the heart of a beautiful woman. And you know what? It's true. Just look around. This is an encouraging message for guys who aren't the ""tall, dark and handsome"" type."

I remember I liked it then, though not as much as another Alda film, Sweet Liberty, which seems hard to find these days.

The Four Seasons feels more obvious to me this time around, probably an unfair comparison because of having seen it once and because I am obviously a different person with many more layers of experience added on after all this time. For starters, I have written many novels over the years, and that has changed how I look at movie plots, I believe.

Anyway, parts of this movie are still very good. There is an undeniable chemistry between some of the main characters, starting with Alan Alda and Carol Burnett’s couple. The banter is great at times, though occasionally repetitious.

Growth in the characters seems very slow usually, which may be part of the point. We seem to take a long time getting to Alda’s character’s breakout moment, which the entire film points towards. I would have liked to see more done with Lisa’s depressed character as I felt left hanging there. Interesting that she was played by Alan Alda’s daughter. And it was also interesting to see Rita Moreno in an early role, having seen her recently in 80 for Brady and knowing I knew her but not knowing exactly from where.

So it is a good film, perhaps with not quite as much depth as it signals that it will have. It feels a bit stagnated waiting for the big moment by Alan Alda’s repressed character."

In the future when humanity is involved in space travel and governed by “The Master,” a rescue spacecraft is sent to a remote planet to investigate a crashed vessel. Things go from bad to worse. 

People tend to write off “Galaxy of Terror” (1981) as an “Alien” knockoff,” which it is, but that iconic Ridley Scott film itself ripped-off every main aspect of the first half of ""Planet of the Vampires,"" aka ""Terror in Space"" (1965). So it wasn't exactly original, although it was well-done and superior. This is basically a combination of those two films with bits borrowed from ""Forbidden Planet"" and, of course, Star Trek (both the Original Series and the first movie). 

Unlike Roger Corman’s “Battle Beyond the Stars” from the year prior, there’s no Star Wars-like cuteness. This is dead-serious adult-oriented sci-fi in the manner of the aforementioned works, perhaps best known for a giant slimy maggot sequence involving statuesque blonde Taaffe O'Connell (Dameia), 

It’s also known as the movie that paved the way for James Cameron’s breakthrough. He was the art director and talked Corman into being the second unit director. He wrote & shot the arm-severing sequence wherein two producers happened to be in the studio. They were so impressed that they hired James to direct his first movie “Piranha II: The Spawning.” After that, he was ready for “The Terminator” and the rest is history.

Aside from Taaffe in the feminine department, there’s Erin Moran as a crewmember with psychic powers. Meanwhile Grace Zabriskie is surprisingly appealing (and convincing) as fit Captain Trantor. I say “surprisingly” because I only know her from roles when she was older, such as Susan’s mother, Mrs. Ross, in several episodes of Seinfeld.

Notables Ray Walston, Robert Englund and Sid Haig are also on hand.

Like “Planet of the Vampires,” this starts to get dull in the mid-section with crewmembers scampering around dark sci-fi sets, usually in terror, but the grim atmosphere is palpable and the ending is fairly interesting. It influenced “Aliens” (Cameron went on to direct that famous film five years later), as well as “Event Horizon” and “Sphere.” 

It runs 1 hour, 21 minutes, and was shot at Corman's studio in Venice, California, his ""renowned lumberyard facility,"" as well as Santa Monica.

This is a very interesting film that addresses Australia and New Zealand's joint participation in the First World War. Both countries had recently gained independence from the United Kingdom, there was no real sense of national identity and, despite the proximity of German colonies in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, there were many Australians who did not want to go to the war alongside the British. It was the English's war, not theirs. The same thing was felt in my country, Portugal, the United Kingdom's oldest ally, but which only entered the First World War in 1916, against the wishes of the English. Portuguese politicians saw the war as a means of giving international prestige to a young and discredited republican regime, and of securing Portuguese sovereignty in Africa and India. Despite having no relationship with each other, the journey of Australians and Portuguese in the First World War had the same end: the CEP, the Portuguese military brigade, was decimated in France, in 1918, in the greatest defeat in the multi-century history of the Portuguese Army; ANZAC almost completely lost itself in the Dardanelles, in the face of the obstinate Turkish defense commanded by Mustafa Kemal, who knew well the terrain and foresaw what the Allies were going to try.

Historical considerations aside, the film does not focus on military action or what happened in the unsuccessful Battle of the Dardanelles. We are taken there by the beautiful friendship between two young Australian athletes with a lot of potential, who enlist in ANZAC (one of them even had to lie because he was too young). I don't know exactly what they expected to do, nor if they did considered the possibility of not returning home alive. I think, as often happens, they wanted to enlist because all the other boys did it so. The script doesn't explore this as it could, and perhaps one of the film's weaknesses is the lack of this emotional and mental depth in decisive moments. I also missed a greater effort at contextualization: anyone who doesn't understand history may not know exactly what that battle was about.

On a technical level, the film stands out for its excellent cinematography, scenery and costumes, and a reconstruction of the period that, overall, works satisfactorily. Of course, it's not technically perfect. For example, in combat scenes there is a great lack of visual and special effects that add intensity to the action, resulting in battles that are not exactly exciting to watch on the big screen. There is also a serious lack of blood here. I'm not a fan of gore or the most visually shocking effects, but stop and think with me: it's a battle, it's war. There are dead, there are injured, there are mutilated, there are screaming people lying on the ground in agony, waiting for their own death and asking for help. The film doesn't show us the raw reality of combat, perhaps to allow for a lower parental rating, which I understand, but honestly don't approve of.

Although the film has a larger cast, naturally, the truth is that the two protagonists, Mel Gibson and Mark Lee, absolutely dominate all the action. It's worth paying attention to the work of the two actors: Gibson still didn't have the stellar status he achieved in Hollywood, and his modesty suited him well. He was a young actor, but he already had the talent that characterizes him, and a friendly smile, a charisma that makes his character pleasant and worthy of empathy. Lee is more important in the script, but he doesn't have the strength and presence of his colleague. He's good, but more discreet and less charismatic. It may have been this, in fact, that didn't help him advance his acting career. The film also features positive appearances by Bill Kerr in a short but significant role."

There's nothing really spectacular about that, but ""Happy Birthday to Me"", delivers a well developed combination of butchery for the gore-lovers, but also offers a pretty intriguing and disturbing mystery surrendering the main character. As a matter of fact, the main premise in this film is the main character's deeply troubled mind and her desperate efforts to try to rebuild a part of her life that seems to be missing inside her head. Naturally, throughout the entire film, the deeply troubled girl appears having incomplete flashbacks that develop an atmosphere full of drama and deception.

This slasher is fairly enjoyable for the most part, until the awful ending arrives and somehow ruins the entire thing. I intend to keep this humble review free from spoilers, so I won't give any specific details. However, I am going to say that ""Happy Birthday to Me"" is one of those films that promise a pretty unsurprising ending without a 'Eureka!' revelation. It is patent from the get-go that one of the characters is clearly the one behind the murders and even though this could sound, shall we say…sub-standard?, I myself, think it would have been a lot more reasonable to leave a mildly expected ending instead of this soap-opera-like final sequence. Let's see: first of all, the killer's so-called identity was only predictable to a certain extent. Let's just not forget that sometimes, the killer's identity in a slasher film looks so obvious, that we end up discarding that possibility because it looks so obvious. So if we keep in mind this simple rule, then I guess we can say that none of the character was suspicious enough to add such a grotesque twist. Honestly, the whole film works as a charm and then, all of a sudden, it's like the writers felt compelled to mock the audience by yelling 'Gotcha!' while pointing and laughing as if the whole movie was a damned high school prank. Unexpected endings are good sometimes, but I think this was just way off. One thing is to deceive the audience and trick them into believing something that eventually is not true, I'm okay with that, because there are several slasher movies like that. However, pulling such a disastrous and stupid explanation to avoid a predictable ending seems to me like a desperate attempt from the writers to be a part of the 'cool gang' of the horror filmmakers. Overall, the film is enjoyable and it would have been one of my favorite slasher films if it wasn't because of that incredibly far-fetched final revelation.

As an extra bonus, most of us who grew up watching ""Little House on the Prairie"" are going to be delighted by seeing Melissa Sue Anderson leaving behind sweet Mary Ingalls for a moment and turning into a totally disturbed teenage girl who drinks alcohol, swears, goes out with guys and… a little bit more than that. Enjoy the movie, but be prepared for the ending, because… oh, boy!, just trust me on this one and be prepared. || **_Unique, lush slasher with a notable cast fumbles at the end_**

A teen returns to a hoity-toity private academy in the Northeast after a seriously traumatic experience (Melissa Sue Anderson) where members of the so-called Top Ten circle start to perish one-by-one. Who’s the killer and why? Glenn Ford is on hand as the girl’s psychiatrist.

""Happy Birthday to Me"" (1981) is both a slasher and a whodunit, similar to “Friday the 13th” from the year prior, except with the milieu of a prep school. The lush setting, mostly taking place at night, is noteworthy and the unique perspective of director J. Lee Thompson gives the flick a different ‘feel’ compared to other slashers from the period. 

Furthermore, you can’t beat the female cast. This was Melissa Sue’s feature film debut as she took time off from Little House on the Prairie to do it. She was 18 during shooting in 1980 and very beautiful (in an on-edge way), but appears at least five years older than she really was. Meanwhile Lenore Zann as Maggie is certainly a highlight and Tracey Bregman has a formidable role as the protagonist’s best friend. If you don’t remember the latter, she’s iconic of ’80-’90’s soap operas, mostly The Young and the Restless.   

I would give this relatively obscure slasher a higher score, but it has two glaring flaws. For one, it’s overlong by about 15-20 minutes with certain useless scenes that could’ve easily been cut with no harm done, like the brain surgery sequence. 

Worse, the creators changed the ending at the last minute because they thought the original was too predictable. Unfortunately, the alteration almost singlehandedly ruins the movie because it's just not believable (I’m not going to give it away). Such a climax may work for Scooby-Doo, but not a live-action story that takes place at a 'real-life' private school. The creators should've just stuck with the original ending they had in mind, predictable or not.

Sure, it's ""just a slasher,"" but even slashers have to be done in an intelligent way so that the viewer 'buys' what's happening as within the realm of plausibility. When they're not, they're eye-rolling and forgettable. Still, up till the last 12-15 minutes there’s a lot to appreciate here. 

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Montreal, with Concordia University standing in for Crawford Academy, and nearby Hudson (the Wainwright manor), as well as Phoenix, New York (the town with the drawbridge), which is about 200 miles southwest of Montreal.

Slasher films from the 1980s are legion for they are many, unsurprisingly the quality varies and the advent of time has dimmed their impact somewhat. My Bloody Valentine is middle of the road, blighted by cuts to its gore scenes, it’s a film that has had to work hard to earn its cult following. It’s a good old stalk and slash revenger based around a coal mine where a tragedy happened many moons ago. The mystery element is strong enough to maintain interest, and although the formula is consistently one dimensional for the genre of the time, it operates well above average for the gore and blood hounds.

There’s some bad acting and some even worse moustaches! While expectation of a hidden slasher gem will only end in disappointment. But what it does it does well and a good time is assured for the undemanding horror peeps. 7/10 || Okay early 1980s slasher (with some decent gore effects, though the violence was very tame compared to today) that has its moments but really never found it very suspenseful or worse, engaging, maybe hurting there's not much in the way of a lead to follow.

Twenty years after a psycho murder spree at a mining town in Nova Scotia, gruesome slayings start happening again on Valentine’s Day. Did the psycho escape the asylum and return for more blood?

“My Bloody Valentine” (1981) was part of the early 80’s slasher boom after the success of “Friday the 13th” (1980) and, of course, “Halloween” (1978). It meshes the vibe of “The Funhouse” (1981) with the location of “Orca” (1977) and throws in a dash of “The Fog” (1980). While it’s the least of these IMHO, it’s not far off.

The remote mining town area on the shores of Nova Scotia is a highlight augmented by a colorful cast. Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn’t have the funds to shoot any sequences at nearby Cape Breton Highlands National Park, so there are no scenic shots; everything looks mundane with a lot of scenes taking place IN the mines, particularly most of the third act.  

Paul Kelman is good as the mysterious male protagonist, T.J., reminiscent of Oliver Reed. On the female front there are several beauties, e.g. Cynthia Dale (Patty), Lori Hallier (Sarah) and Helene Udy (Sylvia), but the creators curiously didn’t know how to photograph women, as was effectively done in “Friday the 13th,” “The Funhouse” and “Tourist Trap” (1979); and I’m not talkin’ ‘bout nudity or sleaze.

Another problem is that the events take place in friggin’ coastal Canada during mid-February and there’s no snow or coldness to be found. It was actually shot in September-November and looks it.

The 2009 remake, which was shot in central Pennsylvania, took the template of this film and made a more all-around entertaining slasher, but this one is worth checking out if you like the style of the contemporary films noted above. Like all of those flicks, it has quality mood and creepiness, but it’s never genuinely scary. When a slaying happens it’s usually humorous even though it’s played out seriously (to me, anyway).     

The movie runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot around Sydney Mines on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.

Whatever, it's a modicum of fun in that dated practical effects way.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || <em>'Piranha II: The Spawning'</em> is woeful. You'd expect more with James Cameron at the helm, but everyone has to start somewhere; he followed up with <em>'The Terminator'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> so he did alright! This, his feature directorial debut, is proper rubbish though.

It's seemingly less to do with Cameron anyway in fairness, it sounds like producer Ovidio G. Assonitis had his hands all over this; Miller Drake was the original director, who Assonitis evidently fired. I think that speaks for itself. Either way, it's low-quality and I hold no positives.

The editing is all over the place, there are moments where it cuts to characters for a relative few seconds for no apparent reason; notably with Chris & Allison and that random couple whose names didn't even register. Some of the character interactions, mainly early, are weird too.

How the film utilises the piranha is the big issue, though. Unlike the Joe Dante original, we see so much of the fish that it becomes ineffective; less is more and all that. And that's without mentioning the biggest howler produced: they made them fly. It plays as terribly as it sounds.

I don't have anything all that noteworthy to say about the cast, but to be honest this film's issues have very little to do with them. Tricia O'Neil is the standout if I had to pick one. Perhaps only an all-star cast would've saved this, but probably not given all the offscreen problems."

Horror 101 for beginners. 3/10 || I remember thinking this was good as a child... I was wrong.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._ || Ghostly happenings on a decades-lost lost ocean liner 

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Steve Beck, ""Ghost Ship"" revolves around salvagers finding a mysterious ship in the Bering Sea that's been lost for four decades and they intend to claim it, but things go from strange to worse as they board the eerie vessel and try to tow it to harbor.

The cast is strong, headed by Gabriel Byrne. Emily Brown appears as a 12 year-old girl. Julianna Margulies looks fine but they don't do enough with her. Francesca Rettondini is also on hand. Let's just say the low-budget ""Ghost Voyage"" (2008) is better in the area of women.

Still, the ship sets are excellent and it certainly seems like they shot the film on a real vessel. Interestingly, the Antonia Graza of the movie is a replica of the Andrea Doria.  Other positives include: The refreshing score with “Not Falling” by Mudvayne thrown in for good measure; a nice haunting atmosphere at sea with one creepy scene reminiscent of the excellent “Dead Calm” (1989); potent visuals of the formidable vessel looming over the tugboat; plus some good thrills, notably one of the greatest horror scenes in the history of cinema in the prologue, no kidding. There's also a decent revelation thrown in at the end.

If you like this one be sure to check out the aforementioned ""Ghost Voyage,"" which is a TV movie. ""Ghost Ship"" was released to theaters and obviously had a bigger budget, but that doesn't mean it's better, just that it's more polished.

As usual, Leigh has put together a wonderful ensemble cast, which is good, because Timothy Spall would have outshone anything less, and he works best when the rest of the cast is great.

The movie seems bleak a lot of the time. The secret is to allow yourself to care about the characters and be patient. It reminds me of the very early Coronation Street shows: no glitz, no glamour, just like down in the muck with real people.

If you have seen this movie already, you know the plot, and if you don’t, stop reading reviews and just watch the darn thing. The more you know about it, the less impact it might have on you.

1360.0,Frida,"A biography of artist Frida Kahlo, who channeled the pain of a crippling injury and her tempestuous marriage into her work.",Prepare to be seduced.,"Drama, Romance",123,2002-08-29,en,7.408,2065,3.1092,"Salma Hayek Pinault, Alfred Molina, Mía Maestro, Patricia Reyes Spíndola, Diego Luna",Julie Taymor,"mexico, love of one's life, bisexuality, painter, surrealism, biography, disabled, lgbt, female artist, woman director, female painter, frida kahlo","**A good biographical film about one of the greatest American painters of the 20th century.**

I'm not a deep connoisseur of Mexican painting, but I don't think I'm saying heresy if I consider Frida Kahlo the most international and well-known artist in the country, the most notable of Mexican painters. She was considered a surrealist, but she didn't really agree with that because she didn't paint dreams. In fact, I agree with the artist: what she left us, in powerful and dramatic canvases, is a portrait of her life, what she lived, felt and saw.

Kahlo's paintings look simple. She was not an academic, coming out of a very expensive and elegant school. She painted with feeling, with an art that was her own, not a copy of others, nor an attempt to follow any school or any master. She painted with simplicity, emotion and drama, in what we can call a “naïf style”. She was married, in a very tempestuous relationship, to the painter Diego Rivera, but he, although more technically perfect, is not as good as she is because he lacks in emotion and sincerity what he has left in political activism. In fact, what I don't like about Rivera's art is the constant apology for communist ideas. Art and propaganda are different things, although they can be harmonized.

The film, directed in a very elegant and competent way by Julie Taymor, invites us to know the artist's life from her youth until her death. It begins shortly before she suffers the accident that will weaken her for the rest of her life (something the film does not tell us – and it is a pity – is that she had polio as a child). The film focuses on her relationship with Rivera and, later, on her affair with the exiled Leon Trotsky. However, and as the film makes clear, the artist was bisexual and had a lot of extramarital relationships with men and women, like her husband, who had a variety of lovers.

I dare say that this is one of the most solid cinematographic works of Salma Hayek's career so far. The actress gave us a powerful, intense and personality-filled performance. Beside her, Alfred Molina also gives us a strong and charismatic work. Geoffrey Rush, an actor who rarely lets us down, was not so good as the disgraced Russian revolutionary. I found it unconvincing, and the romantic relationship with Kahlo sounds artificial, more like a whim than a powerful attraction between characters. The film also has cameos by António Banderas, Edward Norton and others, but they were misused and accessories.

Technically, the highlight goes to the cinematography, crafted with a lot of creativity: I cannot fail to highlight, for example, the scenes in the Aztec ruins, or that scene where Kahlo is treated in the hospital, with a graphic animation that remembers the artist's paintings. The insertion of the paintings is very well executed, so that we can clearly understand the connection between Kahlo's art and life. The soundtrack, with various themes alluding to traditional Mexican music, does an excellent job, and the recreation of historical times and environments was also done with great care and discretion."

I recommend that film for everyone! || _**Psychedelic secret agent satire with a superlative cast**_

A mysterious organization named SMERSH is killing off notable spies from top countries compelling James Bond to come out of retirement (David Niven). Peter Sellers plays a younger “James Bond” agent while Woody Allen is on hand as a diminutive “James Bond.” Orson Welles plays the lead heavy while William Holden and John Huston have small roles.  

“Casino Royale” (1967) is notorious in cinema and generally loathed by critics & cinephiles, but it’s actually superior to contemporaneous spy satires like “In Like Flint” (1967) and “Fathom” (1967). 

It was intentionally made with four different directors in mind for four separate segments, but ended up with six directors. There were originally 4 writers (if you include Ian Fleming’s book), but ended up with a total of 11. Welles and Sellers didn’t get along and refused to work together. It was one of the most expensive films of its day and cost more than any of the James Bond flicks up to that time.

Surprisingly, it all sort of comes together for a madly amusing 60’s secret agent farce despite the problematic Sellers being fired before all of his scenes were shot. I suggest using the subtitles so you can make out all the witty verbiage and follow what’s happening.  

The female cast is outstanding with Barbara Bouchet (Moneypenny) and Joanna Pettet (Mata Bond) leading the way, but also featuring Ursula Andress (Vesper Lynd), Jacqueline Bisset (Miss Goodthighs), Deborah Kerr (Lady Fiona) and several others, including Caroline Munro and Veronica Carlson in cameos. 

The movie is overlong at 2 hours, 11 minutes. It was shot in Ireland, Scotland and England.

GRADE: B- || Very boring comedy.
Mostly just forgettable. 
Niven plays Bond, and the story tries to be funny, but the humor is too dry for me, or too lame. I'm not sure which it is.
I couldn't follow the story line, so let us just say it is confusing. A big climax at the end is something you probably won't expect.
Still, at 3/10, it is three times better than the serious 007 version of Casino Royale."

But, at least it's pretty. || There's a lot of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" to this Neil Jordan fantasy about the young ""Rosaleen"" (Sarah Patterson). This woman is prone to vivid dreams set many centuries earlier, where she lives happily with her parents (and without her dull as ditchwater sister) and where she is regular regaled with portentous stories by her grandmother (Angela Lansbury). It's in one such dream, and whilst walking through the woods to visit her elderly relative that she encounters a handsome and enigmatic young man who wants to bet who will reach the old woman's house first! She is intrigued, but is she prepared for the true identity of her admirer? Though the story is a bit staccato at times, but this is still a rich and vividly constructed adaptation of a story that mixes romance, fable and a soupçon of horror cleverly and entertainingly - whilst subtly presenting an undercurrent of emerging sexuality. Sure, some of the effects are not what they might be and the stylised presentation doesn't always work, but the storytelling of ""Granny"" and some of her warnings about the path, the fruit and about a chap whose eyebrows meet in the middle are engagingly delivered by an on form, and ideally cast Lansbury.

The story all centres around a group of Jewish immigrants who are stuck in British-mandated territory and they want to get to Israel. Luckily for them, ""Ari"" (Paul Newman) is on hand and using a combination of British indifference, politics and guile manages to get them onto a boat and on to their promised land. Thing is, once they get there and try to stand on their own two feet (collectively) they realise that they are quite literally surrounded by hostility. There's even the odd aspect of that from the factions within their own communities as their struggle for independence becomes as much one to survive. The history of this time is fascinating, especially as it's probably not a great deal less lively sixty years on, but the way this chronology unfolds is really wordy and pedestrian. It's clearly a bit of a labour of love for Otto Preminger, but that enthusiasm just isn't contagious as almost 3½ hours really does lumber along in a stop-start manner that makes it difficult to get involved with. The same s truly of the characterisations whom, aside from maybe Lee J. Cobb, don't really engage either.

I like Eddie Murphy, I usually depend on him to carry movie given he's such a big personality.  Unfortunately the character he is playing is every bit as annoying as Owen Wilson and that is amplified as, like I said, Eddie Murphy is a big personality and this character doesn't call for any nuance.

Malcolm MacDowell does a his great creepy villain vibe, and Famke Janssen (""Golden Eye"": Xenia Onatopp) makes a great spy: I wish she had done more of it.

The majority of this movie is Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson playing some stupid characters and getting into situations that they can barely handle most of the time.

It definitely doesn't feel like a ""spy movie"" the same way that someone knocking over a set of steel plate armor doesn't.  This is much closer to an action-comedy, maybe similar to ""Rush Hour"", but not as good.

I'm not saying there isn't anything to enjoy here, I'm just saying you can flip through Eddie Murphy's filmography to find a better movie, and there are a lot of other movies out there to see."

Tim Allen reprises his role as Scott and continues to be showpiece of the film. Elizabeth Mitchell is decent as Carol, while Spencer Breslin - who is good in <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em>, and yes I like that film - fits his character well.

**SPOILER ALERT - The last paragraph makes reference to a 1940s film that constitutes a spoiler. ** 

There rarely seems to be anything in between where Brian De Palma films are concerned, cinematic lovers of all kinds by and large either trash or laud his films. Femme Fatale is no different, one critic - both professional or amateur - will have it as a 1/10 movie, another will have it at the maximum rate available. Femme Fatale is high grade stuff if one is either a De Palma fan or a lover of film noir. Conversely if these two things don't tick your film loving boxes then the law of averages suggests you should have - or should - stayed/stay away from it.

De Palma opens up the doors to his fun house and invites noir lovers to come on in and enjoy. It's difficult to write about the plot because it holds many twists and turns, it's a veritable supply of uppers and downers, twisters and benders, all sexed up and pumped full of De Palma's trademark tricks and devilish rug pulls. In truth the story and set-up is predictable, but the journey is what makes the pic ooze quality and bare faced cheek, with the director giggling away like a schoolgirl in the background.

Opening up with a sequence that sees our titular fatale (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) watching famed noir classic Double Indemnity, De Palma proceeds to homage and love the film noir world. As he uses split-screens, canted angles, up-tilt shots, shadow plays etc, the narrative pulses with eroticism and impending cruelty, this really is a femme fatale based movie of the grandest kind. As events unfurl, with hapless photographer Nicola Bardo (a fun packed Antonio Banderas) caught in the web, Ryuichi Sakamoto's magnificent classical based score swirls around like some sort of peeping tom. The latter of which finds a shifty accomplice in Thierry Arbogast's noir photography.

It's a picture awash with dupes, dopes and vengeful criminals, where the themes of identity, duality, sexuality and distorted perceptions gnaw away at those investing fully in the viewing experience. Some critics (prof and amat) have lazily likened the film to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, as if De Palma in 6 short months watched Lynch's movie and then knocked this film out! The copy-cat charge as funny as the rug-pull that De Palma pulls here. Besides, as any film noir lover will tell you, this has more in keeping with Fritz Lang's 1944 noirer ""The Woman in the Window"" than Lynch's film, which is no bad thing at all, and De Palma knew that. 8/10 || ** Contains spoilers **

Lower tier movie from De Palma that has some good direction and acting was... okay, but the ending still never quite worked even after seeing this again (third time if I recall). The whole it was all a dream felt like a cheat. On the other hand, as mainstream erotic-thrillers go, it's worth a watch if you're interested in that subgenre, it's not a bad way to spend 2 hours. **3.0/5**"

The quality in this film is vastly superior to the first in terms of CGI and acting, which is par for the course as the main trio grows into their roles and as actors. It is evident that the CGI team had adequate time before this film's release because for 2002 the effects are spectacular. From Dobby the Elf to the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, this movie nails creature models and creates very believable interactions between the models and the actors.

Despite this film not having the impact in terms of discovering the magical world of Hogwarts for the first time, the story is able to improve upon its predecessor delivering an all-around stronger plot. There is a real sense of mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets and the suspense and hysteria it creates around Hogwarts is very intriguing. The stakes and the plot progression feel elevated here, creating a more seamless experience.

Like previously stated, the main casts acting is improved drastically. Each actor is coming into their own and really is getting comfortable with their character. Rupert Grint steals the show with his comedic timing and cowardly presence. Emma Watson is great again but does not carry the entire trio like she had to in the previous film. There are plenty of new additions this time around and all of them were splendid. I particularly liked Dobby and Gilderoy Lockhart.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets improves upon the first in almost every aspect, and that is all you can ask for a sequel.

**Score:** _79%_ | 
**Verdict:** _Great_ || This second book in JK Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series sees our trio of wizarding weans start to develop a much closer relationship with each other; and we begin to realise the challenges young ""Harry"" (Daniel Radcliffe) is to face as he grows up. This is much more sinister than the opener; Alan Rickman's ""Prof. Snape"" starts to come into his own as his evil nemesis v Maggie Smith as his professional proponent and ""Dumbledore"" (Richard Harris) starts to develop more as a character too. I could possibly have done without ""Moaning Myrtle"" but the story is well adapted and moves along quickly, with a little more humour than the original too. Again, the score and effects are hugely complementary to what is simply a cracking fantasy adventure story."

He is somewhat younger and his character as Lt. Col. Kirby Yorke is a bit more emotional than the characters that he often played and there is a bit more romance in this movie as well. At least in my experience with John Wayne’s movies.

I was not sure if I was going to like this movie so much since it is generally put in the Romance genre as well as the Western genre. However I can without a doubt say that I did indeed like it quite a lot. It is still a good old-fashioned Western movie with brawls, fistfights and a lot of shooting. John Wayne is great in his role and a lot of the supporting characters are very enjoyable. I especially liked the old Sgt. Major and I would have liked there to be a more official scene of forgiveness between Mrs. Yorke and him. There were a lot of nice interaction between the Sgt. Major as well as between other characters in the movie. At times the movie was really funny due to these interactions between several of the rather original characters in the movie.

To my understanding John Ford was more or less forced by Republic Pictures into making this movie in exchange for his pet project, The Quiet Man, to be produced. I would say that this was a good move by the movie company even though the movie was produced as a low-budget movie even by the standards at the time.

The only thing I feel sorry about is that it was shot in black & white. As is often the case in good old Western movies there are a fair share of lovely nature scenery and I think some of that would have been much better in full color.

Oh by the way, one thing puzzles me. Why on earth did they make a movie poster with John Wayne without a mustache when he is having one throughout the whole movie? || More artistry from the maestro.

The final piece of John Ford's cavalry trilogy is a fine portrait of the old west and the soldiers who operated at that time. Much like She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, this film continues with the central theme of human focus, getting close and real to what makes these folks tick, all laid out on Ford's wild frontier portrait. 

This offering throws up a number of emotions by splicing Western staple conventions. We have a special war time romance (the excellent John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara), a fair dash of humour (hats off to Ben Johnson), and some delightful tunes brought to us by Sons Of The Pioneers. But ultimately it's the realistic feel to the film that makes it so special. There is no overkill of the subjects, it is painted as hard grind, not all whooping in the air and shooting the enemy - with the camera work from Ford able to bring it all vividly to life. What we ultimately get is a post civil war tale that looks great and beats a sound and true heart. 8/10

Footnote: The whole trilogy isn't for those seeking out good old shoot 'em ups in the Wild West, it is for those looking for involvement into a past that has long since gone, but thankfully one that is kept vividly alive by such directing masters like Ford. || ""Col. Yorke"" (John Wayne) has enough on his plate fighting the marauding Apache when his son ""Jeff"" (Claude Jarman Jr) arrives at his post, only to be followed shortly thereafter by the man's mother ""Kathleen"" (Maureen O'Hara) determined to buy him out. Let's just say that marital relations are a bit strained, and that the youngster has no intentions of leaving his post and so the seeds of slightly comedic discord are sown as mother and father bicker their way back into love. The film itself is all just a bit predictable, but there's a fun dynamic between Wayne and O'Hara and a solid supporting cast offering entertaining roles for Chill Wills; Victor McLaglen as the snifter loving ""Quicannon"" and Fred Kennedy as the gargantuan ""Trooper Heinze"". There's plenty of action and the stars make sure that what ""romance"" there is, is presented in feisty and stroppy a fashion with the bare minimum of anything remotely sentimental. John Ford knew how to cast and make an entertaining western and he does it well here."

Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause play the two youths while Nana Coburn is also on hand.

“Return to the Blue Lagoon” (1991) is the sequel to the 1980 hit movie, but bombed at the box office, likely because it’s basically a retread. I prefer this one for various reasons; including the entertaining last act and the simple fact that I favor Milla over Brooke Shields (the latter never did anything for me). Both movies were based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole’s trilogy, although this one deviates more than the first.

There are similarities to Edgar Rice Burroughs’ “Tarzan of the Apes,” which suggests that Burroughs was influenced by “The Blue Lagoon” since it debuted in 1908, four years before “Tarzan” (although Burroughs claims that his only inspiration was the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus). (Why Sure!).

This is a well done and realistic island drama/adventure/romance and doesn’t deserve its bad rap. If you like movies involving castaways, like “Mysterious Island” (1961), “Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan” (1984) and “Six Days Seven Nights” (1998), it’s a must. This one just lacks the fantasy or farcical elements and is more akin to “Crusoe” (1988) and “Lord of the Flies” (1990).

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot on Taveuni Island, Fiji.

Thief is written and directed by Michael Mann, who adapts the screenplay form the novel ""The Home Invaders"" written by Frank Hohimer. It stars James Caan, Tuesday Weld, Robert Prosky, James Belushi and Willie Nelson. Music is by Tangerine Dream and cinematography by Donald Thorin. 

Frank (Caan) is a tough ex-con and expert jewel thief. He's working his way out to a normal life, but after being lured to a big job for the mob, he finds plans on both sides severely altered. 

For his first full length theatrical feature, Michael Mann announced himself to the film world with some distinction, and in the process showed everyone what style of film making makes him tick. Thief is a film of stylised grit, visually, thematically and narratively. Set and filmed in Chicago, Mann, aided by Thorin, shoots the story through pure neo-noir filters. 

At nighttime it is all a beautifully neon drenched haze, where the streets shimmer with dampness, a dampness brought about by the rain and god knows what else! By day there's a sweaty hue, a feeling that the heat is well and truly on, that even in daylight Frank isn't safe, his dreams may be a touch too far to reach. And no matter what the scene or scenario, Tangerine Dream are laying over the top a throbbing pulse beat, it's like The Warriors trying to get back to Coney Island, the music has a sense of dread about it, that danger is at every corner. 

This part of Chicago stinks, it's a vile and corrupt place. Dirty cops everywhere, underworld criminals ruling the roost - Hell! You can even buy a baby if you want one. Is it any wonder that Frank just wants to settle down with a wife and child, to walk barefooted in the sea, to have domesticity? But Frank, as smart, tough and savvy as he is, seems to thrive on the edge of things, with Mann giving him earthy and honest dialogue to engage us with, marking him out as an identifiable everyman protagonist who just happens to be an exceptional thief. 

Mann's attention to detail is on show straight away, none more so than with the two key safe cracking jobs that are undertaken. Using genuine jewel thieves as technical advisers on the film, these sequences ooze realism, from the tools used, the pre-planning and the execution of the takes, it smacks of reality and does justice to the genuine feel of the characterisations brought alive by the superb cast. And finally Mann delivers a finale of ambiguity, a noir shaded piece of abruptness, an ending that perfectly fits the whole production. 9/10 || Seen this one before but decided to do another watch at random. Really great crime-thriller with James Caan perfect alongside Michael Mann's masterful direction and writing. Not quite to the level of something like Heat but probably just below. One of the best heist films ever of the ones I've seen. **4.5/5**"

Still I wish it wasn't Brosnan's last one--and though Craig was truly a refreshing change in his realistic tone that hearkened back to the great days of Connery, that too got old, even for the actor himself. || Sigh Another Way. 

Die Another Day is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Neil Purvis and Robert Wade. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, Toby Stephens, Rick Yune, Rosamund Pike, John Cleese, Judi Dench and Michael Madsen. Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by David Tattersall.

Bond 20 and 007 is captured and tortured by the North Koreans after being betrayed by an MI6 mole. After being exchanged for a deadly enemy operative, Bond has his 007 status revoked and is forced to go rogue to find who the mole is.

As the Bond franchise celebrated 40 years of being, the film to mark the occasion, ironically, forgot the subtle ingredients that make up the best Bond movies. What we get is a chaotic movie, excess is the order of the day, with Eon allowing Tamahori to stack up scene after scene of video game standard ideas. There is no lack of effort here, the heart is full of good intentions, but some big cheese in a suit should have reined the director in. It's also a sad day in the Bond universe when a Bond film uses homage's to homage itself, only for that idea to tire itself out as well. There is barely any time for reflective silences, for a show of character depth, on the odd occasion the film slows down, gasping for air, Tamahori rushes into the next bit of noise annoys. While the action is often as laughable as the dialogue. This may have made a pot load of cash, but few serious Bond fans would have returned to see this again at the cinema. It's Bond for the non Bond fans, a lazy popcorn no brain for the gamers who just want crash, bang and wallop with no substance. Ssshh, did someone say Batman & Robin?

As the film unfolds in a blur of sledgehammer editing and lack of restraint, not to forget CGI that is shameful, the cast struggle to keep the good ship Bond afloat. Brosnan is on smug auto-pilot, this film proving to be a sad farewell for him from a role he had previously graced with some distinction. Berry is gorgeous but looks awkward with the action scenes and can't carry off the chirpy aspects of the script, though in her defence she's not done any favours by the writers and Tamahori is more concerned with showcasing her twin assets. Pike is OK, sexy and feisty, if a little difficult to accept as a MI6 agent. Stephens, who went on to do very good acting work later in his career, hams it up for all he is worth. Meant to be a shadow characterisation of Bond, Stephens plays Gustav Graves as some posh cartoon character from a Brit sit-com, a world away from the much needed dastard villain opposing Bond. His motives unclear and a victim of one of the film's more berserker twists. Yune is fun with his diamond studded face and old pros Cleese and Dench at least come out of it with reputations still intact. While Madsen is criminally underused.

Elsewhere on a technical front there's also not much to shout about. Madonna's title song, the worst in the series by far, is only beaten in awfulness by her cameo in the film. Tattersall's photography barely registers above the ordinary, with sub-standard location filming not helping either, and Arnold's score is about as far removed from Bond flavours as it can get. There are some good scenes within, a machismo pumped sword fight between Bond and Graves and a laser beam (hello Goldfinger my old friend) dodging fist fight stand tall above the messy quagmire, but the memory of the good sequences are quickly vanquished once the ""invisible car"" is put to field duty use! And with that there really is no more to say about the ""quality"" of Die Another Day. For Bond fans it's about a 5/10 movie, for casual blockbuster fans after a cheap thrill it will no doubt score higher. || _**One of the top two in Brosnan's stint**_

Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) is sent to North Korea to investigate a colonel illegally trading weapons for African blood diamonds. The trail eventually leads from Hong Kong to Cuba where Bond meets Jinx (Halle Berry) and infiltrates a gene therapy clinic in a veritable fortress off the coast. Next, Bond has a thrilling fencing match at a swank club in London with the main villain (Toby Stephens). The final act switches to an incredible ice palace in Iceland and back to Korea. Rick Yune is on hand as the secondary villain, Zao.

""Die Another Day"" (2002) was Pierce Brosnan's fourth and final performance as James Bond and it has the most pizazz of his four movies by far. Its heightened comic book-ness gives it a bad rap, but that’s what makes it stand out from the previous two installments, which had a muted palette and were somewhat forgettable (although entertaining enough). The villains are more memorable in this one and the Bond women are certainly acceptable. The best part of the film, for me, is the over-the-top sword fight at the manor. Although it's so overdone it's somewhat goofy, it may very well be the best sword fight in the history of cinema.

The second half, which mostly takes place in Iceland, has several good action sequences as well, even goofier than the sword fight, like the iceberg tsunami on which Bond surfs (Why Sure!). But it's not like this is the first time an action scene was totally ludicrous in a Bond picture (Remember the ‘Bat Boat’ in the opening of “The World is Not Enough”?).

The first time I saw Brosnan my initial thought was, ""He'd make a great Bond,” and so he does; but it's a different Bond than Connery or Moore and it takes time to get used to him.

Madonna sings the title song (and has a cameo). 

The film runs 2 hours, 13 minutes, and was shot in Maui, Hawaii (opening surfing scene); England (including as a stand-in for Korea); Andalucía, Spain (Cuba); Austurland, Iceland, and Norway (ice car chase and ice palace environs).

A masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned. Long read ahead!

Film and reviews are all about opinions, which is only a positive thing. I, for one, though have yet to find a better animation than this. No doubt I'm probably partly clouded by nostalgia, but even a tonne of years later I still remember how blown away I was when I first watched it. Nothing's changed.

Where to start? I love every single detail about this film, for which there are many. Not only does it improve upon the studio's earlier 1950 production about Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel, but it manages to create an incredibly touching, amusing and rather thrilling story for all. They don't rely on the usual, overdone Disney front and center romance to do it either.

It's a story of a young kid coming-of-age into the world. You really go on a journey with Jim Hawkins, who hadn't had the most happiest childhood. We see him grow into a man across just 95 short minutes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings Jim to life superbly, no surprise to see he has done other great things in his career.

Gordon-Levitt isn't the only outstanding performer here, with Brian Murray and Emma Thompson showing their talents in the roles of John Silver and Capt. Amelia. I adore the dynamic between Silver and Hawkins, Murray is truly brilliant. Thompson is great in her role, also.

Even below those aforementioned names, you have memorable characters in Delbert (David Hyde Pierce), B.E.N. (Martin Short) and Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne). Morph (Dane Davis) is a cracking little sidekick, too.

Away from the cast, you also have the sensational animation. They mix hand-drawn 2D and computer generated 3D, which comes out exquisitely. Sure some of it hasn't aged impeccably compared to now, but it all to this day still looks utterly stunning. I love the attention to detail.

That's not all. How about that music? I couldn't tell you the amount of times I've listened to that soundtrack down the years, it's so beautifully crafted by James Newton Howard and John Rzeznik; the latter's, as part of the Goo Goo Dolls, ""I'm Still Here"" fits so, so well.

Can you tell how much fondness I hold for this? It's fantastic! Did Disney mishandle it? Sure. Does it deserves more respect? Definitely. However, I'm kinda glad they just let Ron Clements and John Musker do their thing. Heavy Disney interference could've ruined it. The fact this has zero pointless sequels is marvellous, even if it's for the wrong reasons.

There are minor rumours they plan to live-action this. Normally I'd argue against classics being remade, but I think this 2002 production is in a win-win position in that regard. If it's a big success it'll be good for it, if it's terrible then it'll put more eyes on the original.

It's kinda funny, I don't see myself as a Disney fan and yet my two favourites films (this + <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</em>) are from this studio - and both pirate-y, interestingly. Hmm.

Go watch <em>'Treasure Planet'</em>! || Loosely based on one of my favourite stories, this version of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" sees the young Jim Hawkins on a magical adventure on a space galleon. Befriended by the cyborg cook ""Silver"" they face all sorts of perils on their journey before arriving at the ""Treasure Planet"" whereupon the young lad realises that his pal isn't quite so trustworthy. It's a great adventure story, the voice talents are fun making their mischievous characters engaging to watch - and the animation, though maybe not quite as vivid and detailed as I would have liked, still keeps the narrative alive and thriving. Still not a patch on the superb Robert Newton version (1950) but still a very entertaining watch. || This is one of my childhood, i love this,the story is fabulous it's a amazing to watch i would love to rewatch it all over again👍😍"

Julia (Laura Regan) is a master's degree student in psychology. A troubled childhood friend, Billy (Jon Abrahams), contacts her, meets her, rambles incoherently to her, and then shoots himself in front of her. The viewer has already seen Billy, as a young boy, grabbed by monsters in the night, so he probably had some problems even Julia could not help him with. At Billy's funeral, Julia meets Billy's other friends Sam (Ethan Embry) and Terry (Dagmara Dominczyk). The friends have had night terrors as children, and they now bear strange markings on their bodies that seem to say ""hey, mysterious computer generated creatures, come and get me!"" Julia goes to former childhood psychiatrist Dr. Booth (Jay Brazeau), who does the shrink thing. Julia's boyfriend Paul (Marc Blucas) doesn't really get it all, either. Come to think of it, neither did I.

The basic flaw with ""They"" is the lousy execution of the premise. Childhood monsters coming back for adult victims is a good idea, but the script was given the go-ahead without any explanation as to where the creatures come from, why they mark certain victims, etc. This is huge in a film that is otherwise not very compelling. The cast is fine, acting scared at just the right moment. The instrumental score is terrible, it sounds like incidental music for ""The Music Man."" Director Harmon's talents are wasted on the screenplay. He needs a script that will not fail his eye. The screenplay borrows from tons of other films like ""Jacob's Ladder,"" ""Phantasm,"" the remake of ""The Blob,"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" to name a few, and thinks nothing of ripping off the pool scene from ""Cat People."" Sure, the DVD has the alternate ending, which is a ripoff of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" but that ending was better than the one that made the final cut. The special effect monsters are wisely kept out of view through most of the film, they look like giant bats. They do deliver a few scares, but in context with the mindless script, it is not enough. Eventually, you will figure out that most of the special effects here consist of some grip flicking lights on and off. ""They"" had a promising director, nice cast, and a low budget. The script is what never should have seen the light of day."

""In the hundred years since the Victoria Cross was created for valour and extreme courage beyond that normally expected of a British soldier in the face of the enemy, only 1,344 have been awarded, 11 of these were won by the defenders of the mission station at Rorke's Drift, Natal, January 22nd to the 23rd 1879"" 

Just typing out that spoken narration from Richard Burton brings me out into goose pimples, and the hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention, Zulu quite simply is my favourite film of all time, and my love for cinema to this day owes its credit to this 1964 masterpiece. 

Zulu is a perfectly staged, perfectly acted account of the British defence of Rorke's Drift, where 139 British soldiers held off 4000 Zulu Warriors at the height of the Anglo-Zulu War. Its strength is not in romanticism or over sentimentality in the name of glossy hard sell, the crux lies with just being a tale of pure courage, a tale of pure stoic heroism, it sticks vigorously to the actual events, and thus the film plays out with genuine honesty that few other War pictures can ever lay claim to. 

Where does one start when outlaying the brilliance this picture has to offer? The Natal location is stunning, beautiful lush rolling hills dwarf this tiny outpost, the sky a never ending eye witness to the courage unfolding, Stephen Dade's photography perfectly capturing this colourful extravaganza. The direction from the criminally undervalued Cy Enfield is excellent, along with his star and producer (Stanley Baker in a role of a lifetime) he manages to direct some of the most amazing battle sequences put onto the screen, the discipline of man to man combat perfectly orchestrated by Enfield. The Zulu extras, who once had no idea what they was supposed to do at first, finally grasped the concept of movie making and added weight to the drama. It's now down in legend that Baker showed the chiefs a Gene Autry Western and that got them into the swing of things! 

The acting right through the cast is astonishing, Baker, Michael Caine, Jack Hawkins, James Booth, Nigel Green, Ivor Emmanuel and Patrick Magee are just some of the cast that shine bright and bold. John Barry's score is blood pumping to the maximum, swirling strings collide with thumping base drums to give one the feeling of invincibility. Ernest Archer's art decoration, Arthur Newman's costumes and of course the John Prebble screenplay that is Zulu's heart. I could go on and name everyone involved in this picture, such is the admiration I have for the work involved. But really the story sells itself, not a glossy British victory in sight (the British defenders were allowed to withdraw from the engagement gracefully), this is not just another British fable of imperialistic fervour, it's just a tale of bayonets with guts behind them, and ultimately a story of when men really were men, all in the line of duty. 

Men of Harlech onto glory...10/10 and then some.
 || A superb adventure tale about a British battalion charged with the defence of a mission station at Rorke's Drift from an army of Zulu who wish to remove the red devils from their lands. Stanley Baker plays ""Lt. Chard"" who takes command of this troop of engineers and has to plan and implement the defence of his ramshackle post whilst also combatting the superiority complex of Michael Caine's ""Lt. Bromhead"" who hails from a distinguished family of military and who, initially resents the leadership of this amateur, and the drunken preacher Jack Hawkins who's mission they are stranded in. John Prebble and Cy Endfield keep the script tight; and John Barry delivers a suitably grand score for this beautifully shot film with plenty of action, and quite a bit of dry humour too. It delivers well a sense of the relentlessness of the attacking Zulu: their pride, courage - and integrity, as well as giving us a shared feeling of the sheer exhaustion of those defending their outpost and their lives. It's even got some rousing male voice choristry too...!"

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._ || When you watch some of Nicolas Cage's more recent stuff you do wonder how on earth he ever became a star in the first place. Well, this is one of the films that reminds us why. He is a struggling screenwriter (""Charlie"") charged with adapting a novel about orchids written by ""Susan Orlean"" (Meryl Streep). Mental block would be putting it mildly - he simply has no idea how to make it work for ""Valerie"" (easily one of the less abstruse roles played by Tilda Swinton). Moreover, he is constantly hassled by his twin brother ""Donald"" who is writing his own story - one that his sibling thinks is riddled with flaws and inconsistencies. The book he must adapt centres around the activities of ""Laroche"" (Chris Cooper) who had a habit of going with his Seminole pals to remove rare plants from a nature reserve. Illegal? Well not if you know your way around the Floridian penal code, and the ensuing court case is what entices ""New Yorker"" reporter ""Orlean"" to write his story. Initially sceptical of her rather uncouth subject matter - not helped by his missing front teeth, she discovers there is much more to the man and his provision of a green powder soon helps her to relax! What now ensues nicely marries the threads of the storylines as both Cage characters, an excellently enigmatic Cooper, and the unfulfilled Miss Streep find themselves gradually drawn together for an admittedly pretty far-fetched denouement (pronounce denooeymont). Cage plays the two characters with considerable skill; he juggles his characters' frustrations with his writing, his love life, his brother and his own reluctance to meet the author engagingly and at times he can make you squirm in your seat a bit. There is plenty of humour, and the all but two hours just flies by. If nothing else, it does make you appreciate just how difficult is is to turn a novel into a film - and might explain why so few people are actually any good at it!"

However some people exhibit emotions by not taking the medicine. They want to listen to music, experience their senses by seeing artwork, read books or having pets.

These people are exterminated by clerics, an elite hit squad. Christian Bale is the best of the clerics but once he stops taking his medicine, he feels for the first time and gets into contact with a resistance group to overthrow the leader.

Filmed in Berlin, Equilibrium comes across like an updated version of Fahrenheit 451 but feels too much like a knockoff of The Matrix with a rather a sterile narrative at the beginning which made it rather uninvolving.

Bale's behaviour is so odd once he stops taking the drugs, he should just had been caught and shot. || So there's a pretty decent chance that _Equilibrium_ doesn't have an original bone in its entire makeup, but I still just **love **it.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || Mankind united with infinitely greater purpose in pursuit of war than he ever did in pursuit of peace.

Equilibrium is written and directed by Kurt Wimmer and stars Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson and Angus Macfadyen. Bale plays John Preston, an enforcement Cleric in Libria, a dystopian future where forms of emotional expression are deemed illegal. All citizens of Libria are required to inject drugs (known as Prozium) to suppress emotions. However, Preston misses one of his doses and starts to become emotionally conflicted about the world he now lives in.

Welcome to a dystopian world where art is banned, music destroyed and basic emotions illegal. A world where Christian Bale looks cool in long black coats and ""Gun-Kata"" martial artistry is the order of the day. It's impossible to write a review for Equilibrium without mentioning the film it so dearly wants to be, ""The Matrix"". That it's not nearly as good as that film in terms of story and action is no reason to do it down. What is not in doubt is that the story here is indeed weak, very much so - in fact it appears that Wimmer has merely cribbed elements from notable moments of sci-fi morality works before it - and then cloaked it in a whirling big bang montage of attention grabbing set pieces. But honestly, those set pieces are alone worth spending time with this movie for.

It's standard sci-fi shenanigans for the most part. We have the ruling body of the country, all very fascist and with a badge that looks unsurprisingly Swastika like. A cop character finding a conscience and turning into a rebel on the loose. The underground resistance. And of course the twist ending as the reveal, and plot strands, come together for one final (brilliant) bout of carnage. So yes, it's rammed full of clichés. But it is exciting energised fun. Stylish fun, in fact. Even if at the core it's awash with unimaginative writing. Brain checked at the door for this one then, enjoy. 8/10"

World War II and the Nazi officers have come up with a propaganda driven idea for the German national football team to play a team composed of Allied Prisoners of War. Led by Capt. John Colby (Michael Caine) the prisoners agree, but there's more than just propaganda at stake here.

Directed by John Huston in the twilight of his career, Escape To Victory, in spite of it being a perennial Bank Holiday staple viewing in the UK, is a film that's often used as a kicking post by stuffy critics. It's hard to understand why such a fun and harmless piece can cause such derision in cinematic circles. It can't be expectation because when you read the plot and see that Sylvester Stallone is playing as the goalkeeper, and that a tubby 48 year old Caine is the captain of this soccer team, well surely you know this film isn't all about about cranial depth encompassing the propaganda machinations of the Nazi regime.

Using real footballers (notably Pelé, Bobby Moore and Osvaldo Ardilies) is what makes Escape To Victory work as entertainment for so many people in the UK. Huston, much like Stallone, hadn't got a clue how to make a football based movie. In stepped the footballers to choreograph the films football sequences - sequences that give the film some truly memorable moments (Pelé overhead kick, Ardiles rainbow flick, and erm, a Stallone penalty save). They couldn't act for toffee, none of them, but that's where Caine comes in. Guiding them through their scenes, Caine was highly thought of on the set by the players, a sort of father figure by all accounts, and not just on the set, but in the bar as well. Stallone excepted (he was off doing his own thing most of the time), it was a happy shoot, and this shines bright in the movie, with the non actors growing in confidence as the movie progresses. So while the film ultimately deals in escapist fun, it's not without moments of poignancy too. A sacrificial break for the war effort induces winces across the board, whilst the arrival of the Eastern Block players from the work camps demands our utmost heartfelt thoughts.

So is Escape To Victory a great film? No, of course not. But it is a darn good one. A film that's easy to lose oneself in during the holiday periods. With Caine flicking the eff off Vs, Max Von Sydow being classy as usual and some legendary footballers strutting their stuff, what's not to enjoy? Really? 7.5/10"

Jennifer Lopez pretty much carries this movie, despite all the great characters created to prod her further in the story, to include Bob Hoskins.  He was good, not phenomenal, but I miss Bob Hoskins.

The overall story is actually pretty well written, and most of the character dialogue / interaction is cute, but the working vs elite battle to bridge trope is a little heavy for a romantic comedy.  And then the resolution is that Jennifer Lopez is just that hot.  I hope that wasn't a spoiler for someone, because it's really not.

I honestly wish we had gotten a little bit more out of the pursuit of a woman he didn't know and more action out of the bad guy, but for the stereotypical elite, ""I'm going to have you fired, do you know who I am?"" seems appropriate enough, right?

This ""body swap"" trope is dealing with both sex swapping and age swapping, but not parent-child swapping, so a lot of things come with that in this silly dirt comedy.  I'm not even sure you could make this movie in 2020, there would be too much heat from online communities.  Just a ""30 year old man"" hanging around high schoolers, let alone young women, let alone young women that attract attention like these rich little brats do.

The writing is a lot of plot convenience, not only do they not immediately end up in jail, there are neglectful parents, school faculty, and far too many people to know about the situation and believe it.  With the ratio of people that accept it, she could just live openly as a ""girl in a mans body"".

I do enjoy that the medium in this version is a pair of earrings, they make sense and keep you from thinking about it for too long.

Weirdly, they do manage to shift focus by writing in weird distractions all over the place, and it surprisingly helps with transitions:  Adam Sandler a a fake rastafarian (I think at one point they agreed to always play racist roles in each others movies), a weird, but positive, racial identity plot, and even a dance club sequence that felt rather unecessary.

Now the point is that it's a comedy, and it should be funny, and it is, at times, but using potentially serious issues as comedy really distracts from the ""I'm just having a good time"" of it all, even when it's legitimately funny.

It's not that it's all bad, or that I don't like it, or like I won't watch it again, eventually, but there are a lot of movies to watch, and no one is missing anything from skipping this one."

I feel like I just enjoy ""Star Trek"" TNG just enough that I just like that we have movies.  I thought this was good, but I completely understand if other people didn't appreciate it.

While the core of the concept is a little wonky, the look into the Romulan Empire and it's caste system is somewhat interesting on its own.  It does create a lot of questions though, such as why the ""untouchable"" caste would be given enough resources to create such an impressive warship.

We get another look into the significance of Data's character, particularly that he isn't an easy creation and cannot be copied simply.

It's not the best movie, but it is fun to see some more of ""Star Trek"" TNG. || _**Solid Trek Film**_

So many people inexplicably love to hate ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002), but it's actually a solid Trek film featuring the Next Generation cast. The lengthy space battle in the final act is second to none in the Star Trek franchise. But that's not the main reason I like it.

I like the whole exploration of the conflict of flesh (Shinzon) and spirit (Picard) and the debate over nature (Picard) vs. Nurture (Shinzon), or is it nature (Shinzon) vs. Nurture (Picard)? Like ""Star Trek VII: Generations"" (1994), it entertains while delving into deeper themes, although ""Generations"" is better (a near masterpiece, in fact; see my review for details).

Data's course of action at the end is way more compelling and moving than a similar scene in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" (1982). Think about it, Data becomes the Christ figure by making the ultimate gesture of love and loyalty; an android, no less.

Speaking of TWOK, ""Nemesis"" is often said to be a quasi-remake of that film. It shares some plot elements of the trilogy (TWOK, TSFS and TVH), but that's it (more specifically, the space stand-off, Data's sacrifice and the ""resurrection"" of a blank-version of himself). It's an homage, not a remake, and better than the overrated TWOK.

While NEMESIS may not rank with the greatest of Trek films, it's certainly a solid Trek movie, along the lines of ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" (1991). It has the most beautiful space sequences in the series and the score by Jerry Goldsmith is superlative as usual, not to mention welcomely familiar.

Concerning the incredible ire the dune buggy sequence has provoked, I'm at a loss. The landing party had to cover a lot of terrain, how else would they do it without something to travel in? Why walk miles on end when you don't have to? Besides, it's a fun scene and gives the austere proceedings a much-needed jolt at that particular point.

Be sure to check out the deleted scenes; there are a couple that shouldn't have been cut, like the one involving Riker's joke on Picard's new First Officer and an amusing one involving Picard and Data having a discussion over wine.

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes.

GRADE: B+ || This time it's the ""Next Generation"" who take to the silver screen in what I found to be a passable adventure film. Even for a ""Star Trek"" film, it starts of implausibly though with ""Riker"" and ""Troi"" getting married and having their first dance - but there was no ""Lady in Red"" or ""I Will Always Love You""... we didn't even get Tammy Wynette singing ""DIVORCE""... Cleary this film was going to be lacking in realism then... Anyway, shortly afterwards ""Capt. Picard"" (Patrick Stewart) and the crew head to ""Romulus"" for a summit only to find that Alan Dale and the entire senate have been assassinated and that Praetor ""Shinzon"" (Tom Hardy) is in charge of a very heavily armed warship. The two men meet and it is quite clear that the former has megalomaniacal tendencies that involve a personal relationship with our brave Captain. The story is not so hot, the plot - as ever with this strand of ST couldn't just have a straightforward action theme - phasers and photon torpedos at the ready. No, we had to have some dull familial sub-plots and the always annoying ""Data"" (Brent Spiner) finds himself a brother (think ""C3PO"" on the Cloud City above ""Bespin""). Anyway, trust wains, tempers flare and the last twenty minutes are genuinely at the better end of ST moviedom - loads of pyrotechnics and hammy acting. Hardy does fine as the baddie (he was only 25) and the rest of the established cast turn up and go through the motions as usual. It benefits from less moralising and more action, and is perfectly watchable - if entirely forgettable afterwards."

June Squibb plays his wife, Dermot Mulroney his imminent son-in-law and Kathy Bates the latter’s mother. Howard Hesseman also shows up.          

“About Schmidt” (2002) is a coming-of-old-age road flick, far superior to the similar “Everybody’s Fine” (2009) with De Niro. You can’t help but think of Thoreau’s observation “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” But, unlike the dull De Niro film, this one has a sense of humor amidst the melancholic-but-insightful proceedings.  

It’s a lesson on the negative side of giving up your life to the grind for a good paycheck and nice house in the ’burbs. Yet, also, that it’s never too late to live again, as well as realize & perhaps make up for your sincere, but sincerely wrong shortcomings.

Again, in this country grandma probably would have tried for custody herself.

Irish law says that if the mother isn’t dead, he needs her permission to get the children back. You can guess the rest.

It is a tad sentimental and weirdly religious, highlighting both a mean nun but also showing a daughter absorbing the nun’s teachings which helps their case. But Julianna Marguiles is also very good, so turn a blind eye to the soppy story and Its predictability, and let the fine acting roll over you."

As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set.

Picking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There's also the first appearance of Saruman's spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here).

Other newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King.

As we've come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm's Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen's troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film's most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed.

However, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It's just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content.

This is particularly true of the Ringbearer's quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson's desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm's Deep, it's unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff.


Verdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. 

5/5

- Caroline Westbrook, Empire Magazine || That Damned Ring.

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers” adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving ‘Fellowship’ of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour.  

This three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there’s a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there’s not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        

There are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they’re also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be.  

Another problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that’s about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. 

Despite these negatives, “The Two Towers” was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie.                      

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  

GRADE: B-/C+ || Still probably my favorite of the three, while it's pretty streamlined and far more action centric with little development compared with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King, I always find this one really entertaining with the Helm's Deep battle. **4.5/5**"

It probably is a forgettable film, but I do enjoy the humour. It keeps things pacing well, at least until the third act where the plot kinda ends with a whimper. Nothing else standouts, especially the supporting cast.

Dark, gritty and overwhelming, Narc doesn't sugarcoat law enforcement but somehow keeps the experience real without turning the opinion of the viewer against the officers, who often bend the rules as far as they can without going over the edge.

Excellent drama, along with some very realistic dialog and some top-notch acting brings this title to the forefront of its niche. I guarantee you won't figure out ""who done it"" until the very end.

If you can forgive the plot holes and just go along for the ride, it's a surprisingly rewarding film. || Normally a werewolf movie will have more werewolves in it than this.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Kathryn Bigelow did this, which stands to reason has to be pretty good. She has yet to make a movie that is unwatchable, and in the 1990s she hit her stride.

And you can tell it was Bigelow, because Silver actually had a decent performance and Curtis shows her dramatic credentials and proves she is more than just a scream queen... but more importantly Ron Silver does a good job and I've only seen him deliver meh at best.

But in the end, you still have to take it for what it is, a tense thriller like so many others you have seen before, but a tense thriller with some real class behind it that throws out some seriously great performances, anxiety inducing tension, and lighting that is surprisingly naturalistic for a cheap thriller.

With any other director this might have been a bad movie, but Bigelow really delivers."

Joseph Conrad wrote a characterful story and Ridley Scott makes full use of that with a focused, frequency pithy and entertaining, dialogue and two measured and engaging leading performances with plenty of entertaining swordplay. The supporting cast is as A-list as you're ever likely to get in a non-romantic period drama. Albert Finney and Edward Fox, Tom Conti and an on form Robert Stephens as well Cristina Raines' charming effort as ""Adèle"" contribute well. All are dressed perfectly amidst settings that suit this gritty and battle-worn story perfectly, too. It's a cunningly devised theme, this - it has the obvious storyline, but also takes well aimed swipes at pomposity, the futility of war, and the stupidity of man - all in a manner that resonates cleverly, even now. It was clearly produced on a limited budget, which is apparent from time to time with the continuity (never one of Scott's strong suits) or with some overused extras amongst the soldiers - but, overall, it is a testament to what can be done in a relatively short film, with a good story and cast and some creative leadership behind the camera."

It stars Alec Baldwin, Fred Ward, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Charles Napier. Music is by Gary Chang and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.

Ex-con Frederick Frenger Jr. (Baldwin) lands in Miami and quickly continues his criminal ways. Hooking up with gullible prostitute Susie Waggoner (Leigh), Frenger, by now under suspicion for the killing of a Hare Krishna man at Miami airport, steals the identity of the policeman investigating him and ups his crime spree...

This is all about the characterisations, for the story is simple and played as a darkly comic hard boiled cop picture. We are in a stripped back Miami, no gloss here, wherever the psychotic Frenger goes, there is crime that he is only too willing to enhance. Quite often with violent but humorous results. His union with Susie is a matter of convenience, as she, the gullible tart with the heart, dreams of a white picket fence house - marriage - babies, he dreams only of her cash and the comfort of cover she affords his criminal doings. Then there is Sgt. Hoke Moseley (Ward), straight out of noirville, world weary, grizzled, incapable of genuine affection, tatty and someone who soaks his false teeth in a glass of brandy! It's a wonderful character brought vividly to life by Ward, especially when Frenger steals said set of teeth! And with Leigh and Baldwin also making good on the characters as written, this is very much worth a look for the acting performances.

It's not under seen or under valued, the respective ratings on internet sites and critical appraisals are about right. There's some value in the dark comedy born out of the crime sequences, where we are dared not to smile, and the violence is impacting without hitting us over the head for the sake of it. But without Junior, Susie and Hoke holding our attention, the film would be flat and forgettable. 6/10"

At its core, it's a coming-of-age story that beautifully captures childhood innocence, friendship, and the tough lessons that come with growing up. The plot unfolds naturally, taking its time to let you connect with the characters, making the emotional moments hit even harder. It balances lighthearted humor with deeper themes without ever feeling forced, making it more than just a typical family drama.

The directing by Howard Zieff keeps everything grounded, allowing the story to breathe and feel real. The cinematography leans into a nostalgic, warm aesthetic that perfectly complements the film's tone. There's a sense of comfort in the way it's shot, almost like flipping through old childhood memories. The script feels natural, with dialogue that flows effortlessly, making the characters feel genuine rather than overly scripted or dramatic. The score is subtle but effective, never overpowering the story but enhancing the emotions in just the right moments.

When it comes to performances, Anna Chlumsky shines in her first major role, delivering a performance that feels authentic and heartfelt. Macaulay Culkin, fresh off his *Home Alone* success, takes on a very different role and does it with quiet charm. The supporting cast also does a great job, adding depth to the story without overshadowing the leads. Overall, *My Girl* is a beautifully crafted film that sticks with you.

Everything is outstanding in this film, but especially the way it can emote your sense of wonder and imagination.

I wish I could have watched this as a child, I would have wanted to find Totoro and the Catbus, roar like Totoro, or sleep on his belly.  Oh well...I will just have to imagine it.

Its interesting to note this was released with Grave of the Fireflies, another Ghibli masterpiece, which I have summed up as being about innocence lost.  **This movie is innocence maintained.** || (SPOILER ALERT)

I was delighted to see this subtle/multi-layered tale unfold, which seemed to play well to both a childhood audience, keen on likable characters/compelling imagination, and adults with a deeper appreciation for the symbolic backstory.  

Like most of Miyazaki's films, there was an enormous focus on the power of the natural world. Whenever man perverts the natural world, the natural world seems to pushback. It appears as though the seldom seen Mother in the story is sick due to some mental/physical disconnect that she has likely had with the natural world. 

Through the unique power of children to tap into their imagination, especially children living outside the city and amongst nature, Miyazaki demonstrates the unique gift that children have to re-establish the lost bond between unhealthy adults and the healing power of the natural world. I was thoroughly impressed with how delicately Miyazaki established this bond between the two children, their imagination, and the natural world. Totoro, the lovable silent giant, is a great and unexpected metaphor for the healing power of the natural world and childhood imagination :) || Aggressively cute.

<em>'My Neighbor Totoro'</em> holds an extremely hearty story, one told via impeccably beautiful animation. Noriko Hidaka and Chika Sakamoto standout as Satsuki and Mei, the relationship between those two characters is so sweet. They do get a bit shouty in parts which ever so slightly irritates, but that's definitely one to file under 'nit-picking'.

A simple movie, one which displays the imagination of children perfectly. Big fan of the Catbus. 🐱"

It’s the Christmas season at a sorority house in the Northeast wherein an ambiguous psycho hiding in the attic makes crank calls to the girls and slays them one-by-one. John Saxon plays the local detective.

“Black Christmas” (1974) obviously influenced “Halloween” (1978), e.g. the closet scene, but was influenced itself by psycho slasher flicks like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963) and “Silent Night, Bloody Night” (1972).

Honestly, the 2006 remake has a more absorbing story which, to me, is the best indicator of a quality movie. This version is dull by comparison, particularly the first half, but it picks up steam in the second. And the open-ended climax is interesting. 

But I strongly prefer the female cast in the remake; they're just all-around superior IMHO. Of course Olivia Hussey is attractive in this rendition, albeit cold, and Lynne Griffin as Clare is winsome, although her part is small. Andrea Martin (Phyl) comes across as a shorter version of Cher with short, curly hair. Unfortunately, Margot Kidder as Barb is one of the most obnoxious characters in cinema, a real turn-off (so is Mrs. Mac, but less so). Thankfully, Barb's only prominent through the first half.

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Toronto.

GRADE: C+/B- || Black Christmas is what happens when a director decides to make a slasher but also decides to make a good movie. 

Each character has a purpose. By that, I don't mean simply to drive the plot along. Each character is a person, and they each have their own unique personalities and motivations. Barb isn't just the drunk and morally abrasive stereotype; she's driven by her jealousy and likely by issues from her childhood. Each character feels about as deep as her, at the least. 

The only character who isn't fully explained is Billy, and that's for the best. Billy isn't a character we want explained, and it only drives the horror deeper that he isn't. 

This should be on every horror fan's Christmas playlist. || One of only two films in my adult life to have been in any way involved in giving me a sense of genuine fear.

Whilst training at the YMCA, he comes across the enthusiastic young “Ernie” (Jeff Bridges) who is initially only having some fun, but is soon bent on embarking on a career that “Billy” reckons will follow the same trajectory of brief success and then failure that he suffered.

It’s a grittily authentic looking story that has been written from quite a powerful perspective to show us just how desperate men could become and how hard they would work to raise themselves up. Bridges delivers confidently and though there isn’t loads of action in the ring, what there is is effectively photographed to give us a sense of the punishment taken and dished out by these men week in, week out.

It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.

Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe DiCaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. DiCaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.

I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.

However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch DiCaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when DiCaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400!

Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg's other movies, but still a great film! || **Catch Me If You Can is an entertaining and amusing film full of Spielberg, Hanks, and DiCaprio charm.**

With Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio as leads and Steven Spielberg directing, I don't think it's possible not to enjoy this movie. Everyone loves Hanks and young Leo. Every Spielberg film drips with nostalgia and enthusiasm. Catch Me If You Can is precisely what you would expect from this talented crew. A clever, witty film with growing respect between a con artist and the FBI agent trailing him. Spielberg crafts an excellent, satisfying, and entertaining movie based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. and Carl Hanratty. || Just as great as expected.

I'm not quite sure how I've never got around to watching this, for two reasons: Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Literally two of my favourite actors. Well, at least I have now and I can only add to the general vibe around <em>'Catch Me If You Can'</em>. It's very good!

DiCaprio and Hanks are terrific throughout, the former narrowly outshines the latter but the film is very much greater for having them both onboard. Neat to see the likes of Christopher Walken and Amy Adams behind 'em, too. It's as well cast, and as well made, as you'd anticipate from a Steven Spielberg flick.

I potentially would've shaved a little bit off the run time, though that's very much a minor, minor 'but' of mine. All things considered, it's entertaining to watch, has some solid amusement and is told in a interesting manner. I'd happily revisit it, certainly.

A quick look at the real life Frank Abagnale's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can#Cast"">Wikipedia</a> seems to suggest an equally as intriguing story, with many claims of his potentially being debunked in the years since... yet that, given what has followed them, would simply make him even more of a noteworthy con man!"

In mid-20’s Chicago Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger) find themselves on death row for murdering their lovers and fan the fame that will keep them from the gallows with the assistance of a slick lawyer (Richard Gere). John C. Reilly plays Roxie’s likable but dimwitted husband while Latifah is on hand as the avaricious prison matron.

People criticize this amusing satirical musical for being sleazy, but it would be hard to lampoon and ridicule the corrupt targets of the media and the legal (in)justice system without showing, um, sleaze. That's the point of the original 1926 play “Chicago” and all its successive incarnations, including this acclaimed 2002 movie: illustrating and sarcastically denouncing sleaze via a droll musical. “Chicago” without sleaze would be akin to “Apocalypse Now” without war.

Believe it or not, the movie is based on real women, Beulah Annan (represented by Roxie) and Belva Gaertner (Velma), who were imprisoned for killing lovers in spring, 1924, in two unrelated incidents. The actual accounts were salacious with loads of sex & violence; and both were ultimately acquitted. Maurine Dallas Watkins wrote the original play, which was intended as a stinging satire of the lack of morals in Chicago during the roaring 20s. Watkins was, interestingly, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune who covered the popular trials and is represented by Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski) in the film. Several of the peripheral characters are also based on real-life individuals who played a part in the unfolding drama, e.g. journalists, attorneys, officials and convicts.

I’m not big on musicals beyond ones like “Moulin Rouge” (1952) and “The Wizard of Oz” (1939), but “Chicago” works for me simple due to the scores of beautiful women prancing around in scanty showgirl apparel of the 20s. It’s the same reason I love figure skating. After the passage of the 19th Amendment, American women were basking in their newfound freedoms and “Chicago” depicts this euphoric emancipation.

I also appreciate “Chicago” because Gere is great and there are some creative pieces, like the puppet one and the tap-dancing part. All the musical skits are in Roxie’s imagination, except for the opening “All that Jazz” performed by Velma at the club and the climatic one, which features both Velma & Roxie.

The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.

GRADE: B || SPOILERS AHEAD!

From Rob Marshall (""Into the Woods"") and Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls"") comes this charming satirical stab on celebrity criminals. Based on the 1975 stage play and starring Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere.

Set in the jazz age of Chicago, Illinois. ""Chicago"" tells the story of two women on murderess row who hope that fame and fortune will keep them out of the gallows. Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) is a vaudevillian performer who plugs her sister and husband right before a performance. Roxie Hart (Zellweger) is watching the performance while idolizeing Velma and hopes one day to be on the stage just like her. Convinced that with Fred Casely's (Dominic West) help she will get what she wants.

But, when Casely turns out to be an abusive lying womanizer Roxie is angered and betrayed. Causing her to kill him as revenge, she tries to convince her husband Amos (John C. Reilly) to take the blame. However, his story does not phase the Harrison (Colm Feore) and Roxie is arrested and learns that she could face the death penalty. Roxie later meets the corrupt but nurturing jail matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), who gives her some helpful advice on how to win the court's appeal. Roxie later finds herself being a client of the corrupt smooth-talking Billy Flynn (Gere), who is determined to help her win her case.

Billy corrupts the press with a story about how Roxie killed Fred out of self-defense. At the same time she butts heads with Velma after the press starts putting her name in the headlines. Roxie's fame is almost short-lived until she fakes a pregnancy. Now with a swelled head, she fires Billy convinced she can win the case on her own. Unfortunately, she is forced to take Billy back after seeing that another inmate will be executed. At the same time Amos starts to wonder about Roxie's ""baby."" Convinced that it is not his baby he decides to file for divorce. The day of the trial Billy turns the court room upside down and is able to convince the jury that Roxie is innocent, Amos learns that the pregnancy was a ruse and finally leaves her.

Now that Roxie is free she tries to make her dream come true, but Velma explains to her that a one woman act is not what Chicago is looking for. Roxie rejects the offer because of Velma's resentment towards her and the lack of hospitality when they were on murderess row. Velma finally convinces her that they don't have to be friends in order to be partners. Roxie's dream becomes a reality as she and Velma are now the hottest act in Chicago.

But one question remains did it really happen or is it all in Roxie's head?

Highly Recommended. This movie has some of the best singing and acting I have ever seen. It deserved all six of the awards. || Hats off to Rob Marshall for taking a cast not necessarily obvious for this story and moulding them into an entertaining trio. The screenplay has been sanitised a bit, and proves really quite thin: ""Roxie"" (Renée Zellweger) and ""Velma"" (Catherine Zeta-Jones) are both convicted murderesses who will do just about anything to escape death row. Using their skills as dancers, and their gifts for attracting publicity they must try to engage dodgy lawyer ""Billy Flynn"" (Richard Gere) to help get them out of the clutches of prison warden ""Mama Morton"" (a superb Queen Latifah). That's all pretty incidental to the stunning look of this film. At times a little confusing as the costumes seems to straddle timelines from the 1920s to things one might see in ""Saturday Night Fever"", but it is all about the style; and both principals have it in spades. Zeta-Jones, especially, has a classy sexiness about her performance; Zellweger more of an innocence, and Gere is the perfect man for the job proving he, too, can get his (and our) toes tapping. The original Fosse play remains the bedrock for this and the Kander and Ebb songs performed strongly with ""All That Jazz""; Funny Honey"" and ""Razzle Dazzle"" all delightfully choreographed and delivered. I still prefer the intimacy (and grittiness) of the stage production, but as cinematic adaptations go - this is highly entertaining and well worth a watch."

Once the gritty and darker first half hour or so is over, it falls into a pattern of rather unlikely serendipity. Too many coincidental relationships, friendships and dependencies start to turn it all a bit sour for me. Anne Hathaway adequately provides our hero with some love interest, and as with the brief appearances from Juliet Stevenson as ""Mrs. Squeers"" and the newly knighted Sir Tom Courtenay as the honourable and decent ""Noggs"" adds a bit of richness to the story, but handsome though he is, Hunnam hasn't quite the gravitas to take this on nor Plummer quite the dastardliness intended in the original book. It does look good, the costumes and settings all deliver well but somehow I always prefer adaptations of this author's work to be in black and white.

De Niro is Rupert Pitkin, a comedian who seeks to be as famous as his hero, Jerry Lewis. Pupkin could be Travis Bickle's equally disturbed brother - both of them living in New York and both of them losing their minds in unison.

After much rejection, the crazed Pupkin decides to kidnap his hero and hold him for ransom until a studio gives him a big break. Jerry Lewis is impressive as the total bastard that Pupkin so admires.

A disturbing movie that is more relevant nowadays than ever since the advent of the Big Brother tv show which places national attention on people with no talent.

- Ian Beale || Martin Scorsese's THE KING OF COMEDY was the lowest-grossing major studio film of 1982. It isn't difficult to see why: It's loaded with uncomfortable situations; there is no obvious protagonist; no sympathetic characters (the one that could potentially get our sympathy turns out to be a thief); and everyone is grating and/or unpleasant (even Tony Randall plays 𝙝𝙞𝙢𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙛 as a demanding prick). This lack of popularity was the audience's loss, as Paul Zimmerman graced Scorsese with a screenplay which was just as prescient on the topic of fame as Paddy Chayefsky's NETWORK (1976) was on the future of television. In a day and age where television reality shows and online video platforms allow talent-bereft fame-seekers to offer their wares to an anesthetized public, De Niro's Rupert Pupkin displays an uncanny ambition just by leaving his mother's basement, much less his willingness to use crime as a means to his end. || Robert De Niro is great in this enjoyable comedy about the aspiring comedian ""Pupkin"" who is prepared to go to great lengths to get his moment in the sun. To that end he doorsteps acclaimed chat-show host ""Jerry"" (the entirely convincing Jerry Lewis) and, not exactly lacking in self-confidence, convinces him to listen to his material. Anything for a peaceable life thinks the star and agrees clearly just to be rid of the man. ""Pupkin"", though, isn't so easily deterred and what ensues now are a rather darkly comedic series of escapades as the little man determines to get that spotlight - even if he has to turn to lying, housebreaking - even kidnapping. The writing here is taut and entertaining; the characters - especially that of the rather pompous ""Jerry"" are well crafted by the actors who really seem to be enjoying their roles. Martin Scorsese manages to skilfully keep this on the right side of what could easily have become far-fetched farce. It's the ultimate speculate to accumulate film poking fun at the whole television ""opportunity"" system, and with the odd sight of an almost unrecognisable Ed Herlihy it all adds up to a fun film to watch and I challenge anyone not have a laugh here."

""Kangaroo Jack"" (2003) is a likable family-friendly adventure/comedy with the typical eye-rolling kid humor (e.g. fart jokes). It’s fun, harmless hokum highlighted by spectacular Australian cinematography and the beautiful Estella Warren as an Outback preservationist. The humorous camaraderie of the protagonists is another highpoint. But the story isn’t as compelling as I hoped it would be and the camera never really captures Estella’s beauty beyond her lovely face and bosom.

It runs 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot in Australia and Brooklyn with reshoots done in Los Angeles.

The is the story told through the eyes of ‘Rocket’ who avoids getting in to the gang war of his brother and friends by trying to find a safer life. 

The film combines slick production without losing a genuine documentary feel which I think it is why it’s so enduring. While it achieves a feeling of reality, it isn’t specifically a true story. However, the Cidade de Deus is real (being created to rehouse the slums away from Rio de Janeiro) and this story of its underworld and the film’s production makes one believe it may not be too far from the truth. There is hope in the story but not a lot. || Told by way of an occasionally narrated retrospective, ""Rocket"" (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells us a story of his childhood in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Growing up in a community of newly built boxes, without power or plumbing, that reminded me of a row of concrete beach huts, the community is pretty lawless. The crime is largely to confined to pettier crimes, but as aspirations grow so does the scale of the criminality. A raid on a motel-cum-brothel is supposed to make everyone extra cash, but their inventive young watchman ""Li'l Dice"" (Douglas Silva) hates being left out and so does a little augmenting of his own. Brutal and attention grabbing. Next the cops crack down, bodies pile up and the societal order starts to change. It's this young man who grows up into the leading drug-peddling hoodlum amongst a now much more developed township where, tempered only by his more diplomatic childhood friend ""Bené"" (Phellipe Haagensen), the newly named ""Li'l Zé"" (Leandro Firmino) is ruling the roost. Curiously, his own form of government proves more stable for the residents, and although many are addicts there is a certain degree of law-and-order. Then the runts start to intervene. These are the young children with no hope, no families and only the dream of becoming their own version of ""Li'l Zé"" one day too. Gradually, the empire expands until it's only ""Carrot"" (Matheus Nachtergaele) who stands against him. When tragedy strikes very close to home for the kingpin, though, the uneasy peace between the two sections breaks out into an open warfare that drags in the sharpshooting army vet ""Knockout Ned"" (Seu Jorge), arms all the enthusiastic children and creates an environment that isn't safe for anyone - and where the police keep their distance in the hope that they will just all just slaughter each other. It's lucky that ""Rocket"" can use a camera. His boss wants publicity to illustrate how dominant and powerful he is. The newspapers want the photographs too. If the young man can walk the tightrope carefully, he might find himself well placed to capitalise on his unique access to a story that by now is gripping their nation. This is a fascinatingly well put together depiction of the worst of human nature; a dog eat dog world, where traditional humanity is scarce and the virtues of a not so benign dictatorship are exposed for all to see. The characterisations are mostly brutal and exploitative, yet there is a place for love and loyalty too amidst a poverty stricken population that craves basics like food and running water and is oblivious to death in the streets. The story is well supplemented by some engaging supporting characters like ""Steak n' Fries"", ""Goose"", ""Shaggy"" and ""Thiago"" (Daniel Zettel or is it really Timothée Chalamet?). The writing delivers powerfully but sparingly. We don't have loads of waffling dialogue, and there's also quite a bit of dark humour contained to not so much lighten the mood as to enhance the perception amongst most of the population that kill or be killed was a perfectly reasonable mantra. Firmino, Haagensen and Rodrigues deliver extremely well here in this most impressively photographed and intense look at a society where the top dog was only top by feeding and starving his followers. It's not especially graphic, I found, just a poignant look at survival of the fittest, the shrewdest and the luckiest. There's also a distinct lack of religiosity throughout, too! If you can see this at a cinema, then do - it's based on a true story and isn't an easy watch."

The young lady Odile (Anna Karina), who isn't very bright, meets lowlife Franz (Sami Frey) in an English course and makes the mistake of telling him that the home in which she lives with her aunt holds a large amount of cash. Franz and fellow criminal Arthur (Claude Brasseur) plan a heist while at the same time vying for Odile's love, or at least her body. As is common in the French New Wave, the auteur only uses a crime caper as a skeleton for his own storytelling. A narrator (Godard himself) occasionally reads descriptive passages from the original novel, which are horribly purple prose, as if Godard is poking fun at his own source of inspiration.

<i>Bandè a part</i> has occasionally been treated as a departure from this director's work, as ""Godard for people who don't like Godard"". However, anyone who has seen Godard's films to date will immediately recognize elements typical of his work at the time. For example, someone reads aloud a classic work of literature, this time an English teacher in a parody of modern language-learning methods. There is leftist social commentary, as the two criminals kill time by reading aloud tragic passages from Parisian newspapers. There is also dancing, as in the film's most famous scene Odile, Franz and Arthur interrupt their plotting for an amusing line dance in a café, over which the narrator tells us their unspoken thoughts.

And then there is Godard's many references to the film canon. <i>Bandè a part</i> is deeply imbued with the spirit of American noir films, which fits with the crime caper plot, but it also nods to classic slapstick and romance, which gives it a levity and charm I wouldn't have expected from a film with these particular characters. <i>Bandè a part</i> may not be among the most awesome masterpieces of cinema, but it is memorable and funny, and very much worth seeing for fans of mid-century French films."

Seems I'm one of the few here who are prepared to write that they dislike this picture.

Right I'm off to watch Creole to put me back on Elvis' side.... 3/10 || _**Elvis as a fisherman and nightclub singer in Hawaii**_

In Hawaii, a fishing guide (Presley) tries to find a way to buy the Westwind, a boat that he & his father built, after his employer decides to retire to Arizona. Meanwhile he's caught between two women: An insensitive club singer (Stella Stevens) and a sweet rich girl who pretends to be working class (Laurel Goodwin).

""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" (1962) was Elvis’ 11th movie of the 31 in his acting filmography. It was the second of his three flicks shot in Hawaii, the other two being ""Blue Hawaii"" (1961) and “Paradise, Hawaiian Style” (1966). While it’s a serviceable Presley flick and has its points of interest, it’s the least of the three IMHO with “Blue Hawaii” being easily the best.

The serious drama is situated amongst the Hawaiian boating/fishing industry wherein Presley performs a song every 7-12 minutes with “Return to Sender” being a highlight. 

Stevens' role is rather small so the focus is on the protagonist's romance with the secretly rich girl. Speaking of whom, two years later Goodwin played Yeoman Colt on the original (rejected) pilot episode of Star Trek, which was reworked into the two-part episode ""The Menagerie,"" premiering in November, 1966. While Stevens and Goodwin are a’right, the female cast in “Paradise, Hawaiian Style” is superior.

There’s an interesting scene near the end where Elvis’s character is rescuing the girl and a sailboat runs into their smaller craft. The (presumable) stunt people in the motorboat get hit by the sailboat and somewhat pushed under.

The movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Hawaii.

The latter woman is very much down on her luck, with her daughter ""Sarah Jane"", when she rescues the young ""Susie"", separated at the beach from her mother ""Lora"" (Turner). Not that she has much better prospects, but ""Lora"" takes in the destitute couple and that seems to act as her good luck charm. A budding actress, she finds herself slowly but surely - with the aide of the less than scrupulous ""Loomis"" (Robert Alda) - climbing up the greasy pole - without, it has to be said, compromising her integrity. The four march on as her star rises, but of course there is no pain, no gain. ""Sarah Jane"" (by now Susan Kohner) is of mixed-race, and as she struggles to fit in socially, she goes off the rails. Meantime, ""Lora"" has an on/off relationship with ""Steve"" (John Gavin) to whom, also, her daughter takes a bit of a shine too! It's not a melodrama, this film - it's a well crafted characterful drama that mixes comedy, aspiration, racial tension and love - in many different guises; and it delivers a thought provoking but still very entertaining look at 1950s America. Success always comes at a price, and much of Turner's excellence here comes from the fact that she plays a woman who almost glides through life without really appreciating how or why it impacts on her. It's only when the tragedies - yes there are a few - start to hit her square on, that she has to adjust to real life. Gavin was never really any better than eye candy, but here he does have an extra gear and there are strong contributions from both Kohner and Sandra Dee as the sixteen year old ""Susie"". Henri Mancini had a hand in the score of this lavish and complex story that really does allow the talent on screen to deliver some solid writing well and engagingly. Two hours just flies by. || Imitation of Life is a masterpiece that explores race, class, and privilege in 1950s America. Douglas Sirk's final Hollywood film masterfully contrasts the lives of Lora Meredith (Lana Turner) and Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), using their intertwining stories to expose the stark divides of the era. The emotional depth of Annie's relationship with her daughter, who chooses to pass as white, is super-emotional and heart-wrenching. Sirk's use of heightened drama not only serves as a critique of 1950s society's blind spots but also enlightens today's audience about the issues of the time. In the final act, with Mahalia Jackson's moving performance, the film delivers an emotionally shattering experience that cements its status as a timeless work of art. Flawless."

As a young boy, Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) claims to have seen the fearsome Tooth Fairy kill his own mother. He also claims that having seen her, she wont stop until she also kills him. Years later, and still haunted by the experience of that night, Kyle must return to Darkness Falls to aid his childhood sweetheart, Caitlin Greene (Emma Caulfield) and her kid brother Michael, the latter of which who seems to be at risk from the Tooth Fairy this time around. Can Kyle confront his fears and end the 150 years of terror that has blighted Darkness Falls?

Pretty much despised by the discerning horror-phile, Darkness Falls, to me at least, is a creepy, interesting and totally enjoyable thriller/ghost picture worth reappraisals. From the excellent, and chilling opening credits (where we nicely have a back story to work from), to the final confrontation, Darkness Falls ticks most of the ghostly requisites that is asked of it. Scary demon (troubled children with night terrors should be explored more in cinema I feel), cannon fodder bullies, cannon fodder obnoxious coppers and a constant sense of unease and dread. All of which is provided in Jonathan Liebesman's (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"") film. It's with the sense of dread that I feel that this deserves a better reputation. Hand on my heart I know the film isn't a scary boo jump picture, something that is unforgivable to many genre supporters, but atmosphere goes a long way to creating a good thriller/ghost story picture. Darkness Falls has it in spades, and it's also a film that is a nice antidote to the blood beast torture sub-genre of film that seep out from the multi-plexes on a seemingly weekly basis.

Any expectation of an outright horror film should be quickly extinguished prior to a first time viewing, and if noise annoys and staccato editing bugs you? well stay away. Also don't line up if one demands great acting in a budget restricted piece such as this, since both Kley & Caulfield are only adequate at best. But give it a go if you understand that a preposterous plot, and preposterous set pieces are a pre-requisite for horror films of this type. I say that since I've seen many comments decrying Darkness Falls for the unbelievable elements - only to then search their other comments to find praise for even more ludicrously plotted pieces! Or give it a go knowing it's more about the creeping stalking menace side of horror, or that it's also an action thriller as well as an uneasy story. Maybe just maybe you will enjoy it for what it is? Otherwise I guess you will be looking forward to ""Hostel 22"" or another ""Jason Attacks The Eiffel Tower"" movie... 7/10 || **_Atmospheric chiller starts with potential, but falls apart in the second half_**

In the town of Darkness Falls (patterned after Fall River, Massachusetts), a kid named Kyle sees the legendary tooth fairy specter and is forced to go to an orphanage after his mother mysteriously perishes. Twelve years later, Kyle (Chaney Kley) returns to the town where the specter is wreaking havoc and he's jailed under false presumptions. Emma Caulfield plays the girl he left behind and Lee Cormie her little brother who has also seen the malevolent ghost and is therefore getting ""treatment.""

""Darkness Falls"" (2003) is a haunting ghost flick that starts out very promising, but fails to take advantage of its resources and potential. The movie is enhanced by a quality apparition and an eerie vibe, similar to ""The Ring"" from the previous year, not to mention a strong and sympathetic protagonist played by Kley (who would pass away in his sleep four years later due to a breathing problem). Emily Browning is excellent as the 13 year-old girlfriend in the prologue, but Caulfield doesn't capture the character as an adult, although she's okay. Unfortunately she's literally the only prominent female in the movie, which is scandalous for a horror flick of this ilk.

The movie takes a bad turn around the midpoint when Kyle (Kley) makes it to the hospital just as the boy is about to undergo an experimental procedure, which is ultra-contrived, and the film never recovers. In fact, it goes off the rails and totally loses interest. Another negative is that too much of the story takes place indoors. The few outside sequences are effectively atmospheric, but the bulk of the movie takes place in hospitals, houses, a police station and lighthouse.

While the music is good during the end credits, they run for literally ten minutes, which is curious long for a horror flick that only runs 86 minutes. So, really, the story is only 76 minutes long. ""Darkness Falls"" might still be worth checking out for those who value the above positives, just don't expect anything good or great. Overall, it's okay at best, hampered by lousy elements that are stunningly amateurish (for one, glaring kinks needed worked out in the script).

The movie was shot in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, Australia, with establishing shots in Maine.

Though Wharton was a wealthy New York socialite, she had glimpses of New England village life, and it was the harsh winters, dire poverty and cruel gossip of this region that she sought to portray. The eponymous character (played by Liam Neeson) is a young farmer in the fictional Massachusetts community of Starkfield, whose dreams of making something of himself are dashed by the early death of his parents and then his marriage to the sickly Zenobia ""Zeena"" Frome (Joan Allen). When Zeena's cousin beautiful cousin Mattie Silver (Patricia Arquette) comes to help out in the house, Ethan's heart is thawed, but ultimately the uncompromising conditions of Starkfield life bring Ethan and Mattie to a tragedy.

The plot of a pair of star-crossed lovers is rather overdone, but <i>Ethan Frome</i> is interesting in its depiction of a Massachusetts village in the late 19th century, complete with characters speaking in dialect and a description of country farmhouses. This adaptation does a decent job of presenting those strengths of the novel. It also offers an improvement on the novel in that it tweaks Wharton's risible climax -- Ethan and Mattie deciding to escape this cruel world by sledding down a hill into a big elm tree, the stupidest means of suicide in all of literature -- to be more believable.

The adaption is flawed, however, by a number of factors. One is the decision to change the framing story of Wharton's novel. In the book, the visitor to Starkfield who spurs the flashback is an engineer who wonders why Frome is so taciturn. In this film, however, the visitor is the town's new preacher, just out of seminary, who protests against Frome being shunned by the town. Wharton's portrayal of a man who walls himself off by the world after multiple tragedies is replaced, then, by an element completely unknown to the novel: the castigation of the villagers as ignoring basic Christian charity. This has consequences for the ending, which is much less powerful than the novel. Another unwelcome change is that Ethan and Mattie sleep together, while in Wharton's novel the characters seem incapable under their dire circumstances of having even a physical relationship. Also, Liam Neeson offers some of the best acting in the film, but he's 10 years too old to play this role.

I first saw this film when it was shown on PBS nearly two decades ago, and it works well enough as passive entertainment on television, but this is a second-rate affair in many ways and I cannot recommend it."

This has a great soundtrack - ""You Can Get It if You Really Want It"" features a little too repetitively, but ""Many Rivers to Cross"" and the eponymous title track along with an edgy and engaging characterisation from Cliff keep it entertaining enough. Technically, the film itself is pretty poorly hung together with some very basic production, editing and the dialogue - authentically using a patois that could maybe have been subtitled? - is pretty difficult to make out as the audio mix is not the best. It ends as history tells us it does, and though I didn't hate it - I think it is more remarkable for it's place in cinema history being the first feature made locally than it will ever be as a notable film."

Lacking the originality of New Jack, Sugar Hill could be described as The Blackfather (I would also accept Blacklito’s Way), although it reaches much farther back than that; the film is a tragedy in the classic sense of the word – or at least it would be if it didn’t have one scene too many, specifically a tacked-on semi-happy ending (the previous scene, involving a climactic yet clichéd Gun Struggle, doesn’t do the movie any favors either).

As a Godfather clone, Sugar Hill knows the words but not the music. For instance, evil drug dealer Lolly Jonas (Ernie Hudson) kills good drug dealer Roemello Skuggs's (Wesley Snipes) best friend Goggles (Steve Harris), but instead of seeking retaliation, and hoping to avoid more bloodshed, Roemello makes a precarious truce with Lolly which is broken by Roemello’s older but less competent brother Raynathan (Michael Wright). At the same time, Roemello is looking to quit the drug business and settle down with his new girlfriend Melissa (Theresa Randle), who rhetorically asks him “Do you know that every time I go out with you, somebody dies?” (that’s a breakup line you don’t hear every day).

I get it. I really do. Roemello is Don Corleone – both Mike and Vito –, Goggles is Sonny, Raynathan is Fredo, Melissa is Kay, and so on and so forth. Hell, the cast even includes Abe Vigoda, who played treacherous caporegime Sal Tessio in the first Godfather. On the other hand, what I’m not quite sure about is why exactly Lolly kills Goggles in the first place other than because he’s the bad guy and to speed things along. Another character that exists solely as a victim to be sacrificed on the altar of plot developments is Kymie (Donald Faison), a young, dumb wannabe gangsta who appears in literally two (2) scenes; he’s like Solomon Grundy except he dies on Tuesday instead of Saturday.

Something else New Jack has that Sugar Hill doesn’t is perspective. I mentioned above that Roemello is a “good drug dealer”, an assessment made possible because the movie expresses almost no interest in the effects of drug addiction, and when it does, we catch it in a glaring contradiction; the only two characters who experience firsthand the ravages of chemical dependence are Roemello’s parents, so that his becoming a pusher makes as much sense as if the murder of Bruce Wayne’s mother and father had inspired him to become a murderer himself as opposed to a crime fighter."
9358.0,Final Destination 2,"When Kimberly has a violent premonition of a highway pileup she blocks the freeway, keeping a few others meant to die, safe...Or are they?

Kimberly Corman has a terrifying vision that a highway pile up will claim her life and that of her friends. Blocking the entrance with her car, Kimberly watches in horror as the crash unfolds, thus saving her life and that of the people in the queue behind her. But the grim reaper is not impressed and he's coming to claim the deaths of all those who should have died in the crash.

For a sequel to truly work well it has to come up with something fresh, otherwise why do a sequel eh? Well the makers of Final Destination 2 choose to use the basic same formula of the hugely enjoyable first film, only adding more black humour into the crazy death design broth. Opening with a quite horrific highway pile up, FD 2 then takes us on a journey that sees an assortment of folk offed in various and gruesome ways. The story remains the same as the first film, even though writers Bress and Gruber think they are being intricate by weaving this plot into the original story, but ultimately it's just a devilishly nonsense fun picture. Ali Larter returns for a second helping, and she in turn is joined by a bunch of no mark actors waiting for death, which is perfectly fine for the genre discerning fan.

This is a riot, and as long as you don't look too deep into it (why would you really?) you may just find yourself having a real good time. 7/10 || ***Solid sequel, maybe a notch better than the first film***

The first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper, as an invisible spiritual presence. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually involving an unlikely chain reaction. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash; in this second film from 2003 it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.

There are currently five films in the franchise and they all tell the same basic story with different characters and some nuances; they’re all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same, although the fifth film throws in an interesting new twist (Death’s victim can find a substitute).

Ali Larter returns as a secondary protagonist while A.J. Cook takes the reigns of the 'final girl.’ Keegan Connor Tracy also has a considerable role in the female department while Sarah Carter has a smaller part. While this is a quality assortment of women, the creators coulda done more with them. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum Michael Landes stars as a state trooper. Jonathan Cherry, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson and James Kirk are also on hand. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his second of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.

I actually like this one a little better than the first one, but like that film, the second half isn’t as strong as the first. Is the final scene supposed to be horrific? Cuz it made me bust out laughing.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area, including Campbell River (although the events take place around New York City).

GRADE: B/B- || This is my least favorite out of the series. Just the main character doesn't sell her character to me in this. The death scenes were cool, but it was just an ok movie."

Daredevil (2003) falls prey to a lot of judgment from people who have spent over a decade with Marvel films and The Dark Knight trilogy, but rewind to a time when Blade, X-Men, and Tobey Macguire’s Spider-man were all you had for superhero films, and you might start to see Daredevil for what it was. It was a genuine product of its time - Seether and Evanescence heavily featured on the soundtrack, leather superhero suits, and ridiculous dialogue. Everything was so cheesy in superhero movies at the time - don’t forget that Catwoman came out just a year later. Daredevil tried to be more edgy and gritty than Spider-man at a time when most people still considered superhero movies as kids’ films. It had a lot going against it but still brought together a fantastic cast with Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell at a very popular time in their careers and Jennifer Garner while she was one of the biggest stars on TV. This movie even managed to spawn a spin-off film! Say what you want, but when I saw this movie in 7th grade, I thought Daredevil was one of the coolest superheroes I had ever seen, and even though years later I can see the movie more for what it is - it still holds a special place in my heart."

Immediately, you can tell there is a dip in the quality of animation.  To be fair, no only is this in that string of unnecessary sequels that Disney did, it is right after they switched from classic cell animation to digital cell animation, but it was 2 years after ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" and that looks amazing.

The other immediate problem (even on the cover) is that Mowgli is still wearing his mystery diaper (never established where it came from) instead of actual clothes.

As Mowgli struggles with being of two worlds (an arguably great point from the original movie), he extends his entitled behavior to returning to the Jungle, aggravating the village, as Sher Khan returns to hunting Mowgli, extending his obsession / pride (sort of a Moby Dick thing).

Lacking some creativity, they return to some of the old songs (3 that I can think of, ""Bear Necessities"" and ""Jungle Rhythm"" being over used, and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" at the credits of all places) instead of using original material.

As the adventures continue it's reveal that Mowgli had no natural connection to the animals, it's just that EVERYTHING speaks English, the other human characters don't bat an eye or lose a beat.  It completely ruins the movie.  At least in Tarzan it was clear he would ""ooh ooh"" to the Guerillas.  What little charm they were able to drag from the previous movie to this one is just destroyed by that.

The dramatization of Mowgli's endangerment also has a lesser impact this time, as he's survived before, and this time around we also have 2 other hapless children running about the Jungle who must have been blessed with invincibility to survive all that they do.

I'm not saying there isn't something to enjoy here, but there is a lot more that I didn't, and there are far too many other movies to see."
1956.0,Gerry,Two friends named Gerry become lost in the desert after taking a wrong turn. Their attempts to find their way home only lead them into further trouble.,The desert can be a silent world.,"Drama, Adventure, Mystery",103,2002-09-20,en,6.092,322,2.6085,"Casey Affleck, Matt Damon","Gus Van Sant, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon, Gus Van Sant","friendship, hiking, highway, wilderness, getting lost, friends, best friend, desert, death valley","***A total BORE about being lost in the desert, but Worthwhile for a few reasons***

""Gerry"" (2002) is a film by Gus Van Sant, the director of ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Elephant."" It stars Matt Damon and Casey Affleck as two friends who get lost in the desert; they spend the entire film just walking around the beautiful parched landscapes trying to find a way out.

As a captivating piece of cinema, ""Gerry"" is a TOTAL failure. I say this without any reservation because my definition of a good film is one that simply maintains your interest. If the film fails to capture your interest, that is, it bores you, causes your thoughts to wander, puts you to sleep, etc. THEN IT'S NOT A GOOD FILM. Yet, even though this is true, I find there are a number of reasons why ""Gerry"" is a worthwhile piece of cinema: 

1. It gives a good laugh. Although it's a serious ""story"" and by no means a comedy, I found myself uproariously laughing on quite a few occasions. Why? I don't know, perhaps because I can't believe someone would actually blow the money ($3.5 million) on making such a ""film"" and actually think people would like it (well, beyond pretentious art-geeks). Also there are several laugh-inducing sequences, albeit unintentional, like the absurdly overlong CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH scene.

2. It makes for a great joke movie. What I mean is, you can tell a friend or family member what a great movie you have for them to watch (do a lot of raving) and put ""Gerry"" in; then just kick back and wait for their inevitable negative reaction (e.g. ""This movie's a piece of sh**"", etc.). In most cases it will only take between 15 and 20 minutes, and certainly no longer than 35-40 minutes, unless it's someone who has a romantic interest in you and doesn't want to hurt your feelings.

3. If, like me, you enjoy watching beautiful landscapes, in this case desert landscapes filmed in America (Utah & Southern Cal) and Argentina, then ""Gerry"" is a decent flick in which to kick back. Especially if you just want to relax and not have to THINK. The ambient piano/violin score nicely enhances the relaxing mood.

4. It is a great sleep-aid. Seriously, if you're having trouble sleeping, pop in ""Gerry"" and it'll send you straight to la-la land. I'm serious here, the first time I watched it I was ready to fall asleep after a mere 20 minutes, although I ended up lasting about a half hour. Because of this, it took me FOUR intervals to complete the film (and, yes, it put me to sleep each time).

Just so you know, the movie is titled ""Gerry"" because the two guys constantly refer to each other as ""Gerry,"" a friendly nickname meaning ""loser"" or ""screw-up."" 

Although the film itself is a bore I do enjoy the debates over its probable meaning, e.g. life itself is a desert and the foolhardy side of your psyche (that is, your “id” or “flesh”) must perish in order for you to survive and thrive.

By the way, the Affleck character fits the name ""Gerry"" to a 'T.' You gotta listen REAL close when he speaks because he just sort of mumbles his lines (what few there are).

BOTTOM LINE: Although ""Gerry"" is an abysmal failure as far as captivating cinema goes, it's worthwhile for the four reasons noted above, plus it’s interesting to interpret, hence my 2-Star rating. I suppose ""Gerry"" can be respected for brazenly rejecting EVERY cinematic convention, but that’s more stupefying than bold. Which prompts me to wonder: Maybe Gus Van Sant is pulling the ultimate Gerry on us… and we're all Gerrys because we FELL for it!

The film runs 1 hour and 43 minutes and is at least an hour overlong. Several tedious scenes are about ten times longer than they need to be. I wish I were kidding. They’re laughable.

Berbers come to New York to get their prize stallion back and Alec (Kelly Reno) pursues them to the desert wilderness of Morocco and possibly Algeria. Vincent Spano plays his Moroccan companion.   

I like ""The Black Stallion Returns"" (1983) slightly more than the first one. It’s not as artistic, but it’s dramatically compelling and definitely more adventurous. It’s like “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962), but with a boy & his horse and faster-paced. 

No, it’s not epic or refined like “Lawrence” but, if you’re in the mood for a youth-oriented Saharan adventure, it fills the bill. The stowaway part is well done and I appreciated the inclusion of raven-haired beauty Jodi Thelen.

Some viewers complain about the ending, but it fits. Think about it.   

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in New York City, Djanet, Morocco, Algeria, Abiquiu, New Mexico, Italy, Santa Clarita & Los Angeles.

A boy befriends a fiery Arabian stallion in the Mediterranean in 1946 and ends up hooking up with an ex-horse racing trainer (Mickey Rooney) back home in the northeast USA. Teri Garr plays the mother.   

""The Black Stallion"" (1979) starts out like Tarzan’s origin, just substituting the horse for the apes, before switching to the typical sports formula (young underdog’s talent is recognized and trained by an over-the-hill mentor). Thankfully, this is not a Disney kiddie flick; the tone is artistic and mature with the same visual/audio wonder of “The Secret Garden” (1993), both movies produced by Francis Ford Coppola.

While it’s as aesthetically awesome as “The Secret Garden,” it’s not as dramatically engaging. Teri Garr's role is negligible and Rooney’s character isn’t interesting like, say, Mr. Miyagi in “The Karate Kid” (1984) or even Nick Nolte’s ‘Socrates’ in “Peaceful Warrior” (2006). Either Garr’s part needed beefed up or the scriptwriters should’ve added another character to the mix, like a girl who befriends the boy, but SOMETHING to keep things compelling.

As it is, the story is too dull to maintain the interest of most people over 7 years-old. But the stallion is magnificent and I appreciated the relationship between boy & beast, not to mention the excellent post-war era décor and the afore-noted artistic exquisiteness.   

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in Sardinia, Italy (island sequences), and the Toronto area of Canada, with some stuff done in northwest Oregon (Astoria, Gearhart and Nehalem).

The Red Badge of Courage is directed by John Huston who also co-adapts to screenplay with Albert Band from the novel of the same name written by Stephen Crane. It stars Audie Murphy, Bill Mauldin, Andy Devine, Robert Easton, Douglas Dick, Royal Dano, Arthur Hunnicutt and Tim Durant. Music is by Bronislau Kaper and cinematography by Harold Rosson. 

The American Civil War and Union soldiers head South to confront the Confederate army. Young Henry Fleming (Murphy) is ill prepared for the horrors of war, so when the crunch comes he retreats from the first battle he’s faced with and has a life choice of either being known as a coward, or find something from within to make him strong enough to return to the front line. 

Nutshell History Of The Production. 

John Huston believed that this could have been his masterpiece, but an MGM power struggle saw the film butchered. A narration was insisted upon after poor test screenings, Huston washed his hands off the picture, while Lillian Ross produced a critically acclaimed book about the production. With no fanfare or bunting put out by the studio to promote the picture, the eventual 70 minute cut of the movie flopped as audiences didn’t quite like the tonal flows of the piece. Over time, even in its truncated form of just under 70 minutes, pic has garnered praise to become something of a classic as it stands, while also being considered as a lost masterpiece due to the cut material apparently being lost forever. 

Beautifully photographed by Rosson, it’s a film that has often been tagged as some sort of arty exercise. Yet it never once feels like it has ideas above its station, it quite simply is a very intimate and touching portrayal of Americans fighting Americans. It doesn’t soft soap anything, deftly imbuing the narrative with the awfulness of the war and the effect on those wearing the uniforms. The period design is superb, the battle sequences crafted with great skill by Huston, and in Murphy the pic has a great fulcrum for youthful confusion acted with a skill that many still think he didn’t have. 

Up close and personal, with raw emotional seeping from its pores, The Red Badge of Courage is a potent exercise in war film making. As Audie stands there at culmination of battle charge, holding in his hands the battered flags of both the Union and the Confederacy, the impact is quite something to behold. 8.5/10 || Audie Murphy quite potently epitomises the fighting spirit of the young ""Fleming"" at the height of the US Civil War. He's most certainly not a coward, but he's no warrior either and as he becomes exposed to the repetitive, seemingly endless, horrors of the war he really isn't sure whether to stand and fight or run and hide. Even if he were to succumb to the later survival instinct and still survive, could he endure the consequent shame? If he steps up the mark, will it make him ever an angry and violent man? What's also clear here is the extent to which he is not alone amongst the solders of both sides, their officers - even the general, are all conflicted to an extent as the bodies mount amidst all the mud, splintered trees and tears. It's a curiously short film that rather offers us a baptism of fire as we are swiftly immersed in this young man's predicament, but therein lay the problem for me. I didn't know him, nor much about him and as the story developed I felt way too much detail and character were missing as we raced along to a denouement that was never really in doubt. The production looks good, conveying effectively the grubbiness of their battles and their dependance on beans, but that lack of detail and the slightly documentary feel to the photography left me wondering if this wasn't just a bit of a school history lesson tempered with a bit of God-fearing. I quite liked Murphy as an actor, easy on the eye and never troubling to the brain, and he does enough here but on the whole I felt there was way more missing than not."

Even though I love the Civil War I waited a full six and a half years before catching the prequel ""Gods and Generals"" (2003). Why? Because 1993's ""Gettysburg"" was so unimpressive. While ""Gettysburg"" has some worthwhile scenes it was merely okay on a whole, and sometimes downright tedious. How the filmmakers made the Civil War's biggest battle boring (generally speaking) is beyond me.

Gods and Generals"" is the prequel detailing the battles of First Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, which are largely viewed through the lens of Stonewall Jackson (Stephan Lang) on the Confederate side and the Chamberlain brothers (Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell) of Maine on the Union side. Also on hand is, of course, Robert E. Lee, played by Robert Duvall, who does a more engaging portrayal than Martin Sheen in ""Gettysburg."" The film starts off slow and builds momentum. By contrast, ""Gettysburg"" started off slower and never became engaging with the exception of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge. 

Where ""Gods and Generals"" really pulled me in was the battle scenes of Fredericksburg and the aftermath. It showed how Civil War troops were required to march, shoot & reload in formation while rifles and friggin’ cannons are blasting their way. The Chamberlain brothers had to sleep on the battlefield that night. Imagine sleeping amongst all those dead bodies and dying, moaning soldiers! This was very well done.

There are quite a few other great scenes, like the Yankee and Reb soldiers meeting in the middle of the river to exchange coffee for tobacco; the execution of three deserters; and the ""perfect battle"" for the Confederates at Chancellorsville where General Lee, with a much smaller force, takes the risk of dividing his army and executing a surprise attack. Unfortunately for the Confederates they won at a huge cost as General Jackson loses his ""right arm"" to friendly fire.

The story ends on a slow, melancholy note.

I was impressed with the battle in the town scene. The town looked so authentic. Watching the documentary afterward I learned how they accomplished this: they filmed it at Harpers Ferry, WV.

Some have complained that the Southern viewpoint is shown in a more positive light than the Northern, but I disagree. While it seems more time is spent with Jackson & Lee's story, considerable time is certainly given to the North as well; the film does an excellent job of taking the middle road between the two positions.

The film was shot on location in Virginia, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, WV and runs 3 hours and 39 minutes. The Director's Cut (which I haven't seen) runs a full hour longer and features the bloody battle of Antietam and a subplot with John Wilkes Booth.

FINAL WORD: If you thought ""Gettysburg"" was boring don't let that prevent you from checking out ""Gods and Generals."" Yes, you have to be ready for a long movie and it does have some slow, dramatic parts but it builds momentum and it's one of best Civil War films in helping the viewer visualize the battles and many other aspects.

WARNING: Believe it or not, the film shows overt depictions of Bible reading, citation and prayer!! It also dares to show Christianity and marriage (between a man and woman) in a positive light!! Oh my God!!!

<em>'Open Hearts'</em> is actually a film that doesn't really evoke many thoughts in my head. It's a solid watch, the story is standout and the acting is more than satisfactory. Apart from that, I don't have much elese to say, to be honest.

Sonja Richter and Mads Mikkelsen are very good together in this, as are Paprika Steen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas in fairness. The whole plot that they are all involved in is rather depressing, the relationship between Richter's Cecilie and Mikkelsen's Joachim is uncomforting to see unfold. Stine Bjerregaard's character is annoyingly used (just there to twist the story) but the Bjerregaard herself does do well.

I will say that I didn't overly like the editing/camera work, though that's pretty much only early on as it becomes less noticeable as the film ticks by. That's the only real negative that I have."

I guess when push comes to shove it’s an action film that delivers the requisite supply of biff, bam and kerpow action sequences. Yet even allowing for the old “leave the brain at the door” requirement for such action comic malarkey, the script is too poor, the acting equally so, while the choreography is weak. The latter of which a big misstep when you have Jet Li and Mark Dacascos fronting the good guy/bad guy axis of the story.

Plot pitches Li’s ass kicking detective with DMX’s urban thief together as an unlikely buddy buddy combo trailing missing diamonds and DMX’s kidnapped daughter, and that’s pretty much it. There’s no attempts to expand the characters or add some emotional depth to what is meant to be a pretty critical situation.

It often feels tired, like a recycling of so many other film’s of similar ilk, originality is out the window here, hell they even get Tom Arnold in to reprise a watered down version of his character from True Lies. Gabrielle Union and Kelly Hu are on hand to add the sexy sizzle in thankless roles, while Dacascos barely registers as an uber villain.

Lazy and redundant, all told, a waste of time for cast and viewers alike. 4/10 || Extremely dumb, but <em>'Cradle 2 the Grave'</em> actually did entertain me.

The humour and cast are the strongest parts to this film, it made me laugh a couple of times to be fair. Jet Li (Su) and DMX (Anthony) are the two leads, they aren't all that memorable in truth but at least do have a few good scenes. The main ones I'll remember are in fact two bit part roles in Anthony Anderson (Tommy) and Tom Arnold (Archie). Those two kept things comedic which worked well. Chi McBride is also solid as Chambers, who should've been the main villain in my opinion.

The premise is borderline rubbish, but the above mentioned things as well as the music/action made sure I was enjoying myself while watching this - that's sometimes all you want."

It's the scheming Northumberland (John Wood) who conceives a plan with the equally ambitious Suffolk (Patrick Stewart) and his wife (Sara Kestelman) to marry his own son Guilford (Cary Elwes) to their daughter Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) so that her tenuous claim to the throne could be better upheld when the sickly young king died. Aware that the public would have little stomach for such an arrangement, and that the Princess Mary (Jane Lapotaire) would not give up her rights to succeed easily, this is a perilous course for these two families to take. Luckily, though, the young Jane is no match for their machinations and soon both she and her new husband are but pawns in a grander game. What the parents don't quite anticipate is that the couple actually start to fall in love, and begin to think that with her on the throne then maybe good can come of this usurpation. Can she survive for long enough once Edward is dead? It's an history, so we know what happened to whom and when, but as a well crafted drama it looks good and HBC and Elwes manage a degree of chemistry that works quite engagingly as the writing becomes increasingly on the wall for the pair. Wood and Kestelman also deliver quite effectively here as the schemers-in-chief, and as the plot thickens we do get a sense of just how powerless these young people were in the face of ambitious men who cared little for the wishes of their children or their country.

A squadron of Navy Seals led by Lt.

The Doctor insists that ""her people"" go with them and so Waters opts for leading 'em out on foot to the Cameroon border. Will they make it out alive? 

""Tears of the Sun"" (2003) has an ultra-serious vibe and _some_ depth. If you appreciate ""The 7th Dawn"" (1964) with William Holden and Capucine, this is cut from the same cloth, just with modern production quality and more focus on grim jungle drama & action, like ""Rambo"" (2008). While it's arguably on par with ""The 7th Dawn,"" it doesn't stand with the giants of the genre, such as ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) or ""Platoon"" (1986).

For one thing, the characters outside of those played by Willis and Belucci are relatively forgettable, which isn't the case with ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon"" wherein you know and remember the bulk of the key characters. Another good example would be ""Last Of The Mohicans"" (1992), which has a similar tone and theme, i.e. protagonists being chased through the forest by savage antagonists.

The issue I have with ""Tears of the Sun"" is that it jumps right into the thick of the jungle story without allowing the viewer to get to know anyone. The theme is heavy and the vibe is fittingly serious, including the score, but because we aren't emotionally tied to the characters the picture comes across too heavy-handed and melodramatic. It doesn't help that it's one-dimensional.

Meanwhile the 2-hour movie is fairly slow moving with the big-action sequence not taking place until the finale. The problem with this ""exciting"" climax is that the viewer, once again, doesn't care what happens at this point because we don't really know the characters and therefore have little emotional attachment.

Although the story takes place in Nigeria the picture was obviously shot in Hawaii. The difference in geography is enough that the film loses points for realism, but who can deny the beauty of Hawaii? So maybe it gains the points back.

The Director's Cut merely adds the deleted scenes from the Special Edition DVD to the film. In other words, unless you absolutely love the flick it's not necessary to buy the Director's Cut; just watch the deleted scenes. Speaking of the deleted scenes, there's one quietly potent scene where a black American talks with a black Nigerian. It has good dialogue and should've never been cut.

Yet ""Tears of the Sun"" has some attributes, including the ultra-serious vibe, cinematography, score and Monica Belucci. The harrowing sequence where the squadron saves a rural village from some ruthless militants is well done. But this is far from a good film IMHO; at the same time, it's not bad and has its points of interest. Check out ""Rambo"" (2008) if you want to see the same theme done in a more effective manner.

King Of Kings is a good film, and certainly one that is better than its reputation suggests. It's for sure better than the poorly put together The Robe from 1953 and the gargantuan excess that would be The Greatest Story Ever Told four years post this MGM piece.

Produced by legendary Samuel Bronston and directed with assurance and imagination by Nicholas Ray, the film tells of the 33 years of Jesus Christ's life. From his birth in Bethlehem to his Crucifixion, to the Resurrection and finally the Ascension. A familiar story that is nicely spread to a movie under three hours long, takes in the Apostles selection, John The Baptist, 40 days in the desert, the miracles (though we are short changed here), Sermom on the Mount, Judas' betrayal and of course The Last Supper.

The film contains a narration by Orson Welles, which was written by Ray Bradbury. It's a wise move for it helps the narrative immensely, while lets face it here, Orson had a great voice, perfectly biblical and it lends a touch of class to the material. Of the cast, Jeffrey Hunter has the glory role of Christ. A relative unknown (this helps I feel), Hunter is effective with his steely blue eyes, while Robert Ryan is first rate as the doomed John The Baptist. Also turning in good performances are Harry Guardino (Barabbas), Viveca Lindfors (Claudia), Royal Dano (Peter) and Rip Torn (Judas). Though not hurting the movie, Hurd Hatfield as Pontius Pilate is a touch too animated, while Frank Thring as Herod Antipas takes the woe is me mantra a step too far.

Naturally with a budget of $8 million the film has considerable scope. Thousands of extras are a given of course, all captured among the Spanish locations in 70mm Technicolor (Cinematography by Manuel Berenguer, Milton R. Krasner & Franz Planer). While the sets (almost 400 used) are very pleasing on the eye and Miklós Rózsa provides a suitably effective score. The writing from Philip Yordan is lean, there's no heavy filler and for a film of this type it's a pleasant surprise to see such restraint. Ultimately it's just real good story telling given a good technical work out. The appearance of Judas for the first time still sends a shiver down the old spine and the Crucifixtion instills a sadness that is hard to shake off once the credits have rolled. Job done really. 8/10"

It's a gun pointed at somebody's head. All depends upon which end of the gun you stand, whether the law is just or not. 

The Talk of the Town is directed by George Stevens and Stevens co-produces with Fred Guiol. It's adapted by Dale Van Every, Irwin Shaw and Sidney Buchman from a story by Sidney Harmon. It stars Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Ronald Colman, Rex Ingram and Edgar Buchanan.

Leopold Dilg (Grant), a radical and political thinking man, is accused of burning down a mill and causing the death of a foreman in the subsequent fire. On trial for his life, he decides to escape from jail and makes his way to the home of his school day friend Nora Shelley (Arthur). However, his timing couldn't be worse, for Nora has taken in a tenant for the summer, a law professor, Michael Lightcap (Colman). Passing him off as the gardener, Nora has to hope that Lightcap doesn't cop on to Dilg being an escaped prisoner. But with both men feeling each other out, and both having designs on Nora, something is going to have to give.

Though nominated in seven Academy Award categories, ""The Talk of the Town"" won none. Perhaps more surprisingly is that of those seven nominations, none were for acting or direction. Surprising because the film is impeccably acted and smoothly directed. It was, however, rightly nominated for Best Picture (it lost out to William Wyler's ""Mrs. Miniver"") and was a big smash at the box office. The public quickly warmed to the blend of comedy with intelligent politico musings. The set up is safe, a potential love triangle - with the three leads playing off each other sublimely - is nicely played out whilst the two men partake in discussions about the law, the applications of such and its moral worth. The comedy that comes in fits and starts is not so much of the screwball variety, but more that of ebullience born out of beautifully written sequences. Some argue that the plot is heavily reliant on contrivances (how many 1940s comedies aren't?), but ultimately that is easily forgiven given the quality on show across the board. 8/10"

It's a classic case of a family film keeping everything simple for maximum results. A big hit upon release, as was the book written by Joy Adamson, the beautiful landscapes and emotionally swirling musical score marry up perfectly with the story being told. There's some liberties taken with the facts, both with humans and lions, but we aren't in to this pic for any sort of misery or grimy drama. We want, and get, feel good, a time for animal lovers to rejoice and wipe that fly from the eye. 8/10 || > We want them to be an angel, but being wild is what defines them.

I thought I dreamt about these lions when I was a kid, but when I came to know about this film that made me realise I actually saw this film when I was a very young to remember anything. It was a few images remained in memory, that's how I tracked it. So while watching this now brought back those scary moments. Yep, I was scared like hell, like the character Kendall from it was. Childhood is like a dream, until we re-encounter those things we held, met, seen, which wakes up our memory after a long time and becoming adults.

I really enjoyed watching it, because I love animals. But what I did not like was harming the animals. I don't think animals were harmed while making this film, and they even smartly censored story/scene that consists harming/killing them. Actually the film was inspired by the real story, in that, the animals were killed and that is what this film depicted, yet disappoints from that perspective. The time has changed, now it is different, we learnt our lesson, so I hope we focus on protecting this magnificent animal to be born free and to be wild.

The Africa was very beautifully portrayed. One of the best films on the wild animal theme I've ever seen. It was a documentary style narration with a little story from the human couple. Hats off to the real Joy and George Adamson. It won a couple of Oscars in the category of music and song. But I think it deserved more than that. I can't believe it is rated PG, but I scared watching it as a kid and I believe the young children with the awareness of the true nature of the lions would do the same. But still highly recommended for all ages. We have now 'Duma', 'Two Brothers' and many more, but this film is something special and you will know it after a watch.

Intrepid professor Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook leads an expedition towards the center of the Earth via an extinct Icelandic volcano. The journey is sure to be fraught with danger and little do they know that their trip will take in many unchartered wonders...both good and bad!

As adventure films go, Journey To The Center Of The Earth has few peers, it's a wonderful film based around the Jules Verne story of the same name. There are no hidden agendas here, no wry social commentary or satirical edginess, it is pure fantastical entertainment that wants you to enjoy its science heart whilst you have a blast following this group into the wondrous unknown. Lost cities, prehistoric lizards, underground oceans, crystal caves, sand mines, murder, sabotage, and on it goes for just over two hours of delightful movie making, it even has time for a bit of cheeky sexual tom foolery for the knowing adult.

I'm sure the likes of Spielberg & Lucas were nodding in approval back in the day.

The sets, the sound, and the special effects were all nominated for Academy Awards, and sure enough all may well seem tame by todays bloated standards, but this is 1959 and let your mind be back to that time and you surely will be taken in by this joyous experience. While I must also mention that location footage shot in the beautiful Carlsbad Caverns that adds to the dynamic feel of the picture. Lead acting duties fall to the irrepressible James Mason as Lindenbrook, perfectly cast as he nails all the traits of this dyed in the wood professor. Support comes from Pat Boone, Arlene Dahl (the colour photography perfectly showing her piercing eyes), Peter Ronson and star of the show Gertrude The Duck.

It was magical to me as a child, it's still as magical to me now I'm in my advancing years, wonderful indeed. 9/10 || ***Into the bowels of the earth with James Mason, Pat Boone, Arlene Dahl and… Gertrude, the duck***
 
In 1880, a professor from Edinburgh (James Mason) leads a team to follow a renowned scientist's path down an extinct volcano in Iceland to explore the bowels of the earth. Pat Boone plays the professor’s favorite student, Arlene Dahl the Swedish wife of the professor’s rival, Peter Ronson a towering Icelandic ranch hand and Thayer David the morally dubious descendent of the original pioneer.  

Very loosely based on Jules Verne’s book, “Journey to the Center of the Earth” (1959) is an amusing and imaginative family-friendly adventure flick with a superlative cast. It’s not great like “Mysterious Island” (1961) and is a little less serious, but it’s cut from the same cloth and is worth checking out if you can appreciate the quaintness of movies from that time period. Redhead Dahl is stunning, a true whoa-man. And Gertrude the duck is entertaining, but what happens to her is unforgivable.
    
The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot in Edinburgh, Scotland; Carlsbad, New Mexico; and Malibu & Lone Pine, California; along with lots of stuff done in the studio. 

GRADE: B- || James Mason is super in this adaptation of the Jules Verne story about a Scottish scientist and his rather motley team who set off in search of a long-lost Icelandic vulcanologist deep in the bowels of the Earth. I've been watching this film for thirty odd years now, and it is still a good, entertaining version of a strong fantasy story. Thayer David is good as the evil ""Count Saknussemm"" and there is even a duck to keep things in proportion as they combat each other and all sorts of prehistoric beasties on their journey. It's a wonderfully colourful and gently comedic treasure hunt..."

At times this is a little over-contrived, with that sense that if something can go wrong it will or if it's vital that a person doesn't turn up just at that moment, then you just know they will - and that's a bit annoying on occasion as it tends to undermine just a little too much of the drama here. That said, it's still quite a different coming-of-age style of story that isn't limited to the maturing of the younger members of the cast. Langlet delivers delicately here and Greggory does get a bit under your skin as both men seek the attentions of a woman who's generally quite tired of the fickle attitudes of the men around her and ""Pauline"" just gets increasingly fed up."

It's not Neil Simon's best script adaptation either, indeed ""Nights of Cabiria"" might blush at the rather staccato nature of this tribute. It looks great and there's quite some chemistry between MacLaine and the suave and debonaire Montalban and by mid-way through, you just want poor old ""Charity"" to find her happiness.

Sure it is not the best Stephen King adaptation, but it is far from the worst.  Some fairly hammy acting, dodgy CGI and tonnes of cliché Stephen King tropes don't stop this film from being lightweight fun, so long as you are not expecting a work of art.  

Damien Lewis is a stand-out, especially when he is being the Mr Gray personality and most of the rest of the cast do well enough, with a little bit of coasting from Tom Sizemore and Morgan Freeman.  It is however hard to look past the patronising and mildly offensive portrayal of the idiot savant Duddits, and the ending is completely stupid.  But if you have a spare couple of hours there are worse ways to spend time.  

B grade film with an A grade cast and a budget somewhere in between. || This is all I have to say... Butthole-cock-monsters. || Compared to the book, yeah, it stinks...but that's really only because it got lost somewhere in translation from prose to screen.

Take it as it is, take it as a movie and its not half bad, the problem is that, once you leave the book behind what you have is an old fashioned B horror movie that is trying to sell itself in an era where B horror movies need the special effects of modern super hero movies and the basic plot of a Dick and Jane novel.

And then, in many ways, it's just too expensive. It feels like a classic Drive-In horror flick, but it looks like a block buster. Tone down the budget by a few million and make it a direct to video movie and it would have cult classic status already...despite the people that actually read the source material.

The acting is good, the special effects are too good, the setting is cool, but the plot hurts a bit and the fact that Duddits is Intellectually Disabled is inevitably going to put off more that a few viewers.

Really though, what you have is a great B Movie Drive-In fair that somehow got an actual budget wot work with. And you could do a lot worse in this Post New Hollywood day and age."

Don't get me wrong, it's fine to have simple dreams, and the romanticism of Paris is great for ""small town"" folk aspirations, but the movie leans on it pretty heavy for comedy purposes.

If you peel back a couple of layers, there is a great metaphor for woman empowerment and being able to reach their goals through hard work and networking, but it is really subtle.

My review here.... I confess it was prompted by the review given by Kamurai (which was the first review given on this movie on The Movie Data Base).

Also by way of background, I came to watch this movie because of who is in it. Specifically Gwyneth Paltrow, who I first came across in 'Sliding Doors' (1998), Christina Applegate, who I first came across in 'Married... With Children' (1987-1997), Kelly Preston, who I first came across in 'Jerry Maguire' (1996) and Mike Myers, who I first came across in the 'Austin Powers movies' (1997, 1999, 2002).

To a lesser extent Candice Bergen who I first came across in 'Murphy Brown' (1988-1998, 2018). I later watched 'Gandhi' (1982) and discovered that Candice Bergen had an important role towards the end of it.

I wanted to see a movie in which these actors had moved on to. That is what brought me to 'View From the Top' (2003).

**The actual review**

First of all, I think the first reviewer description of ""little person, little dreams"" (quotes by them) is... how to say this... betrays a lack of empathy. The Gwyneth Paltrow central character is actually a big person in terms of inner drive and ambition. The only things which are little are her circumstances and the mind of those around her.

I believe there is a subtext to this movie. I am conscious of the fact that the writer is male and that the director is male. The subtext is feminism. Okay, here we go... I shall 'dive in' to this difficult and oft-times divisive topic. What I write is something I have only come across once in my life, by what a musician said at the end of a live concert i.e. many years ago now.

Female rights are human rights. Feminism is not only about women, but about humanity as a whole. In terms of this movie, the viewer has an option to see each character as a person - rather than a female person or a male person.

After watching it, I heard that Gwyneth Paltrow described it as ""the worst movie ever"". I think a mistake was made that the characters were seen as being either male or female. Well.. not so much a mistake.. just that the movie does not **have** to be seen in this way.

Who cares what gender/sex this character is or that character is? To take a step back a moment, half my ancestors were female and half were male - and I am fine with that. We are people. Here a preciously short time. Feminism is not about women.. or highlighting women.. about sexism in favour of women.. it is about the exact opposite of all this: making one's anatomy or gender irrelevant.

I take an additional step back. Yes, I know that males (of which I am **one**) have monopolised positions in some employment circles and monopolised leadership positions. That it has been going on for centuries... nay... millennia. This **is** tragic and totally unfair. The reason for this is that sexism is dehumanising. I shall leave it at that. I know that it is a hot and highly sensitive topic.

Back to the specifics of this movie. It is not a complex movie. I agree with the first reviewer on that score. It is however fun.  I did not like how favourably capitalism was portrayed - but it did stop short of 'kowtowing' to capitalism. It has a human element to it. What I mean by that is that it is humane. Each character is portrayed as a human being. It makes no distinction between whether someone is male or female, homosexual or heterosexual and so on and so forth. Or if it did make these distinctions then... well... I shall go out on a limb and say that it was inadvertent.

In short, it was an entertaining watch. Nothing to write home about. Something well acted and there to enjoy. I do not recommend watching it nor letting it go by the wayside. I write this review to share a different perspective to what is already on 'The Movie Data Base (TMDB)'. I know for myself that it has been a long time coming to watch a movie which is safe and I can just enjoy. I appreciated it.

I also appreciate your time and attention in reading me here."

It’s from that 2000 to 2010 cultural crossroads, before everything became about metrics and trend-chasing. This was when movies still dared to be weird, flawed, ambitious, and most importantly, human. It has all the hallmarks of that era where studios were still funding original scripts, even if they were risky. And yeah, it paid the price at the box office, but I’d argue it aged better than a lot of so-called “hits” from its time.

Directing-wise, Jon Amiel keeps things grounded even when the plot is anything but. He never tries to oversell the drama or throw in unnecessary flash. Instead, he lets the characters carry it. And that’s where The Core shines. The script is quietly brilliant. It doesn’t scream its cleverness, it just talks like people talk. You’ve got emotionally loaded one-liners, smooth transitions, and character-defining dialogue that lands in seconds and moves on. There’s no pandering, no exposition dumps. You either keep up, or you miss it. That kind of confidence in the audience is rare now, especially when studios are so obsessed with clarity over character.

One thing that stands out even more today is how unfairly movies like The Core have been treated just because their science wasn’t explained in a way that “felt” believable. The truth is, there are tons of movies with equally ridiculous science that were accepted just because the script guided the audience more carefully. If a movie gives you a decent explanation, even a weak one, it becomes forgivable. But when it doesn’t handhold, even if the logic is the same, it gets slammed. And that’s a problem. The Core didn’t flop because it was more far-fetched than others. It flopped because it didn’t explain its madness in a way that made audiences feel safe. But honestly, once you get past that, what you find underneath is a character-driven, surprisingly well-written story with actual heart.

Watching this in 2025 hits different. You realize just how rare it is now to get a non-franchise, non-remake, non-based-on-existing-IP kind of film. Out of the top 66 movies to earn over $100 million in recent years, around 70% were franchise flicks. That tells you everything. Studios are scared to invest in originality, so they don’t. And we as an audience? We’ve gotten used to that. But The Core, for all its plot holes, reminds you what it's like when a movie just wants to tell a story, not trend. It's a reminder that when you kill risk, you kill magic. So if you want to rewatch something that speaks to the lost art of character-driven, original cinema, give this one another look. You might be surprised at how much it says when it’s not trying to go viral."

Lucy & Jerry Warriner strain their marriage by suspecting each other of cheating, so much so, a day in court leaves them with a 90 day prelude to a divorce. Sure enough, though, love never quite runs as expected, and can indeed be a truly complex thing, especially when the other parties involved are human, a cheeky cat, and a rather smart and astute canine!

The Awful Truth is tagged as part of the wonderful genre that encompasses the screwball comedy, and although to a degree that genre placement is true, I do believe that those not particularly fond of the high octane scattergun comedies from the genre, will certainly find this offering far more appealing with its pacing and lighthearted production values.

The Awful Truth began life as a stage play in the early 20s, and was then adapted to film twice previously in 1925 & 1929, but here for the 1937 version, director Leo McCarey (Academy Award winner Best Director) improves the story big time with sharp witty dialogue and an appreciative knack for letting his actors improvise at free will in the name of comedy. Taking the lead roles of the Warriner's is Cary Grant & Irene Dunne, and it's a great pairing as they positively bounce of each other with almost carefree abandon. Adding greatly to the frivolity is Ralph Bellamy as tone death country bumpkin love interest Daniel, Alex D'Arcy as the suave but naive Armand, and Cecil Cunningham as the wry Aunt Patsy. It's a seamless enjoyable romp containing many laugh out loud sequences, and as much as the outcome my never be in doubt, the ending is still a joy to behold. Even if the cat and the clock invariably steal the show!

Wonderful and highly recommended. 9/10"

Plot Summary - First Paragraph

Screenwriter Dixon Steele is very talented, he also drinks too much and is prone to outbreaks of shocking violence. Thus the studios are reluctant to hire him, but through sheer determination, his agent manages to get him a coveted writing assignment to adapt a popular novel. The main players in the proposed picture meet up at a restaurant to talk things out, but with Dixon being Dixon it all goes wrong and violence curtails the evening. Though not really keen to read the novel he is to adapt, Dixon accepts an invitation from the hatcheck girl to read for him as it's her favourite book, they both go to Dixon's home and nothing untoward happens between the pair, he bids her farewell and puts out for her cab fare home. The next day the police show up at the door requesting Dixon accompany them down to the station, turns out that the poor hatcheck girl was murdered and dumped on the roadside, Dixon of course is the chief suspect. But a glint of light appears in the form of Dixon's beautiful neighbour, Laurel Gray, who provides Dixon with a solid alibi, this sets in motion a relationship between the pair that might break or make either one of them.

In A Lonely Place is a fabulous picture, not nominated for any academy awards (incredible in light of Bogart's stunning portrayal as Steele), and tagged on its release as being too bleak to be a winner, it's now rightly considered one of the best films of its type and contains some of the best work from those involved. What always amazes me with the film is how the two halves are so very riveting for different reasons. The first half we are trying to understand Steele's conflict with himself (a wonderfully complex character), he is our sole focus of attention. Then the second half as Laurel and Dixon enter into a full blown relationship, we find ourselves in Laurel's place, as Dixon grows ever more erratic, we join Laurel in her unease, it feels like a coiled spring waiting to unleash itself. 

It's quite an achievement that director Nicholas Ray blends the pictures' halves together and dabs them with darkly affecting visuals, whilst simultaneously taking us on an up and down ride as to how we feel about Dixon Steele and the girl he has clearly fallen in love with. This is not just about the actors (Gloria Grahame as Laurel is also as fabulous as Bogart is) and the director, though, a tip of the hat has to go to the source material by Dorothy Hughes and Edmund H North and the adaptation by Andrew Holt. The ending here is different to the one in the book, but personally I think this one works better because it has a quandary cloud hanging over it, not in a short changed way, but in a deeply unnerving way, the kind that sets you pondering over a cold glass of beer. 

Terrific stuff here for those willing to invest undivided time with it, a film that is now rightly revered as a classic, so just as Dixon Steele is up on that old knife edge, the makers are asking you to hop up on that edge alongside him, so do it and you wont be disappointed. 9.5/10 || Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame are on great form in this complex and intricate crime noir. He (""Dixon"") is a down-on-his-luck writer who finds himself squarely in the eyes of the police, suspected of murder. Fortunately, and somewhat out of the blue, his neighbour turns up at the station and gives him a cast iron alibi. She (""Laurel"") saw the victim leave his home, and he stayed put! Now at this point, we have no reason to disbelieve her, but as the story develops and the two become more intimately connected, we start to see certain flaws appear in both of their characters that starts to make us doubt which (if either) of them might be telling the truth. The police haven't given up on him either, and their investigation and his consistently wayward behaviour soon has everyone on edge. It's a well paced and well written drama this, that plays well to the skills of the two stars. They exude a chemistry that is just as suspicious as it is loving. We are never quite sure where we are - not until the rather effective denouement which was not really what I was expecting. If you can watch this for ninety minutes on a big screen: it offers a richness of photography and a gripping George Anthiel score to complement a strong story well controlled by Nicholas Ray who is also at the top of his game."

Joel Schumacher is a rather inconsistent director. Unusual, yet capricious. From ‘The Lost Boys’ to ‘Batman & Robin’, his career has been considerably scattershot in terms of quality. Phone Booth, whilst quintessentially being a product of its time, happens to be his most simplistic. An arrogant publicist is held hostage in a phone booth by a mysterious sniper who offers him an ultimatum.

A hyperbolised exercise in absolution from an absurdist’s perspective, Schumacher delivers a nail-biting thriller from the confinement of one besmirched public booth. Unscrupulous sex shops on one side of the grubby New York street, and a religiously inclined series of posters dictating “who do you think you are?” on the other side. It may just be a lightning paced disposable techno thriller to many, but if you divulge into the finer details you’ll notice it is overwhelmed with morality. The repentance of sins. Cleansing the soul from immorality. The harsh tones of Sutherland’s antagonistic voice, likening himself to a higher (or lower...) entity, offering Farrell’s Stu a chance for redemption. A surprisingly thematic endeavour for Schumacher, whether intentional or not, the religious symbolism in its subtle visuals or literary narrative were certainly profound.

It smooths out the neo-noir roughness that forces this thriller to be nothing more than disposable entertainment. Aside from Farrell’s strong performance as the arrogantly unlikeable Stu and Sutherland’s menacing tone, the supporting cast were mediocre at best. Whitaker, Mitchell and Holmes rarely had an opportunity to shine within the mucky street and had a tendency to overact. The act of forgiveness, whilst being a pivotal point to the whole ordeal, seemed incredibly vacuous without much deliberate intervention. All too easy, considering how long Stu kept his unfaithful behaviour up for. Cohen’s script was sharp and concise, occasionally stagnating in moments of desperation when not knowing how to progress the hostage situation further.

Stevens’ editing was swifter than Sutherland cocking his sniper rifle multiple times. On screen graphics to display scenes running simultaneously, such as police officers tracing the encrypted phone call, keeping the pace consistently tight. Some of visuals, such as the red dot from the sniper, obviously smelt of fakery as well as the space effects showcasing the satellite sending communications to mobile phone chips etc. Y’know, common tropes from films created in the early naughties.

As I said, it’s very much a film of its time. Yet despite the rough disposable nature of Phone Booth, it’s a much more entertaining call then being on hold for an hour and a half. I can tell you that from experience... || . || ""Phone Booth"" starts off a bit slow in the first act, but it quickly picks up the pace and becomes more intense as it goes along.

Colin Farrell and Forest Whitaker deliver fantastic performances that really bring the intensity to life. Kiefer Sutherland, who I know and love from 24, is chilling as the voice on the phone, adding a menacing layer even without much screen time.

What’s also impressive is that the whole movie was shot in just 10 days, with two extra days for some additional shots. It’s amazing they created such a suspenseful film in such a short time. Overall, I really enjoyed it!"

Released in 2003 and written/directed by Ed Solomon, “Levity” concerns a man in the Great Lakes region (Billy Bob Thornton) who’s released from prison after 23 years of confinement. He returns to the big city where he murdered a 17 year-old cashier and finds lodging & work at a community house run by a priest with edge (Morgan Freeman). Seeking forgiveness, he pursues a relationship with the sister of the boy he killed (Holly Hunter) while helping a wild young woman who lacks adult guidance and is wasting her life (Kirsten Dunst).

The meaning of the title, ""Levity"" can be traced to this conversation: “What are you thinking about?” “Gravity.” “It doesn't last long.” So ‘Levity’ is meant as the opposite of gravity and graveness. It stems from the Latin root ‘levis,’ which means ""light in weight” or even ""changeableness."" It means ""lightness” in every respect. Life is tragic and painful. We do senseless, unkind things to one another in various states of spiritual growth and immaturity. We spend our whole lives being dragged down to our inescapable end (""Gravity kills""). But we sooner or later must let go of this gravity and realize that there is joy to be had. Redemption is the return of that joy, that Levity.

Critics argued that the flick could really use some levity in light of it being burdened by dour self-importance and a heavy-handed moral. The tone is similar to other spiritual movies, like “Grand Canyon” (1991) and “The Woodsman” (2004), but not as effective in overall quality. One problem is there’s a little too much ambiguity and another is the weakly executed subplot about the woman’s juvenile delinquent son and his violent gang proclivities, which comes off wholly contrived. 

Still, there’s enough good here to recommend to those who appreciate the kinds of films noted above, films that try to balance the reverence and beauty of life with the profane, foolish and ugly. I loved the way Dunst’ character rolled with the inner city youth. Actually, all four main cast members shine in their roles.

The movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes and was shot in Montreal.

Gotta respect those associated with getting <em>'Better Luck Tomorrow'</em> off the ground, reportedly with big help from one MC Hammer - I didn't expect to read that! However, I didn't like it sadly. You can tell if has a competent director in charge with Justin Lin, though everything to do with the plot and characters just didn't do it for me.

I found the story too far-fetched, personally. I have no issue watching stuff that is nonsensical, but when it is along those lines then it has to be very entertaining and this wasn't, for me. The actors didn't quite work either, not even Sung Kang as Han - who was the sole reason why I wanted to watch this, given the (loose) <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em> connection.

Parry Shen is underwhelming, his voice-overs are particularly dull - he is fairly likeable, I'm just not sure Shen (or his character) were a wise choice for lead. Jason Tobin as Virgil is also a tad irritating (as intended?), while Kang is actually quite forgettable; this Han is barely anything like the F&F version, quite the large reach for them to connect the two, if I'm honest.

A quick look at the Wikipedia article for this, which also talks about some other interesting production events (Macaulay Culkin?! Big props to Lin for rejecting that, despite the £££), notes that apparently Sung Kang wanted to play Ben - now that could've been something! Obviously it worked out best for him that he didn't, but still... what could have been.

Many others love this - who am I to object, really. All the same, I'm glad this was a success otherwise we most likely would not have got Justin Lin atop the F&F franchise; <em>'Fast & Furious'</em> and <em>'Fast Five'</em> are my favourites, behind the original of course.

RELEASED IN 2003 (but shot in 2000) and written/directed by Rob Zombie, ""House of 1000 Corpses” is a horror/black comedy about two young couples who inadvertently visit a house of demented serial killers in backwoods Texas.

A critic summed the movie up as “a ridiculous horror comedy, but with extremely annoying villains.” It was inspired by (or rips off) “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) and combines it with the cartoonish horror comedy of “Evil Dead II” (1987) while throwing in a little “The Funhouse” (1981).

The entire first act, including the amusing prologue that introduces Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), is very entertaining, but the over-the-top approach starts to get dull by the middle of the picture with the overdone events at the demented Firefly abode. The last act gets so cartoonish that I thought maybe the main protagonist (Erin Daniels) was experiencing a nightmare. The fantastical elements strip away any vestige of horror that was hardly there in the first two acts, which were too zany to take as serious horror. As such, I can’t see anyone older than 7 finding this movie “disturbing.” Still, the film pulsates with colorful pizazz and characters, not to mention a quality score/soundtrack.

Sheri Moon Zombie is effective in her role as Baby Firefly. I liked her voice and didn’t mind her laugh (which many criticize), but she’s a little too thin for my tastes. Daniels works pretty well as the main protagonist. But, considering Zombie’s resources (e.g. the five captive cheerleaders), the flick sorta drops the ball in the female department.

The film sat on the shelf so long because Universal feared a NC-17 rating. Lions Gate eventually picked it up, but it was cut & edited in an attempt to achieve an R-rating. The original version was 16 minutes longer.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Chicken Ranch Backlot, Universal Studios; Palmdale; Santa Clarita; and Saugus).

GRADE: B-/C+ || Heavy throwback elements make up most of _House of 1000 Corpses_' runtime, from an era when Zombie was still finding his footing. It maybe leans too heavily on a nostalgia that I simply don't have, but personally I found this to be one of Zombie's weaker entries. Great song! But I don't totally love the movie. I like it. I wish that some of the parts I found more interesting, like Doctor Satan, got a bit more play, and both the acting and video quality often leave something to be desired, but still, I like it. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || **Style, blood, guts and hard rock, without any decent script to back it up.**

Rob Zombie has devoted his life to music and horror movies, but so far I haven't seen a single movie of his that's really worthwhile. The director's style is that very low-budget and low-quality horror that made school in the 70s and 80s. In truth, I must say that there is some coherence here, if we consider the musical style of Zombie's projects. However, it is a film that disgusts us, and that causes more strangeness and repudiation than fear.

In this film, we follow four teenagers who accidentally stumble into a village of abnormal people and end up intrigued by a local legend about a mad doctor who cut people up, was executed and disappeared, leaving in doubt whether he had really died. Of course, they end up in an even crazier, morbid and dysfunctional house of people, who are behind an endless series of crimes.

By my standards, this movie is so bad that it doesn't even work as a comedy. There is not a scary moment, based on a strangely bizarre script, without content. The film shows the influences of slash horror, with lots of gore, blood running everywhere and bodies torn to pieces. Cannibalism, necrophilia, sadism, if we think of depravity this film will probably have some scene associated with what we think. That, on the one hand, has a vantage point: the film is gritty enough to pull it off, in an era when horror movies are so bland that even underage kids can see them.

The cast brings together a series of actors who have become famous precisely in slash cinema: Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Karen Black, Tom Towles, Dennis Fimple. Each one of them did their job well, they are the right actors for this type of material, they are perfectly comfortable doing this. However, Haig and Moseley are particularly effective and work very well, stealing the audience's attention whenever they appear. Sheri Moon, an actress who has a certain relevance in the film, is however an amateur, Rob Zombie's girlfriend, who entered the film at his request. Love has these things, it makes us do crazy things. Unfortunately, and as it is routine in these films, the teenage victims of the carnage are simply talking meat that we can't care less about for a minute.

The film does some pretty competent visual effects work, with gallons of fake blood and other effects designed to make the killing realistic and ""fun"" enough. The sets and costumes were also very well thought out and create a decadent environment, in which rurality is distorted and transformed into the perfect environment for a Halloween massacre. That is, the film has style, it has an extremely worked and complex look, but that's about it. It does not present us with content, substance that makes the film worthwhile."

Disney produce and Andrew Davis directs this wonderful adaptation of Louis Sachar’s Holes.

New inmate Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LeBeouf) is about to set the wheels in motion that will unearth the secret of the digs.

The film, to me anyway, has such an odd feel to it throughout, there's a weird mix of story elements and I'm not convinced it all works - and yet, I  actually really like it... I think. In parts, though, if I closed my eyes it would sound like one sorta movie and if I covered my ears it would look like a different one.

What I mean is, the music doesn't quite match the onscreen events. Is the music good? Sure, but the more dramatic pieces don't fit with the rough and tumble nature of the plot. With that said, I do really love how the film begins/ends and how it all comes full circle - coolly done. The flick utilises flashbacks excellently, also.

Cast-wise, it's absolutely solid. Søren Pilmark is an able lead, while Ulrich Thomsen, Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas, among a few others, are good behind Pilmark. I will say that the latter's part of the storyline with Sofie Gråbøl was off, it wraps up disappointingly... especially given *that* moment with Pilmark's Torkild, which should've sealed the opposite outcome.

Interesting that Thomsen, Mikkelsen and director Anders Thomas Jensen would go on to make <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/adams-apples/"" rel=""nofollow"">Adam's Apple'</a></em> together five years after this. One of the flashbacks in this actually features heavy similarities to that 2005 film, which was presumably inspired by the short story used here.

All in all, a very good release from 2000; even if it does leave a little bit of a strange aftertaste for me personally."

McKenna, Del Henney",Sam Peckinpah,"rape, countryside, based on novel or book, primal fear, england, country life, cornwall, england, revenge, rural area, shocking","This is where I live. This is me. I will not allow violence against this house. 

Straw Dogs is directed by Sam Peknipah and Peckinpah co-adapts to screen play with David Zelag Goodman from the novel ""The Siege of Trencher's Farm"" written by Gordon Williams. It stars Dustin Hoffman, Susan George, Peter Vaughan, T.P. McKenna, Del Henney and Ken Hutchison. Music is by Jerry Fielding and cinematography by John Coquillon.

A young American maths teacher and his English wife move  to the rural English village where she was raised and face increasingly vicious harassment from the locals...

One of Peckinpah's masterpieces (yes you can have more than one), Straw Dogs is an uncompromising dissection of violence, machismo and boundary pushing of the human condition. Controversy around the film reigned supreme upon release (and long into the dead part of the video nasty era 1980s), and in fact still today it is still pored over as an abject lesson in audience manipulation. For a s the power struggle between a husband and wife against their abusers reaches boiling point, ultra violence and sexual assault attacks the viewer's senses.

Peckinpah is in his pomp here, making us observers complicit in the ultimate cynical premise. It's not so much that violence begets violence, but that a mild mannered man has to resort to extreme violence - thus repelling his once firm code of morals - in order to defend what should in fact be his right. Hoffman is excellent, layering the character arc to perfection, while George as his wife is sexually suggestive, spiteful and positively superb in bringing to vivid life such a challenging characterisation.

As the director (see what he could do when not pestered by studio execs) pulls the audience's strings, and Fielding lays a haunting musical score over proceedings (Oscar Nominated), we have been privy to one of the best and most caustic observations of violence put on the screen. 10/10 || **_How far can a civilized man be pushed?_**

A well-to-do couple from America (Dustin Hoffman and Susan George) move back to the wife's hometown near Land’s End in western Cornwall, England, and settle into the vacant homestead. They enlist some roofers whom she knows from her school days, one of them being a former boyfriend (Del Henney). Rivalry is in the air as the laborers try to emasculate Amy’s brainy husband and she questions his manhood. Havoc ensues.

Based on Gordon M. Williams’s novel and helmed by Peckinpah, ""Straw Dogs"" (1971) is a psychological thriller and so there's a lot of drama and subtle suspense build-up; things don't blow-up until the final act, so to speak. Consequently, anyone looking for mindless action should stay away. There are bits reminiscent of ""Of Mice and Men,"" like the mentally challenged guy (David Warner) who doesn't know his own strength.

The conflict here is basically brawn vs. brain or Lynyrd Skynyrd vs. Bach. David (Hoffman) is a meek, civilized man of below average stature (almost 5’6”) with an intellectual occupation who is forced to shed all his cultured conditioning and revert back to the barbarism of his ancestors.

The story spurs some questions: Why does a rape-victim keep silent? Why is the local teen hottie interested in the mentally-challenged hunk? But a little reflection will answer these and other questions. I like it when films don't spell everything out and make you think. Certain added bits are interesting, like the subtle rivalry between gang members Charlie (Henney) and Norman (Ken Hutchison).

The flick is sophisticated and sneers at binary good/bad characterizations, rubbing the viewer’s face in humanity’s animalistic (or fallen) nature, which lies just beneath the veneer of civilized proprieties. There’s an effective 2011 remake, which switches the setting to the modern day of the Deep South, America. Anyone who appreciates Rural Gothic or Southern Gothic will likely appreciate either. I should add that there's an unpleasant rape sequence à la “The Wild Angels” and “Last Summer,” not to mention the mayhem of the climax, but it's mostly an intelligent drama that slowly builds tension, obviously influenced by “The Shuttered Room” from four years prior.

It runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in southwest England at St Buryan, near Penzance, with studio stuff done at Twickenham Studios in London.

Taken from the novel by Michael Crichton, this film is a wonderful lesson in tension building as we follow the scientists through a carefully structured sci-fi plot that will eventually become a race against time thriller. What makes The Andromeda Strain stand out against other genre pieces is the astute and believable approach to the subject matter, we are (in the main) in the presence of proper scientists. There's no super hero tricks forthcoming from these people, these are sensible honest intelligent folk using their combined knowledge to hopefully save the planet? A masterstroke from the makers is that they used largely unknown actors for the film, this gives the story an added grounded believable factor, thus a very useful way of drawing the audience into the drama unfolding. The direction from Robert Wise is very clued in for serio narrative drive, the set design for the underground research facility is top notch, and the actors all give stoic and intelligent performances. 


However, it's not without a niggle, for after the excellence of the films first two thirds, it's disappointing to find that the final act reverts to type, which somehow seems misplaced given what the viewer has just been through. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine sequence of events that fuels the dramatic slant, but it comes off as just a bit too glossy in light of the preceding structure. Still, The Andromeda Strain is an intelligent, smart, mature, and knowing film that is standing the test of time for being a great piece of science fiction cinema. 8/10"

As their numbers thin out, the travelers begin to turn on each other, as each tries to figure out who the killer is.",The secret lies within.,"Mystery, Thriller",90,2003-04-25,en,7.2,4035,4.6391,"John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina","James Mangold, Michael Cooney","prostitute, prisoner, psychopath, nevada, detective, rain, motel, weather, ex-cop, murder, stranded, serial killer, slasher, psychological thriller, whodunit, storm, psychiatrist, convict, thunderstorm, rainstorm, split personality, mental disorders, murder mystery, dissociative identity disorder, isolated place","His story's so unbelievable, I think it just might be true.

Identity is directed by James Mangold and written by Michael Cooney. It stars John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amada Peet, Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, Jake Busey and Pruitt Taylor Vince. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael Jr.

Inspired by Agatha Christie’s Ten Little Indians, Identity pitches 10 characters trapped at a motel who begin getting killed off one by one...

If you are going to do yet another take on Christies superb literary source then at least bring some freshness, so how nice to find that Identity does in fact ironically have its own. Set up is suitably in keeping with murder mystery shenanigans, there’s major flooding and our host of characters are bound to a shabby motel run by a shabby John Hawkes. On the edges of the frame we have another story where multiple killer Malcolm Rivers (the wonderful wobbly eyed P.T. Vince) is under interrogation to test for insanity to stave off his impending execution.

Mangold uses flashbacks to put the various characters at the motel, in how they came to be there. There’s a creative ambitiousness about how Mangold constructs the pic that draws you in, which come the finale will either have you satiated or stupefied. The murder sequences are very well put together, with a couple being well ghoulish, and it’s a very impressive cast of actors working their way through the formulaic but fascinatingly cheat free psychological murk.

It’s not as smart as it thinks it is but this has enough of an absorbing pull, and no little intelligence, to lift it higher than many other Agatha 10 copies. 7/10 || It's one of my favorites, I rate it four stars and a half. || **Overall : One of the best plot twists I have ever seen!**

Identity masterfully surprises and misleads every step of the way. What seems to be a run-of-the-mill slasher flick at a rundown motel on a stormy night is anything but average. With incredibly clever writing, Identity is a wild ride that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Even if you are a pro at guessing who the killer is or catching plot twists before they happen, you will be shocked again and again by the twists and turns Identity takes. While it isn't a perfect movie, its creativity and rare brilliance make Identity a must-see film."

I did watch the <em>'Lizzie McGuire'</em> television show when I was younger, not religiously or anything close but I do remember liking it. I wouldn't, though, know if it works well with the exact storyline, given this film connects to what occurs on the small screen; I was an on/off watcher at best.

Hilary Duff (Lizzie) and Adam Lamberg (Gordo) work together nicely, but it's a slight shame that Lalaine (Miranda) doesn't appear - I recall liking her in the show. Elsewhere, Alex Borstein (Ungermeyer) and Yani Gellman (Paolo) are solid.

Worth watching for the Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike fight alone. || Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

Again, horrible ""comic book movie"", good stand alone movie.

Wolverine was the most interesting thing about the last movie, and this is a surprising instance of a studio realizing audience feedback and basically just made the first Wolverine origin movie, because that's what this is.

Comic continuity aside, and Wolverine aside, the war of the Brotherhood of Mutants is fairly compelling angle to take, and it is refreshing they did it from the human's side, but if you look at it closer, then we're just looking at another race war.  It sort of takes the fuel out of the fire when you realize how ""real"" your super power problem story is.

While this has a slightly better premise, and good plot skeleton, there is a lot of ""(mostly Wolverine does) something cool here"" stuff, but there are at least 2 large exceptions with multiple mutants working together that end up being a ""lot of cool stuff"", but also add some significance to the story and heavily progress the plot.

I'd honestly recommend anyone watch this over the original. || Strong sequel.

I didn't quite enjoy <em>'X2'</em> as much as <em>'X-Men'</em>, though not by much in truth. This follow-up film is still something I'd class as entertaining. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) again impresses, though those behind him are - though all good - a little meh in my opinion; especially newcomer Brian Cox (Stryker), who underwhelmed me.

All in all, it's a film that is totally worth watching and is a sequel that is worth its salt.

I admit I haven't seen the stage play--which many sources say is far superior to this filmic adaptation.

I'm rather surprised that: a) Michael Douglas gets star status here, or is even involved. He doesn't dance here. The film would have worked so much better if it showed his character showing some dance moves and getting across to the dancers what he wanted. Both his character would have connected better with the dancers, and he would have connected better with filmgoers; and b) that Lord Richard Attenborough got involved with this: It's definitely not his forte or cup of tea. Perhaps he wanted to expand his directorial palette, or that some of his influences were masters of the genre, such as Lubitsch or Minnelli. Personally, I wish I knew, for he has done much better work in his career.

Overall, not one of the better of contemporary (post-1970) musicals, but worth seeing once, if renting or seeing that it's coming on TV. Not a top purchase priority, unless you are a Douglas or Attenborough completest, and then prepare to be disappointed. || Were it not for Marvin Hamlisch's ""Surprise, Surprise"" then I think this film would be even more forgettable than it actually is. Michael Douglas is the hard-to-please Broadway director ""Zach"" who is casting the dance ensemble for his latest production. Aided by his sidekick ""Larry"" (Terrence Mann) he pits the would-be's through their paces with rigorous routines and some rather invasive questioning about their lives, families and peccadilloes. I did see this on stage and felt it a rather flat and introspective of an industry that should usually keep it's casting practices under wraps. Here, Richard Attenborough attempts to lay these bare for the big screen and ends up with a rather dull, processional series of footwork demonstrations and sob-stories that are pretty wearisome to endure after a repetitive first half an hour. Alyson Reed clutters the thing up further as the down-on-her-luck ""Cassie"" who is looking for favours from a man who seems pretty impervious to many of the decent aspects of human nature. The stage setting is too sterile to engage for long, and the characterisations fit just about every stereotype in the book as these youngsters vie for this latest opportunity to shine (and eat!). I didn't hate this, but it's really a rather disappointing foray into the potentially fascinating world of who wins and who doesn't in this highly competitive and fickle environment!"

Fresh, Mary Alice",Stan Lathan,"dance, rap music, hip-hop, rhyme battle, disc jockey, subway, breakdance, graffiti, intense","Beat Street is an American dramatic musical film directed by Stan Lathan and written by Andrew Davis, David Gilbert, and Paul Golding. The film features a talented cast including Guy Davis, Rae Dawn Chong, Saundra Santiago, Doug E. Fresh, Mary Alice, Shawn Elliott, and the late Duane Jones, known for his role in Night of the Living Dead. Orion Pictures released this film on June 8th, 1984, five months after Breakin' had been released.

The Beat Street Crew looks to put their mark on the South Bronx, and they won't let anything stop them. Ramo is into tagging and is always chasing an elusive, brand-new, all-white subway car. His friend, Lee, wants to make his mark on New York City's breakdancing culture and has been tearing up the floor at local nightclubs. His older brother, Kenny, wants to be a world-famous DJ. This crew has the passion, the skills, and the drive to work hard for what they want.

Beat Street is an awesome look at New York City's hip-hop culture of the 1980s. A perfect call and response to the more cartoonish musical dance films that had come before it, Beat Street is a fuller film about Breakin’ or its sequel. And it has a deeper message. Breakin' was set on the West Coast in Los Angeles and featured a lot of the hip-hop and breakdancing prevalent at the time. However, Beat Street is a star-studded love letter to East Coast hip-hop culture. It's definitely what Roger Ebert was talking about when he said that Breakin' was opening the door for bigger-budget breakdancing movies in the future.

Keeping in tradition with the rest of the movies that I watched for Breakdancing week, Beat Street offered an amazing soundtrack curated and composed by Harry Belafonte Jr. and others. Belafonte's signature Calypso tunes are definitely there, meshing with traditional breakdance beats to create unique sounds and vibes. Many of the songs have that infectious Miami Sound Machine-type sound. Melle Mel, Afrika Bambaataa, Treacherous Three, Doug E. Fresh—these are just a few of the names who appear in the movie. We're definitely going to have a lot of songs to add to the Spotify playlist.

Rae Dawn Chong was fantastic. She's got this energy that just doesn't quit. Guy Davis is cool personified. Robert Taylor is a great dancer and he really makes Lee's character iconic. And those actors were so good in those roles. But they just didn't carry the same weight as the know-it-all, street-smart Graffiti artist Ramo.

John Chardiet's Ramo turned in a killer performance that stole the show for me. He reminded me a lot of Matt Dillon’s character in The Flamingo Kid. Ramo is at that stage in his life where he's becoming a man who understands that he wants his art to be what defines him. His unapproving father, played by Shawn Elliot, just wants him to be a good person and make something of himself. Of course, he misunderstands his son and doesn't identify with Graffiti Art. But towards the end of the picture, his father gets to see some of Ramo's work and he understands. It’s the deepest part of the film and the best.

While the story may not be the strongest, it boasts amazing character development and captures an energy that is almost unmatched. Unfortunately, it doesn't receive the recognition it deserves. There are deeper and more intimate tales that will come out this year, but Beat Street might be one of the best dance/musical films of the year. It feels so real compared to Electric Boogaloo. After watching the movie, a line rang through my mind, “If Art is a Crime, May God Forgive Me.” This was a solid three-and-a-half-star film, but the character work here just puts it over the edge to four stars."

Sarah Paulson and David Hyde Pierce play the respective best friends while Tony Randall has a bit part.   

“Down With Love” (2003) is a satire of those Doris Day romcoms of the late 50s / early 60s that typically revolved around a battle of the sexes. While I’ve never seen any of those movies this is an amusing & cute spoof that pokes fun at ’em. 

Renée is adorable and McGregor rises to the challenge in an atypical role. The inclusion of Jeri Ryan & Melissa George on the feminine front is a plus. Unfortunately, the flick’s a tad too long for such fluff; 12-15 minutes shoulda been shaved off to give it more drive, but that’s just me.     

The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot at Universal Studios, Universal City, and Hollywood Center Studios, Hollywood, California.

Characters are always talking like this in ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" which plays like a collaboration involving a geek, a comic book and the smartest kid in Philosophy 101. Morpheus in particular unreels extended speeches that remind me of Laurence Olivier's remarks when he won his honorary Oscar--the speech that had Jon Voight going ""God!"" on TV, but in print turned out to be quasi-Shakespearean doublespeak. The speeches provide not meaning, but the effect of meaning: It sure sounds like those guys are saying some profound things.

That will not prevent fanboys from analyzing the philosophy of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" in endless Web postings. Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology; there is something refreshingly ironic about becoming an authority on the transient extrusions of mass culture, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.

I say this not in disapproval, but in amusement. ""The Matrix"" (1999), written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, inspired so much inflamed pseudo-philosophy that it's all ""The Matrix Reloaded"" can do to stay ahead of its followers. It is an immensely skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: heroes and villains, special effects and stunts, chases and explosions, romance and oratory. It develops its world with more detail than the first movie was able to afford, gives us our first glimpse of the underground human city of Zion, burrows closer to the heart of the secret of the Matrix, and promotes its hero, Neo, from confused draftee to a Christ figure in training.

As we learned in ""The Matrix,"" the Machines need human bodies, millions and millions of them, for their ability to generate electricity. In an astonishing sequence, we saw countless bodies locked in pods around central cores that extended out of sight above and below. The Matrix is the virtual reality that provides the minds of these sleepers with the illusion that they are active and productive. Questions arise, such as, is there no more efficient way to generate power? And why give the humans dreams when they would generate just as much energy if comatose? And why create such a complex virtual world for each and every one of them, when they could all be given the same illusion and be none the wiser? Why is each dreamer himself or herself, occupying the same body in virtual reality as the one asleep in the pod? But never mind. We are grateful that 250,000 humans have escaped from the grid of the Matrix, and gathered to build Zion, which is ""near the Earth's core--where there is more heat."" As the movie opens, we are alarmed to learn that the Machines are drilling toward Zion so quickly that they will arrive in 36 hours. We may also wonder if Zion and its free citizens really exist, or if the humans only think so, but that leads to a logical loop ending in madness.

Neo (Keanu Reeves) has been required to fly, to master martial arts, and to learn that his faith and belief can make things happen. His fights all take place within virtual reality spaces, while he reclines in a chair and is linked to the cyberworld, but he can really be killed, because if the mind thinks it is dead, ""the body is controlled by the mind."" All of the fight sequences, therefore, are logically contests not between physical bodies, but between video game-players, and the Neo in the big fight scenes is actually his avatar.

The visionary Morpheus, inspired by the prophecies of the Oracle, instructed Neo--who gained the confidence to leap great distances, to fly and in ""Reloaded"" destroys dozens of clones of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in martial combat. That fight scene is made with the wonders of digital effects and the choreography of the Hong Kong action director Yuen Wo Ping, who also did the fights in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" It provides one of the three great set pieces in the movie.

The second comes when Morpheus returns to Zion and addresses the assembled multitude--an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in ""Metropolis."" After his speech, the citizens dance in a percussion-driven frenzy, which is intercut with Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) having sex. I think their real bodies are having the sex, although you can never be sure.

The third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with gloriously choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. That this scene logically takes place in cyberspace does not diminish its thrilling 14-minute fun ride, although we might wonder--when deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it? (I am sure I will get untold thousands of e-mails explaining it all to me.) I became aware, during the film, that a majority of the major characters were played by African Americans. Neo and Trinity are white, and so is Agent Smith, but consider Morpheus; his superior Commander Lock (Harry Lennix); the beautiful and deadly Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), who once loved Morpheus and now is with Lock, although she explains enigmatically that some things never change; the programmer Link (Harold Perrineau); Link's wife, Zee (Nona Gaye), who has the obligatory scene where she complains he's away from home too much, and the Oracle (the late Gloria Foster, very portentous). From what we can see of the extras, the population of Zion is largely black.

It has become commonplace for science fiction epics to feature one or two African-American stars, but we've come a long way since Billy Dee Williams in ""Return of the Jedi."" The Wachowski brothers use so many African Americans, I suspect, not for their box-office appeal, because the Matrix is the star of the movie, and not because they are good actors (which they are), but because to the white teenagers who are the primary audience for this movie, African-Americans embody a cool, a cachet, an authenticy. Morpheus is the power center of the movie, and Neo's role is essentially to study under him and absorb his mojo.

The film ends with ""To Be Concluded,"" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in November. Toward the end, there are scenes involving characters who seem pregnant with possibilities for Part 3. One is the Architect (Helmut Bakaltis), who says he designed the Matrix and revises everything Neo thinks he knows about it. Is the Architect a human, or an avatar of the Machines? The thing is, you can never know for sure. He seems to hint that when you strip away one level of false virtual reality, you find another level beneath. Maybe everything so far is several levels up? Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time tells the story of a cosmologist whose speech is interrupted by a little old lady who informs him that the universe rests on the back of a turtle. ""Ah, yes, madame,"" the scientist replies, ""but what does the turtle rest on?"" The old lady shoots back: ""You can't trick me, young man. It's nothing but turtles, turtles, turtles, all the way down.""

3.5/4

- Roger Ebert || I'll tell you something that a lot of people don't know... teachers make lesson plans around movies when they need an easy day. They keep them in their pocket when they feel a little sick, or when they were up all night watching the election returns or, you know, drinking and playing stupid games with the college roommates they still live with because they are single and having roommates is a little more fun.

This is one of those movies that I sucked the joy out of and used to teach the philosophy of the Reformation... but, you know, I tried to be the cool teacher and throw in some wire-fu action between stripping all the joy out of it for them.

We look at Calvinism and that philosophy... we watch the really cool car chase We examine the concepts of predestination in Christianity, we watch a shoot out. We talk about faith and free will... we watch a fight scene before moving on to the next scene.

Because when you are hung over in a class full of people old enough to know you are hung over, and some of which are probably just as hung over, you want a little wire-fu at work.

I don't know if they enjoyed it, but I know I did. And I know it's full of enough philosophical mumbo jumbo and long diatribes about religion to be able to use as a fun classroom tool.

Plus, you know, stylized Kung-Fun and gun violence is fun to watch."

Fans of Jim Carrey can't go wrong with this fun filled picture that's not without serious undertones as well.

The Premise is flimsy as such, Carrey plays Nolan, a harried and fed up TV reporter who feels that all of his problems are God's fault. Having enough of his whingeing, God (Morgan Freeman) summons Nolan to his ""residence"" and bestows all his powers to him. This is where the film hits its stride, the makers letting Carrey loose for a number of funny sequences as he plays God to further his own ends.

It goes where you expect it to, and nobody else gets a look in as Carrey does his stuff, but the journey is a most pleasant one. 7/10 || **Bruce Almighty leverages Carrey's comedy strengths and a solid supporting cast to create a top-notch lighthearted comedy. **

Honestly, I had a traumatic experience from seeing The Mask way too young, and it left me terrified of Jim Carrey for quite a while. Even after I grew out of the Carreyphobia, I still wasn't a fan, but Bruce Almighty changed everything. The first time I saw it, it was against my will, but I am so glad I was forced to watch it because it's a wonderful movie! It has fun with Christian values and themes without bashing or harassing its source material. It's just a good-natured funny movie that sees Carrey's Bruce Nolan grow from kind but self-absorbed to considerate and caring of those around him and appreciating all that he already had in his life, especially his love interest played by Jennifer Anniston. Bruce Almighty also showcases a young Steve Carrell in his big breakout role as Carrey's rival, who faces the wrath of Carrey's God powers in a hilarious way. This film is by far my favorite Jim Carrey film and one of my favorite comedies. || Another one of my favorite movies of all time. Jim Carey is one of my favorite actors. This movie is so funny.

Yes, it’s bloody. Yes, the bad guys are inbred cannibals. But the cast is great, and the effects are also great for its time. You feel for these characters and their predicament.

PLOT

Five friends and a stranger, after a car crash, must survive in the woods while being hunted by inbred cannibals.

MY THOUGHTS

There’s roughly ten kills. I say roughly because “supposedly” two of the killers are killed, but since there are several sequels, we can assume they may have not died. The kills, the ones that are shown on screen, are bloody and good. Unfortunately there are a few that are shown off screen. I would say my favorite would have to be either Francine’s barbed wire death (to include the dismemberment later on) or Carly’s beheading.

The boring death would have to be either Evan’s, which is ear sliced off and Scott’s where he is just shot three times in the back with arrows. Neither were that interesting. I did feel bad for Scott since I actually like him. I could care less about Evan. He was annoying.

As far as acting goes, I think it was pretty decent. I found Eliza Dushku, Jeremy Sisto, Emmanuelle Chriqui, and Desmond Harrington did a good job with their characters, and I really felt for their characters.

Eliza Dushku (known for Soul Survivor, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Tru Calling) plays Jessie, a woman who recently ended a relationship. Her friends brought her out hiking to take her mind off of the breakup. Emmanuelle Chriqui (known for Crow: Wicked Prayer and Forever Knight) plays Carly, engaged to Scott, with wedding plans running through her head.

Jeremy Sisto (known for May, Nightmare and Dreamscapes, and Dead & Breakfast) plays Scott, Carly’s fiancee. And Desmond Harrington (known for The Hole, Taken, Ghost Ship, and the Neon Demon) plays Chris, the man late for a job interview who regrets taking a shortcut.

We start Wrong Turn with two college students rock climbing. When the young man gets to the top we hear what sounds like a struggle and then his body is thrown over the cliff. The girl’s rope is being pulled up so she cuts the rope and falls to the ground. She tries to get away, but is caught and killed off camera.

Next we meet Chris who is driving to what we assume is a job interview. He’s running late and there is a chemical spill on the road. He then decides to use a shortcut. He distracts himself and crashes into a jeep that is sitting on the side of the road. Here he meets 5 more people: Evan, Francine, Scott, Carly, and Jessie.

Jessie and her friends are on a hiking trip when they realize that their flat was caused by barbed wire that was purposely layed out in the road. Chris, Jessie, Carly, and Scott take off to find help, leaving Evan and Francine with the vehicles.

After messing around for a bit, Evan hears a noise and goes to investigate. After realizing he’s missing, Francine goes and looks for him. She doesn’t find him but she finds his shoe and his severed ear. She screams and tries to run off but is quickly captured and a barbed wire is stretched over her mouth and pulled. This causes her mouth to tear open, killing her.

Meanwhile the other four find a cabin and go in to investigate. They find various items, old and new, as well as body parts. Before they can leave, three people show up, so they hide. Chris and Jessie hide under a bed and Carly and Scott hide in a room with junk in it.

The three carry Carly’s body in and put it on the table and start dismembering and eating her! Their friends are horrified but are quiet until the three fall asleep. As they escape, Chris tries to distract the killers and they shoot him. So then Scott decides to distract the inbreds so Jessie and Carly can get Chris and steal the killer’s truck. They drive down a path hoping to find Scott. They see him and as he’s running to the truck the killers shoot him with three arrows, killing him.

The three drive off as the killers take Scotts body with them. They keep driving and find a ranger’s station/tower. They climb it, hoping for a radio and they find one but nobody answers when they call for help. Unfortunately for them, the killers see them and follow. When someone finally responds on the radio, the killers try to get into the room.
Unable to get to them they set fire to the tower. This causes Jessie, Chris, and Carly to have to climb out onto the tall trees. As they climb down, Carly is too scared to move, is caught by surprise and her head is chopped off with an ax!

Our final two, Chris and Jessie are able to cause one of the killers to get hit by a branch, and fall from the tree. They are able to escape, and hide in a cave until morning. They head out the next morning and finally see a road. Just then, the killers show up and push Chris down the hill. Jessie is captured and taken back to the cabin. She is chained to the bed, unable to escape.

Chris survives the fall and see’s a police officer. Before he can explain what is going on, the officer is shot with an arrow. Chris tries to take the vehicle but can’t find the keys. Instead, he hides under the killer’s truck, holding on while they leave to go back to the cabin with the officer’s body in the back.

Just before Jessie is killed, the front of the cabin is busted open when a vehicle bursts through, setting the cabin on fire. There’s a fight, but in the end Chris is able to blow up the cabin with the two killers inside. Jessie and Chris drive off.

As a note, there’s an end credit scene, so stay and watch it.

Overall, I think this is a great movie and a good cast. One of those kinds of movies that’s, yes bloody, and there’s killing, but you actually like the characters. You feel bad when some die or get hurt. I can’t say the same for the sequels though. So if you haven’t seen Wrong Turn, then you definitely should watch this.

And now for your Forever Final Girl Exclusive…Did you know?:

Emmanuelle Chriqui dislocated her shoulder performing her fall through the trees. You can hear her shoulder pop on the production track in the theatrical sound mix.

Several of the cast and crew were covered in poison ivy throughout the filming of the movie, this was due to the chairs being placed in what was first thought to be a group of weeds only later to be discovered as a patch of the rash causing plants.

During one of the last scenes in the movie, Eliza Dushku actually set actor Julian Richings (Three Finger) on fire.

When the four were running from the cabin after awakening the mountain men, Desmond Harrington broke his right ankle after landing on the opposite side of a log. This made it very difficult to shoot some of the scenes after his left leg is “shot” and he has to limp on his right leg.

Despite only being credited for his producing, Make-up master Stan Winston was pivotal in the key design of the Mountain Men, in particular now postmodern horror icon Three-Finger. This marks the second last major horror film he has been involved before his death in 2008 at age 62 and the third slasher horror film he had been involved in following unaccredited work in Friday The 13th Part II and III, the latter of which he had been a core designer on the original hockey mask of also horror icon Jason Voorhees and the respective mongoloid appearance of Jason for those two parts.

Screenwriter Alan B. McElroy also penned the script for the reboot Wrong Turn (2021).

Director Rob Schmidt said in the commentary that he considers this film to be his own personal tribute to the classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Hills Have Eyes (1977).

Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth also appear together in the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. In this film their characters are in a relationship and both die, however, in Dawn of the Dead their characters both survive and are assumed to have started a relationship by the end.

The only film in the series that does not contain any sex or nudity.

The female lead character, Jessie Burlingame, was named after the heroine in Stephen King’s novel, “Gerald’s Game”.

There’s an additional scene halfway through the end credits, showing the fate of a state trooper who discovers a body in the burned-down cabin.

Eliza Dushku did a lot of her own stunts for the movie.

John Bridger's gang of thieves are double crossed and left for dead after a daring gold raid in Venice. The surviving members regroup and convene in L.A. to enact revenge and recapture their gold … the job is on!

This could have been a complete disaster, I'm British and the wave of revulsion that boomed in my homeland upon hearing of this remake was explosive; ""how dare they remake a British institution"" was the cry. Things were not helped in the run up to the film's release by  main star (and draw card) Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss...

Had to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isn't. Director F. Gary Gray hasn't remade the ""Italian Job"" of 1969, in fact he hasn't even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heist-come revenge movie, that's maybe a tad too glossy at times, but it has got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.

I have jokingly titled this film ""Ocean's 5"", but that is in no way detrimental to ""The Italian Job"", it lacks the jazzy coolness of ""Soderbergh's Ocean's 11"", but it's a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, thus the rating of just under 7 IMDb is actually spot on. 7/10 || **The Italian Job is a cool, sleek action-packed film with a fantastic cast and incredible stunts.**

The Italian Job achieves the impossible - making mini coopers cool! With a cast filled with stars from Mark Wahlberg to Jason Statham to Charlize Theron, this high-paced, high-energy film oozes swagger and awesomeness. This close-knit band of thieves is on a mission of revenge to steal from the man that betrayed them all and murdered their leader. With the moral high ground and proper motivation, these characters become that much cooler and are that much easier to root for as they break the rules in pursuit of their quarry. The stunt driving and camera work meld together perfectly to create a stunning high-octane movie that is exciting, fun, and worth seeing again and again. || Seen this one a few times over the years and still holds up as a light-hearted and fun heist-thriller. The ensemble cast with Wahlberg, Theron, Green and Mos Def, all have great chemistry. A shame the planned sequel never came to fruition, though surprised Paramount hasn't attempted to do one even if they could only bring back a couple actors like Wahlberg and Theron. Still distracting watching Norton knowing he was forced into doing this movie. And maybe sacrilege but I prefer this one over the 1969 original. **4.0/5**"

Now living in the Miami area and no longer an undercover cop, Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker) is compelled by the authorities to work with a US Customs agent (Eva Mendes) to nail an arrogant drug lord (Cole Hauser). To accomplish this, he teams-up with an old street-racing buddy (Tyrese Gibson) who’s in dire need of redemption.

Paul Walker is the only notable cast member to return for ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (2003). The others won’t return until the fourth installment, “Fast & Furious” (2009). Anyway, I like the beginning of this sequel better than the first movie. Director John Singleton has a better eye for photographing women, at least as shown in the first 40 minutes or so; plus I appreciate the diverse cast, which also includes the likes of Ludacris as Tej, cutie Devon Aoki as Suki and James Remar as a lead agent.

But as effective as Gibson is here, he can’t rival the charisma of Vin Diesel. And somewhere just after the midpoint I started to get a little bored. Nevertheless, “2 Fast 2 Furious” is an entertaining race-oriented action thriller. It basically mixes the first movie (2001) with “Licence to Kill” (1989).

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in the Miami area.

GRADE: B- || Sadly, this sequel really did miss Vin Diesel.

More than a Western indeed, perhaps a straight forward revenge drama in substance? But it is also a fine character study of a man coming to terms with growing up faster than he ever thought he would have to. What makes the film smart and lifts it above average are the structured segments, as director Henry Hathaway weaves a potent and interesting story by making each part of Nevada Smith/Max Sand's journey an involving character piece, one that puts you firmly on side with the protagonist and his vengeful quest.

Credit has to go to McQueen for putting great gusto into the character when it was badly needed, for to save the film from being standard fare we need the leading man to involve us in his troubled and confused state, thankfully he does this with bells on. The locations and sets put gloss on the story and in the main the rest of the cast do very well, however, I'm one of the few amateur reviewers who feels that Karl Malden just doesn't cut it as the chief villain of the piece. I feel the character who carried out these vile crimes should have been far more menacing than the shaky overplayed villain that Malden gives us.

Nevada Smith brings great action sequences, a memorable story, and an ending that brings the character full circle. These things that combine to give us an involving entertainment that stars a great leading man, who in turn is directed with very professional and genre knowing hands. 8/10"

Fortunately for Butler, he has a lawyer who is prepared to work hard on isolating the various witness testimonies and illustrating the flaws and inconsistencies from a combination of statements ranging from the sloppy to the downright perverse by way of quite a few lies and violence en route. The documentary makers manage to immerse us in the detail of the process and also to engage us in genuine senses of apprehension for the youngster and disgust for one or two of the lazy, possibly bigoted, and incompetent police officers whose approach to this whole crime did no-one any justice at all - not the victim, the accused nor the judicial system that has to evaluate these contrary assertions. The documentary does adopt a very pro-defendant position and that doesn't always provide us with a balance. Not that there's much doubt as to the verdict, but for a fair part of the trial process which is extensively reflected here, the prosecuting attorney isn't mic'd up and so her objections or ad hoc comments are inaudible as his defender Patrick McGuinness goes on the offensive. As is often the case with documentaries like this, it's the closing textual slides that provoke the most visceral of responses and offer us food for future conversation, but even though this is probably half an hour longer than it needs to be, it's still a well put together analysis of the effectiveness of an independent justice system that supports the right of everyone to a trial by their peers."

Deputy Tom Destry Jr. (James Stewart) rides in to Bottleneck and sets about ridding the town of its riff-raff elements - without guns!

Based on the novel by Max Brand, Destry Rides Again simultaneously spoofed the Western genre whilst reinvigorating Marlene Dietrich's flagging career. At first glance it seemed an odd casting choice to choose Dietrich as the bawdy saloon chanteuse, Frenchy, especially since Paulette Goddard was originally cast for the role. But it really comes off, where Dietrich's loud and brusque portrayal perfectly plays off of Jimmy Stewart's laid back and gentle mannered Destry performance.

The role of Destry is tailor made for Stewart, his everyman charm sits perfect for a character who is at first painted as a wimp, he drinks milk - he carries no guns, but who better than Stewart to fully realise a character that uses brains over brawn to great effect? A film of this type, though, is only as good as its villain, and thankfully Brian Donlevy steps up to the plate with a suitable grumpy sneer, it's a fine performance from a very undervalued performer.

Directed by the highly experienced George Marshall, Destry Rides Again is chock full of the elements that make a good family film even better than it should be, jokes a plenty, goodies and baddies, songs and quality slices of drama, all combine here to make this a very entertaining and rewarding picture indeed. While for those into girl power really need to check out the ending of this picture for sure.

Little Joe, Little Joe... 8/10 || This was very interesting and I enjoyed it significantly. It's weird watching very early James Stewart--he's not what one would consider a conventional romantic male lead--and this is a very bizarre Western/comedy/musical. Anything starring Dietrich of this vintage is priceless, no doubt. Very weird, especially considering America's ever-present right-to-bear-arms controversy, watching a film like this, too. A purely magical film that's essential to own and re-watch for any Stewart, Dietrich or Western enthusiasts--and a strong reason why 1939 was the greatest year ever for American cinema. || Brian Donlevy (""Kent"") and Malrene Dietrich (""Frenchy"") pretty much run the town of Bottle Neck. Everyone comes to their saloon where they blow off steam and where she regularly serenades them with some toe-tappers. Upstairs, ""Kent"" runs a crooked poker game and together they fleece gullible old ""Claggett"" out of his ranch. He goes to the sheriff who promises to intercede, and pretty soon the town drunk has a new job! This new sheriff ""Dimsdale"" (Charles Winninger) worked for the original ""Destry"" back in the day, so determined to clean up the town for good, he sends for his son ""Tom"" (James Stewart). Nobody is prepared for the rather dapper gent who disembarks from the stage without a gun. Everyone assumes he is going to be a bit of a washout, but of course there is more than one way to skin a cat - as we are about to discover. Stewart is on good form in this much more subtle and enjoyable western. He plays a perfect foil to the undoubted star in Marlene Dietrich whose face just lights up the screen, and whose voice with ""See what the boys in the backroom..."" and ""Little Joe"" has that legendary tone to it that has this raucous crowd eating out of her hand. There is a solid and entertaining supporting cast, and though the conclusion is maybe a bit rushed, it all ends the only way it can and Emmeline Pankhurst would have been proud."

As the American Civil War rages, a Virginian patriarch keeps his large farming family in the act of isolationism. But will the war leave them alone?

First half of the pic lets us into the lives of the Anderson family, their beliefs, their loves and losses, and decisions that will shape their futures. Circumstances will of course come knocking at the door, which shifts the film into darker territory, where it is here that McLaglen and his team brilliantly show the emotional and physical hardships of the war between the North and the South. Story and the characters are consistently compelling, all while the locations envelope the dramatics with a beauty that is realised by the legendary Clothier. And then there is Stewart, a class act and the axis, the fulcrum of everything that is great about the pic, his character brought vividly - and crucially believably - to life, one of the best father portrayals in classic film.

Rightly thought of as a British classic, story finds three children relocating to Yorkshire after their father has wrongly been imprisoned for treason.

Picture comes with splendid Edwardian detail, of a time long since lost to Britain. Jeffries never once over eggs the Yorkshire pudding, filling out his pic with great dramatic sequences and wonderful coming of age literacy.

I also thought Bernard Cribbins did a wonderful job as Perks, crusty on the surface, but only on the surface, and full of energy and enthusiasm bringing the role to life. The rest of the ensemble cast were fine also. It was well worth watching.

I have many positives. Clint Eastwood is tremendous in one of the two lead roles, I know he seemingly plays this sorta character a lot, at least early on in his career, but man is he quality at it. Shirley MacLaine is great alongside Mr. Eastwood, she suits and plays her character extremely well. The two have excellent chemistry. Elsewhere, Manolo Fábregas spearheads the rest.

How about that score? I love it! Impossible not to tap along to whenever the main title is used and every single time it sounds so, so good. Ennio Morricone, what a ledge! The humour in this 1970 film is also top notch, while the pacing and editing is also on point. I really enjoyed the journey that the plot takes, it's simple and there's a clear beginning, middle and end but it's all supremely entertaining.

I will no doubt be revisiting this! || **_One of Eastwood's top Westerns_**

In Mexico during Maximilian's brief reign (1864-67), a nun named Sara (Shirley MacLaine) is rescued from three rowdy rapists by a loner named Hogan (Clint Eastwood). The pair team-up and assist the Juaristas in their fight to free Mexico from French rule. Manolo Fábregas plays the colonel of the Juaristas.

Released in 1970 and directed by Don Siegel, ""Two Mules for Sister Sara""  is superior to Eastwood's first two ""Man with No Name"" movies. While it's not technically as good as the renowned ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966), it has a more compelling story with better characters.

And that's the key to this movie's effectiveness: It focuses on the two protagonists and their developing relationship. Because we're interested in them we're more interested in the extraordinary events with which they're entangled. 

Speaking of which, there's a nice buffet of Western staples: gunfights, an Indian attack, a saloon scene, a train wreck, a house of ill repute and a rollicking climax. MacLaine is young, beautiful and charismatic here.

The movie runs 1 hour, 56 minutes, and was shot in Morelos, Sonora and Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico.

McAdam follows, intent on settling his old quarrel, while the rifle keeps changing hands and touching a number of lives.",The Gun That Won The West!,Western,92,1950-07-12,en,7.3,372,1.1065,"James Stewart, Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell",Anthony Mann,"showdown, robbery, horseback riding, hostility, assault, search, rifle, stealing, contest, poker game, fourth of july, winchester rifle, prize, u.s. cavalry","Some things a man has to do, so he does 'em.

This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 ""The Gun That Won The West"" - To cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession. An Indian would sell his soul to own one...

Winchester '73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam, who is pursuing the man who killed his father. Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) having taken all the guns from those entering the town, both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for. The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin eventually wins. But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast. As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.

Very much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called ""psychological Western"", Winchester '73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past. Though shot in black and white (the only one of the duos Westerns that was) the landscapes are still breath taking feasts for the eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City. It's just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.

Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of America's finest and most versatile actors. The support cast isn't too bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings. There's even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here, though the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far.

Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had the script ready to run. But Lang walked away from it, something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans. For as great as a director that Lang was, with Mann directing (and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands) it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre. Not only with the further efforts that Mann & Stewart produced, but also in who they influenced. The likes of Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all taking notes, and gleefully for the Western purists, they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further.

A big hit at the box office back on release, Winchester '73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age. 9/10 || _**Dynamic James Stewart Western with a noir tinge**_

The prize rifle of a drifter (James Stewart) is stolen by his nemesis (Stephen McNally), apprehended by a gun-trader (John McIntire), involved in a cavalry vs. Indian clash, winds up in the hands of a man who struggles with cowardice (Charles Drake) before being swiped by a charismatic outlaw (Dan Duryea). Meanwhile Lin McAdam (Stewart) pursues it with his faithful pardner (Millard Mitchell).   

While ""Winchester ‘73"" (1950) was shot in flat B&W, it’s a compelling action-packed Western with noir touches highlighted by the notable cast, which also includes Will Geer and Shelly Winters (when she was young, fit and voluptuous, not to mention spunky). Also look for Rock Hudson as the lead brave Young Bull and Tony Curtis as a besieged cavalry trooper.  

The movie throws in Dodge City, Kansas, and a surprisingly congenial, almost bumbling (and too-old) Wyatt Earp (Geer) even though it’s clear that the film was shot in southern Arizona. For instance, the saguaro cactus is native to the Sonoran Desert and not within 800 miles of Dodge City. But Tascosa, Texas, works okay within the framework of the Southwest, I guess. Basically, you have to ignore some misleading geography and a dubious Wyatt Earp to enjoy the picture.
  
The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot mainly in southern Arizona with studio stuff done at Universal Studios, California, with some exterior shots of Zion National Park, Utah.

We begin as the audience flood into a cinema and settle down in front of the big screen. The cameraman then takes us on a tour of his city with no apparent rhyme nor reason to the imagery we see. There's a bit of the old Imperial opulence reflected in the architecture to contrast with the street beggars (whom the Soviet Union aways denied existed). A very near miss whilst trying to get some POV footage of a train. Then what feels rather pruriently like a look at a woman's morning levée all intercut cleverly using the camera shutter to deliver this in chapters as their city awakens and the trams start to run, the bustle sets in and the industry comes alive. The photography frequently captures the intricacy of different manufacturing processes - both with and without human input, the latter sometimes being quite labour intensive. People mill about like ants racing to and fro and the cameraman himself appears in shot now and again to add additional context to this remarkably captivating look at a day in the life of an huge variety of people and activities - including a wedding and funeral. What's quite astonishing is the quality of the film. It's almost pristine, almost a century after it was made, and there are even some very basic visual effects merging the images and creatively capturing the lives of the community. It's barely an hour long, but effectively combines pictures of the serious and professional as well as the mischievous and playful and it's well worth a gander."

Errol Flynn stars as Major Nelson, who along with 50 other commandos parachute into Burma to destroy a Japanese radar station. The mission is a success but while waiting to be air lifted to safety they come under attack from the Japanese and are forced to trek thru the jungle, simultaneously fighting the terrain just as much as the enemy.

There were two magnificently directed war films made in 1945, one was John Ford's supreme John Wayne vehicle, They Were Expendable, the other is this much unheralded Raoul Walsh classic. High on military detail and paced with the ultimate precision, Objective, Burma! is as tense as it most assuredly is thrilling. It also finds Errol Flynn turning in what is arguably his finest acting performance. Casting off his rapscallion prankster like persona, he delivers a straight and raw emotive performance that proves beyond doubt he was an actor of note. Short on flag waving sloganeering, courtesy of the source story from Alvah Bessie, pic holds its head high in the technical departments as well. Franz Waxman's brilliant score is tense and unnerving and it mixes seamlessly with the sound department's excellent work involving the noises of the jungle. It's now very much a relief to be able hear this picture through the benefits of home cinema systems. James Wong Howe's photography is suitably bringing the jungle to life, which considering the film was shot mostly at the L.A. Arboretum & Botanical Gardens is quite some achievement.

On its release in the U.S. the film was a critical and box office success, my fellow countrymen here in Britain, however, were not so impressed. Angry about the lack of credit given to the British in the Burmese operation, the film was subsequently banned in the UK until 1952. Then, with common sense prevailing, new prints were issued with a prologue giving credit to the other armed forces involved in the campaign. Which all in all ends things on a rather tidy note I feel. It's a magnificent picture that never loses sight of the core story, it's widely available now on various formats so really you have no excuse not to see it. 9/10"

Spanish cinema has something that the Portuguese need to learn: it knows how to make films that are enjoyable, entertaining, commercially viable, and yet artistically beautiful and well-made. This movie is far from one of the best, and it decidedly hasn't stood the test of time: I would never have heard of it if I hadn't found the movie on the Internet by chance. The presence of some well-known actors and actresses helped my decision to see it, and I was even pleasantly surprised to discover that the film was filmed in Portugal (I discovered this through the train's locomotive, which I recognized as Portuguese).

The script was well written, and weaves a light comedy around a deserting soldier and a very liberal family for the period in which everything takes place, the thirties of the last century. The context is a Spain in political upheaval: the monarchy, unpopular and unloved, is increasingly contested by the people, who place hopes in socialism and republicanism. This is how the republican military uprising in Jaca takes place. The defeat leads Fernando, one of the rebel soldiers, to flee and desert, ending up in a rural region where he meets Manolo, an elderly republican who is quite progressive, but lonely, since his four daughters already live their lives away from their father's house. . When they finally arrive, Fernando refuses to leave because he is enchanted by their beauty: one of them, Clara, is a recent widow; Violet, on the other hand, is a lesbian; Rocío, on the other hand, is dating a boy, from the region, rich, idiot and supporter of Carlist ideologies. The youngest daughter, Luz, is the most innocent.

What follows is a cross-over between each of the old man's daughters and the deserting soldier. He actually goes to bed with all of them, and falls in love with each one in turn, which is both hilarious and absurd, and even anachronistic, since it goes against the narrow and closed morality of the Iberian countryside. from that time, when courtship was more social and heavily guarded by the girls' families. This was what irritated me most about the film: the anachrony of the behaviors and excessive sexual tolerance of those people. This seems much more like the product of some modern sexual fetish than a story set in the 1930s.

The actors do a reasonably good job: Jorge Sanz is a gentle protagonist, but his performance as an actor is rather lukewarm, and he turns out to be quite erased by the good performance of the actresses. Penélope Cruz and Maribel Verdú are the best actresses: each in their own character, they completely dominate the action with funny and well-executed interpretations. Ariadna Gil is rarely seen, but she also handled the task at hand well. Miriam Diaz-Aroca, in turn, is limited to the average. Fernando Fernán Gomez is a veteran who gives us a good performance, but in an ill-conceived character.

Shot in Portugal, the film is quite elegant, and the cinematography works very well, as it does much to give the film a dreamlike look, emphasizing rural beauty and nature. The sets and costumes were well done, and easily transport us to the 30s. The good soundtrack also deserves praise, even if it doesn't have any memorable songs."

A transport aeroplane carrying an assortment of men crash lands in the Sahara desert, these men must group together in spite of their varying indifference's and build another plane out of the wreckage.

It perhaps, on the surface, doesn't sound much does it? We as viewers are asked to spend over two hours watching these men interact with each other with differing results. The location stays the same, it is just sand, sun, and men awaiting death. Yet the film is one of the best exponents of the character piece because the characters each have their own personal hang ups. Be it carrying scars from the war, or a class difference of upbringing, or that demon addiction to alcohol, these men have to overcome themselves before they can overcome the biggest hurdle in front of them.

Boasting what reads as a who's who of great character actors, The Flight Of The Phoenix becomes a riveting watch because we feel the stifled nature of their plight, because we are blessed to have these wonderful actors fully realising the great writing from Lukas Heller. It is absorbing, it is very sharp, and fittingly we get a twist that makes the ending even more rewarding.

Highly Recommended. 8/10 || A true classic.
14 men on a small low budget plane working for an oil company that cares as much about their employees as one might expect.
So, the plane goes down in the middle of the desert, and the twelve survivors just wait to die.
James Stewart is the pilot who feels responsible, but so does his navigator played by Richard Attenborough. Meanwhile, we wonder about the other characters.
We expect Ernest Borgnine, Dan Duryea, and George Kennedy to be the key players, but they relax into the backdrop, except for Borgnine, who soon fades into the backdrop. 
Instead, it's Ronald Frasier as a career soldier, and Hardy Kruger as an engineer, who become the key players.
The engineer claims he can build an aeroplane.
Little by little, Townes (Stewart) and Lou (Attenborough) begin to believe the engineer. They see his designs. They get hope. They begin to build the plane.
Then, a bit of dark comedy unfolds as they find out more about the engineer. I dare not spoil it.
The characters are awesome, even those who seem to be just extras, but they aren't extras. In fact, these extras (Kennedy and Duryea) give life to the film. It's probably because they were big name players that they were chosen to be the most minor players, to give the viewer the sense that minor players are real people.
Even ""Rat Bags"", who appears to be the most brutal of the characters, displays humanity and sorrow when his friend decides to walk out with Peter Finch to seek help.
There's a lot of theatrics and drama, and the setting is the exotic desert, but still the setting doesn't change, yet there is never a dull moment. Much like ""12 Angry Men"", there is always some animation of emotion and theater that keeps even the most attention deficit disorder person infatuated with the story. I know, because I am as ""attention deficit"" as they come. || Jimmy Stewart is ""Towns"" who flies his dilapidated aircraft around the North African oilfields. When once such trip ends in a crash, they find themselves stuck in the desert short of water, and of ideas as to how to get themselves home. Until that is, the rather superior ""Dorfmann"" (Hardy Krüger) concocts a plan to perform industrial surgery on the wreckage and maybe get them airborne again. What now ensues is a tautly directed series of escapades as the personalities of crew and passengers clash; the desert takes it's toll on the sanity of some, the Bedouin on the lives of others - but can they get out? Richard Attenborough is superb, as is the usually reliable Peter Finch and his sergeant Ronald Fraser - but it is the psychological duel between ""Towns"" and ""Dorfmann"" that stands out. Both actors really draw the audience into their predicament, and their characterisations work well to raise the palpable tension before an ending that ties together the surreal with the enjoyable in an innovative and exciting fashion. This is certainly one of Stewart's better performances, and is certainly well worth a watch."

It's a small point, but the audio from Welles isn't the best and sometimes its quite difficult to make out what he's saying, but as the family dynamic becomes more strained and the backstory fills in a tale of a group of people for whom it's really only money that has become the thing that matters now - we end up with a characterful study of avarice and ambition tempered with some dark humour and an increasingly engaging effort from Welles and a smouldering - if maybe a little too predictable - chemistry from Woodward and Newman. It can be a bit wordy at times, but Martin Ritt keeps the pace even and taut as these folks evolve before us. It's not as intense as it might be, but it's still an easy two hours looking at the less salubrious side of human nature."

Well, that's what he wonders too - and every effort he makes to establish just what he is supposed to have done fails to deliver. His detention is hardly traditional either. He is largely free to come and go as he pleases, provided always that he is available to attend his questioning sessions by those who seem rather arbitrarily charged with deciding his guilt or innocence. As his (and our) frustrations grow, he explores the lives of those close to him - might the source of his predicament lie there? Luckily, his uncle learns of his situation and engages the learned advocate ""Hastler"" (Orson Welles) - but is he likely to prove an help or an hindrance? This story is Kafka as his very best. Machiavellian scheming mixed with the ultimate in ""Big Brother"" state manipulation; the disabling lack of information and the increasing exasperation of young ""Josef"" are successfully transferred onto an audience that shares his fears and apprehensions. Gradually, we learn a great deal about this man, his flaws, foibles and fetishes, but still are uncertain as to just what he is supposed to have done! A considerable degree of the menace here emanates from the dark photography and from an effective supporting cast who excel in perpetuating the mystery, too. Welles directs this with considerable aplomb, Jean Ledrut provides an evocative and mysterious score to accompany a screenplay that delivers the sense of vexation and chagrin well and compellingly. Fans of horror films ought to watch this too - it's one of the scariest films I have ever seen. || . || The Trial: Welles's Brilliant Exposition of Guiltless Guilt

Orson Welles's ""The Trial"" exists in a lineage of dystopian narratives that includes Kafka's original text of the same name, George Orwell's ""1984"", and Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" film - all works that explore bureaucratic dehumanization and the absurdity of institutional power.

If the first layer of the film reveals bureaucratic absurdity and inaccessible justice, its deeper strata explore a more insidious human condition: the phenomenon of ""guiltless guilt"" - an existential state where individuals internalize blame for circumstances beyond their control.

Josef K (Anthony Hopkins) isn't just a victim of an incomprehensible system; he's a subconscious participant in his own psychological prosecution. Welles suggests that guilt isn't an external judgment, but an internal landscape where humans reflexively blame themselves for random misfortunes.

This psychological mechanism echoes broader historical traumas. Like Kafka's prescient writing before the rise of Nazism, Welles exposes how undefined, internalized guilt enables systemic oppression. The nameless accusation becomes a mirror: ""Perhaps I deserve this,"" people whisper to themselves, thus facilitating their own marginalization.

Religious narratives - from Eve's original sin to cultural mythologies of personal culpability - have long programmed this psychological response. We carry lucky charms, we apologize for being victims, we internalize blame as a perverse form of control.

In both ""The Trial"" and ""Brazil"", the visual language becomes a physical manifestation of this psychological oppression. Welles's stark, expressionist landscapes and Gilliam's grotesque, mechanical environments aren't mere backdrops, but external representations of internal psychological states. The labyrinthine bureaucracies become metaphors for the human mind's capacity for self-persecution, where architectural complexity mirrors psychological entrapment.

Welles and Gilliam share a crucial insight: systemic oppression isn't imposed from outside, but cultivated from within. Josef K and Sam Lowry aren't just victims; they're unwitting architects of their own psychological prisons. The surreal, nightmarish visual styles become a perfect translation of this internal landscape of ""guiltless guilt"" - where the most effective chains are the ones we forge for ourselves.

""The Trial"" is less a film about justice than a profound exploration of how humans psychologically prepare themselves for, and participate in, their own oppression."

All these ultra-low reviews are ridiculous. What were these people expecting? A serious drama with superb acting? An action film? Actually ""From Justin to KellY"" (2003) is a fun musical/beach film in the manner of Elvis films and the 60's beach flicks. One look at the movie poster and it's obvious.

When viewing films of this ilk it's time to just kick back, turn off your brain and have a good time. On this level ""From Justin to Kelly"" works fabulously. It's pretty much just as good or better than any Elvis or beach movie you can think of. Filmed in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, the story deals with the romantic adventures of youths on Spring Break. Keeping with the traditions of the genre there's no raunch or moronic sex/bathroom humor; the film has an appealing innocence.

Another highlight is that there are more gorgeous bikini-clad babes per minute than most movies out there (dudes too, if you're a woman).

To be expected, the songs featured are all substance-less modern pop ditties ('modern' as in the early 2000s, which hasn't changed much today). I don't normally listen to this kind of music, but it fits the upbeat and fun vibe of the film.

I'm hardly an American Idol aficionado but I admit that I did enjoy the show when I occasionally viewed it with my wife. And Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the two stars of the film, were two of the more likable ""idols."". (I also confess to liking Katharine McPhee, Bo Bice, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Kelly Pickler and Clay Aiken). (I'm just joking about Aiken, lol). To be expected, Kelly and Justin aren't the best actors but they're not bad either, particularly as the story proceeds; the quality of the acting certainly doesn't prevent you from enjoying the flick. They did a fine job all things considered.

One can't bring up American Idol without mentioning the ever-present Kimberly Caldwell (from the channel station). She's an undeniably good-looking woman but she tends to grate on the nerves. The reason I bring her up is, if you've ever secretly fantasized about seeing her chopped in half, be sure to check out the goofy gorefest ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" (2007) (I'd call it a horror film but it's way too silly and over-the-top to be horrifying). This film makes your fantasies come true, literally.

The DVD features the 81-minute fullscreen version of the film whereas as well as the 90-minute extended widescreen cut, which has a few extra dance numbers.

If you're in the mood for an innocent beach flick turn your brain off and enjoy!

GRADE: B/B- || While ""From Justin to Kelly"" may have been labeled a box office failure and a flop, I must admit that I have a soft spot for the music and dancing featured in the film. Despite Kelly Clarkson's candid dislike for the project, I find it to be a fun and enjoyable movie. My fondness for the film is largely due to my admiration for Kelly Clarkson.

Although Justin's character may come off as corny and over-the-top, Kelly shines with her fun and exciting performance. With a better storyline and script, I believe Kelly's involvement alone could have led to box office success. Unfortunately, the mismatched casting and weak storyline hindered the film's potential.

From a critical standpoint, ""From Justin to Kelly"" falls short in terms of quality filmmaking. Despite its flaws, I am able to overlook the film's shortcomings and appreciate it for the enjoyment it brings me. While it may not be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece or a top-notch musical, Kelly Clarkson's commendable performance stands out. The experience may have deterred Kelly from pursuing similar projects in the future, but her talent as a megastar continues to shine."

Ultimately you have to think that those who have wanted to see Hollywood Homicide would have done so by now, certainly fans of the generational divided lead actors (Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford) would have long since tuned in to see what it's like. It's fair to say that its reputation is most divisive, with some critics proving to be most ferocious in their summations. Personally I find it to be an enjoyable spin on the buddy buddy cop formula, where director Ron Shelton isn't afraid to put emphasis on characters instead of just filling out the pic with high octane bangs and crashes. The wry portrayal of the police system in a bustling Los Angeles is nicely etched into the froth, with the sidebar of coppers having two jobs being a deft poke in the ribs.

Good fun with well crafted action scenes, but the main strength is in the writing and to see once again that Ford has been very undervalued as a comedy actor of the years. 6.5/10"

My feelings about this movie may very well be extended towards Boyle's movies in general : solid direction overall, but events did not fail to go from situational and behavioral realism to sudden heroical action nonsense. || It started off as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different...

28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.

When animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as ""Rage"", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...

28 days later... 

The amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day). 

There's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.

It's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for ""28 Weeks Later"". It's not as raw as ""Days"", but it's gorier and itself also a fine ""infected"" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.

A great cast and premise get down and dirty In a sharply executed infected based horror. 8.5/10 || _28 Days Later_ was made on a very small budget in the early days of digital cinema, so, yes, in retrospect, it does look a little bit like it was shot on a Nokia 3310, and yes, it is heavily responsible for the bilious deluge of zombie movies we got in its wake, which we are only now finally recovering from - but it's so **good**.

Can I order a McG sandwich please? Huh? You have no filling? Sure, I’ll just take the overly stylised sauce. My personal adoration for this sequel’s predecessor is one that cannot be described fully without tackling the realms of lunacy and diminishing my own critical insight. It’s just a special piece of camp nostalgia for me, even if its construction is more amateurish than Diaz’ dance moves. Interestingly, this continuation was also on repeat as I galloped around the room to the soundtrack of The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers, witnessing physically impossible aerobatic stunts. However, after all these years, it’s time to succumb to the realisation that Full Throttle is a bad film.

Much like the first feature, its plot is a secondary product to the outlandish femme fatale antics. This time the angels must secure two H.A.L.O. rings which probably has something to do with monetisation and greed. Don’t ask me! For I honestly do not know. A stationery Barrymore sliding fully under a low table without the use of her arms had me entranced. Liu leaping sixty feet into the air by just jumping off a table had me hypnotised. And of course, Diaz bopping to MC Hammer’s “U Can’t Touch This” had me salivating. These, including the last point (have you tried side stepping that rapidly!?), are physically impossible to perform.

The wired stunts and choreography are so exaggerated that it becomes laughably terrible, juxtaposing the semi-realistic narrative that McG is attempting to convey. Driving off a dam whilst trying to fly into a helicopter and take off (all in mid-air by the way...) before it crashes? Sure. Why not. Performing motocross stunts whilst upside down and shooting the angels? Eh. I’ll let it slide. Using a lace cape as a squirrel suit, throwing a bomb into a film premiere and perfectly landing in a car whilst being pursed by the angels who are hanging onto illuminated wires? Ummm. I guess. Being tossed through a shop window, like a rag doll, and walking it off before getting changed for the premiere? Now wait just a minute! Heightened stunts and ‘Matrix’-styled slow motion is all fine and dandy, but I need an ounce of realism in order to feel threatened by the danger on screen. The angels are invulnerable to everything, making the entire ordeal worthless.

Yes, using a flamethrower to “Firestarter” is bonafide brilliance and shaped me to be the man that I am today. Yet the random action set pieces (to which there are loads!) cannot justify the narrative’s direction. Again, frustrating considering the onscreen chemistry of Diaz, Barrymore and Liu. The one and only Demi Moore is used for an underdeveloped plot twist, as she suggestively licks Diaz’ face. Oh, and Bernie Mac replaced Murray. A fine replacement, but again, under-utilised. Let’s not even discuss Theroux’s insulting Irish accent. The technical aspects, especially the garish green screen and floaty human CGI, unintentionally adds characteristics to the film in general, yet still executed terribly. And the callback “humour”, mostly consisting of the “creepy thin man” and the angels’ relationship, were cringeworthy at best. Although, the ongoing innuendos between Alex and her father did make me chuckle continuously.

Is it enough to substantiate a sequel that showcases the apparent curse of “more is better”? Absolutely not. Whilst the heart of Charlie’s Angels resides within, its discombobulated exterior diminished most of the heavenly fun to be had. || Not as good as the 1st. It was still pretty funny. The sexy trio's fight scenes were a little better in this one."

That is due to one of the two protagonists we meet: Ali (El Hedi ben Salem) is a Moroccan immigrant working in Munich. He toils as a car repairman and has learned some very basic German, but he has been hindered from assimilating to German and fully learning the language by both lack of time and a German society that deliberately keep his kind at arm's length. But one night at a pub, he meets by chance Emmi (Brigitte Mira) a 60-something widow. They dance and Emmi falls in love with this tall, dark, and handsome stranger who makes her feel feelings again after so many years. Ali's own thoughts and motivations remain more mysterious, but he too seems to have been wracked with loneliness, and he recognizes in this woman two decades his senior a soulmate. The result is initially a very idiosyncratic romantic comedy.

Sadly, as an opening title of the film reads, ""Happiness is not always happy"". The flip side of this couple's burgeoning love is the suspicion, jealousy, fear, and hatred that Emmi and Ali encounter from the citizens around them. Emmi's neighbours gossip and disparage her for bringing ""trash"" into their block of flats; Emmi's adult children reject her new partner; and the local grocer refuses to serve Ali. The drama of the film is Emmi and Ali's attempts to weather this storm of social rejection and make their relationship work. Some small hope remains in a handful of Munich people who see nothing wrong with this couple.

The acting here is memorable. El Hedi ben Salem was not a professional actor. In fact, he was one of Fassbinder's lovers, the two met in a bathhouse in Paris. Yet El Hedi ben Salem's awkwardness on screen actually fits his role perfectly, because Ali is ill at ease and unsure of what to do in this foreign land he has immigrated to. Most of the strong acting demands are placed on Brigitte Mira, a veteran of German film and television for decades, and she pulls this off marvelously. So much poignant emotion of a woman ruing the racism of her peers, or alive with love again after years of solitude, are expressed purely through her eyes, which Fassbinder often emphasizes with long camera takes. Fassbinder himself appears as Emmi's son-in-law (married to Emmi's daughter played by Irm Hermann, a stalwart of this director's productions), and though he gets little screen time, Fassbinder's facial expressions and sardonic dialogue are delightful.

Yet, in spite of its curiously heartwarming romantic pairing and touching plot about two lovers against a cruel world, ANGST ESSEN SEELE AUF is not a perfect film. In the latter part of his film, Fassbinder seems uncertain of his point. In a bitter turn, he upends the romance we had become used to for a much more pessimistic view of human relationships where the original theme of racism and intolerance seems forgotten, or at least firmly pushed aside. He then ends the film at an arbitrary point, as if unable to come up with anything more conclusive.

Nonetheless, this is a classic film and worth seeing. One can also appreciate just how well Fassbinder anticipated here the cinema of Aki Kaurismäki with its characters who are ""losers"", the cold stares of onlookers, and the awkwardness of it all."

Indeed that was true, and especially in my movie-watching, I try to imagine all of the effort, and the blood, sweat and tears, that goes into a film's gestation. Thankfully, I paid very little for this film (director Paylow's only cinematic feature), and it only took 71 minutes of my time.

To its credit, it had an intriguing start, with an eerie atmosphere to its opening credits. But the introduction by the cemetery's custodian, 'R.J. Dobson', (complete with his crazed cat, 'Puma') was the first clue to me that something just wasn't right. But openings like that, with Dobson showing a tombstone, starting to explain how the death at such a young age occurred, then the flashback occurring, at least gave me the false hope that this could be a 'horror anthology', and that no matter how bad a piece was, at least others would come that might be better. But no.

This had no credibility in any manner whatsoever. In its depiction of college life, particularly for the medical students (who bizarrely were all male), it was obvious the filmmakers had no idea whatsoever of human nature, or the way that people of that age group interacted. There were no horrific aspects whatsoever, and all of the resoundingly minor attempts at comedy fell disgustingly flat. Any high-school play from the era would have more life. What makes this the second-worst film I have ever seen is that, for all intents and purposes, everyone involved thought they were making something credible, and were giving it their all (nothing could surpass Lena Dunham's 'Tiny Furniture' as the very worst film of all time IMHO). What surprises me is that Paylow would eventually be involved, in different capacities, in two of the very best films of the 70's ('Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'The Conversation'). Obviously he was a talented man who, at least in the director's chair for this film, didn't deliver the goods, though by no stretch of the imagination was it his fault alone."

You Only Live Once is directed by Fritz Lang and written by C. Graham Baker and Gene Towne. It stars Sylvia Sidney, Henry Fonda, Barton MacLane, Jean Dixon and William Gargan. Music is by Alfred Newman and cinematography by Leon Shamroy. 

He has been pounding on the door of that execution chamber since the day he was born. 

One of Fritz Lang's first American productions is a cracker-jack proto-noir, a leading light (darkly shaded of course) in the sub-genre of fugitive lovers on the lam pictures. Story leans on the legend of Bonnie and Clyde and finds Fonda as three times jailbird Eddie Taylor. After strings are pulled and promises made, Eddie gets released into the arms of his adoring gal, Jo Graham (Sidney). Determined to go straight and settle down with Jo, Eddie finds a society not ready to forgive and forget, worst still, he's old comrades in criminal arms have cooked something up and it's not going to be good news for Eddie. Cue the Romeo & Juliet factor as two lovers love each other so much they will stop at nothing to be together and to try and make the other one happy. 

Lang brings his expressionistic bent to the tragi noir tale, drifting fogs, mists and spider web shadows across key scenes. Canted angles feature, reflections in a psychological eye also play their part, while the protection of animals theme – and the continuing frog motif - further strengthens the otherworldly – cum - nightmarish aura that so often permeated Lang's movies. The action scenes are deftly marshalled by the director, with a smoke grenade led robbery and a prison escape particularly worthy of luring you to the end of your seat. 

Lang also gets fine performances from his lead actors, Sidney is not done too many favours by the screenplay, where she is saddled with one of those compliant love interest roles, but she brings a quality to her scenes with Fonda that earns respect. Fonda is great in what is a two-fold role, shifting skilfully between a tender lover to an embittered man, he's a triumphant fulcrum for all the various strands that Lang is weaving together. It has been argued that it's a film that's too morally grey, but as film noir lovers will tell you, this is no bad thing, especially when Lang marries up his superb visuals with alienation, fatalism and pessimism.

It also turns out that should she endorse the identity of the young woman, the enormous sum of £10 million will be released to her by the Bank of England. Bergman is strong as the initially vulnerable, amnesiac girl who has no real idea who she is, or where she comes from - and that performance contributes very plausibly as the story gathers momentum and her persona becomes much better established (real or not!). Hayes - aided by the scene stealing Martita Hunt's ""Baroness von Livenbaum"" - also plays her part well, an imperious woman who is cynical but harbours an optimistic desire that hopes against hope. Brynner isn't up to very much, though. He doesn't quite cut it as the scheming manipulator and as the story progresses his character, already pretty unlikeable, doesn't really develop until a rather weak and underwhelming denouement (historical truth notwithstanding). When this was made, there was a chance that one of the Grand Duchesses had survived, and the colourful and stylish look of this film tries hard to capitalise on those intriguing rumours.

Scaramouche is a romantic revenge adventure brought to us by MGM. It's based on the 1921 novel Scaramouche by Rafael Sabatini. The story was also filmed as a silent film in 1923 that starred Ramon Novarro. Directed by George Sidney (Anchors Aweigh/Kiss Me Kate), it stars Stewart Granger, Eleanor Parker, Janet Leigh, Mel Ferrer and John Dehner. It's produced by Carey Wilson from a screenplay by Ronald Millar and George Froeschel. The original music score was composed by Victor Young and the cinematography by Charles Rosher. 

Do you want your buckle swashed? Would you like to be whisked away on an adventure with beautiful women and handsome men at every turn? All played out in sumptuous Technicolor? Where the sets and costumes are of a very high quality and the choreography of the sword play is as good as it gets? If yes then Scaramouche is the film for you. A classic swashbuckler in the truest sense of the saying. 

The makers have simplified Sabatini's novel to make the film family friendly, the script is literate and witty, while the cast attack the material with gleeful relish. Particularly Granger, who smirks his way thru the piece with debonair ease; and Mel Ferrer who delivers one of the finest villains the genre has thrown up. At the core of the film is the longest filmed ever sword duel at six and a half minutes, every second of which is vibrant, bold, and yes, damn sexy too. Sidney's direction is very astute because the pace never sags and there's just enough characterisation to make us root for the hero and to boo the villain. Whilst the piece rightly in its approach work never resorts to being a boorish history lesson. Even the love triangle {poor Stewart has both the sensual Parker and the sweet Leigh lusting after him!} never cloys the story, and in fact gives the film a solid centre as the outer edges merge into its adventure based being. 

Not as famous as some of Errol Flynn or Tyrone Powers' sword play movies, but it should be because it's a rapier ripper of a movie. 8/10"

She's a bit of a live wire and that doesn't sit well in his new lodgings where a library-like atmosphere is actively encouraged. Indeed, before long he begins to feel that his neighbours are engaged in a plot to force him out, or even worse. He's hearing noises, voices; he's imagining things. Or is he? His flat is broken into; he fears that someone is going to try and kill him as he sleeps. In short, paranoia is taking a firm hold of this man. What also doesn't help is the fact that he is becoming increasingly obsessed with the (now deceased) previous occupant, and that leads to significant changes to his frequently erratic behaviour too. Is all of this real or is he just losing the plot? Polanski delivers well here, as does Adjani but it's really the whole concept that makes this interesting. It reminded me a little of ""Rosemary's Baby"". Not in any Satanic fashion, but in the way the claustrophobia of his dwelling with  animosity on all sides; his own personality instinctively weak, susceptible and all in the face of a danger that might be real, or then again... It has some effective menacing elements of a psychological conspiracy thriller to it that I though worked really quite well and the two hours flew by as his character really does start to get under your skin."

Right from the start, we know that there's a sub-plot involving a tartan holdall, well four of them, and with some underhand shenanigans going on to obtain one of those that must contain something secret we now have the ingredients for some slapstick chaos that provides one of the best ""Wacky Races"" style car chases through San Francisco with nobody safe!

Rather than just have the hero try to save the world, Lee and James Schamus decided to have Bruce Banner deal with his Freudian psychology, specifically the repressed memories he had thirty years ago about his father.

The acting talents of Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott and Josh Lucas are perfect for the five main characters. Bana was able to do intentional wooden acting to hide his character's repressed emotions while Connelly conveyed kindness as her Oscar winning role from A Beautiful Mind (2001).

What I loved about Lee's interpretation is that he did not care about faithfulness. He cared about showing a cerebral kind of superhero film that later got imitated with The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005-2012), Watchmen (2009), Logan (2017), Dawn of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016).

Ang Lee is one of the best directors to have ever lived and Hulk is one of many films he directed for great proof. || The Green Giant is awakening!
As a little baby, the Offspring Bruce Banner Genmanipulativ is changed. Later, as a young man, he is a scientist himself and is employed with gamma radiation. He wants to try to reach scar tissue and injuries, using the radiations, a healing method. Through an accident with the radiation, banners mutate when he has a tantrum, to a Green Giant: the Hulk!
Eric Bana plays the shy and vulnerable Bruce banner. Although he does not really trust the role, he mastered the insecurity in person, sovereign. 
Jennifer Connelly plays Betty Ross. Connelly embodies Betty cool and sober. It is only when she experiences how banners mutate that she shares a helping emotion.
Josh Lucas plays Glen Talbot. Talbot is fully fixated on his career and is a smug Sesselfurzer. He wants to develop the invention of banners for the military and thus create super soldiers. He has every means right for that. Lucas was arranged as a little villain. Unfortunately, he doesn't necessarily come across like that.
The military commander Ross, is portrayed by Sam Elliott. Elliott plays his character cool and iron. He really wants to protect his country. That is why he acts defending and patriotic for his country. 
Although Nick Nolte has at least playtime, he plays his role most deeply. The few minutes of presence, is a pleasure of acting. 
The visual language of the director Ang Lee is very special. His idea of using certain settings as a split screen is also closer to the Marvel Comics. So that you really also realize the Hulk is a comic book template. 
The effects from the year 2003 are good, but you can already notice certain Unperfektheiten.
The animations are still kitschy. Which seems a bit ridiculous, too. The story leaves a lot to miss. On the one part, because Hulk belongs in the MCU, here the humor and sarcasm is very rare to see. The colourful and colourful MCU can not be classified here. The story is portrayed here rather as a fantasy drama. Which then looks rather dull for a comic book template. 
In the last third, it is right to the point and it is going to be quite an effect thunderstorm. It's really a pity that you have to wait more or less until the end until the Hulk drops off steam. 
Conclusion: A down-to-earth stand of the character hulk of Marvel Comics. Unfortunately, it diminishes the story through seriousness and dramaturgy that happens! || I mean, what was everyone expecting? They hired a director who does mostly Asian art-house movies to helm a comic book movie about a green monster who smashes things when he gets angry. Of course Ang Lee was going to delve into Freudian concepts, overtones of Greek tragedy, and strange editing choices.

My issues with Hulk are more focused on its painfully slow pace and messy third act. Yes, the whole movie seems a bit pretentious, but you have to at least admire the intent and ambition to make this movie, even if the execution is wonky."

Under-rated, worthy chapter to the story, with surprisingly provocative ideas and some stellar acting.

While this movie admittedly has neither the grit of T1 nor the grand vision or pathos of T2, I'd like to share what I believe to be three elements which together cement T3's place in the canon of the Terminator franchise.

The first is the way the actors acted the relationship between Connor and the T-800. While Connor has memories that we the audience recall from T2, the T-800, played by Arnold, was not the same T-800 from T2. This is just another machine from off an assembly line of T-800s that were manufactured. Yeah, Arnold looks like Arnold, but this T-800 has no memory of the previous installment because it was not there. And he acts disconnected, distant and mechanical, betraying zero connection to Connor. That was really cool, and helped we the audience appreciate that, where the T-800 comes from, is a much bigger place than we had heretofore really digested. We only ever saw one or two at a time back in our time; the reality we had not yet seen by the time of T3, is that the future was full of these things, and there's nothing personal about them. We the audience wanted to reconnect to all the good feelings from the end of T2, we wanted to get personal with these machines, and that's really hard to do. This movie smacked us back to ""reality"".

The second aspect is that this is the movie that puts the transition to SkyNet into a context that we could see. Now we know why and how the government handed control over to SkyNet. T3 displayed what we'd heard a little about in T1, and a little more about in T2, but it did so in a way that did not prompt much in the way of ""where did that come from?"" or ""what are they talking about"" that I've ever come across (Terminator Salvation failed test this miserably, spectacularly).

The third and final aspect of the movie that, for me, was rather provocative is that, right up to the end, we the audience are following the stubborn view of Connor that judgment day can be stopped. He was sure they'd stopped it at the end of T2. He was sure they were racing to stop it throughout T3...but, if we the audience stopped ourselves from being emotionally carried away, we'd have come to the realization Connor did earlier that judgment day could not be stopped. The terminators kept coming back from the future because the technology had advanced to where it was both possible and necessary. So judgment day did happen, and the terminator being there meant it couldn't be stopped.

Is T3 the best in the franchise? Heck no! C'mon, I'm not totally crazy. Is it the worst? I don't think so, at all. (I, personally, lay that crown on Terminator Salvation, but I digress...) T2 is the best, for me, for a few reasons. T1 is the honourable second because it started the story and set up many of the devices that would help make T2 among the great sequals of all time - right up there with Godfather 2 and Star Wars Episode 2, and Blade II :-) || The worst _Terminator_ movie. Which seeing as what came after it is... Quite the burn.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || Is it in the song ""American Pie"" where Don McLean sings ""Fire is the Devil's only friend""? Well, I hate to contradict him, but I am afraid time travel is also one of his allies - especially when it is handled in quite such a derivative fashion as this. This time Arnie returns from the future to protect the under-the-radar drifter ""Connor"" (Nick Stahl) and his as yet unknown, future, wife ""Kate"" (Claire Danes) from another, much more state of the art ""Terminator"" - the ""T-X"" (Kristanna Loken). The plot thickens when we discover that her father is an US Air Force general in charge of an whole load of military tech and that baddies Skynet hope to be able to manipulate the past and take control of the defences leaving the nation open to attack from even more of their deadly machines. Could they be re-inventing their own future - on their own, dastardly, terms? Well, of course the original T-1000 (our friendly, neighbourhood, ""Terminator"") is determined to work with ""Connor"" and the now remarkably adept with weaponry ""Kate"" to ensure that this catastrophe is thwarted. Nope, there is not the slightest amount of menace or jeopardy here at all. You might as well just watch the last ten minutes and confirm what you knew was going to happen from the start of this completely unnecessary sequel. The horse has been well and truly flogged; the action scenes - though impressive enough on the VFX front - are all repetitively predictable and frankly rather dull. Neither Stahl nor Danes really fit into their roles particularly well, and strong as he is, Mr. Schwarzenegger can only do so much of the heavy lifting before even his broad shoulders get too tired to prop the whole thing up. Mark Famiglietti provides a bit of eye candy, but otherwise this is all poorly written and delivered, forgettable, stuff that just about passes OK the time in front of the telly."
302.0,Swimming Pool,"A British crime novelist travels to her publisher's upmarket summer house in Southern France to seek solitude in order to work on her next book.

""Swimming Pool"" (2003) is a drama/psychological thriller about a popular English novelist named, Sarah (Charlotte Rampling), who vacations at her publisher's villa in France to find inspiration for her next book. Unfortunately, the publisher's oversexed daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), visits and disrupts her activities.

If you remember 70s' films like ""Orca"" and ""Zardoz"" you'll know that Rampling was stunning in her physical prime in a looks-that-kill way. In ""Swimming Pool"" she's still in decent shape for a woman verging on 60, but her character's a joyless biyatch desperately seeking inspiration. Julie, by contrast, is young, friendly and overflowing with sexuality, but – like Sarah – she's not a pushover in the least.

Sagnier shines as the wild child French hottie. There's just something about the female French accent that's a turn-on. Despite her sexiness, it's clear in some scenes that Julie's actually sort of plain in a girl-next-door kind of way. It's what she does with what she's got that makes her stunning.

Like 2005's ""Match Point,"" ""Swimming Pool"" is the antithesis of the modern 'blockbuster' and all its moronic trappings -- there's no quick editing, no CGI, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. No, ""Swimming Pool"" is movie-making based simply on excellent writing and cinematic storytelling. The end is a revelation to the viewer even if you were expecting it, particularly because, if you research it, it's way more than even that, believe it or not. It's amazing how good writing & storytelling can create a 'Wow' reaction more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite CGI and explosions.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in Luberon, Vaucluse, France, and London.

GRADE: A-

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further if you haven't seen the film)

The obvious interpretation is that Julie isn't real, but rather a character created by Sarah for her next book whereas Julia is the publisher's real daughter, revealed at the end. People who draw this conclusion, like me on my first two viewings, are on the right track, but this interpretation is only accurate to a point.

The crew of the Black Pearl are cursed by something most unimaginable, the only way to lift the curse is to return a lost Aztec coin to its treasure chest home. In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.

It's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, thoughg that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.

It's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun. This is the reason why Pirates had few peers at the time of its release, for it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously. The audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, they are having fun because so is the film and so is, crucially, the impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley (perfectly cast), Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.

The subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the very least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place. The Curse Of The Black Pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10 || My favorite out of the series. In my opinion none of them has been as good as the first. Him just trying to get his ship back the Black Pearl. || Having been deposed by his crew, ""Capt. Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) arrives in Port Royal with little but the clothes he stands up in. He turns up just as the governor's daughter ""Elizabeth"" (Keira Knightley) is having to fend off the rather unwanted matrimonial intentions of ""Norrington"" (Jack Davenport). She has designs on the blacksmith's apprentice - ""Turner"" (a handsome but insipid, sorry, Orlando Bloom) whom she rescued from a pirate raid many years earlier. ""Sparrow"" would prove an excellent catch for ""Norrington"" but thanks to an hot poker, a donkey and some legerdemain at sea, he and ""Turner"" are soon abroad on the trail of his old crew and of the legendary pirates who sail the seas in the ""Black Pearl"" seeking an odd sort of salvation! What now ensues are some pacily directed escapades with loads of attitude, swash and buckle. Some pithy dialogue and a rousing (if slightly repetitive) score from Klaus Badelt take us criss-crossing the Caribbean constantly jumping from frying pan to fire. The star for me here is certainly Geoffrey Rush. A man who rarely disappoints, and on this occasion brings a comically potent degree of menace as his ""Barbossa"" character ensures that the plot thickens and the story gathers momentum. It's a bit on the long side - there are a few sagging moments now and again, but a solid supporting cast led by Kevin McNally provide some borderline slapstick humour, occasionally tempered by the dignified persona of an underused Jonathan Pryce's ""Gov. Swann"" and an whole suite of powdered wigs. The visual effects are top drawer and the story well worth a watch on a big screen to do justice to the imagery and the best traditions of seafaring yarns."

Rowan Atkinson takes his typical goofball character and thrusts him into the serious world of sophistication and espionage, making his ridiculous antics much more hilarious because of the highly dissimilar juxtaposition. Despite bumbling his way through the film, English’s confidence never wanes as he dives into danger again and again, needing the help of his assistant and femme fatale ally to save him from certain doom. Unfortunately, the sequels fail to live up to the excellence of the first installment, never getting the right balance of goofiness and fun. But the original Johnny English film brings it all together, from the stunts to the laughs to the characters. Johnny English might not be a master spy, but he is a master entertainer."

The Cradle of Life benefits from a larger budget, a new director, and a little less cheese. While this Tomb Raider film still has plenty of ridiculous moments, this time, they are more fantastical than cliche, which for a video game character, feels like a step in the right direction. The first film seemed more influenced by Blade and style Matrix, whereas the sequel takes its cues from Mission: Impossible. Lara Croft is a globe-trotting, gun-wielding, archeological super agent, but even with how larger-than-life that sounds, Angelina Jolie and Jan de Bont make it feel more grounded and believable. I appreciated the more practical feel of the effects and incredible stunts. In addition, Gerard Butler’s duplicitous romantic interest keeps the story more unpredictable and engaging. There were gun battles, exotic locations, plenty of expendable bad guys, and an awesome action heroine kicking butt! I couldn’t ask for more! || Equally as good as the first.

The clue to it's long-hidden whereabouts is a pulsating golden orb and both team ""Croft"" and team ""Reiss"" know that's what they are going to have to locate before they can obtain this ultimate power. What's quite impressive about this sequel is that it managed to retain the services of Jolie and attract the always reliable Djimon Hounsou as it tells us a story respectful of cultures across the globe and extols the virtues of leaving well alone. As ever, there is plenty of action, destruction and even a bit of smart-mouthedness and Jolie did look like she was enjoying just throwing caution to the wind amidst a studio of green-screen and taut cables. There's a fair degree of teatime menace and the special effects guys have let rip with plenty of effective visuals to keep the pace rollicking along fine. It's a throw away adventure film with no ambitions to be anything else, and on that basis it effortlessly engages for a couple of hours essentially knitting a few stand-alone episodes into one. You ought to know what you are going to get when you watch it, and if you accept that premiss then it doesn't disappoint."
4464.0,Seabiscuit,True story of the undersized Depression-era racehorse whose victories lifted not only the spirits of the team behind it but also those of their nation.,The hopes of a nation rode on a long shot.,"Drama, History",141,2003-07-22,en,7.055,861,2.682,"Tobey Maguire, David McCullough, Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Elizabeth Banks",Gary Ross,"based on novel or book, horse race, american dream, horse, racehorse, great depression, based on true story, jockey, horse trainer, seabiscuit, 1930s","***Hope for the broken via a quirky, forsaken race horse***

During the Depression, an undersized, “lazy” horse named Seabiscuit becomes a champion, lifting the spirits of both its team and that of the nation. Jeff Bridges plays the owner, Tobey Maguire the jockey and Chris Cooper the trainer. Valerie Mahaffey is on hand as the owner’s wife.

Based on the real story, “Seabiscuit” (2003) is reminiscent in tone of another timeless historical drama starring Bridges, “Tucker: The Man and His Dream” (1988) by Francis Ford Coppola. I prefer the underrated “Tucker” because it’s snappier and less vague, but “Seabiscuit” ain’t no slouch. 

Like the historically-based “Jeremiah Johnson” (1972) the manner of storytelling respects the intelligence of the viewer to sometimes read between the lines. One of the best parts is the build-up to the race with War Admiral and the thrilling race itself. Not knowing the real-life events, a couple of the twists were surprising. The first act, however, seems bogged down by extraneous details about the owner.

The film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes and was shot in California, New York and Kentucky.

GRADE: B || It wears its sentimental heart firmly on its fetlock.  

As the depression era kicks in, Americans were grasping for any sort of inspiration they could get, enter equine supreme, Seabiscuit. Considered broken down, too small and untrainable, Seabiscuit went on to become a bastion of great racehorses and in the process bringing solace to those closest to it.

Back in 2003 upon its initial release, critics were very divided as to the merits of Seabiscuit as a picture. Some were concerned that this adaptation from Laura Hillenbrand's highly thought of novel missed too many crucial elements, others were merely touting the tired old charge of the film purely baiting Oscar (something that is levelled at every film in history about hope and second chances), the more astute critics of the time however lauded it as the delightful and inspiring piece that it is.

It would be churlish of me to not agree that Seabiscuit is laced with sentiment, rookie director Gary Ross barely wastes a chance to tug the heart strings and paint an evocative sequence, but if you have got it in you to accept this true story for its base emotional point, then it is one hell of a wonderful experience. Seabiscuit is not just about the equine beauty of the picture, it's also a fusion of three men's personal wavering, who for one reason or another need the horse for far more important crutches than those provided by financial gain, make no bones about it, Seabiscuit is a very human drama. Knowing how the picture will end never once becomes a problem, because the historical accuracy in the story makes one yearn for that grandiose ending, one to gladden the heart in the way it must have done to thousands upon thousands of Americans back in the depression era day.

Ross wisely chooses to filter in as much realism as he possibly can, archive stills and narration serve as exceptional points of worth to the narrative structure. Then there is the first rate cast to fully form the emotional complexities that Seabiscuit provides. Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire (waif like), Chris Cooper, Elizabeth Banks, top American jockey Gary Stevens and a splendidly jaunty William H Macy, all can rightly feel proud of their respective work on this picture. Yet it's with the thundering race sequences that Seabiscuit really triumphs best, magnificent beasts hurtling around the race track are excellently handled by Ross and his cinematographer, John Schwartzman, whilst a nod of approval must go to the sound department's efforts, for this is definitely one to give your sub-woofer a work out.

Seabiscuit was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning none, perhaps the Academy also felt like those critics who thought it was trying too hard for a Golden Statue? But now after the dust has settled some years later, it pays to revisit Seabiscuit and judge it on its own emotional terms, for it's a tremendously well crafted picture that is of course as inspirational as it most assuredly is tender, a fine fine picture indeed. 9/10"

The inclusion of big celebrities that kids won't recognize is a little odd, but the in your face 3-d stuff is irritating, and there were several forced scenes, and a conflicting message of competition vs cooperation.

There are really high points of the movie: the story line itself is actually pretty good, the robot battle detour was actually a fun way to set up a call back, and there is a really good, if short, twist that I wouldn't expect in a kid's movie.

The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is directed by Billy Wilder who co-writes the screenplay and story with I. A. L. Diamond. Based on characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle, it stars Robert Stephens, Geneviève Page, Colin Blakely, Christopher Lee & Irene Handl. Miklós Rózsa scores the music and cinematography is by Christopher Challis.

There were cases that Sherlock Holmes worked on that were deemed of a ""scandalous nature"" and not for public knowledge. But Dr. Watson made journals, and as Watson's private deposit box is opened some 50 years later, one such journal now sheds light on one particular tricky case, and one that also delved deep into the private life of the greatest of sleuths.

Billy Wilder film's rarely need an introduction, with a CV that contains Stalag 17, The Apartment, Sunset Boulevard and Some Like It Hot, his output, it's safe to say, is mostly remembered and quite rightly is often praised. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is not forgotten by Wilder fans, but it most certainly is his most underrated. Originally made as a three hour movie, the film was taken from Wilder and snipped to a two hour picture. So where once there was a four story narrative, weaved together as an episodic humanisation of the ""consultant detective"", now sits a two story movie. That's it's still a fabulous movie is a towering credit to Wilder and his long time associate, I. A. L. Diamond. With Wilder declaring his displeasure at the final cut of the film, it promptly bombed at the box office. Further lending weight to its reputation as something of a stinker. But time has been kind to it, where the advent of various home format releases and internet discussion forums has seen its stock rise considerably. And rightly so.

Wilder deals an irreverent take on Sherlock Holmes, but one that is not disrespectful to the world created by Arthur Conan Doyle. It's a loving recreation that simply portrays the man as a flawed, yet still genius like, human being: one with his own hang ups and insecurities. Once this has been established in the first third of the movie, and hopefully accepted by the audience, Wilder and co then take us into familiar ""case to be solved"" territory. Once a bedraggled Geneviève Page turns up at 221B, suffering from amnesia and clearly in need of help, we are whisked along with our intrepid duo on a journey involving canaries, midgets, Trappist monks, Queen Victoria and the Loch Ness Monster. With Sherlock's mysterious brother, Mycroft (Lee), front, centre and very involved too. It may not be a mystery to appease purists of the Holmes literature, but it's real good fun and contains one or two twists and revelations along the way.

Robert Stephens plays Holmes as fey yet articulate, intelligent yet complex, but always with a nod and a wink that surely pleased his knowing director. Colin Blakely is pure effervescence as Watson, excitable and exuberant and perfect comic foil for his more mannered partner. Lee is utterly splendid as the straight laced Mycroft, Page adds a simmering sexuality to the proceedings and Handl is joyously sarcastic as Housekeeper Mrs. Hudson. Look out, too, for celebrated stage and screen actor Stanley Holloway as a gravedigger. Rózsa's score is very upbeat, even for the more reflective moments, further evidence of Wilder having tongue nicely nestled in cheek, and the score sits snugly with Challis' pleasing photography around the Scottish Highlands. Major bonus here is the marvellous sets by Alexandre Trauner, particularly the recreation of Baker Street, for here be a sometimes forgotten cinema art at its grandest.

A crisp script is crisply executed by all involved, this film deserves the credit that is now finally coming its way. 8.5/10"

Full of communist bluster dialogue and jokes in keeping with the times, One, Two, Three has all the trademarks of a classic Billy Wilder/I.A.L. Diamond picture. Yet viewing it now, one finds that the jokes are tired and weary, and although the frenetic pace of the film is incredible {it really is like a scattergun exploding upon the viewers senses}, the film is something of an archaic oddity. Boasting a quite brilliant performance from James Cagney, the picture is never less than watchable, but the advent of time means the film is stuck firmly in 1961, regardless of the fine work from lead man and director alike. 6/10"

I think Fred Ward is well cast as Remo Williams. He plays the part well, and in the spirit of the movie. He also has excellent chemistry with Chiun.

My own opinion is this post apocalyptic flic deserves to be right up there with the best of the Mad Max films, and I suspect an indifferent ad campaign doomed it from the start. I love it when a film delivers a lot more than I expected, which is what you get here.  Rutger Hauer and Joan Chen are the primary players on a team of roving 'athletes' who play a brutal game involving two sides, each of which is attempting to win by being the first to spike the skull of a dog on the opposing team's post (don't ask - the origin of this 'sport' is never revealed).  The winning team gets room and board, and maybe a cut of the betting.  Think of it as a variation of baseball's farm system and minor leagues.  Sully, Rutger's character, reached the 'major leagues' before the film begins, but due to poor judgement in choosing his bed partners, was cast all the way down to the bottom, and he's trying to make it back.  The teams that get to the top are allowed to commingle with this future society's one percenters who hold all the wealth and power.  They also get a vicarious thrill watching their 'sports heroes' bleed playing the game, hence the title.

The film is well paced but sparse, you get to learn just enough to understand what's happening and why.  Because of the context in which it is portrayed, it seems to never get dated. Almost no romantic moments, but violence?  Oh, yeah. If for no other reason, the film's ending scene where Sully instructs Kidda (Joan Chen's character) what her next actions should be, elevates this above most other films in the genre.  Let me put it this way - I gladly re-watch this one every chance I get.  My vote - 4 and 1/2 stars."

I'm not sure what it is about this movie, but it's just an easy, fun watch.  Jamie Lee Curtis is a seasoned actress, and Lindsey Lohan had finally built enough experience to be reliable in this role where she's basically doing an impression of Jamie Lee Curtis being her mom.  I'm not a huge fan of either one, but I'm not going to deny their acting ""chops"" and they bring it here, giving the audience a natural and fun atmosphere to the dilemma.

There are several very good improvements on original movie in this: cutting a lot of the thought narrative, adding a medium for the swap magic, having them wake up different instead of insta-switching, and several of the added plot lines really help fill out the world better.  A career woman is more interesting to follow than a housewife (not that it's necessarily more important), the romance line(s) in this are surprising and slightly less creepy, and swapping a sports game out for musical show not only allowed for the cross competition between character events, but also allows for some great alt rock music throughout the movie: I'll admit to enjoying a movie more when I can relate to the music better.

There are several good supporting actors (big and small), to include the Chinese restaurant family which, I think is a very nice cherry on top of the story.  By having the source of the magic be an outside party, I think it helps the complexity of the story without causing confusion.

It's a fun watch, give it a go. || Unlike with <em>'The Parent Trap'</em> films, there is a fair gap in favour of the original for <em>'Freaky Friday'</em>.

This 2003 remake is still very good, I definitely enjoyed it. It just feels a little hollow in some areas, at least until the sweet ending. Lindsay Lohan is great as the daughter, giving Jodie Foster a solid match. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a fairly strong performance, though Barbara Harris' portrayal of the mother is superior in my opinion.

There's fun to be had here for sure, it's just not on the same level as the excellent original for me."

S.W.A.T. is neither here nor there, in that if it was made ten years earlier it would in all probability be better thought of. The problem is that there is such a long line of action movies that entertain without pushing the boat out, some, like S.W.A.T., throw a good cast list at it and hope that carries the film through, others just go over the top with the pyrotechnics and think that is job done. Abandon hope of something fresh and exhilaratingly kinetic and S.W.A.T. passes muster.

The plot of S.W.A.T. basically sees Samuel L. Jackson put in charge of a crack team of five cops with attitude and guts. Their main mission, after all the training and baring out of character's respective traits and psychological make-ups, is to ensure an imprisoned drug kingpin doesn't get broken out of jail after said scum-bag offers a huge cash reward to anyone that can break him out of said police custody. Cue crash, bangs, double-crosses and a face from the past coming back into the picture after being telegraphed by an incident that opens the film.

Along with Sam are Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt. Oliver Martinez slips into the slimy villain shoes and Jeremy Renner does another one of his unhinged characterisations. Director Clark Johnson never breaks free of his TV roots, because the film often feels like a glorified TV episode, but his action construction is competent and he has decent actors to keep the film from sinking down among the dead men. Competent is the key word here, it's a decent time waster for the action movie fan, but really it feels like the action movie hadn't advanced much from the previous decade. A shame because there was much potential in the story. 6/10"

Rather, there are symbolic allusions, for example, just when the Cicillio saint declares himself a man without faith for momentarily failing with the sparrows, the young man, visibly bored, asks permission to play hopscotch , a popularly legendary allusion that implies Dante (who is supposed to represent all human beings in his Divine Comedy) coming out of Purgatory, and facing his fate he had to jump those nine circles, the stone would be the soul). Of course, the crux of these hermeneutic traditions and biblical passages continues here, in this argument, but not following a horizon of interpretation of them as symbolic, indisputable Truths, but rather as small truths, with tiny letters, daily truths, loving and painful, other sad times of God, love, Death, like when the youngster urges his father with questions, and he stops breathing and then, what comes next?The holy Ciccillo announces ""Ho trovato"", just as the young man jumps but his hopes will not be realized. In the background, Toto himself, who urges to receive his payment for land, is also cornered by other larger land owners. The metaphors of the streets named after people who fled the place, the war aggressions for the lands and the ownership of them with power, as well as the fate of the crow devoured by the ""harmless"" occasional singers of Carmela, Carmelina, are clear signs of a disenchanted Pasolini, of both spiritual and political pessimism; the crow was right, regardless of a humanity that does not know where it is going, they will not listen to those who propose the course either, said the voice on the left in the raven"

There is an intensity about Colman here - his eyes, menacing; his almost schizophrenic character genuinely quite scary at times, and his Shakespearian on-stage effort decent - if not exactly Olivier - when required. All of this, coupled with strong contributions from Hasso and his friend ""Bill"" (Edmond O'Brien), who ends up perilously close to getting of the blame for the worst of his Colman's excesses, make for a compelling, expertly shot, story of split-personality gone, quite literally, mad!

Enrique Irazoqui is undoubtedly a beautiful man to look at, but unlike in so many more commercial iterations of this story, his character is portrayed as a strong, demanding and forceful personality. His sermons are powerful instructions to, even condemnations of, the populace. Certainly there is love, but it is a tough love which only evolves as the story does. This characterisation is also surprisingly political. I wouldn't say he is simply to the left or to the right, as we might consider politics nowadays, but he definitely has strong views on corruption, of the venality of society and of the need to care for and to be cared for by each other. The delivery of this potent message hits the mark well. The dialogue is actually quite sparing, much of the audio comes from a mixture of classical music (Bach and Mozart feature prominently) along with themes than sound more African in origin. The photography is intense, no other word for it. The grand scale cinematography well complimented by the close, intimate imagery of the faces of the cast as the story unfolds in an unashamedly emotional (but not sentimental) fashion.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || ***Worthy new millennium entry in the Friday & Nightmare franchises, until they clash, that is***

To be expected, 2003's ""Freddy vs. Jason"" mixes together elements of the ""Nightmare"" and ""Friday"" franchises. Both franchises had essentially ran out of gas in the early 90s -- the last conventional ""Friday"" movie, before 2001's ""Jason X,"" came out a decade earlier and the last ""Nightmare"" movie almost as long. So mixing up the formats was a great way to introduce these modern monsters to a new generation as well as re-introduce them to the old.

THE PLOT: Freddy Krueger, the wicked spirit of a child molester/serial killer, is trapped in hell and unable to wreak havoc on the youths of Springwood, Ohio, because they have forgotten him and therefore no longer believe. Krueger's diabolical plan is to lure Jason from Crystal Lake, NJ, to Springwood and inspire him to go on a killing spree, which would naturally be blamed on Kruger, thus giving him the power to return.

Some say ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is more of a ""Nightmare"" film than a ""Friday"" film, and I can see why, but it's really an equal parts crossover. Once Jason is led to Springwood it essentially becomes a ""Nightmare"" movie with Jason as the antagonist until Freddy gains enough power; by that time the story switches to Crystal Lake for the finale and even provides an insightful flashback (via a dream sequence) of Jason's youth and abuse.

One of the highlights takes place early in the second act: Jason's flaming attack at a teen party in a cornfield; it's a dynamic sequence and features great opticals.

As with all the Friday films, ""FvJ"" features a nice assortment of women, beginning with the cameo of Heather (Odessa Munroe) in the opening reel. She's pretty much on par with the cameo of Agent Marcus (Julie Michaels) at the beginning of ""Jason Goes to Hell."" From there we have cutie Katharine Isabelle as a secondary protagonist and Monica Keena as the heroine. It took me about half the movie to warm up to Monica but she ultimately won me over.

""Freddy vs. Jason"" is a noticeably more technically sophisticated than the first nine ""Friday"" movies. Don't get me wrong, it's very cartoony and hardly scary (except for jump scares and gore), but it LOOKS so much better and has more oomph. The story’s also way more involved than the first eight entries and “Jason X,” which makes the film play better on repeat viewings.

The fight between the two monsters in the closing act is a cinematic tradition going back earlier than 1945's ""The Wolf Man vs. Dracula"" (aka ""House of Dracula""), but it's the weak point of the movie for me because it's just too cartoony. The film works as horror with either Jason or Freddy attacking the youths, but when they finally clash in the action-packed climax it's just too comic booky.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot mostly in British Columbia, Canada (e.g. Buntzen Lake, Anmore), but also Toronto.

It's purely my own opinion of course, but Open Range is a modern day genre classic that stands up to repeat viewings.

It's story is of course a simply structured tale of the underdog rising up against the fat cats who want it all in the name of tyranny. But on its side is the fact that its characters are so interestingly engaging. Within a short time frame I feel that Kevin Costner manages to put us in the saddle with the main protagonists, we understand these guys without actually knowing them, and that is quite an achievement I feel. The film does flesh them out to enhance the film without boring the pants off the viewer, and it's only come the final reel that you realise you have been engaged in a very human and honest Western film.

Most of the cast do great here, both Robert Duvall & Kevin Costner bounce of each other with moody and world wise aplomb as the two main leads, while in the sole female role of note, Annette Bening is gusto beautiful personified. Sadly it's hard for me to write that Michael Gambon as the villain of the piece is not only underused, but also something of a let down. Such an accomplished actor should know better than to overdo it in the context of this particular story. Yes we get the need for villainy, but gurning and frothing doesn't quite make the grade here. It's a little surprising that director Costner didn't utilise Gambon more wisely.

Still, I say the film is a wondrous experience because it is, a film to have you cheering and booing in equal measure, and in the main the work on it is top dollar. Some of the shots are gorgeous, the framing that Costner uses in close ups is excellent, and the final reel shoot out ranks as one of the best in Western genre history. So all in all it's a modern day genre piece that actually sits nicely with the best from the golden era. 9/10 || I ain't going to meet my maker without knowing your real name.

The film does flesh them out to enhance the film without boring the pants off the viewer, and it's only come the final reel that you realise you have been engaged in a very human and honest Western film.

Most of the cast do great here, both Robert Duvall & Kevin Costner bounce of each other with moody and world wise aplomb as the two main leads, while in the sole female role of note, Annette Bening is gusto beautiful personified. Sadly it's hard for me to write that Michael Gambon as the villain of the piece is not only underused, but also something of a let down. Such an accomplished actor should know better than to overdo it in the context of this particular story. Yes we get the need for villainy, but gurning and frothing doesn't quite make the grade here. It's a little surprising that director Costner didn't utilise Gambon more wisely.

Still, I say the film is a wondrous experience because it is, a film to have you cheering and booing in equal measure, and in the main the work on it is top dollar. Some of the shots are gorgeous, the framing that Costner uses in close ups is excellent, and the final reel shoot-out ranks as one of the best in Western genre history. So all in all it's a modern day genre piece that actually sits nicely with the best from the golden era. 9/10 || **_Now THIS is a Western_**

Four cowboys & their cattle are traveling through the Hammondville, Montana, region in 1882 when they discover that the leaders of the town don’t like free grazers. It escalates into a life or death situation. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner play the two main cowboys while Annette Bening appears as a doctor and Michael Gambon a land baron.

“Open Range” (2003) automatically brings to mind “Dances With Wolves” (1990) because they’re the only two Westerns Costner has both starred in and directed. While not quite as good, this one is still a great modern Western and nigh epic. The theme revolves around how noble Westerners like the protagonists don't seek violence, but it's sometimes necessary to make a stand for justice, even if the local law is bought and corrupt.

I like the way the movie confidently takes its time and fleshes out the characters with insightful bits here and there. It feels like the way it was in the Old West and the characters speak the way you know they spoke back then. The mood is increasingly tense, but most of the action is saved for the last act when everything explodes, reminiscent of the real-life gunfight at the O.K. Corral, just longer. As such, viewers who need quick-editing and constant thrills to be entertained will likely find it boring. Mature-minded viewers, however, will appreciate the realism and the slowly developed characters, as well as the well-done romance angle.

The big rancher is pompous because his arrogance has built up over the course of decades and he thinks he owns the town. But does he? In his own mind he’s King Sheet because he’s gotten away with injustice due to his power and influence. But what happens when noble citizens say “Enough”?

While “Open Range” deals with dark, challenging things, it has a warm, redeemable heart, unlike “Unforgiven” (1992), which wallows in ugliness (although it’s still a worthy Western, as long as you can stomach the ugliness).          

The film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot at Stoney Indian Reserve in Alberta, Canada.

RELEASED IN 2003 and directed by Boaz Yakin, ""Uptown Girls"" is a dramedy with a little romance about Molly (Brittany Murphy), a fun-loving 22 year-old who suddenly loses her inherited riches and is forced to become a nanny to a stoical neat-freak girl, Ray (Dakota Fanning). Heather Locklear plays Ray’s distant mother who’s an exec in the music biz while Jesse Spencer plays a hunky musician who gets signed. Marley Shelton and Donald Faison are on hand as friends of Molly. 

The first act didn’t do much for me, but at the halfway point something made me bust out laughing and I busted out four more times before it was over. More importantly, the movie is rich with quality mind/spirit food. Both Molly and Ray are broken people who handle their grief in opposite ways. And each has what the other needs to heal and escape their disorder.

“Uptown Girls” boldly reveals that “meds” (drugs) cannot heal or deliver a person; the best they can do is help a person cope. In fact, they usually have negative side-effects, mentally and physically. Sadly, six years after the release of the film Murphy ironically died of cardiac arrest due to inadvertent overdoses of a mixture of over-the-counter & prescription drugs taken (they presume) for a respiratory infection. She was only 32.

The flick encourages growing up and achieving true success through (1.) recognizing “golden connections” and taking advantage of them (after all, no one makes it alone, no one; they had help); and (2.) discerning and cultivating one’s special talent(s). I’d say more, but it’s better to see the movie, enjoy it, and quarry the gems for oneself.                                     

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 32 minutes and was shot in New York City (Manhattan & Brooklyn with studio work done in Queens). WRITERS: Julia Dahl, Mo Ogrodnik & Lisa Davidowitz wrote the script based on Allison Jacobs’ story.

An upstart skiing ace (Patrick Houser) travels to Squaw Valley in northeast California to compete, including facing off with the pompous Austrian world champion (John Patrick Reger). On the way, he picks up a comely female hitchhiker (Tracy Smith), but is eventually awestruck by a statuesque blonde at the resort (Shannon Tweed). David Naughton is on hand as a charismatic veteran who befriends the newbie.

""Hot Dog …the Movie"" (1983) is, thankfully, not an all-out comedy, but is more of an energetic drama/sports flick with amusing bits meshed with some softcore nudity and sex scenes. The latter is likely due to the success of “Porky’s” from two years prior and is reminiscent of the soon-to-come “Two Moon Junction.” 

The nudity is displayed early-on with the curiously naked motel clerk (Crystal Smith), which diminishes realism. If you can roll with that, this is an entertaining flick with great skiing action, superb alpine cinematography and a dynamic early 80’s soundtrack, just don’t expect the greatness of the grim “Downhill Racer” (1969). ""Aspen Extreme"" came out ten years later and isn’t as entertaining, but it’s the better movie, marginally. This one’s a tad too sleazy for my tastes.

Tracy Smith is a highlight in the feminine department, as is Victoria Rae Walker as the beer-chugging contestant and girl-in-the-gondola.

The movie runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot at Squaw Valley and Sierraville in northern California, just northwest of Lake Tahoe. The Squaw Valley ski resort changed its name to Palisades Tahoe in 2021 and the corresponding city changed its name to Olympic Valley in 2022.

As much as I thought I would enjoy getting in the way back machine to see Christopher Lloyd getting up to whacky antics, this was disappointing.

It's a bunch of rich, spoiled kids tricking their parents into paying for what they is a way to get rid of their kids for the summer, and the kids basically creating a criminal ring to facilitate it.

I see a lot similarities between this and ""Accepted"", but where ""Accepted"" was built with better intentions by the characters who were adults that ended up dealing with a situation and turning it to be an attempt at betterment, ""Camp Nowhere"" grew the conspirators first and then committed to a fake camp.

This movie just doesn't have the fun charm that its future counterpart has, and that can probably be attributed to the child actors involved.  They're not all so bad, but they're mostly typical child actors.

Sure there are some fun moments in this, but the overall story is severely lacking, and we don't need a fable to tell that this kid is going to be sorry and that he was wrong at the end of it."

Henry Jarrod is a very talented sculptor of wax figures for a museum. But as the museum starts to flounder, Jarrod's partner, Matthew Burke, insists on taking a new direction, a row ensues and Jarrod is knocked unconscious. Burke seizes the opportunity to torch the museum and get the insurance money, with Jarrod still in the premises. Thought long since dead, Jarrod resurfaces, apparently wheel chair bound and with horribly burned hands. Opening up a new museum, his new figures (made by his protégé under his instruction) look ever more lifelike than before, could he be responsible for some despicable crimes in the area?

This marvellous film is a remake of the 1933 chiller, The Mystery Of The Wax Museum, directed by Michael Curtiz. Here this film is taken on by Andre de Toth, originally filmed in 3-D with the then bonus addition of Warner Phonic Sound, it's a picture that thankfully holds up real well even in its basic flat format. The reason it does hold up well is because director de Toth didn't get carried away with the gimmick, it's used sparingly so the narrative never gets lost amongst any trickery, and thus House Of Wax's excellently creepy story comes to the fore.

Having the ever supreme Vincent Price as your leading man (Jarrod) will always help your horror genre picture, and here he two folds the performance brilliantly. At first his Jarrod is charming and carrying a grace about his dedication to his craft, but then, devilment takes control as Price pumps creepy ardour into Jarrod's fractured mind. Quite a turn from Price who most definitely suffered for his art during the shoot, forced to do his own stunts (the 3D process needs more than one camera), he was involved in an accident that set him on fire and almost saw him crushed!Then there was the long and often painful make up sessions to get the desired effects of a burns victim, layers of rubber strangling his skin to the point of passing out, oh yes Vincent earned his money on this one!

We even get one of the earliest credited performances from Charles Bronson (here under his real name of Buchinsky) as Jarrod's assistant Igor, whilst fans of The Addams Family TV series will no doubt enjoy the performance of future Mortica, Carolyn Jones. The film was a big success on its release, and hugely popular with critics, and it's not hard to see why, because today it still stands proud as one of the finest exponents of classic horror, both as a story and as a technical construction. 9/10"

Honestly, all of that is a side-show to the actual story and had it been six different actors the film would be unaffected.

The humour is that of a gentle farce and personally it caused little more than a wry smile for me. I realise it's ""of it's time"", but even for the late '40s I think it's pedestrian."

The 50s ream of sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features are, depending on your persuasion, either genius fun or tacky nuisances. Since I belong to the first group, Tremors is possibly one of the finest homages to a most wonderful time in cinema. What is often ignored is that those 50s film's deal with the paranoia of the time, with nuclear testing and a wondering appertaining to Roswell like alien visits being very prominent in honest Joe's thoughts. So it be that Tremors is ideally set out in the desert, a place from where all manner of terrifying things have come forward to announce a threat to the American way of life.

We are in the small town of Perfection, a place that may be small on residents, but very much large on character. We have dim wits, annoying kid, cutesy single mom types, Mr and Mrs Rambo and courtesy of Finn Carter's seismologist Rhonda LeBeck, a romantic and charmingly fun filled thread.

The creatures are well designed and prove to be a scary and enjoyable foe, whilst the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California location is perfectly utilised by cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski. Directed by Ron Underwood on his feature film debut, Tremors also sees Reba McEntire, Michael Gross and Victor Wong also along for this fun packed ride. 8/10 || _**Underground monstrosities in the desert prey on the folks of a remote town**_ 

Two handymen working in a Southwest town (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward) team-up with a seismologist (Finn Carter) and the townspeople (e.g. Michael Gross & Reba McEntire) to take on huge creatures that live underground and like to eat people. 	 

“Tremors” (1990) is a desert creature feature similar to “Gargoyles” (1972), but with a less grave tone; there’s a somewhat light air, but it’s not a comedy. The cast is spirited and likable while the creatures are inventive and interesting. Unfortunately, they’re also unbelievable since the hard desert ground would have to have the texture of thick mud for these behemoths to so easily travel through. 

If you can overlook this, however, it’s a fun monster flick with magnificent desert cinematography. Yet it’s nothing more than that and so plays tediously on repeat viewings. “Gargoyles” is all-around superior because it’s more cryptic, grave and streamlined.    

Finn Carter is a highlight in a girl-next-door kind of way, particularly her brief de-panted scene (lol). Meanwhile Gross is reminiscent of Dennis Weaver while McEntire is a natural as the gun-toting hick woman.

The film performed modestly at the box office, but eventually became a cult hit, followed by several sequels.   

It runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Olancha & Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California. 

GRADE: B- || ""Tremors"" joins ""Gremlins"" as one of a handful of family friendly creature features. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have great chemistry as two bickering handymen in Perfection Nevada, population 14 when an invasion of subterranean ""graboids' (I know, I know ... that sounds ridiculous, but in the context of the movie it clicks).

19542.0,The Red Shoes,"In this classic drama, Vicky Page is an aspiring ballerina torn between her dedication to dance and her desire to love.

She is the aspiring ballet dancer ""Victoria"" who must train under the positively brutal rule of acclaimed tutor ""Lermontov"" (Anton Walbrook). This maestro, however, expects undiluted devotion and so when this young woman also falls in love - with composer ""Craster"" (Marius Goring) she finds herself out of favour. Facing the toughest of choices, she chooses love - but even married, she is still torn. When she returns a few years later to visit - her new husband having now completed the eponymous ballet - the imposing ""Lermontov"" proves he can still pull her strings and she faces an heart-rending choice. P&P have created a masterpiece of rich and colourful cinema. They have turned a relatively simple Hans Christian Anderson story into a maelstrom of love, ambition, power, control - you name it, it features here somewhere. Emotions run high, cruelty runs rife and all under the baton of Brian Easdale who has created his own ""Ballet of the Red Shoes"" score. Both Walbrook and Goring were underestimated actors, in my view. They had an adaptability that demonstrated a surety of foot as their characters illustrate traits that at best celebrate humanity, at worst denigrate it badly. The dancing is frequently mesmerising with the media of theatre and cinema merged seamlessly to give us a really breathtaking experience. I felt vested in the fate of this young woman, I felt vested in the nasty Lermontov - which would I have chosen? This is a great film, marrying the vivid imagination of a timeless creative source with a visionary and highly entertaining ensemble adaptation. Recently staged by the Sadler's Wells Company of Sir Matthew Bourne, but good as that was - this still knocked spots off it."

He's a social sophisticate who is invited to the grandest of soirées and where there is always a jewel robbery.

""Clouseau"" thinks it's bound to be stolen, as does just about everyone else but the arrival of nephew ""George"" (Robert Wagner) puts a spanner in the works of ""Lytton"" and what now ensues is quite a good laugh. Niven and Cardinale just ooze charisma here, with both gelling well and easily exuding a sense that this alpine luxury is exactly where they belong. The audience knows a few things about ""Mrs Clouseau"" that her husband doesn't, and that adds quite nicely to the not so mysterious mystery and to the rather quirky ending. I think this is my favourite of the outings for Sellers with this character. It's his most natural performance and his role isn't top-billed, he's more a part of the mechanics of a film that marries quite a few themes together and allows everyone to have their ""007"" meets ""To Catch a Thief"" moment in the snow. Some of the scenes - especially in the hotel room with the folks hiding under the bed - do go on too long, but there's still enough innate comedy timing from just about everyone to take this oft-told story and make it worth rehashing. Keep an eye out for the over-the-top Brenda de Banzie, too! Good fun."

As much James Bond film as Pink Panther movie, this 1976 entry begins with _former_ Chief Inspector Dreyfus, (Herbert Lom) about to be released from the lunatic asylum and all is going well - until _Chief Inspector_ Clouseau turns up...

Within minutes, the newly sane _former_ police commissioner Dreyfus is reduced to a _gibbering maniac_ - hell bent on destroying the world unless the authorities deliver Clouseau to him.


The following 90 minutes consist of an inflatable Quasimodo hovering above Notre Dame cathedral, an absurd fight with an 'oriental lunatic', assassin wars at the Oktoberfest, a dentist with a plastic nose and the destruction of the United Nations building.

Sellers and director Blake Edwards did everything right here. With a script this insane - they couldn't really go wrong. || Imagine poor old ""Dreyfus"" (Herbert Lom). Once the proud chief detective of the Sûreté now reduced to trying to convince his psychiatrist that he is over his kill-Clouseau phase and is ready to resume his place in society. Guess who turns up to wish him well at his hearing in front of the sanity commission...? Oops! Back to square one. Scoot on a bit and ""Dreyfus"" is now so obsessed with revenge that he has assembled a gathering of criminal minds that would make ""Spectre"" looks like the boy scouts. He issues the world with an ultimatum. Deliver ""Clouseau"" or face the imminent destruction of the globe! Meantime, the hapless sleuth (Peter Sellers) has decided that he will put himself on the trail of his nemesis whilst trying to avoid some of the twenty-odd assassins out to get him and his own, trained-to-kill manservant ""Cato"" (Burt Kwouk). Lom is on great form here as the maniacal character bent on getting his pound of flesh, and as Sellers wanders about leaving comedic mayhem in his path, I was with very much with him! By now, this character is established and we know what to expect with the silly accent, slapstick antics and the incompetent bumblings gently entertaining as the soundtrack and the narrative takes a pop at a few other stories (and even director Blake Edwards' wife) as it moves along. I would have preferred a different conclusion, but I suppose that was never to be in a world where a bum actually explodes and a game of croquet can lead to concussion and near drowning. It's almost as good as the first film, and shows an ability amongst everyone here to be funny without over complicating things."

To find her, Matrix has to fight his way through an array of punks, killers, one of his former commandos, and a fully equipped private army.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || I eat Green Berets for breakfast. And right now, I'm very hungry! 

Commando is directed by Mark L. Lester and written by Jeph Loeb, Matthew Weisman and Steven E. de Souza. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rae Dawn Chong, Dan Hedaya, Vernon Wells, James Olson, David Patrick Kelly, Alyssa Milano and Bill Duke. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.   

John Matrix (Schwarzenegger) is the former leader of a special commando strike force that always got the toughest jobs done. He is forced back into action when his young daughter (Milano) is kidnapped by kingpin criminal Arius (Hedaya) and his gang of thugs. They want Matrix to carry out an assassination, but all Matrix has on his mind is to save his daughter - he has half a day to do so before the thugs will kill her - so it's now a private war...

After playing ""Conan"" and ""The Terminator"", Schwarzenegger slipped into a role that would prove to carry all the hallmarks of the big man's action movie career. Commando is awash with outrageous action, pure carnage and gruesome deaths, plenty of quippy one liners, and of course over the top villains. 

Clocking in at just 90 minutes in length, it's the perfect ""leave the brain at the door"" popcorn crowd pleaser. Chong gets a well written lead lady part, giving us a spunky heroine who evolves as the plot grows ever more chaotic, and young Milano gets to play a resourceful child character.

High art it is not, but who cares if you want to just watch Arnie waylay a whole army on his own. Great fun. 7/10"
