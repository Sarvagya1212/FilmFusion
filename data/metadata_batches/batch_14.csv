A movies as they used to be when interesting thrillers were on the screens with higher frequency. || This movie follows a familiar subset of the thriller genre, that of the journalist investigating a story and discovering there is more involved than what meets the eye, and before he knows it there is evidence of a conspiracy stretching high into government. How high? Well, that of course varies from one conspiracy movie to the next.

I couldn’t help but notice that one of the methods of death early on here was later borrowed by the series House of Cards (U.S. version). But there are only so many ways of making possible murders look like accidents or suicides, so perhaps it was coincidental. The acting and the writing were fine, however familiar the story seemed. It just felt like it wouldn’t have taken much originality to alter the plot to separate it from all the other journalistic investigations of government corruption."

Are you now or have you ever been a Norse God, Vampire, or Time Traveling Cyborg?

Another in what is a long line of body swap comedies, 17 Again is fun, frothy and full of warmth; just like all the other ones really! There's nothing new here, it's the same old format as a grown up Mike O'Donnell (Matthew Perry) rues how his life has grown to miserable proportions but magically gets to be a high-schooler again and grasp that second chance. Back in his 17 year old bod (Zac Efron looking like a young Rob Lowe), Mike oversees the trials and tribulations of his two kids who attend the same school, whilst also forming a ""special"" bond with his future wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann) who is going to divorce him! Cue much high-school pranks, perils and near misses and a few worthy messages in the narrative.

Tailored towards a certain demographic with the casting of Efron, who is very likable and a worthy lead here, the film thankfully doesn't lack for good performances elsewhere. Both Mann and Melora Hardin as the hot principal make their roles stand out, while Thomas Lennon as Mike's uber rich man child buddy steals the movie. It's rich in clichés of the formula and the predictability of outcome robs us of a surprise, but these are not actually irritants, for this is a very enjoyable movie. One where the teens hot for Zac can stare lovingly, and one where the adults can nod in knowing agreement at some plot dynamics. 7/10 || Just watched it just so I can say I watched it. It turned out to be funny and liked the story similar to 13 going on 30. || **_A high school dramedy/body swap flick with heart_**

A dispirited 37 year-old man (Matthew Perry) is about to lose his wife and high school sweetheart. Through a ""spirit-guide"" (Brian Doyle-Murray) he is miraculously able to become, you guessed it, 17 again. His younger self is played by Zac Efron, who's actually the star of the movie. Leslie Mann plays his soon-to-be former wife while Thomas Lennon appears as his geeky best friend. Sterling Knight & Michelle Trachtenberg are on hand as his kids struggling through the teen years. Melora Hardin plays the attractive principal while Nicole Sullivan has a glorified cameo.

""17 Again"" (2009) is magic from beginning to end, with few missteps. It's both a high school dramedy and a second chance fantasy. There are elements of films like ""Back to the Future"" (1986) and ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986), but the uniqueness here is that the protagonist doesn't go back in time, but rather stays in the current day and appears to his family & friends as 17 years-old, even though he's really 37. With one exception, no one knows who he really is.

Efron, who was only 21 during filming, easily carries the film while Mann is one of the most winsome women to walk the Earth. Lennon's amusing character is akin to the Big Bang Theory guys. Best of all, the film has heart, effectively conveying the triumphs and tragedies of the high school experience in all its glory and awkwardness. I know it's clichéd, but ""you'll laugh, you'll cry.""

The movie runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in Santa Monica (Hayden High School), Van Nuys & Los Angeles, California. The script was written by Jason Filardi.

Hunger for power, incompetence, lack of respect for others, and betrayal are on full display. The movie had no problem keeping my interest, though it did lose my respect at times. The characters came across to me as fairly two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, and I was a little surprised to find they were exc=aptly the same way at the end. Maybe character growth is not needed in comedy, but a little more depth would have been great.

I thought Gandolfini, Gina McKey and Mimi Kennedy came the closest to making their candidates real, but ultimately the script let them down. The Malcolm character was there at every turn to shout them down. The constant use of curse words reveals a lack of imagination, a lazy writer’s way of trying to titillate the audience. But when you hear the f-bomb every fifteen seconds, it loses all its shock value and exposes that lazy writing.

So while the movie never lost me, it never really captured me either. I was just along for the ride. || Peter Capaldi seems to be in his element as the foul-mouthed political aide ""Tucker"" in this look at just whether it's the tail that does the political wagging of the dog. He has it in for the British International Development Secretary ""Foster"" (Tom Hollander) who finds an off the cuff quote during a radio interview plunges him into a debate on both sides of the Atlantic about a potential war scenario. ""Tucker"" thinks he can just railroad his opinion through by sheer force of nature and excessive Anglo-Saxon peppered invective, but the American side of this are a bit more subtle - and ""Gen.  Miller"" (James Gandolfini) and State Department deputy under secretary for countries beginning with the letter C - ""Karen Clark"" (Mimi Kennedy) take ""Foster"" at face value and what follows in now a quickly paced game of manipulation, duplicity and spookily ambitious interns. At times this quite potently mixes the scenarios of a ""Yes, Minister"" edition with the writing sharpness of the ""West Wing"" but for the most part I just found it all a bit too repetitious and vulgar. I think ""Judy"" (Gina McKee) would have been perfectly justified attacking ""Tucker"" with a rusty stapler and after about fifteen minutes I began to wonder why she didn't. It's his unfettered obnoxiousness that robs the thing of even the faintest sense of realism. The aforementioned television series worked because the roots of their humour were based in something plausible, the humour was a little more sophisticated and the characters not so crass. Hollander does well though, the mouse minister who fills a chair with little ideology one way or the other, as does Chris Addison as the weathervane analyst ""Toby"" who really has mastered the art of straddling the proverbial fence with aplomb. For me, though, sorry - this lacks any form of class with the quickly paced but far too abrasive and unconvincing a lead character. It was made at a time when the chief of staff role to the British Prime Minister was under a bit of a spotlight, so it's an easy target for Ianucci to throw stones at - I just like my comedy a little more thoughtful and a little less custard pie."
16869.0,Inglourious Basterds,"In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as ""The Basterds"" are chosen specifically to spread fear throughout the Third Reich by scalping and brutally killing Nazis.

Aldo Raine soon cross paths with a French-Jewish teenage girl who runs a movie theater in Paris which is targeted by the soldiers.",Once upon a time in Nazi occupied France...,"Drama, Thriller, War",153.0,2009-08-02,en,8.213,22993.0,16.6674,"Brad Pitt, Mélanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender","Quentin Tarantino, Quentin Tarantino","guerrilla warfare, swastika, paris, france, nazi, self sacrifice, sadism, dynamite, mexican standoff, world war ii, jew persecution, masochism, antisemitism, german occupation of france, british politics, revisionist history, candid, adolf hitler, amused, dubious","**_Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure_**

RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Inglourious Basterds"" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless “Jew Hunter” Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.

This was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch ""Basterds"" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.

I eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the ""interminable dialogue"" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.

There ARE elements that bring to mind ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but ""Basterds"" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.

All effective films have quality characters and ""Basterds"" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.

Like Tarantino’s other great movies (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “Jackie Brown”), ""Basterds"" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic ""blockbuster"" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they’re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer’s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it’s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.

THE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.

GRADE: A- || Second time seeing this since it was released on Blu-ray in 2009 and still is a solid war-thriller with Tarantino's flair with dialogue and of course, feet. But seriously, despite being 2.5 hours, the time flew by thanks to the brisk pace and great performances from all around. Not my favorite Tarantino film but it's up there. **4.5/5** || It's obviously Tarantino, creating tension with long dialogues and containing short bursts of violence, although some scenes could have been shortened or omitted. Great to see the lineup of French and German actors, where the terrific Waltz takes the cake.

We're people, do you understand?

Directed by Duncan Jones and starring Sam Rockwell, Moon finds Rockwell as Sam Bell who is coming to the end of his three year contract on a lunar station working for Lunar Industries. His only companion is an intelligent computer named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). When Sam has an accident he awakens to find he is now not alone and all he thought and believed in is just not as it seems.

Forget any fears about a low budget and any plot similarity to 2001: A Space Odyssey, for this is a cracker jack of a science fiction picture. Film quickly fills us in on Sam Bell the man and his function up there on the lunar station. His relationship with GERTY the computer grabs our interest whilst the production design has a sort of medicinal sheen to it. Once Sam's solitude is established, the minimal contact with Earth explained, the pic then spins into another dimension, dragging both Sam and us viewers into the vortex.

To say more would be churlish, but this is adult science fiction, clever in existential whiles and scathing with observations on corporate shenanigans. Narratively it's evocative in its telling, even haunting and philosophical, where a brilliant Rockwell nails every inch of Bell's search for being, and crucially, the truth. It's all building towards a finale of some devilish substance, no cop outs or easy fed answers, just a pertinent question asked of the viewers. Moon comes highly recommended to sci-fi fans who are after a bit more than mere sparkly fluff and robotic chaos. 9/10 || Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.

Sam Rockwell no only carries the movie, but he's literally the only person in the movie that isn't on a screen.

He plays off himself amazingly well and really balances the struggles of both the individual and the clone to clone interaction.  The struggle feels like how someone would react to the situation, and Rockwell adds his own special flair to it.

The setting of Luna is amazing, granted it's mostly in the small station, but it makes me jealous that we haven't established moon colonies.  Space madness might be a real thing, but it is because someone is alone and not part of a group.

I want more movies like this for every reason: more Sam Rockwell, more Luna settings, more clone movies, more isolation theory, more, ""OMG, MY ENTIRE LIFE IS A LIE, WHAT IS HAPPENING!"". || A quiet, psychological sci-fi thriller with a grim atmosphere, ‘Moon’ is carried by a greatly nuanced performance by Rockwell.

Makes sense now why many scenes feel rushed or incomplete, most of the effects look half rendered, and ""Deadpool"" looked like an absolute disaster.

And yet, oddly enough, it's not the worse film in the X-Men franchise. It just sets the bar exceedingly low. || Just about passable.

I never felt bored while watching <em>'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'</em>, which is why I can't give it a lower rating. The action is well done and it gives the satisfactory amount of enjoyment, shame the CGI isn't quite up to scratch though. As with the preceding three <em>'X-Men'</em> releases, I really do enjoy watching Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - he is certainly the best thing about these films.

With all that noted, the film does definitely have issues. I didn't overly like the new characters and the plot didn't truly fulfil what I was expecting/wanting from an origin story, even if it is fairly fun to watch. Elsewhere, Ryan Reynolds is introduced as his well known character, I look forward to seeing more of him in the role - here, he's fine.

Four films in and there's a slow decline ongoing, hopefully <em>'X-Men: First Class'</em>* at least regains footing with the opening two productions. <em>*I'm watching these in release order.</em>

I did like _Star Trek_. I did not, however, appear to like it as much as the rest of the whole damn planet.

I appreciate the decent helping of Australian actors in the mix (like personal favourite Chris Hemsworth, above). I can get behind the colourful and impressive special effects spectacle. Most of all I dig the reboot angle they pulled. The whole time travel/tangent universe thing is the perfect breeding of remaining true to the original, while still not constricting themselves to the old canon. Fantastic idea.

But I didn’t love it. I’m a big fan of origin stories, but I personally feel that _Star Trek_ never really breached past that point. The first half was brilliant, getting to know the characters, the world, the ideals, everything. But in the latter half it seems they just sort of went “Well, we spent a bunch of time doing stuff good, but now we don’t have enough time left to make an actual movie out of this… Oh well, just chuck an hour of lasers in there and we’ll worry about that next film!” which just isn’t good enough. When _Into Darkness_ comes out later this year, the format will probably pay off, but looking at the merits of Star Trek alone, I think it fell short.

Simon Pegg (_Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead_) as the new Scotty and Zachary Quinto (_American Horror Story, Heroes_) as the new Spock were both solid choices, but other casting decisions like Winona Ryder (_Black Swan, Alien: Resurrection_) as Spock’s mother were an off-shot in the worst possible way.

I suppose though, in science fiction, it’s often safety first and little steps. As a member of what is probably the most frowned upon of the genres, I wish this Star Trek reboot all the best in its inevitable future, and it seems it will make good use of it. But for now, the solo film itself didn’t reach as far as I felt it could have with a little harder work towards the end.

_-Gimly_ || A franchise re-energised-big time! 
 
It's not an understatement to say that the news of a new Star Trek movie was met in equal measure by suspicion and pretty low expectations. Step forward J.J. Abrams to direct it, and many wondered while the guy behind TV series ""Lost"" and ""Mission Impossible III"" would want to dabble on hallowed sci-fi turf?. Things were further eyebrow raising when Abrams openly admitted to not having been a fan of the original show so cherished by a legion of Trekkies. Then news came of the film being a prequel, based around the Starfleet Academy and the coming together of what we know as the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. ""Ooh that will be a tough one to carry off"" said many, ""Kirk & Spock as young spunkers - surely not"" they said. Well not only did Abrams pull it off as it were, he simultaneously appeased most Trekkies whilst garnering a whole new generation of sci-fi observers. Budgeted at $140,000,000, Abrams Star Trek went on to gross Worldwide $384,953,778. Figures that, even allowing for the huge fan-base that the franchise has, show that many first timers not only went to see it - but also that they enjoyed it so much they went back for second helpings. I know I did.

The success of the film isn't hard to fathom, because although Abrams upped the action quota (with a number of breath taking and eye appealing sequences) he also dispensed with much of the sci-fi psycho babble that has blighted some of the previous filmic instalments in this most up and down of franchise's. Sure there's stuff in there for the discerning fan, with a time travelling revenge plot at its axis, how could there not be?, But Abrams and his writers (Roberto Orci /Alex Kurtzman) keep it simple, savvy and sexy. They smartly link to Trek lore with a crucial plot and character development featuring the Kobayashi Maru, while pain, emotional conflict and personal crisis all feature heavily. This is, one can ""logically"" say, a spiky post 9/11 Trek movie. There's even room for a romantic strand, a strand that is tender and fits the whole make-up of the piece perfectly. All of which only works because the cast are, in the main, producing great work.

Getting Leonard Nimoy to appear in a small, but crucial role, is nothing short of being a master-stroke. His presence keeps the all important essence of Star Trek within what is ultimately a reboot. It's like a father figure watching over proceedings, making not only the cast feel safe, but also us the viewers. The youngsters in the cast are impressive, Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock) and Zoe Saldaña (Uhura) lead from the fresh faced front. While Karl Urban (Bones McCoy) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) impact with comic relief that aids instead of hinders the plot developments. Villain duties falls to Eric Bana as Romulan Captain Nero, he's a touch miffed is Nero, and Bana brings the character's vengeful pain vividly to life. While Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike adds a touch of class that he almost always seems to do.

This U.S.S. Enterprise has launched itself in another direction, and yes, it's boldly going where no-one has boldly gone before. It is, all told, a bona fide blockbuster with brains and balls. The like of which has sadly been missing from many a modern era summer release. Yes it's not all perfect, the odd scene could quite easily have been jettisoned, and some accents need a bit of fine tuning, but they are very minor complaints. A triumph from Abrams and his team - note the Stardate in the ships log, for this is a noteworthy moment in modern sci-fi cinema. Now comes perhaps a bigger challenge, the notoriously difficult second film...  10/10 || I quite enjoyed this. It is a simple, end-to-end action adventure set in space. It doesn't attempt to moralise or philosophise, it is just an interstellar shoot 'em up. Chris Pine is pretty wooden, Zachary Quinto does a passable ""Mr. Spock"" and Anton Yeltsin seems to be having a good time trying to get the onboard computer to recognise his particularly thick ""Chekhov"" accent. Sadly Eric Bana completely lacks menace as ""Nero"" and Simon Pegg's ""Scotty"" is just plain irritating but the special effects are stunning.

Angels and Demons is directed by Ron Howard and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman from the Dan Brown novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller- Stahl. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.

Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is summoned to Rome and asked by the Vatican to help when four cardinals are kidnapped. Upon examining a tape recording that announces that the cardinals will be killed one at a time hourly, Langdon places the crime at the door of the ancient Illuminati. It's a race against time to not only try and save the lives of the cardinals, but also to avert the detonation of an anti-matter bomb which will destroy Vatican City. 

In spite of The Da Vinci Code making gargantuan amounts of cash, there were many who actively hated the movie. Yet this follow up from Howard and his makers still enticed just under $500 million's worth of worldwide paying punters into see it. Ultimately it's a very different movie to Da Vinci, where that film was sombre and talky, and had a great religious hook that caused tremors in Christianity, Angels and Demons is a pacey race against time serial killer thriller. Albeit one that is still religion based and additionally topped up with some sci-fi gubbins. 

The ticking time bomb format works well as a cliff hanger and the narrative allows Langdon and his latest lady investigator, CERN scientist Vittoria Vettra (Zurer), scope for no-nonsense detective work. There's a good solid mystery story at the heart, one which doesn't veer to being over complicated, and the production value is of a very high standard. Casting is first class, with McGregor and Skarsgard complimenting the reliable, and thankfully new haircut sporting, Hanks. It's a little draggy in the mid-section, as history comes crashing into the mix and the makers feel the need to be cerebral, and the finale is bizarre if wholly appropriate, but herein lies the problem 

If you can judge it on its own terms, not as a Dan Brown novel recreation and a link to bad memories of Da Vinci Code (not me, I liked it well enough actually)? Then it's a film of simple pleasures. If not then it kind of goes without saying that you probably already dislike the movie! 7.5/10"

Quickly, it falls to ""Daley"" and his assembled troop of recently transported, brave, exhibits to thwart this dastardly plan. To be fair, this film does move along well and has retained most of the cast from the first film - Robin Williams as the sagely Teddy Roosevelt and quite a dashing Rami Malek (""Ahkmenrah"") as well as adding an enthusiastic performance from Amy Adams as the trail-blazing Amelia Earhart. It's all just a bit overly-theatrical for me, though - especially the really hammy Hank Azaria who just seems to be trying to do his best Robert Downey Jr impersonation of the menacing Pharaoh. It's really just anther vehicle for Ben Stiller to do what he does best, and if that's what you like then there is nothing to disappoint here - he does all that he needs to.

It was nice to see the return of Kyle Reeese. It was a different look at a character that was forgotten to quickly. John Connor was a bit stale and I wanted way from his character. 

It was nice to see this future everyone spoke about in past films, Problem was this film felt darker than all the others, excluding T1. The first film was pretty dark but had a storyline And an R Rating to back that up. This film just didn't feel like it belonged to the Terminator world.

Soon, just about the entire town are captured in his web of mischief. Anyone who has read the play will appreciate that ""Puck"" is one of the best comic characters in English literature, and Cohen does a better than decent job at marrying the frustrations and naughtiness of the fairy into a 21st century environment.

As they move from Sicily on up the peninsula, we meet a population who have had different experiences of the war so far - some barely touched by it, some deeply so - and the US forces are not universally welcomed. I won't try to explain the plots of each of these episodes, but suffice to say that they each have a potency that demonstrates quite well the ravages of war on both the victors and the losers - and it's not always immediately clear whom is whom! My personal favourite involves a young, homeless and streetwise scrounger who takes advantage of a sozzled soldier only to end up back in his war-torn hometown where the seizure of a pair of boots is rather put into context. There's some philosophy here, too. The sense that all are united against a common enemy until the fractured nature of human nature re-emerges, and things like religion start to re-impose a sometimes quite questionable dogma on a previously conjoined family of beliefs and opinions is effectively presented. These are six mini-adventures. One or two of them may deal more with the romantic or personal aspects of war, but all are delivered under a fairly constant threat from bullets and bombs that culminates well with a scenario that sort of offers us the wartime equivalent of snagging! The last few pockets of resistance to the advancing forces proving dangerously effective and highly tenacious.

An ambitious loan officer at a bank in Los Angeles (Alison Lohman) wants an imminent promotion above her rival and so makes the “tough decisions” by refusing compassion to a desperate aged borrower. Big mistake. Justin Long is on hand as the young woman’s beau.

“Drag Me to Hell” (2009) marked Raimi’s return to the overdone comic book horror of his “Evil Dead” flicks after achieving blockbuster success with the “Spider-Man” trilogy. While unpleasant in ways since it deals with the assault of an evil spirit, the lamia, it’s all-around superior to the first two “Evil Dead” movies (I’ve never seen “Army of Darkness”).  

A critic who hated it claimed that it had no message. Whether people appreciate what the flick has to offer or not, it does have a message amidst its exaggerated comic booky thrills. A pretty glaring one on the surface along with interesting details if you go a little deeper.

Lohman is winsome on the feminine front while Bojana Novakovic has a brief but notable role as the old crone’s granddaughter.

It runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles & areas nearby.

Fired Up is the cheerleading version of Pitch Perfect. It overflows with dorky characters, hilariously strange situations, and gut-busting quotes that will stick with you. Fired Up knows it's completely and outlandishly ridiculous and enjoys every goofy second of its insane existence. The premise of 2 guys skipping football camp to chase girls at cheerleading camp sounds like every other teen film but Fired Up is surprisingly fun, witty, and at moments even endearing. Eric Christian Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto make a fantastic comedy duo, building one-liners on top of each other with excellent chemistry and hilarity. And John Michael Higgins is just as crazed and entertaining as ever. Overall, Fired Up is a much better-than-average stupid humor movie with a cast and director that know how to do comedy. || **_Hilarious and heartwarming, but too much raunch in the air_**

Two popular high school football jocks (Eric Christian Olsen and Nicholas D'Agosto) decide to go to cheerleading camp in the summer instead of football camp in order to score with the ladies. Their plans go awry when one falls one of the head cheerleaders (Sarah Roemer) and they both find themselves wanting to help the squad win the camp competition.

The purpose of a teen dramadies like this is to entertain and elicit laughs; the great ones avoid too much raunchiness, etc. and offer strong subtexts (like 1995's ""Clueless"" and 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""). The good news is that ""Fired Up"" (2009) is surprisingly funny from beginning to end and it does have heartwarming elements. Despite being direct-to-video, it's obvious that a lot of thought and effort was put into the film.

For it to be effective, Olsen and D'Agosto have to work well together and they do. Olsen was 31 during filming and D'Agosto was 28, hardly high school age, and – while they do a good job of appearing high school age – their overall demeanor give 'em away. As for the females, Sarah is striking as Carly and there are quite a few curvaceous beauties, including the brunette cheerleading coach.

I would easily give ""Fired Up"" a grade of 'A-' if not for some unnecessary coarseness, implied raunch (in other words, there aren't any overtly raunchy scenes) and way too many 'gay'-oriented jokes. These aspects remove it from the realm of greatness, as far as I'm concerned.

The movie runs 90 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

GRADE: B || So very dumb, yet kinda, actually, good... one to file under 'better than it has any right to be'.

I'm not entirely sure how, but <em>'Fired Up!'</em> suffices. Nicholas D'Agosto and Eric Christian Olsen make it work enough, they have decent chemistry and fit their respective roles - and that was needed, different casting and events would've flopped.

The humour is silly yet mildly amusing, don't get me wrong I wasn't laughing or even chuckling but I wasn't cringed out for the most part and I smirked a few times to be fair. There are some solid music choices in there, tracks from the likes of Akon and Avril Lavigne somehow fit.

I was expecting the story to a play out a little differently (worse), it actually portrays the development of the two main characters fairly well. It is quite funny how many of these 00s movies exist that involve the same sorta plot, almost a signature of the era.

I decided to watch this as I noticed it was the only one of Will Gluck's movies that I had yet to see. <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/annie-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">Annie</a>'</em> aside, he is a very reliable director. <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/friends-with-benefits/"" rel=""nofollow"">Friends with Benefits</a>'</em> is his best thus far, I'd say."

At the same time, after Elrod Sykes, the star of the film, reports finding another corpse in the Atchafalaya Swamp near the movie set, Robicheaux starts another investigation, believing the corpse to be the remains of a black man who he saw being murdered 35 years before.",NO ONE CAN ESCAPE THE SINS OF THE PAST,"Thriller, Drama, Crime, Mystery",117.0,2009-04-15,en,6.1,432.0,1.0421,"Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard, Mary Steenburgen, Kelly Macdonald",Bertrand Tavernier,"detective inspector, bayou, series of murders, confederate soldier","Tommy Lee Jones performance is superb and the Southern US atmosphere is really genuine but the story is just made overcomplicated and disappointing. || A woman is found murdered in the swamp somewhere in the south. A brutal murder, quite possibly a serial killer. A policeman is investigating, and  while he does that, another body is found, but this one nothing but bones. This guy (a black guy) was killed 40 years ago, and the policeman suddenly remembers that he saw this murder happening when he was a kid. There doesn't seem to be any sort of connection between the murders, except the man investigating both of them.

Tommy Lee Jones plays the old cop who investigates the murders in the swamp. He is a man fighting his own demons, meaning mostly alcohol, but clearly the death of this black guy has also haunted him for 40 years. He wants justice to be served, but is not willing to do whatever it takes, at least not in the beginning.

This movie is not the most exciting crime movie out there. One thing that makes it stand out from most of them, though, is that it doesn't want to trick us. From the beginning, we know where the plot is going, we just need to follow it all the way to the end and see the ends being tied together. The story is ok, solid, but what really makes this thriller different is the characters and the pace. It is not afraid to slow down the pace and gives us a look into the people who live here, and those visiting. I especially liked the element introduced with Elrod Sykes and Kelly Drummond, two movie stars down here shooting a movie. By the way, it is Elrod who finds the old bones while taking a piss. The confrontations between a drunken Elrod and a sober Dave (the cop), are brilliant and really gives this movie a lot of heart.

I also want to mention the music in this movie. It is there, but doesn't overshadow the images and plot, and most importantly, it has a very unique rhythm, like a beating heart, that drives us forward together with Dave Robicheaux. You notice it, but you don't notice it, if you know what I mean. Brilliant.

_Last words... don't expect this movie to offer you gore and violence. Sure, people die, but you never actually see any sickly images. That's not the story it wants to tell, it wants to give you an insight into a man, a man that isn't so different from you and I._ || **_Tommy Lee Jones as a tough sleuth in the bayous of the Deep South_**

A no-nonsense detective in the heart of Louisiana (Jones) tries to stay away from alcohol as he investigates the murder of a young prostitute, as well as a murder from the mid-60s of a black man in the swamp. John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard, Mary Steenburgen and Ned Beatty appear in secondary roles.

Based on the 1993 book, “In the Electric Mist” (2009) is a detective drama/thriller with a Southern Gothic milieu. Imagine “U.S. Marshals” if it were set in the Deep South, like “No Mercy,” ""Cape Fear"" or “The General’s Daughter.”  

The details of the book are absent so you have to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but I loved the bayou atmosphere even though some of the peripheral actors seem like they memorized their lines 15 minutes before their scenes were shot. 

The movie runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot New Iberia, Louisiana, which is 15 miles southeast of Lafayette and 130 miles west of New Orleans. Areas nearby were also used, including Catahoula, Albania Plantation in Jeanerette, St. Martinville and Charenton.

A mob hit-man (Mickey Rourke) teams-up with a young psycho (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and they go after a separated couple (Diane Lane & Thomas Jane) who witnessed a botched hit. Rosario Dawson is on hand as the twerp's girlfriend.

""Killshot"" (2008) is a thriller/drama by John Madden that supposedly had post-production problems, sat on a shelf, was reedited and whatever else. As such, some criticize that it doesn't flow well. Don't believe it. This is a very professionally-made film and I never got the sense that the story didn't flow, regardless of what they edited out, reedited or what have you. The story's easy to follow and makes sense.

Mickey Rourke is always a highlight even though he essentially plays the same character, which I guess most actors do. His character here is the same likable, brooding one seen in ""The Wrestler"" (2008) and ""Passion Play"" (2010) with the variation that he murders people for a living. Yes, that's a big difference and it does cause the viewer to disapprove of him but it's hard to hate him, unlike his two-bit partner. Somewhat likable or not, the Rourke character HAS to pay for his misdeeds (or should pay, at least).

Speaking of the twerp partner, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines here as a scumbag with almost zero redeeming qualities. Something happens to him at the end and you just can't help saying ""THANK YOU.""

Thomas Jane is always a solid masculine protagonist as is Lane in the feminine department. The film is just as much about the potential reestablishment of their relationship as it is about the thugs trying to find them. But this is definitely a thriller/drama. You get a lot of quality drama interrupted by sudden and intense thrills.

The score's nice and atmospheric and there's a great song on the soundtrack (""Monkey"" by Low).

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Port Perry, Uxbridge and Toronto, Canada, as well as Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Detroit.

Last Saturday me and my son got around to watch it.

Dead Snow is a pretty classical teenage-group-gets-into-big-mess-with-supernatural-beings kind of horror movie. In this particular case a group of teenagers goes for a hike in the Norwegian mountains where they camp in cabin. Not very original of course but what the heck, it is a zombie horror movie so…

One thing that makes the movie a bit original is that it is not so totally over the top with foul language and insane consumption of all kinds of drugs as the standard Hollywood crap. These teenagers actually behave fairly normally drinking a few beers and having a good time. Well that is until the mysterious stranger, who is in the movie just to set up the mood, shows up and tells his story about a unusually cruel Nazi officer and his men. Of course we all know where things are going from there…

Here the movie starts to follow the usual recipe for these kind of movies. Naturally one of the teenagers needs to take care of some natural needs and separates himself from the rest of the party. Then follows the obligatory boy and girl having sex scene. This time in a old-fashioned Scandinavian “skithus” separated from the actual cabin. Anyone who has ever used one of these (I have and they stink) would know that you have to be pretty horny, drunk or both to have sex in one of those. Anyway, that was one less teenager in the party.

Slowly the zombies become more frequent and the dire situation the party is in becomes more and more evident. As the zombies become more frequent so does the gory sequences and eventually the movie turns more into a comedy than a horror movie. I have to say that the Tommy Wirkola have little to learn from his Hollywood counterparts when it comes to horror movie violence. Body parts, external as well as internal, flies around like there was no tomorrow. Which for most of the characters involved is exactly the way it is.

On the whole this movie was one part classical horror movie and one part comedy and I found it quite entertaining but you have to be into these kinds of movies to feel that way of course."

When I first saw this movie in theaters back when it came out, I was not impressed. But after rewatching it, I'm still trying to remember what I didn't like! I was laughing out loud and feeling my heartstrings pulled the entire time. The dog and eagle scene had me rolling! Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are both romantic comedy veterans that prove their skills with the genre in this film. Reynold's quick wit and Bullock's physical comedy perfectly complement each other. The supporting cast and unique twist on the awkwardly forced marriage concept elevate this movie a little further, making The Proposal one of the best of its genre. || You can see what's coming from a mile off. Still good though.

I'm pretty sure I've watched <em>'The Proposal'</em> before many, many years ago as I semi recognised a couple of scenes and knew where the story was going from basically pressing play, though the second half of the film didn't feel like something I had previously seen... so who knows! Either way, that didn't affect my enjoyment at all.

Having only seen Ryan Reynolds in his present day comedy machine it is so odd seeing him act less jokey and more serious, even if you can still spot the quintessential Reynolds comedic delivery in there every now and then. It takes a little bit to get over that but eventually a strong performance is clearly visible. Sandra Bullock fits this realm comfortably and is also very good throughout.

The film does a neat job at making it all believable, the journey from where the two characters begin to where they finish is one that somehow feels natural. It never feels disjointed, which is actually impressive given the plot. Reynolds and Bullock, who share sizeable chemistry, are a large reason for that, of course. || Ok, so the premise is all a bit far-fetched, but the combination of the charismatic Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds does work quite well in this daft, predictable, rom-com. Canadian “Margaret” is the no-nonsense editor-in-chief at a publishing house and the downtrodden “Andrew” is her not so executive assistant. She gets quite a shock when she is told by her bosses that her work visa isn’t being renewed and she is soon to be deported! Unluckily for her aide, he pokes his head around the door just at the wrong time and is soon embroiled in her survival scheme. They are loved-up and soon to be married! Rather than tell her to get lost, he realises that this is a good chance to advance his own career so makes a deal. Thing is, though, the immigration bloodhound “Gilbertson” (Denis O’Hare) is having none of this convenient arrangement and so with a difficult questionnaire looming that could see her locked out and him locked up, they head to Alaska to meet his family. They are a wealthy and welcoming bunch in the main - his mum (Mary Steenbergen) and grandmother (Betty White) are delighted by the potential nuptials, but he has a strained relationship with his rags-to-riches dad (Craig T. Nelson) and so a combination of familial politics and light-hearted slapstick now ensues as the story unfolds. The star of the thing is really Betty White, especially as the film progresses towards it’s ending, but there’s an ambiable chemistry between Bullock at the top of her game and a Reynolds who is beginning to be more than just cinematic eye-candy as both deliver some quite entertainingly written dialogue amidst some lovely scenery. Not an hint of jeopardy, but it’s effortless viewing."

Nothing amazing nor has any great twists, but the performances from Washington and Travolta made the movie worth the time. On the downside, as with many of his later films, Tony Scott's choppy direction was a bit annoying. **3.5/5** || Having seen (and truly loved) <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/unstoppable-2010/"" rel=""nofollow"">Unstoppable</a>'</em>, it's impossible not to see <em>'The Taking of Pelham 123'</em> as a rather pale incarnation of that 2010 flick (which also has Tony Scott as director and Denzel Washington as lead!).

How strange that those two came together to make two very similar movies so close together. In the end, here, there is enough done to separate them, but early on especially I felt like I was watching the same film almost. For the record, that other release is so vastly better than this... so I'd recommend that more if you want a train-centric production from Scott and Washington.

With all that noted, this 2009 film is still a fairly enjoyable 1hr 40mins or so - despite some questionable editing choices. A big reason for my positive rating is the aforementioned Washington, who gives as good a performance as he always tends to give - which is why he is probably my favourite actor, him or Leonardo DiCaprio anyway.

John Travolta does well though, even if I kept getting <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/face-off/"" rel=""nofollow"">Face/Off</a>'</em> vibes throughout. Here, he made me laugh a few times and the guy has some good dialogue/delivery of said dialogue. Even if that latter element is hit-and-miss elsewhere. The rest of the cast are alright-to-meh, nice to see James Gandolfini though.

It's, taking everything into account, all worth a watch, I'd say. || It’s not really fair comparing this with the much more sophisticated 1974 version of this story as Tony Scott has taken a fairly broad-brush to that template and pretty much re-characterised the whole story. That’s a story about a gang of well organised criminals who plan a daring hijack of a subway train in New York, USA. Their plan is simple enough. They seize one car and then their leader “Ryder” (John Travolta) demands $10 millions within the hour or the bodies will start mounting up. His contact in the control room is “Garber” (Denzel Washington) and soon wheels are in motion to get the cash. What’s not so clear, though, is just what the agenda of these criminals is. It’s not an excessively large sum of money and we know that “Garber” is under investigation for bribery, so is there something more sinister going on here? What is obvious is that these guys mean business and are not afraid to demonstrate that fact! Tony Scott has managed to convey something of the claustrophobic nature of the tunnels well here and Harry Gregson-Williams’s aggressive score also helps build the tension but for me, Travolta just doesn’t deliver anything on the scale of menace I wanted here. Sure, his character is vile and violent but with the story relying on a degree of ambiguity for much of it’s substance, his unsubtle and charm-free performance is all just too one-dimensional to keep the intrigue sustained. Washington, likewise, just doesn’t impose himself on the story anywhere near enough to give us any real sense of panic and the other  supporting efforts are all a bit too underwhelming too, delivering a great deal of wasteful shouty dialogue as this thing rather lumbers along as if it were stuck at the lights, too. It probably didn’t need remaking but it does remind you just how good Robert Shaw was on the less is more front."

The Land That Time Forgot is directed by Kevin Connor and adapted to screenplay by Michael Moorcock & James Cawthorn from the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name. It stars Doug McClure, Keith Barron, John McEnery, Susan Penhaligon, Anthony Ainley and Declan Mulholland. Music is by Douglas Gamley and cinematography by Alan Hume. It is the first of four feature films featuring the pairing of director Kevin Connor and actor Doug McClure. Story is set during World War I and sees an uneasy alliance formed between enemies on board a German U-Boat after it drifts for miles and lands in a lost world of dinosaurs and cavemen.

Rationale goes out the window, as does any hope of quality thesping, in the sort of cheese laden creature feature that thrilled many a child back in the mid to late 1970's. Film was enough of a success that it spawned three more films of the same ilk - At the Earth's Core (1976), The People That Time Forgot (1977) and Warlords of Atlantis (1978). Of the four, this is the one that arguably has the most about it in terms of plotting and character development. Certainly it's the biggest budgeted of the four. In fact for the first third of the picture it's distinctly un-child friendly, as story focuses on characters from opposite sides of the war clashing on board the U-Boat after the torpedoing of the ship housing the allies. But once the boat reaches arctic climes and wades through to the sunnier ""other side"", it's all prehistoric puppets, fisticuffs and square jawed heroics from McClure. Ultimately a fun boys own adventure without sensible trappings. 

Not as outrageously fun as At the Earth's Core, but a decent launching pad for the 70's creature feature niche created by Connor and McClure. 6.5/10 || The survivors from a U-boat attack turn the tables on their would be killers and hijack the submarine after it has surfaced to recharge batteries. A gentlemen's agreement between the crews doesn't quite go to plan, and next we know it they are surfacing in a land that is full of dinosaurs and primitive human beings. Will they get home? Well that's down to a rather wooden but entertaining Doug McLure and John McEnery to fathom out. The monsters and other special effects are fine given the budget, though you do glimpse the odd bits of string now and again! Like a few others who have reviewed this, I too saw it at the cinema when I was but a bairn, and I cannot help but look back on this (and ""Warlords of Atlantis"") with a fondness maybe not quite due to the production. Still, it's a jolly adventure lark and still worth a watch."

It is not overtly stated that he is a professional, but his uncompromising posture, his unchanging expression and the omnipresent suitcase make it clear from the very first minutes of the film. Isaach De Bankole is perfect in this role, as he has a face that seems carved out of granite. The hitman's few intimations of humanity are thus all the more shocking.

As the film proceeds, the hitman meets a series of individuals who send him onwards in his journey to pick up necessary equipment and finally confront his victim. These employees of his mysterious employer are left nameless, though often referred to by items they carry or other qualities: ""Guitar"" (John Hurt), ""Blond"" (Tilda Swinton), ""Violin"" (Luis Tosar), ""Mexican"" (Gael García Bernal), and ""Molecules"" (Youki Kudoh). In engaging the assassin in conversation to subtly convey their messages, they end up delivering eccentric monologues. Many critics lambasted these lines as so much metaphysical babble. In fact, everything said relates very directly to the plot, but this is the sort of film that demands a second viewing to really tie everything together, and those who fail to be intrigued enough on the first viewing to go on to a second may find this film a failure.

Though Jarmusch alludes to America under the Bush administration at points, this is ultimately a psychological drama: the hitman's task and contacts represent only parts of his own psyche. While some have tried to view this as a simple Freudian struggle between the id, ego, and superego, I feel that Jarmusch is aiming for something more subtle, something that he has great difficult putting into words and, even with his best efforts, this film can only hint at. THE LIMITS OF CONTROL feels like a cinematic analogue to the late albums of Scott Walker, where the songs' characters, cultural references and ""plot"" only serve to express some burning flame in the artist's own psyche.

Jim Jarmusch has always stated that his aesthetic is to absorb everything he can from prior films (and books, music, etc.) and let those inspirations reflect in his own films.<i>The Limits of Control</i> abounds with references to the film canon: Jean-Pierre Melville (namely ""Le Samouraï""), Orson Welles (""The Lady from Shanghai""), Alfred Hitchcock, Aki Kaurismäki (""Le Vie de Bohème""), Alejandro Jodorowsky (that auteur's entire trippy aesthetic), and probably more that I just didn't recognize.

The film's lack of conventional interaction between characters and the compilation of references ultimately makes THE LIMITS OF CONTROL feel relatively cold and lifeless compared to Jarmusch's many other films. Still, the visuals of the film make it a worthwhile experience in spite of its flaws. With Christopher Doyle, funny enough, working the camera, we get a number of beautifully composed shots that will prove memorable."

Nope, not to be. He keeps having dreams, and vivid, mysterious, dreams that feature mysterious writings? Just like with the first outing of this franchise, the story drags the young couple into a battle between the ""Autobots"" and their foes, the ""Decepticons"" only this time the rehash of the hidden power-cube story tries to immerse itself in ancient Egyptian mythology as a means of making the never ending assemble/disassemble/reassemble fight scenes emerge as something less repetitive and, frankly, dull. There isn't really a script to speak of, and at 2½ hours this really does feel like you could have actually built one of the pyramids in the time it takes to come to what is the inevitable tee for another sequel. John Turturro steals his scenes as the ultra-hammy agent ""Simmons"" and we have Josh Duhamel as the eye-candy in an uniform but as with the first film, Fox is as wooden as a skateboard. Although there is pretty much non-stop action throughout, I still couldn't tell who is fighting with whom nor is ""Bumblebee"" getting any better at the close protection game. One for die hard fans, I think - it certainly left me yawning. || <em>'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'</em> is much like the original for me, in that I never got hooked into what was being portrayed in front of my eyes; I was more just processing the events, rather than actually absorbing anything. Don't get me wrong, neither flicks are bad, just not good in my opinion.

I personally have a hard time differentiating all of the robots, even main dude Optimus Prime. Their designs aren't eye-catching to me, I don't feel like I'm looking at anything other than metal and tiny little light up eyes. The wall-to-wall action doen't help either, what with them just clattering into each other constantly.

With that said, the aforementioned carnage does help in regards to the pacing and run time. 150 minutes is way too long, though to be honest it flows well for a movie of that length and I was never desperate for the end credits to arrive. I just wasn't properly enjoying myself at any point.

Shia LaBeouf works, a competent and well chosen lead no doubt. Megan Fox really is only there to look beautiful though, eh? No dislike directed at Fox at all, more so at those responsible for the lack of tangible character development offscreen. The rest of the cast are alright, Tyrese Gibson is quite underused though. The voice cast are slightly better than those behind LaBeouf/Fox.

I watched that first film just over five years ago, I hadn't realised until recently that they had made seven (!) of them; plus that bonus one last year. As if I'm going to watch them al... of course I am. I'm bound to like at least one, right?"

There is no shortage of quality films about Prohibition and the many notable criminals of this era in American history: Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel and others form a kind of “golden age” of organized crime. John Dillinger is among them, occupying a top place on the list of great criminals of this era.

After a rebellious and delinquent youth, Dillinger deserted the Navy and ended up being sentenced to almost twenty years in prison after a grocery store robbery. The sentence was considered excessively heavy and left Dillinger resentful. From then on, he made the Indiana State Penitentiary his school of crime until he was released in 1933. With his freedom, he formed his first gang and began the bank robberies that made him famous. In 1934, he was arrested in Arizona and sent to Crown Point, Indiana, from where he made a spectacular escape, using a fake pistol made from a bar of soap or wood. His escape, the notoriety he had already acquired and the interstate nature of his crimes led to the involvement of the recently founded FBI. Meanwhile, Dillinger formed a second group of criminals which included the equally famous “Baby-Face” Nelson, and resumed his robberies, while trying to elude the authorities. Months later, and after almost being arrested on several occasions, he was betrayed and denounced, and murdered outside a cinema.

The film is quite good. It is faithful enough to the events and to Dillinger's life, but mixes things up a bit, changing the order of events in order to increase dramatic tension (for example, the death of “Pretty Boy” Floyd is shown well before Dillinger's death , but it happened months later, in a corn field). Furthermore, the film exaggerates things. However, these are concessions that I accept because the film, in addition to being a fictional piece, is reasonably respectful of historical facts. I don't accept the poorly explanatory narrative so easily: anyone who doesn't know Dillinger and his life well will have some difficulty following the film. This may help to understand why this film was a failure outside the US, where John Dillinger is little known.

Michael Mann is a very competent director, thorough and respectful of the past. We saw these characteristics in “Last of the Mohicans” and “Collateral”, among other quality films. The director does a very good job in this film, which follows well the adventures of the criminal's life and his tricks to elude the police. The cinematography is magnificent and makes wonderful use of light and color, especially in scenes filmed at night, and the filming locations, props, vehicles, costumes and sets are convincing and quite realistic. The film's biggest flaw, for me, is the dispassionate way it approaches everything. Considering that the protagonist is an outlaw and that nothing he did was acceptable, having managed to like him would have been a bonus. In fact, what stood out to me the most was the extremely thin line that separated the agents of the law and the criminals they pursued: think about it, Dillinger was not detained to be present at a trial, he was executed in a public square and surrounded by hundreds of people who could have been injured if things had gone out of control. Who is hero or villain? The waters are murky, in the film as in life itself.

All I can do is talk about the cast, which is confidently led by Johnny Depp, an actor who has a special talent for complicated and unusual characters, and who gives us a very competent interpretation. Christian Bale, another talented actor for impactful characters, played the federal agent in charge of arresting Dillinger, and he is extraordinary in his effort. Marion Cotillard does what she can in the role of Dillinger's girlfriend, but the truth is that the film did not need any attempt at romance, even though the character was necessary to understand the life of the heartthrob criminal, and that's why she doesn't add much to the product. Final. There are also notable additions to the cast, including Stephen Graham, David Wenham and James Russo."

<em>'(500) Days of Summer'</em> impressed me. It features a fairly unique and a pretty refreshing romcom story, which is told in an interesting way. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom) is very good, as is co-star Zooey Deschanel (Summer). The pacing is good, as are the comedic aspects. All in all it's a pleasant watch. || I recently had the opportunity to watch this movie again, many years removed from the first time I saw it. I was surprised how few details I remembered.

During the movie’s sharpest moments, the dialogue is witty and fun. The story bounces around back and forth along the 500 day timeline they have measured out for the relationship between the two main characters. The device works; we get to see the state of their couple-ness at various points. It is, most of the time entertaining.

But I have to say, as much as I like Zooey in her role (and this time around I know her from her great work in Elf), I was less than dazzled by our hero. I found him to be rather pathetic and despite the fun the two characters shared at times, it felt to me there was not much chemistry between the two, except when Zooey’s character exerted herself in his direction. Perhaps that was intended, given the arc of the plot.

As I said above, the movie was entertaining, but ultimately I wasn’t satisfied with the ending. How it turned out for both characters, while believable when looked at from afar, came across as sudden and a little lame. More groundwork should have be laid out for where they stood at the end. || **When I suffer from love pain** after any breakup and cry for days, when I build scenarios in my head and upset myself again, **I will remember (500) days of summer** and I realised much better that t**here is nothing I need to upset myself so much,** because I have experienced that **new people will come up** and make me happy and even make me sad."

Death Eaters are running amok as Dumbledore has an important task for Harry and Voldermort has one for Draco; all set to the backdrop of raging adolescent hormones. While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.

Potter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.

A filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10 || The seventh installment, the appetiser.

As the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the ""Horcruxes"" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.

So this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.

New additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!

Tension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10 || Has the quality direction of _Order of the Phoenix_ but manages to separate itself from that movie by having a script that isn't shit.

Avoid where possible._ || This is not a shark movie as I had thought nor a related sequel to the equally charming first instalment in the Open Water series, but it did get me hooked quickly when a group of friends impulsively decide to take a dive in open waters without lowering the ladder on their yacht. It's crazy how things move from there with basic instincts kicking in and the blame game starting up. It's solid entertainment if you are into survival thrillers. Has a few clichés here and there, but overall Adrift gave me a good 90 minutes of pure thrills. (Grade B). TN. || **Much better than expected.**

I saw this film very recently, following another, Portuguese one, which is a copy of it. The film is much better than I expected and, even if it is not based on true events (the producers should be sued for misleading advertising), it is quite well made, tells a good story and entertains quite well.

Everything takes place at sea, on a luxurious boat. Six childhood friends meet up for a walk and everything seems to be going quite well until they all end up in the sea: when they want to get back on the boat, they realize that no one has remembered the ladder to climb.

Normally, this type of film contains idiotic people doing idiotic things that end in the worst way, and who ends up being saved is always the character that gives us the most sympathy. It's almost mathematical, and I didn't expect much more. I was surprised to find a film that manages to be that, but go beyond that and give us entertainment, a story capable of minimally convincing us and relatively well-built characters. It's not an exceptional film, but it's frankly better than most of its counterparts.

I'm convinced that the secret to this film's success lies in the team of very competent screenwriters called to work, and also in the intelligent direction of Hans Horn, who was able to manage the cast in the most capable way possible. Susan May Prat is believable in everything she does, and she's the standout actress here, but Eric Dane and Richard Speight Jr. they are also quite good on the job they have done.

Technically, it's a pretty good movie, considering the budget and other constraints the production faced. Being a film that was made a little outside the big studios and the millions in the industry, it is a very competent work, with excellent cinematography, good editing, good soundtrack and sound effects, and good use of the filming location."

The concept is fascinating - an adult (and a ruthless and unstable one at that) in the persona of a child using innocence as the ultimate tool for deception is cleverly delivered by the cast and from the pen of Alex Mace. The wintry scenario and the John Ottman score also contribute well to a genuine sense of menace as those who get in her way are unceremoniously snuffed out.

It feels like this is after all the uproar with Katherine Heigl (""27 Dresses"") and she was trying to come back with a smile on her face, but she took the role because it gave her the opportunity to act the awful person she was accused of being.

Gerard Butler (""Bounty Hunter"") acts up a storm to keep up with her, with both equally playing off each of wonderfully.

I can't tell the better actor here because Gerard is clearly acting, but he might be acting a character that is acting eccentrically, but I'm still aware regardless of how good it is, versus Katherine who is so natural and seamless that you don't realize she's acting until she over acts per the character following another character's prompts badly.

Two newlyweds (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) set out to enjoy their honeymoon hiking the incredibly scenic Kaua'i, Hawaii. Unfortunately they catch word that a crazy murderous couple is on the loose and they become seriously suspicious of other hikers (Timothy Olyphant and Chris Hemsworth, amongst others). Will they escape their honeymoon alive?

""A Perfect Getaway"" (2009) is worthwhile if, like me, you enjoy island-adventure movies like ""Mysterious Island,"" ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Six Days Seven Nights."" The film was shot at Kaua'i, Puerto Rico and Jamaica (the sea cave sequence) and these locations are spectacular. 

Also, the character played by Timothy Olyphant and his woman (Kiele Sanchez) are likable and you can't help but start to root for them by the time the third act roles around. Olyphant is ""outstanding."" Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is also impressive as a grim/laconic badaxx hiker in a glorified cameo. Marley Shelton easily wins the Best Beauty award, but her role is too small and the filmmakers fail to take advantage of her presence.

Everyone knows by now that this is a 'twist' film and consequently the story takes a jarring turn in the final act. I'm not going to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. I recommend seeing ""A Perfect Getaway"" if you like island flicks or films with surprising plot twists (or both). See if you can figure out the twist before it happens. I did and will explain below why it was easy. However, let me humbly add that I didn't have it figured out 100%; I just suspected the twist and that's how it turned out.

The film is good for what it is, but there are a couple of things that turned me off. One has to do with the twist, explained below. The other has to do with the film being a whodunit thriller. By it's very nature the story has to cast suspicion on several characters and, as such, they are often portrayed in a negative or weirdo light, which doesn't change until the last act when the real murderers are revealed. In short, there's just too much negative energy amongst the players, but this is somewhat offset by the impressive redemption of a couple of the characters in the third act.

The movie runs 1 hour, 38 minutes.

GRADE: B-

**_SPOILER ALERT_** (Don't read any further unless you've seen the film).

We discover in the third act that the main protagonists played by Zahn & Jovovich are the murderers and that they're actually impostors of a recently murdered newlywed couple. The reasons I was able to figure this out was because (1) I knew beforehand there was going to be a plot twist and so was looking for it and (2) in a murder-twist scenario it's usually the most innocent/vulnerable persons who are guilty (e.g. ""Howling V: The Rebirth"").

Twist films like this have now become so common that they're no longer even surprising. What would really be refreshing and 'cutting edge' is if the film simply played it straight, i.e. the people we think are the protagonists remain the protagonists throughout and the suspicious/evil people get their comeuppance (""Cape Fear"" is a good example).

My problem with the twist is that it makes the whole story a lie -- the very people we come to care about and root for in the first hour end up being despicable criminal scum of the lowest depth (at least Zahn's character anyway) and the suspicious characters that we're led to believe are the murderers wind up being the protagonists we should care about. To the film's credit we DO end up caring about Olyphant's character and his mate by the end of the story.

Yes, I realize that, in a way, the film isn't lying to the viewer once the characters played by Zahn and Jovovich are understood to be the murderers. When this is understood, most (maybe all) of their conversations are authentic as the impostors/killers but not as the innocent newlyweds, if you know what I mean. It's all a matter of perspective. But, still, this doesn't take away from the fact that the viewer has essentially been baited and switched -- the very people we think are the innocent/vulnerable protagonists end up being the guilty/malevolent scum bags. Consequently, the viewer can't help but feel hoodwinked at the climax."

Consistently enthralling and keeping one at the edge of his seat. THIS is a recent film, like 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World', that should have spawned sequels. Much better than his follow-up, 'Elysium' (I haven't watched any others he's made since; hope he doesn't end up a cinematic one-trick pony like M. Night Shyamalan...). || Great watch, will watch again, and highly recommended.

This has a wonderfully exciting premise: alien refugees on Terra, how Terrans react and how the aliens react.  The premise, as delivered, has some odd holes in though: it's specified that all of the crew have died, mysteriously, and no one knows how to operate the ship, but it's been in the air for some time.  The idea of gravity alone should have motivated Johannesburg to evacuate, but their government interaction seems decidedly weak.

The advantage of setting the story in South Africa, for an American audience, is that it's a very capitalistic society where they speak chiefly English: it's very similar to being set in Mexico and using Mexican Cartels instead of Nigerian gangs.

So if we accept that we haven't been able to extract an incident report, that we're not able to move the ship, and none of the xenos can move the ship, then the premise includes that one xenos knows what to do.  One would think that he just talks to someone and he gets all his people off planet, but since he's smart enough to do what he's been doing for 20 years, then he knows not to trust anyone.  But this self-serving principle is key to understanding character motivations going forward.

The writing in this is so good, along with the effects, and performance delivery.  As Vickis deals with his transformation, it prompts so many philosophical questions of what it is to be a person / human / xenos, a citizen, a government agent.  It also sort of resembles a gangsta / heist movie at parts, as opposed to a anti-government escapee.

If any of the deep stuff worried you, then be at ease that this movie has plenty of explosions, gunfire and sci-fi goodness.  It's also filled with some silly cliches that serve the points of the story, but there are several points in this movie that I have to shake my head at.  The motivations don't make sense unless you're reminded that everyone, including the protagonists, are (forced) in a self-serving mindset and it's about what they can do for themselves, even when working together with the contrast being, of course, that only when anyone is cooperating that anyone gets anywhere.

This is such a great watch, and if you like sci-fi styled stuff, and don't mind the South African setting (""Chappie"" is another one), then definitely give this a watch. || A gritty and original story that is as entertaining as thought-provoking, combining xenophobic satire and political allegory with raucous action.

And even though John Cena is better than he usually is in movies, he's just no Keanu (did I say that? Oh yes I did).

And Ashley Scott is definitely no Sandra Bullock and furthermore Aidan Gillen no Dennis Hopper.

That said, it's not terrible, SPEED (1994) to me is just one of the best blockbuster action movies of the 90's so the chance that it would match up to it would really be second to none.

Anyway back to this movie, it's okay fairly mindless popcorn entertainment, Renny Harlin is good when it comes to action-sequences and yet again he delivers on those aspects.

I'm usually not bothered to much over shaky cams but this movie contains a overabundance of that and occasionally you wish they would just use steady cam but what can you do? not much.

“The Time Traveler’s Wife” (2009) is a drama/romance with a sci-fi element comparable to “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (2004). Like that film, it can be mind-boggling, but both Bana and McAdams make it worthwhile and there are thought-provoking & moving parts. Eric is masculine and charismatic here, really showing off his talents, while Rachel shines as one of the most uniquely beautiful women to walk the earth.

I ""liked"" this movie up to the point I was going to write the review, and realized that I don't like the movie in spite of all its horrible qualities.

The story, as written, is actually pretty goo, but there are certain comedic points that only sabotage the movie.  The biggest problems are simply that the lead actor just is not charismatic enough for the role:  the character can still be a wimp and likeable enough for the audience to be behind him from the start.  The second problem, which probably hurts the lead, is that the ""best friend"" character has too big a personality and is gratuitously stupid far beyond the point of irritation.  There are several points where the movie stops just so we can watch him be a moron.

It's all about pacing.  The movie wants to shock and awe, but doesn't build to anything, it just randomly flings things at the wall to see what sticks and then forcing you to look while it asks, ""Isn't that crazy?""

I'd like to see a refined version of this movie with decent actors: Craig Robinson is by far the best and biggest actor in this, and he has a bit part which seems specifically written for one of the worst jokes in the movie."

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Decent watch, could watch again, but can't confidently recommend.

While they're very different movies, I tend to get this mixed up with ""She's Out of My League"".  They're both decent movies, they're funny enough, but they're both forgettable and I don't think you're missing out if you skip either.

My biggest problem with this movie is that there is a wildly violent crime spree throughout the movie.  I'm not talking about simple trespassing, or even under-age drinking (though, I think it applies to my point)  there is physical assault, jokes about ""date-rapey"" behavior, use of cocaine, threats to life, severe destruction of property, forced entry, and I think illegal tracking, quite a bit is just done openly in front of adults / authority figures, and at one point in uniform.  It's one thing to be a little lenient and let kids be kids, but graduating high schoolers are probably 18, adults, and it doesn't make sense to not arrest this idiot.  On top of that, to create a character like that in the moment, then he must have a long history of crimes.

I'm actually a fan of the story, cringey as it may be.  I love an underdog story, and this is a powerful ""coming of age"" story for at least 3 different characters, but as the premise is that it is an unbelievable situation, and they casted and that caste delivered just a little too well.  They specifically don't play well off of each other because the performances are actually so good as characters, and the characters barely mesh, even as the movie continues.

The movie also undercuts the protagonist at the oddest times.  While we're supposed to relate to one of the boys (or possibly Beth Cooper) there are several points where it makes them look even more pathetic or jerks (in her case) and it really takes me out of the movie.  I think it is better to have irredeemable characters than characters that vary on their relate-ability like this movie does.

I think you could have a fun little watch with this, but there are so many other things I would suggest: ""Superbad"", ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""She's All That"", ""Booksmart"", ""Eurotrip"" for a start."

Along the way he must deal with sabotage from Portugese spies and mutiny from a rebellious crew.","Chosen by a queen. Driven by a dream.

“Christopher Columbus: The Discovery” (1992) came out seven weeks before Ridley Scott’s “1492: Conquest of Paradise,” both of which tackle the same historic tale in celebration of its 500th anniversary.  This one was directed by John Glen who’s no slouch as he helmed five James Bond flicks in the ’80s, including “For Your Eyes Only” (1981) and “Octopussy” (1983), both of which rank with the better 007 movies.  

Scott’s film is more artistic and epic, being longer by 34 minutes, whereas this one is more compact, not to mention it focuses more on the set-up to the expedition while “1492” is more concerned with what happens when Columbus hits ground on the other side of the Atlantic. Moreover, “Discovery” sticks to the first voyage whereas “1492” includes additional expeditions.

Both bombed at the box office, but “Discovery” made more money in North America and especially so if you factor in production costs ($40 million compared to $47 million). Each is worth checking out and comparing if you like real-life adventure. This one is more balanced in regards to the three acts and doesn’t bog down with events in the New World. The weakest part of “Discovery” is the voyage itself, which runs half an hour (twice as long as in “1492”), which is understandable since it’s difficult to make a long ship journey consisting of all males dramatically compelling. Scott’s film did a way more convincing (and artistic) rendition of the Atlantic voyage.

However, “Discovery” has the superior cast with unknown Frenchman Georges Corraface charismatic in the title role, although Gérard Depardieu is more convincing in the role in “1492” when you consider historic artist depictions. Corraface, by contrast, comes across as the cliched Hollywood version of the explorer, which doesn’t mean he’s not effective. In any case, I like the way each version points out both Columbus’ positive AND negative qualities.

Benicio Del Toro is also effective as one of the Spanish sailors of dubious character. Meanwhile it’s great to see Brando near the end of his career as the Grand Inquisitor, Tomas de Torquemada. While his role is peripheral, there’s a subtle quiet greatness with his deep, effortless wisdom and spirit. Marlon would only perform in five other films. Then there’s Tom Selleck as King Ferdinand, which critics curiously lambaste, but he actually kicks axx in the small role.

Speaking of critics, they all jumped on the hate bandwagon when “Discovery” was released as soon as they smelled blood in the water. However, neither this one nor “1492” are even close to being as awful as they claim. Like I said, they’re definitely worth seeing if you prefer historical adventure in the mold of “Mutiny on the Bounty” (1962) and “The Bounty” (1984).

On the female front, Catherine Zeta-Jones is notable as Columbus’ Castilian mistress, Beatriz. This was before she became a star, being only 21-22 during shooting and very cute. Rachel Ward also does well as Queen Isabella. Of course, most men will appreciate voluptuous Tailinh Agoyo as the chieftain’s daughter for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the women on the islands are overtly top nude, as was the case in “The Bounty.” This is just a heads up.

I’ve heard critics say that “Discovery” can only be appreciated if you don’t take it seriously, but this makes no sense since it’s a historical tale in which the gist of events is true; for instance, what happens to the Santa Maria, as well as the 39 Spaniards left behind on Hispaniola when Columbus returned to Europe. While we know someone’s head wasn’t on the literal chopping block during the voyage, this was obviously added for dramatic effect.

Some complain about Columbus’ swashbuckling early on, but he was widely traveled and I’m sure he ran into ne'er-do-wells with weapons on an occasion or two. I was held up by three guys with guns on a wilderness trail at one point while I’ve had friends involved in bloody knife fights at local bars and so forth. Let’s not pretend like these kinds of clashes don’t happen.

One of the reasons this flick and “1492” bombed was because Columbus was no longer viewed in a positive light by 1992 due to the preachin’ of Lib academics who denounce the explorer as evil incarnate. But, let’s face it, the European colonization of the Americas was BOTH a blessing and a curse, yet mostly a blessing since it introduced to the New World the written language, the horse, the wheel, wagons, stagecoaches, firearms, trains, industry, superior architecture and so on.

And let’s not kid ourselves with the Lib fantasy that the Americas were a Garden of Eden before Euros arrived. There was constant war between “Indian” tribes, who are actually the progeny of settlers from Asia. There was also slavery, massacres, heinous torture of captives, gross human sacrifice in Mesoamerica to nourish their gods, headhunters in the Amazon. Need I go on? The idea conveyed in “The New World” (2005) that AmerIndians had never experienced envy/rivalry and didn’t even know what a lie was is utterly laughable. I’m speaking as part-Abenaki.

The movie runs 2 hours and was shot in Portugal, Spain & Malta for the European events, the Atlantic Ocean for the sailing sequences and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, for the island parts.

When I watched the 2007 remake I was quite happy that it was a decent enough work and gave it 7 stars out of 10. This one though? Well the reboot is effectively killed as far as I am concerned. If there are to be made another movie in this franchise there has to be another reboot. This one is just ruined.

The first 20 minutes or so was not too bad. Then it just went to hell. Rob Zombie must have been high on drugs when he wrote this crud. A god chunk of it is just some drug-induced psychedelic mess.

Debora Meyers is just a foul-mouthed brat who is so dislikable that you almost hope that Michael will get her. Dr. Loomis have been turned into a despicable asshole. Michael himself is mostly just a big dirty man who slashes people up. 

Occasionally he shows some of the supernatural qualities he is supposed to have but most often not. And he grunts a lot, what the f…? The dialogue is non-existent if you remove the foul language. I am normally quite resistant towards foul language but not when the movie is filled with it just to cover up the lack of talent in the writer.

I think that I have not been so disappointed in a movie in a long time. This movie is utter trash and a disgrace to a franchise that is really one of my favorite horror ones.

I am going to think more than twice before I ever watch a movie by Rob Zombie again. || I see 2 reviews here on this one, one is an 8 star the other a 1 star, I've been watching Movies for over 50 years now, I absolutely love them, all types and Genres, I can sit down with my Wife or alone and watch any good Hallmark Movie or any good Horror Movie, I have favorites in all genres.

And I think I can give a good honest independent review on any type of Move, so obviously here with an 8 & 1 star reviews one of them is either 100% wrong and the other right or this move possibly falls somewhere in the middle at around a 5*.

I watched it for the 1st time last night, I like the original, it's not a great Movie but it's good and a decent sequel to the Original,  Rob Zombie's Halloween remake of the Original was fairly good, 10x better than his second one.

I have to agree 100% with Peter's review here, the star is a Loud, Foul Mouthed, and extremely irritating and ignorant Character, she is also a terrible actress in this Movie unless you just want her for her screaming in y our face.

I like all the actors from other shows and Movies he throws in, some are wasted others are fairly good in their spots.

I also rate it a 1 STAR, I'm not against Foul language in a Movie, but it should be used in the right spots and times, in this one, they just throw the F-Bombs out there like it's a normal thing and it's not, even when I worked in a Factory with mostly Men that drank some before during and after work, they did not use foul language that often.

I could have raised my rating higher if that was not the case and if she was nothing more than a screamer, let her act a little, I agree with Peter's question, was Rob High when he filmed this, LOL!,  the reviewer that rates it an 8 star is WAY OFF!, I'm sorry whomever you are, but the only thing you get right is, it is Rob's Darkest Movie yet, other than that, this MOVIE SUCKS!

Can his deductions find the truth? This is a great example of a methodological and forensic drama that looks at the crime, sure, but it takes almost the same amount of time and effort to examine the strongly built characterisations. The nature of obsession, the desire for closure and completion - all addictive aspects of human nature that Darín and the almost perfect pacing from Juan José Campanella deliver here. It's a mystery that works on several levels evaluating the effectiveness of legal process and modern policing whilst reminding us that those exposed to crime are also affected, sometimes profoundly, by what they encounter. This works really well in a cinema, if you can.

Incapacitated and sent to the (not so) nearby hospital, his is just the start of some fairly brutal mishaps that befall this small rural community as Europe drifts towards the start of the Great War. It's a sort of feudal existence for this community were everything stems from the baron (Ulrich Tukur). When his young son is violently assaulted, tensions run high in the village and as more atrocities emerge they all start to turn on each other and suspicions run high. It might be, though, that the children of the pastor might hold the key. That's what the narrator, and rather naive teacher (Christian Friedl) eventually concludes, but as he investigates as surreptitiously as he can, we find a great deal more going on amidst a village of child molesting, cruelty, adultery and basically anything that could easily contribute to the negative mindset of those carrying out these acts of pretty calculated wickedness. Each of the villagers has their moment in the cinematic sun as we are taken, almost door to door, on a tour of their foibles and peccadilloes. It delivers quite a potent look at the almost, sometimes literal, incestuous nature of country life where people live in fear of losing their patronage and their survival depends on the harvest - and that depends on a God who is represented by Burghart Klaußner's enigmatically characterised pastor. This is a conflicted man more concerned with a status quo than necessarily with the truth. There is mystery here, but that rather fades into the background of quite a disturbing character study that is puzzling and intriguing."

Still, I thought it was entertaining most of the time. There were slow interludes that could have been removed to improve the pacing without harming the story. But if you understand that they aren't going for laugh out loud gags or one-liners, but rather they work for their punch lines or leave you to figure out where the joke is, maybe you can appreciate it more.

I will say that the plot seemed a bit disjointed to me. The flashbacks weren't confusing, but in a slower paced film like this one, I think they were sometimes more of a distraction than plot-enhancers. The ending also had an air of an anticlimax to it, like - oh, okay. I guess it fit the laid back mood of the rest of the movie, but they might have done more with it.

Still, I liked it. Enough said."
19994.0,Jennifer's Body,"Jennifer, a gorgeous, seductive cheerleader takes evil to a whole new level after she's possessed by a sinister demon. Now it's up to her best friend to stop Jennifer's reign of terror before it's too late.",She's evil... and not just high school evil.,"Horror, Comedy",107.0,2009-09-18,en,6.0,3985.0,11.6757,"Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, Adam Brody, Sal Cortez","Karyn Kusama, Diablo Cody","high school, minnesota, possession, slumber party, gore, sexual murder, teenage girl, demon, rock band, succubus, satanic ritual, candlelight vigil, duringcreditsstinger, woman director, curious, virgin sacrifice, frenemies, bloodthirsty, teen scream","PMS isn't real Needy, it was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem like we're crazy. 

Jennifer's Body is directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody. It stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sedaris and Adam Brody. Music is by Stephen Barton and Thodore Shapiro and cinematography by M. David Mullen. Plot finds Fox as a High School cheerleader who gets possessed by a demon and starts eating the boys from school. Seyfried is the homely best friend who tries to stop her.

Women impacting on the horror genre from the directing or writing chairs is in short supply, sadly the team-up of Diablo Cody and Karyn Kusama has barely made a stain on this issue. The intentions, you feel, were honourable from the outset, an attempt to blend hip pop culture comedy with demonic horror, wrapped around the perils of High School sexual learnings, unfortunately the final product is decidedly tepid. Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats. Cast are fine, the odd gag scores some giggles and the film is often sexy, while the score literally does rock, but all told it's just too messy, too studio safe for its own good. 5/10 || Rewatching Jennifer's Body reminds me why it left such an impression the first time around. The opening narration paired with the ""before and after"" sequence was a brilliant way to introduce the characters and set the tone for what was to come. It strikes a balance between ominous and quirky, pulling you into the strange, twisted world of Devil’s Kettle.

Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried’s chemistry is one of the highlights. Their dynamic as Jennifer and Needy feels authentic, charged with tension, and full of layers. Megan Fox, often criticized for her emotional range, really brought something extra to this role. She captures Jennifer’s dangerous allure and underlying insecurities in a way that makes her both menacing and fascinating. And let’s be honest—Fox’s charisma and screen presence are off the charts here.

What I like is that the movie has more going on under the surface. Sure, it’s about a demon-possessed cheerleader eating boys, but there’s also stuff about friendship, jealousy, and even how women are underestimated or exploited. There’s a lot of deeper meaning if you take the time to think about it (or look it up online, let’s be honest).

The production overall was pretty good. The locations were well chosen, and the cinematography had some cool details, like those subtle shifts in perspective with handheld shots and close-ups. It really added to the tension without being too flashy.

For me, Jennifer’s Body is one of those movies that just works. It’s fun, has great performances, and leaves you thinking a bit more than you’d expect from a horror-comedy. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely worth a rewatch—and yeah, Megan Fox totally owned this one."

But after watching it, I was surprised. First off,this movie was way,( and I mean), way better then the last two movies were. It was darker and had a lot of elements from the first movie, which I loved. I don't want to give away too much, but I do want to say that the last scene of the movie will leave you speechless. It had me thinking, ""OMG, that was AMAZING how they came up with that twist."" One last thing I loved about this movie was that it was well planned out and thought of, unlike the forth movie which was a joke and in my opinion, shouldn't have never been made. The deaths weren't rushed as opposed to the deaths in the forth movie, and it gave more screen time to introduce us to the characters. Note: I will say that there is one death scene in the movie that I didn't see coming, besides the ending. I recommend you see this movie. It might have the same theme as the first four movies, but unlike the first four, it's on a much higher scale. || It's not actually final...

You can just imagine the suits sitting around their big round table discussing how to churn out another financially beneficial Final Destination movie and get away with it. Big suit number one puts forward that they obviously need more inventive mouse trap like deaths. Big suit number two has the genius notion that 3D is again taking off so why not utilise that option too. And that's pretty much all that it took, with the end result being a movie that is very self aware of its roots, but still plays out as the runt of the Final Destination litter.

Just as the director of the first one, James Wong, was brought back to direct part 3, the makers here bring back the director of part 2, David R. Ellis, to direct part 4! Which ultimately proves to be nothing more than some sort of nepotism like factor because The Final Destination is basically just over 82 minutes of poor acting, bad writing and a series of kills weaved together by the odd 5 minutes of barely relevant characterisations (the exposition as painful as the gory deaths!). 

The kills entertain as they pretty much always have throughout the franchise, with the opening disaster sequences (here set at a speedway stadium) continuing one of the series' great traditions. While the opening and closing X-Ray/Skeletal credit sequences are superb and a credit to those involved. Yet it all feels so tired, where in spite of the willingness to upgrade the technology, it's still lazy and has nothing to really justify its very being other than that to make easy money. 

The makers of part 5 would have to come up with something special to not turn this franchise from being one that was once bright and inventive, into that of a money train joke. 4/10 || For some reason this one is named The Final Destination instead of Final Destination 4. Almost looks like they expected this installment to be the final in the series but since the 5th one is about to come out on Blu-ray that was obviously a wrong assumption in that case.

A positive surprise. Most people have said that the second third and fourth film slipped compared to the first one and it wasn’t until the fifth film that the series took off again. Well they’re wrong in my opinion.

This installment was a lot better than the third one. Sure if you do not like gory horror movies then you wont like this film but then why did you even bother with it? Me, I like these kind of films so I was quite happy to see it.

The special effects was much better than the previous film and not so silly and stupid as they sometimes where in the third one. I liked the ending as well. Classical horror movie style ending and really cool touch with those x-ray shots."

Running Man with a dash of Facebook, and not much more. Maybe more the book Running Man, less the Schwarzenegger thing. But essentially, it's that story - bits of which have been filmed numerous times.

The logistics and the logic in this story don't add up. Unclear rules and chaotic action scenes permanently maxed-out on violence make it impossible to either feel the danger, or compassion with the protagonists during the battles. 
And outside the battles, there is not much suspense either, nor acting possibilites, nor dialogue, let alone character development. Even the technobabble is off.

Oh, and the CGI at start is sub-par, even for its day. (Hint: If you can't afford to do it with good CGI, use physical effects instead.)



If you want your fix on ""action without too much brains"", watch something like Hardcore Henry; if you want something somewhat clever and entertaining on the topic, read the book ""The Running Man"".

You will enjoy it if you like the genre. If not ... well, probably it would be a slow and dull romantic drama for you. || Bright Star is the rare biopic of an artist that actually provides some insight into its subject’s craft. Usually, a film about a writer, including such recent examples as To Olivia (Roald Dahl) and The Laureate (Robert Graves), will approach the creative process as 99-percent inspiration and 1-percent actual work – and sometimes not even that. Writing is taken as matter of course; poems come out straight out of the author’s mouth, fully formed like Athena emerging from Zeus’s forehead.

Bright Star doesn’t dismiss the notion of divine inspiration, but it does not tacitly take it for granted either; on the contrary, it acknowledges and articulates it (“If poetry does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree, then it had better not come at all”). Moreover, even though it declares “Poetic craft is a carcass, a sham,” it does so perhaps out of modesty (after all, “A poet is not at all poetical. He is the most un-poetical thing in existence. He has no identity”), before diving right into the crux of the craft itself (“A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not work the lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and emboldens the soul to accept mystery”).

This is all great stuff, and writer/director Jane Campion displays a sincere love for poetry with which she infuses her characters (who not only commit their favorite poems to memory, but can even recite verbatim from literary reviews). The problem is that her cast themselves are un-poetical and have no identity, and while this might serve them well in their poetic endeavors, as characters it renders them dull and unappealing; Ben Wishaw is wishy-washy as John Keats, and although credit is due Campion for not depicting him as a proto-rockstar (unlike, for instance, Leo DiCaprio’s Rimbaud in Total Eclipse), she loses many points for portraying Keats’s romantic interest Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) as a proto-groupie (early on, in order to impress him, she quotes some of Keats’s verses back to him, as if he weren’t familiar enough with his own work).

I’m aware that an artist’s love life, or lack thereof, tends to inform his creative output, but the romance between Wishaw and Cornish is so corny and mushy that we can’t believe such saccharine sentiment could ever translate into Keats’s sublime lyricism. Only Paul Schneider as the sardonic Charles Armitage Brown, Keats’s fellow poet, comes across as a sensible person who can tell the difference between poetry and real life; he starts out as boorish for the sake of boorishness, but he grows on us the more we realize that his contempt for the shallow Fanny is well-deserved (I especially enjoyed when he tricks her with a question about Paradise Lost’s non-existent rhymes)."

There are some rough patches, but overall, it's not a bad film. “Paranormal Activity” is shot in a found footage format, with believable acting and some effective scares. The film brilliantly capitalizes on the concept that what's scariest isn't often what you see, but what you imagine, and it does so effectively. However, that is about all it has going for it; it is not really terrifying, the story is as ordinary as it possibly could be, and the conclusion leaves a lot to be desired. If you have some time to kill, you probably will not regret checking it out, but I personally don't think it's worth going out of one's way to do so. || Decent movie but could have better.

Whilst there is the traditional deference you'd expect from children to parents, it soon becomes clear that the mother - especially - is no stickler for protocol, and her questioning of her son and his wife (whose own relationship is at times quite strained) about their own baby plans soon leads us to further exploration of all the aspirations and demons of those gathered around the table. It has been probably twenty years since my family had any sort of cross-generational repast, and there are certainly parts of this that ring true as the personalities of all concerned - even the youngsters - start to impose themselves on the ordinarily structured lives of all gathered together. That brings an authenticity to the scenario. There are no fights, tantrums, or squabbles - but it is clear from our observations that there are soft, vulnerable, points in each of their characters and that all of them are looking to the future in differing (and shorter-term) ways.

In Taiji, there is a place called the Cove. It is a secret place, a place where 23,000 dolphins are killed every year. The dolphins are not just killed, they are in fact slaughtered in the most brutal way imaginable. And all this without anyone really knowing that it goes on.

I've heard of dolphins being killed in the nets when they catch tuna, but I've never thought that people actually hunted down dolphins as a source of food. Dolphins, like any whale really, seem a bit too majestic and mysterious to just slaughter like pigs and cows, at least to me. And if this movie is to be believed, they can also be quite dangerous to eat, as they contain a high amount of mercury.

This movie is a documentary, focused around a signle event, where we actually see the slaughter of the dolphins. We see how the crew set up the cameras in the middle of the night, as well as how they scout out the area and plan the entire event. But more interesting than all that, we also meet Ric O'berry, one of the original actors and trainers from the tv show Flipper, who has now devoted his life to stopping the killing and abuse of dolphins. Being part of Flipper, and the one who actually caught the dolphins to appear on that show, he feels personal responsible for starting this whole mess. Of course, it would most likely have happened anyways, but we feel his pain.

As a documentary, this is really well made. It is constructed much like a movie, but doesn't become too emotional, except at the very end, where we see Ric telling his story to the world, silently and with a screen on his belly.

_Last words... I am not a big dolphin lover or anything, but this movie still got to me by the end, because... this seems so pointless. I dont think the dolphins are in any danger of being extinct anytime soon, but still, these creatures are mysterious and might have something to teach us, and for that, they deserve to be treated differently._ || There is something pretty harrowing about this documentary and it's definitely not for the squeamish. It follows a clandestine investigation by some American conservationists who suspect that a remote cove near the Japanese town of Taiji is being used by local fisherman to kettle and then slaughter hundreds of dolphins. Facing the hostility of the locals and the authorities, the team are determined to capture video evidence of this atrocity and so using state of the art technology and quite a bit of legerdemain, they attempt to infiltrate the highly secure locale to obtain it. In the course of their planning, we are made aware of the role the International Whaling Commission has in policing the fishing of cetaceans around the world, and plausible assertions are made that Japan is using financial and economic muscle to attract new members to it's fold so they can have it's long-term bans reversed or a least modified. We are also advised of the dangers of mercury within the food chain, and of the dangers of consuming dolphin meat as children - frequently when it is ill-defined on the packaging and/or disguised as something else. There's fairly clear complicity from the authorities demonstrated here, usually presented in the name of tradition and to an extent this documentary rather sneers at that. These are centuries-old fishing communities that quite possibly have always fished like this. That's not to excuse their current, brutal, practices - but what this does lack is a little of the historical context in which these fishermen behave and which might possibly explain some of their government's broader strategy in a nation that looks, like many other island nations, to the sea for the bulk of it's food. At times it uses the imagery as a bit of a blunt instrument to make a point that would also benefit from augmentation by debate. It's thought provoking and well worth a watch, but maybe just a little too simplistic in it's broad-brush philosophy."

A very unique Scandinavian-English language film from the technical aspect. The only one kind in the whole world which is actually an experimental product from the new productions. It was made primarily using photoshop, and then adobe after effects for animation. If you're wondering what kind it is, actually a 2.5D animation, that means it is neither 2D or 3D, but between those two. Like tricking the 2D object as the 3D material.

Well they have succeeded to bring a visually impressive animation that mainly focused on the film character faces. The story was decent which is another dystopian concept where metro trains are the main content, hence it is called 'Metropia'. But the title also means 'visual refraction', that's what the story is slightly related too.

Anyway, it was very suspenseful till the final and mostly talking drama than physical action sequences.

Trick 'r Treat is written and directed by Michael Dougherty. It stars Dylan Baker, Rochelle Aytes, Anna Paquin and Brian Cox. Music is by Douglas Pipes and cinematography by Glen MacPherson. Trick 'r Treat plays out as an anthology of four Halloween related stories. One tiny figure with a burlap sack over its head links the film together.

Warner Brothers kept it on the shelf for two years, a mistake since it happens to be a delightful little frightener that appears to be made with a love of omnibus shockers from back in the day. It's never overtly scary or bloody, but it has a twisted slickness that is rather pleasing in this day and age of poor horror remakes and boorish cash cow sequels. Neatly performed by the cast and with tech credits high from the camera folk, it homages simple horror pleasures as it celebrates Halloween. With a glint in its eye and a macabre smile on the lips, this non linear treat should be perennial viewing for the Halloween hordes. Especially since it rewards still further on repeat viewings. 8/10 || A better-than-expected horror anthology with some creepy good Halloween scares. || I love anthologies. A well told short story is better than a long story arc or a drawn-out character study way more often than not. So, when **Trick 'R Treat** came along, it proved to me that while it's not something the majority of the population wants to see, there are filmmakers out there who still value the format. 

It's too bad then that **Trick 'R Treat** wasn't more of a treat. It looks great and it has its entertaining moments. I mostly enjoyed the story of an odd girl who gets her revenge from some unlikely assistants and a man who has to deal with a strange trick or treater. Unfortunately, these stories aren't the most original things you'll ever see. They are more a tribute to urban legends and other Halloween clichés. The way that the four stories are intertwined is different. It's not a _Creepshow_-style format as there is nothing that truly divides the stories. **Trick 'R Treat** is well done but it's not particularly exciting."

Perfect for not thinking much and enjoying, without having to suffer all the stereotypes. || Be your own hero! Go Babe Ruthless!

Whip It is directed by Drew Barrymore and adapted for the screen by Shauna Cross from her own novel, Derby Girl. Barrymore also co-stars alongside Ellen Page, Alia Shawkat, Marcia Gay Harden, Kristen Wiig, Juliette Lewis, Jimmy Fallon, Daniel Stern and Landon Pigg.

Bliss Cavendar (Page) is a bored teenage girl stuck in a rut in Bodeen, Texas. Her life consists of working at the ""Oink Joint"" restaurant and entering beauty contests to please her mother (Harden). Along with her friend Pash (Shawkat), she dreams of escaping to a better life. Then one day during a trip out to Austin, the girls get wind of Roller Derby, a sport for girls played on roller-skates. Intrigued they go and take in a match and Bliss is hooked straight away, it's tough, competitive and even edgy. Telling a lie about her age, Bliss decides to try out for the ""Hurl Scouts"" and gets a place on the team as ""Babe Ruthless"". Thanks to her ability the ""Scouts"" start to turn around their season, however, with a new boyfriend on the scene and her parents unaware of her secret life, Bliss' new found happiness could come crashing down around her.

In spite of some favourable critical assessments, Drew Barrymore's directing debut barely made a dent at the box office. Just about making its money back on World gross, the figures would lend you to believe that the film simply isn't very good. Plot synopsis doesn't suggest anything out of the ordinary - yet another coming-of-age teenager picture, and one that is sports based, and even more formulaic than that, the sports team at the centre of proceedings is an underdog too! Throw into the equation that it's a female based movie and it's not really a film crying out for all demographics - or is it? Barrymore herself was very disappointed with the marketing for her movie, the general feeling being that it was sold as a girls sports love story type picture. She's absolutely right, it was marketed badly, and it barely had a run on the big screen in most countries. Which is a shame because Whip It is a smashing film, a picture that's vibrant, funny and not without dramatic worth - and yes! it's accessible for any age, sex or gender persuasion. Cross' script is fresh and free of filler and the cast all turn in jolly good shows, ranging from the excellent (Page/Gay Harden) to the engaging (Shawkat/Lewis/Wiig) and the funny (Stern/Fallon). OK, so it's not perfect, Barrymore is no Tony Scott when it comes to shooting action (some of the actual derby matches are confusing and not flowing), and maybe a bit more back story flesh for the other ""Hurl Scouts"" wouldn't have gone amiss? But these are minor itches at the beginning of what is hoped to be a long career in directing for Madame Barrymore.

With names like Jabba the Slut, Smashley Simpson and Iron Maven, it's evidently a film full of fun vim and vigour. But as great as that is (girls in skirts on skates belting each other around a track), the coming-of-age drama at its core should not be understated either. 8/10 || Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I've actually been to some of the Austin locations and seen that roller rink: it's a pretty cool place with a powerful vibe to the room.

I've really had enough of pagentry, it just feels very boring, so maybe it was the perfect way to start this movie.  It's a very cliche ""I don't want your life"" beginning, but grounding the establishing act in that foundation really takes us on a journey of growth in this ""finding of self"" (possibly a ""coming of age"", but no really) story.  When something grabs our interests, even on a weird flyer, or a pair of skates, we should pay attention, and the smaller the thing is that calls out to you, the more you should pay attention.

Roller derby is a bad ass little sport, and maybe ""no one gets famous"" or ""successful"" from it, but it looks fun and I'm sure the people that do it love it.  While the roller derby aspect is great, and the romantic plot lines are good, and the best friend angle is really good (just realizing how multi-threaded this movie actually is), it is the self discovery, the character growth of Bliss (thanks to Ellen Page's powerful delivery) of being a person that we can barely hear, to being someone how is able to yell for what she wants, delivery a hit, and be a literal poster child.

The movie honestly makes me envious: while I'd like to be an attractive tough girl, sure, to find a passion while you still have time to enough to enjoy it, to find people to guide and support that passion, and then compete and find adversity from people twice your age is an amazing thing all to itself.

I'll never be a ""roller derby girl"", but I know I can always come live vicariously through this movie."

It's an addiction. And you have to kill the addict to kill the addiction. 

I first viewed Surrogates upon its home format release and positively found it very ordinary. Viewing it again, with focus and in solitude, it proved to be a far better experience.

The action scenes are what you would expect for a multi-plex appeasing popcorner, loud, colourful and owing great debt to modern technology. Yet to dismiss this totally as one of those easy money making blockbuster movies is most unfair.

Surrogates oozes intrigue, even if it doesn't quite deliver on the smartness written on the page. The idea that in the future robotic alter egos can carry out our everyday mundane functions is cracker-jack, and it opens up a whole can of berserker worms. 

This is not merely an excuse to have Bruce Willis running around exploding surrogate robots, as much fun as that is of course, there's a deeper emotional core pulsing away as Willis fights the good fight to make sure being human is not cast aside like a thing of the past, that as flawed as we are, hiding away in a surrogate is not the answer.

This axis of the story is beautifully realised by the plot strand involving Willis and Rosamund Pike as his wife, with both actors doing fine work to give it the required emotional heft. It may ultimately lose itself to a standard conspiracy plot, but there's intelligence within to make Surrogates a better film than it first appears. 7/10 || Surrogates (2009) takes an interesting concept, people living through robotic avatars, and turns it into a straightforward action thriller. The plot is easy to follow, with a few twists along the way, but it never really digs deep into the bigger questions it could have explored. The movie has a polished look, and the visual effects for the surrogates are decent for the time, making them feel just artificial enough. The directing keeps the pacing tight, but the script doesn't do much beyond moving the story from one action scene to the next. There's a moment or two where it tries to be thought-provoking, but it doesn’t fully commit.

Bruce Willis does what he always does, playing the tough, weary protagonist, but there’s not much character depth to work with. The supporting cast does fine, but nothing really stands out. Ving Rhames' presence adds some weight to the film, but the dialogue overall is just serviceable. The score is typical for an action thriller, doing its job without being memorable. The cinematography is solid, with some good action sequences, but it doesn’t do anything particularly unique. The movie is entertaining enough, but if you were hoping for something as layered as I, Robot, this one doesn’t quite reach that level. Still, it’s a decent watch if you're in the mood for a simple, action-driven sci-fi flick."

I haven't seen Zombieland in quite a few years, but with its sequel being released this week, now it's the perfect moment to go back to the hilarious world of zombies. It still holds up incredibly well. In a time where zombie films and TV shows were starting to come up (The Walking Dead premiered one year later), this post-apocalyptic zombie comedy flick still remains as one of the best zombie movies of the century. Their use quickly became something cliche, and neither funny or scary. Nowadays, people are used to seeing the living dead on the screen all the time, so why does a 2009's film like this still work?

Well, first of all, the outstanding cast is halfway through success. In 2009, only Woody Harrelson was already a renowned adult actor. Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg didn't star in anything truly remarkable yet, so much that Abigail Breslin was more recognizable than them. Even with only 13-years-old, she already had an Oscar nomination in a supporting role (Little Miss Sunshine). However, everyone delivers fantastic performances, which carry the simplistic yet entertaining story to such a success that it became a zombie classic.

Harrelson portraying Tallahassee, the guy who's not scared of anything and likes to ""enjoy the little things"", is one of his career's coolest roles. Eisenberg is not exactly the type of actor I like since he can only do so much with his acting abilities. He always offers the same type of character: a quirky, twitch-full, idiosyncratic personality, which most of the times doesn't work. Contrary to this tendency, Columbus is a character that logically and hilariously fits this model, hence Eisenberg is the movie's primary source of comedy. From his list of rules to his weird behavior, everything feels natural since the character's background justifies his awkward self.

Stone and Breslin share great moments together, as well as Harrelson and Eisenberg, but the former duo has less exciting sequences. Nevertheless, even though the girls could have received more character development, their relationship gives them a compelling reason for us to care about. Wichita might just look like the cliche hot girl who falls for the good guy, but she would do anything to protect her sister, and her love for Little Rock does give her some gravitas. The cast's chemistry is undeniably astonishing. It's visually palpable that they had tons of fun doing this film, and that elevates every single conversation or action scene.

The short runtime allows for a fast-paced story, packed with fun moments, and a lot of bloody zombie killings. The production design is remarkable. Excellent use of practical effects and real sets, plus a perfect soundtrack. Ruben Fleischer knew precisely what he wanted the movie to be, and he never tried to make it something more. Yes, it still involves a romance of sorts, and some backstories might not be funny or joyful. However, it never feels forced or fabricated. It never overextends its stay because Zombieland is neither a romance or a drama. It's purposefully campy, plays with stereotypes creatively, and it's merely 88 minutes of good fun. We are in 2019, and studios forgot how to make films like this!

Every year, there are dozens of blockbusters that would be extremely entertaining if studios would just let them be what they are meant to, but no. They need to have some relevant story that carries a political tone or a social message. Zombieland has all the attributes of a pure blockbuster: a phenomenal cast, a straightforward narrative packed with thrilling sequences, a short runtime with fast pacing, compelling characters, and thousands of zombies. Put together a funny screenplay filled with chuckle-worthy jokes, and you have yourself one of the best zombie movies of the century. It's one of those films which don't exactly have what people address as ""flaws"". Zombieland has its cliches and lazy exposition, but it heavily compensates them with 80 minutes or so of spectacular entertainment. It's a zombie cult classic. Nut up or shut up, but watch the goddamn movie!

Rating: A- || **Zombieland is a hilarious treat for comedy and zombie fans alike.**

Zombieland is a goofy spin on the hordes of zombie movies that came as a result of The Walking Dead’s popularity. It follows a zany cast of characters with big personalities thrust into a post-apocalyptic landscape. However, rather than living in constant fear and survival, it feels as if the characters consider it all another Tuesday. Their motivations are finding twinkies or love rather than escaping death. This tonal twist leads to a very entertaining, self-aware plot that takes funny jabs at traditional zombie tropes. The cast nails this tone as well, with Harrelson, Eisenberg, and Stone all delivering sarcastic yet genuine and caring performances."

There's something very natural not just about Mulligan's performance here, but also about her burgeoning relationship with a man who knows just which buttons to press. He's not a nasty man, he has no agenda to get her straight into bed, indeed he seems just as dependent on having this young woman around to make him feel alive as she does him; and those characterisations proves quite effective. The star for me, though, was probably Molina. He portrays almost perfectly a father whose dreams for his daughter partnered with his own middle-class mores leaves him caught between his paternal instincts to protect his daughter and his ambitions that she live a better, more fulfilled, life than he. It does run out of steam a little at the end, but then again I'm not quite sure how I would have wanted it to conclude without copping out - one way or another, so maybe it is for the best.

That said, Tautou rarely puts a foot wrong and does go some way to convince - despite the over scripting and underwhelming screenplay, and there's an hint of chemistry with Nivola too.

I picked up this movie by chance, right at the beginning, and I watched it. I liked the style, the atmosphere, and the fact is that the film turned out to be very good. The film begins when a boxer, who should have lost a fight, decides not to comply with the agreement, harming some mobsters, who go after him to kill him. In order to escape and hide, he enlists in the Foreign Legion and goes to Morocco, where he will have to survive a commission in times of war.

Jean Claude Van Damme really surprised me with his work, completely outside of what he has accustomed us to. I don't even like this actor very much, and I really enjoyed watching him work in this film! It is, for me, the best film of Van Damme's career to date, and excellent proof that he can do better, and differently, when he wants to. I also enjoyed seeing Nicholas Farrell, Steven Berkoff, Jim Carter and Daniel Caltagirone.

The script is not complicated and also not original, but it works very well and gives us a good story, which never feels like a mere excuse to send the character to fight in Morocco. It's a good action movie, a movie that takes itself seriously and does its best to be taken seriously by the public. There is a good set of sets, excellent costumes, a legitimate and serious effort to recreate the historical period with some accuracy. The filming locations were also meticulously selected and are magnificent, something cinematography is no stranger to. Indeed, the film has magnificent colors and was well shot. In addition to all this, it is worth listening to the soundtrack, where the melody “Mon Legionaire” stands out clearly. || **_Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure in the Moroccan desert_**

In 1925, a boxer in Marseille (Van Damme) makes some big enemies and so joins the French Foreign Legion in which he’s assigned to Morocco during the Rif war to defend a desert outpost against Abd el Krim’s Berber guerillas.

“Legionnaire” (1998) begins like “The Cotton Club” (1984) before settling into a plot reminiscent of “The Dirty Dozen” (1967) with the North African milieu of “March or Die” (1977) or “Khartoum” (1966), not to mention an ending similar to “The Alamo” (1960).

Like “The Flight of the Phoenix” (1965) and “Lawrence of Arabia” (1962), this is a movie involving the challenges of sweaty men in the vast, beautiful desert. As such, don’t look for many, if any, women in the proper cast, although Ana Sofrenovic has a small role. 

While this lacks the martial arts action of most Van Damme flicks, there are plenty of fights and military combat. The opening sequence in Marseilles is well done and the desert cinematography is both colorful and breathtaking. I was expecting a low-budget affair, but was impressed by the production values. Although not a blockbuster, it cost $20 million in 1997 when it was shot, which is nothing to sneeze at.

Unfortunately, the story isn’t as dramatically compelling as “The Dirty Dozen,” “The Flight of the Phoenix,” “Lawrence of Arabia” or “The Alamo.” The script needed another rewrite or two to flesh out some depth. As it is, a couple of the villains are too comic booky and the black character (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who’s stalwart in the role) is the cliched American that’s (supposedly) ever so hurt by white American society. It smacks of Lib Hollywood propaganda and is just hackneyed & eye-rolling.

The film runs 1 hours, 39 minutes, and was shot in Morocco.

Right?

Gerard Butler stars as Clyde Shelton, a man forced to not only watch his wife and daughter be raped and murdered in his own home, but to also have to sit there and watch the justice system fail him. So he wages a one man war against pretty much everyone involved. 

Hoo-Hah! The big hitting critics hated it, with comments ranging from it being sub-normal, preposterous, ugly and morally corrupt, to it being a comic book film of moral hectoring! Naturally, as the critics were at pains to point out that it would, it made a pot load at the box office and is generally well liked by a good portion of the action/revenge/thriller loving populace.

There’s always a big grey area with revenge/vigilante movies that really brings out the debate crowd, but what rarely gets said is that through the actions of these cinematic waste layers is the chance for many, many, folk to live vicariously. Yes! 99% of the common man and woman do indeed sit back and trust our respective legal systems to do what’s right and just, but oh how we feel that given similar circumstances we would want to vent spleen with furious anger.

Law Abiding Citizen is a riot, at its heart it does have something to say, even asking some pertinent questions. Do these social smarts come bursting through the bloody haze to make a point? No, they get submerged in a whirl of kinetic fury and socko violence, but they are there, caustically so. But hey! For shocks, twists and outrageous set-pieces, this picture rocks the big one. Vicarious living through cinema – wonderful. 8/10 || Not the ending I wanted

Some movies you want the bad guy to win and this is one of them. There's a few things missing here, like the setup that Clyde is really this smart inventor guy leading a double life. That could've used some secret door behind a front working in a lab kind of shots. And that Nick Rice is actually smarter, cause he wasn't. Other than that, it does keep you on your toes, mostly to see what Clyde comes up with and how he's going to fix the broken justice system."

Am I philosopher?

It's hard to understand weird people. Oh, actually, I'm weird. It's hard to understand normal people. I've been depressed for a great deal of time. Not depressed like: ”oh, I'm not feeling okay now. But everything is okay”. It's something like: “I'm feeling very bad, and sad; probably I'm considered as I am freak. But I consider others as being freaks. I'm not depressed because of weirdness – it's because of life, as it is”. Uncertainly, I'm both Mary and Max.

The first – my state of mind.
Unbearable pressure in head, which I almost can't put literally vertical on my head. It's pretty hard, considering it's mass. I feel like an invisible ghost pushes my head and makes my eyes falling down. Teeth and jaw are stiff. I'm going to sleep. It's the most comfortable way to make reality become unreal and relaxing. I'm crying when the story of the sense of life is being said. I'm smiling when there are people around me. It's a spontaneous reaction. Probably because I'm Max in my mind, Mary in my soul.

People probably wrongly understand depression; or more precisely – they have no idea how actually it functions for real, in mind of attached person. They think they are mad, or they're pretending something wrong is happening- “depression is nothing serious”.

I'm Mary:
I'm ready to finish my living, to kill myself, to die in the full coldness of the life. There is no good person in the world, there is no sense of
life, there is no hapinnes in the world, there is nothing funny to do. But I won't do this. Medicines are really useful. They're changing our brain. I want to be in a closed room, I don't want to eat, I hardly ever sleep, but I'm tired. My willing is just to make me being physically smaller, to become a dot in a nowhere and to forget about everything. I have headaches. I almost haven't eaten anything for a couple a days, I'm sad, unsuccessful, bad in every possible way. There is no meaningless of living. We've been born. We're going to dye. We're nothing. I'm isolated, obsessed with horrible thoughts, (horrible from my point of view). These thoughts are as normal as they could be. I'm right but
nobody understands me. Acting happiness and smiling and funny person makes me feeling even worse after a while. The first thing I'm going to do is to push walls around me, to make me feel pain, to be alone and to do nothing – because, there is nothing to do. The only one friend I believed in disappointed me. Nobody cares. The next state is that I would try to be “normal”. I'm buying stupid cosmetics instead of going to travel. I'm talking to people, doing this as they do. Pretending being cool and perfect. Funny. Communicative. Everything went bad because it's not me. Go ahead!

Now, I'm Max:
Einstein said there were only two infinite things: cosmos and one's stupidity. I agree with him. I am different, I'm maybe even smart, I'm trying to understand the world. Maybe others are, too. Different, and also triers. I like chocolate, I don't have friends, there is no justice in the world. Anxiety and changing mood are no so simple things. Feeling are unpredictable, emotions are strong. Emotions are strong but undefined. I gave up. My psychiatrist is giving me instructions how to act in real life. “This is good, this is bad, in this situation you have to cry, in this to laugh, in this to imitate some nerd.” I was even using small notebook where I wrote “acting explanations”. I met Mary, but who cares. I'm used to living on my own. There is no friend. I am distanced form everyday life, like there is invisible barrier between me and others. It makes me being special; but obviously not in a good way.

We're now good friends. She is the best one for me; but also the only one. Oh, there are more freaks here. Haha. Impossible. She understands my needs, my mind, my reactions, my way of viewing stuff.

The second – don't worry. Robots are walking down the streets. Everyone is the same as the others. They define themselves as normal guys. Just define, don't worry. You can define them as you want The left person is copy of the right one. Everyone is the same. Everyone
has striped hair, blue narrow jeans, the equal brains, the equal opinion.
It's easier acting like they are acting. Just go down the street, listen to the others, turn off your mind, point of view the world and your charm. Just be like others. Be stupid. Be robot. I'm starting to believe Einstein. This is not myth he's very smart. But also you need to be good. Brave, beautiful, funny, intelligent, popular,...(just kidding) ;)

Be who you are, and help humanity. And believe there are also people worth respecting, because they are not robots. You just have to find them. Also they'll find you. They exist. Look bright, go straight. We're here and we can't run out of it. Imagine our life is one adventure we are lucky to have chance to play in. You're not a weirdo. Just go on, enjoy the adventure, be yourself, even when you have to be pathetic as I am now. :) After that, sense of life will come to you; you don't have to search so much! Just relax ;)

Let the game begin!

Reilly over the years, in everything from 'Hoffa' and 'Dolores Claiborne' when he was developing his craft, to 'Step Brothers' and 'Carnage', in which he was one of the leading actors that the film was centered on, I really wanted this film to work for me, though I feel in this recent glut of cinema spawned from Hollywood's post-'Twilight' obsession with vampires, that someone really needs to give this trend a coffin rest, at least for a while so creative fires can have a chance to rekindle--it seems to have been done to death. I'm sure this wasn't what Bram Stoker had in mind with his original 'Dracula'. There's nothing in these recent CGI-bloated messes meaty enough to sink one's teeth into. I'm sure Dr. Alucard himself is cursing the day he was granted immortality, if only to avoid his local multiplex, for this very reason.

Like another recent film I tried to get into, but basically flew off the rails in an enormous video game-like tidal wave of effects I neither wanted nor needed to see ('Your Highness' by David Gordon Green), the filmmakers ill-advisedly thought that the audience had to be captivated by fights and chases galore, but it's like seeing yet another explosion in a Michael Bay movie: Just give me: a) Great presence in an actor, for once, like the Sir Christopher Lees, Sir Peter Cushings, Vincent Prices, Boris Karloffs and Bela Lugosis of yesteryear; b) A story worth telling; and c) A director who knows a thing or two about storytelling--otherwise, I'd rather boycott drinking blood, and simply switch, at least for contemporary film, to a different cup of tea. I'm not surprised whatsoever that this didn't do well at the box office, and that filmmakers decided not to continue with the franchise. Even for vampires, sometimes enough is enough for a lifetime. || I found this movie pretty much by accident when flicking through the Netflix catalogue. I thought what the heck and started to watch it. My hopes were really not that high. Actually I am not sure I had any hopes at all since I just stumbled on the movie and started to watch it on a whim. What I found was a rather okay and fun movie actually.

The movie is apparently based on popular book series Cirque du Freak by Darren Shan. Unfortunately, in their usual arrogant manner, the Hollywood moguls decided to rip the books appart and mash together book one and two in this movie. It appears the general consensus is, not surprisingly, that the books are better than the movie. Nevertheless, the movie was good enough that I most probably will have a go at reading at least one of the books in the series.

The movie itself then? Actually I liked it more than I expected. It took a little while before it got started but once it got going it was a good teenage magical fantasy adventure. I am actually a bit saddened that it appears there was never any sequels using the other books in the series.

The name Cirque du Freak is well chosen. This is not the usual bunch of people with magical abilities or fangs or some of the other attributes you usually see in magic or supernatural movies. The members of the Cirque are freaks in every sense of the word. I do not think I have seen such a bunch of weird and bisarre creatures before. Heck, the vampire that takes Darrel as his assistant is probably the most normal of the bunch.

The story is quite okay and the acting acceptable. The vampire, Creepsly, felt a bit underwhelming at first but he grew on me. So did Mr. Tiny who I definitely didn’t like at first but found doing quite a good job of playing the evil mastermind towards the end. His sleaziness was downright creepy.

I am sure a lot of the story and character development from the books were left out because there is so much more that could have been done with the story. Darrel befriending the snake man, the brewing romance, Darrels relation with Creapsley and all the other interactions and characters that took place. If the producer had wanted to do a good job he could easily have added another 40 minutes to the movie. A shame he did not.

Bottom line, watching this movie was a pleasant experience. It is perhaps not a blockbuster but a nice little adventure, magic, supernatural and fantasy gem. || A teen joins a freak circus where he encounters a war between vampires

RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Marco Brambilla, ""Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant"" is a fantasy/horror/comedy about a teen (Chris Massoglia) who is compelled to join a circus of freaks where he becomes (you guessed it) the assistant of a vampire (John C. Reilly) and learns of a war between two classes of vampires. Josh Hutcherson is on hand as his best friend while Michael Cerveris plays the mysterious Mr. Tiny. Ray Stevenson is formidable as a vampiric heavy.

After the mega-hit of “Twilight” (2008), producers naturally thought that another young adult book series involving vampires might be profitable. As such, this movie is based on the opening trilogy of the 12-book series “Cirque du Freak: The Saga of Darren Shan” by Darren Shan (pen name of Darren O'Shaughnessy). It mostly focuses on the first book with uber-fans of the books complaining about deviations. In any case, the film wasn’t a hit at the box office (costing $40 million and making back $39 million worldwide with $14 million of that made in North America). Regardless, I much prefer it to “Twilight.”

For some reason I always enjoy stories that center around life in circuses and carnivals. The excellent “Water for Elephants” (2011) is a good example. While that movie was decidedly realistic, “The Vampire’s Assistant” is obviously rooted in fantasy.

The first act is a low-key introduction to the two teen friends, their situation in life, and their intriguing visit to the Cirque Du Freak, which in English means The Freak Circus. The film improves in the second act with the excellent character of Larten Crepsley moving to the spotlight. Reilly is commanding and fascinating in the role. The third act is also really good, centering on the war between the vampires and the vampanese. The plot is involved enough without being too complex and the movie is impressively imaginative on practically every front.

Salma Hayek stands out in the female department as one of the performers with a lame talent. But the creators don’t really take advantage of her presence. In other words, don’t expect anything like Salma’s mind-blowing sequence in “From Dusk till Dawn” (1996). The striking Jane Krakowski is on hand, but her role is very small. Winsome Jessica Carlson plays Rebecca, a potential babe for the protagonist, I guess; she was only 15 during shooting and looks it.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot in Louisiana (New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Folsom) and Los Angeles with studio work done in Universal City.

Humbug!” Zemeckis had always been fascinated with digital cinema. ‘The Polar Express’ was technological innovation at its more pure, yet ‘Beowulf’ stabbed itself through contrived art direction that failed to suit the dark environment it was showcasing. So when he heard the “House of Mouse” were adapting Dickens’ universally known tale (again...), he clearly joyfully jumped at the chance of producing more digital art. The inevitable question though is: why? Does a Victorian-era Christmas story warrant the unrefined technological advancement of motion capture? Yes and no, is the answer.

The tale itself remains intact, following closer to Dickens’ words than any other adaptation that preceded this. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge encounters various spirits that show the repercussions of his selfish acts, in a bid to rid the evils of ignorance and want. I’ve seen it. You’ve seen it. Your nan has definitely seen it. And probably your pet dog too. Whether it be live-action, Mickey Mouse or The Muppets, you have almost indefinitely seen an adaptation of this famous novella. It’s an important moral that warrants the several iterations over the course of cinema, teaching families the significance of generosity and Christmas spirit.

Much like its source material however, it’s a dark tale. Ghostly ghouls visiting an elderly lonely man, including his deceased business partner entrapped in shackles and the shadow of Sauron succumbing Scrooge to the depths of Mordor’s burning fires. Zemeckis took the core tone of Dickens’ novella and merged it with Disney’s typical holiday whimsicality. The end result? Inconsistent. It’s either too dark for children or too joyous for adults. The two jarring tones rarely worked, producing a conflicting adaptation. One moment Scrooge is dealing with a prostitute dragged away in a straining jacket. The next scene? Children having a snowball fight to the merry notes of Silvestri’s score. Neither producing an entirely cheerful Christmas flick or faithful replication. I’d rather have a 15-rated horror adaptation of A Christmas Carol, as intended of course.

Now for the motion capture. It is what it is I suppose. A technical achievement for its time, utterly outdated a decade later. Character models were stilted. Eyes lacked any expression whatsoever. When close to candle lighting, resembled waxworks. The Ghost of Christmas Past just looked terrible, with its face mismatching the rest of its anthropomorphic candle body. Environmentally speaking, the scenery and inanimate objects were stunningly designed. It really felt like Christmas in Victorian-era London. Just a shame that Zemeckis only tested the limitations of animation through scenes of padding. Scrooge chased by a grim reaper for five minutes. Scrooge flying around London for three minutes. Scrooge slowly becoming Jim Carrey for the film’s entirety. Seemed like additional efforts for gimmicky 3D extravaganza than actual substance.

Fortunately the voice acting was perfect. Carrey and his multitude of personas rarely matched Scrooge’s mundane lifestyle. But that’s why it worked so well! The various voices of the ghosts as well tested his voicing talent remarkably. Oldman as Cratchit added a touch of humility to the story, and again, suited the character perfectly.

A Christmas Carol is a smorgasbord of tonal clashes and technical anomalies. For every fantastic aspect is a tiresome trope. The gorgeous scenery design is counteracted by horrific motion capture. The source material’s darkness is restrained by forced whimsicality in an attempt to appeal to the masses. It’s not the ideal Christmas present I asked for, but I can make do with its contents. Bah! Humbug! || A tale that almost feels as old as time itself, one that is very much overtold. However, this <em>'A Christmas Carol'</em> is a good retelling of Charles Dickens' work.

Jim Carrey isn't necessarily firing on all cylinders, but is entertaining enough as Scrooge. Gary Oldman (Bob) and Colin Firth (Fred) are welcomed members of the voice cast, also.

I quite like the tone of the film, as well as the design of the animation - which isn't amazing, some parts look like what you'd see in a video game, but it works well to set up the ambience of the London surroundings.

There's good music from Alan Silvestri, too. Overall, I'd recommend it - admittedly I do enjoy the story of Ebenezer a lot. || It takes a bit of getting used to the rather angular style of animation, but thereafter this is quite an enjoyable adaptation of Charles Dickens' tale of the wealthy miser ""Scrooge"". He hates Christmas with a vengeance - all that good will malarkey - humbug! Luckily for his eternal soul, his long-dead partner ""Marley"" mysteriously appears and forewarns him of three visits he is going to receive in the early hours of Christmas morning. His past, his present and his future are going to flash before his eyes - all with a view to him realising the errors of his ways and changing for the better before it's all too late. The story is told in a similar fashion to Ronald Neame's version from 1970 - only without the music - and it's well paced with plenty of creative and expressive use of the animator's art to re-create a Victorian world of poverty, cold and generosity of spirit - even in the least likely of places. Robert Zemeckis has assembled a solid vocal cast to compliment the eerily life-like characterisations and although they can look a little sterile at times, this is still a worthwhile reimagining of an oft told story that keeps a tight hold on the reins for ninety minutes of dark festive fantasy with a message of joy and hope."

<em>'Fantastic Mr. Fox'</em> is a terrific stop motion animated film, which is unmistakably a piece of Wes Anderson's work. I enjoyed the whole film undoubtedly, though the first half is much stronger than the second. The opening piece of stop motion didn't actually fill me with confidence, but thankfully that immediately disappeared as the whole thing looks truly excellent.

George Clooney is great in this, definitely the most I've liked a performance (from what I've currently seen, of course) of his away from the <em>'Ocean's</em> flicks. Every member of the cast is top notch to be fair, from Bill Murray to Michael Gambon to Eric Anderson. Willem Dafoe is fun too. || Such a fun, uplifting movie. Even terrible actor George Clooney was perfect for the lead role. || The eponymous character lives with his wife and son in their foxhole under a great big tree.

What he doesn't think through is that these farmers are not dimwits. They know exactly who is pilfering from them and so determine to avenge themselves on him and his family by digging them out of their home and, well a siege and a trip to the sewers now ensue for the all of the subterranean families. George Clooney and Meryl Streep lead the vocal cast - and they are great - but for me, the star of the whole thing is Sir Michael Gambon's wonderful contribution as their principal, wonderfully odious, antagonist ""Bean"". The animation is simple and effective to watch and the writing is frequently pithy offering plenty for the older audience to take from this entertaining critique on responsibility, greed, revenge, loyalty - you name it, it's probably here somewhere. Roald Dahl had an amazing imagination and by imbuing the foxes with human traits (and the humans with some animal ones) here, he makes an whole load of attributes accessible to the audience in a more enjoyably tangential manner - traits that are not always honourable ones, neither. These role reversals work well and make you wonder if humanity is really just in the purview of people! Great fun."

Daardoor warmt de kern van de aarde met grote snelheid op wat zal leiden tot rampzalige gevolgen voor de planeet. Adrian haast zich terug naar de Verenigde Staten en waarschuwt Anheuser, stafchef van het Witte Huis, die op zijn beurt de president inlicht. Adrian maakt vanaf dan deel uit van de staf van de president en wordt gevraagd een schema te maken van de mogelijke gebeurtenissen die zullen plaatsvinden in de komende jaren.
In 2012 blijkt dat de president opdracht heeft gegeven om 8 grote arken te bouwen waarin 800.000 mensen op basis van DNA, expertise en wetenschap zich schuil zouden kunnen houden. Inmiddels weten ook alle leiders van de meeste landen in de wereld van dit plan af en worden er selecties gemaakt. Ondertussen komt Jackson Curtis in Los Angeles zijn kinderen ophalen bij zijn ex-vrouw Kate (die samenwoont met haar vriend Gordon). Hij neemt z'n kinderen mee naar Yellowstone National Park. Daar worden ze vervolgens meegenomen door het leger en ontmoeten Adrian, die hen de smoes voorlegt dat Yellowstone in moeilijkheden verkeert en daarom geen toeristen toestaat. Ook ontmoeten ze Charlie Frost, die een eigen radiozender heeft en Jackson vertelt dat de wereld binnenkort vergaat. Hij zegt erbij dat er een grote groep mensen is die plaats mag nemen in ""ruimteschepen"" waar hij de locatie van weet. Jackson brengt op verzoek van zijn ex-vrouw zijn kinderen terug naar L.A., alwaar hij hoort dat er een aardbeving heeft plaatsgevonden die een grote scheur in de aarde heeft veroorzaakt. In het Witte Huis wordt duidelijk dat het schema van Adrian sneller verloopt dan ze dachten, en dat door de grote hitte van de aardkern de mantel ook vloeibaarder is geworden, waardoor de aardkorst als het ware ""los"" kan drijven, en dus zal gaan verschuiven. Ook krijgen ze te horen dat er maar 4 arken op tijd klaar zullen zijn. Jackson wordt opgeroepen als chauffeur om de zoons van de Russische miljardair Yuri Karpov op te halen en ze naar het vliegveld te brengen. Hier laat één van de zoons per ongeluk los dat zij de rampen zullen overleven en Jackson niet. Met de informatie die Jackson al van Charlie kreeg, realiseert hij zich dat er inderdaad rampzalige dingen zullen gaan gebeuren, en hij rijdt terug naar L.A. om z'n familie op te halen. Hij gebruikt een vliegtuig en Gordon, die amateurpiloot is, is uiteindelijk gedwongen het vliegtuig te besturen wanneer hun piloot blijkt te zijn omgekomen. Terwijl ze opstijgen is de familie Curtis getuige van de complete verwoesting van Los Angeles. De stad verdwijnt door de aardkorstverschuiving volledig in de Stille Oceaan.
In het Witte Huis wordt Adrian verteld dat de aardkorstverschuiving voor honderden aardbevingen heeft gezorgd en al 2 miljoen slachtoffers heeft geëist. President Wilson geeft het bevel dat zijn personeel zo snel mogelijk het vliegtuig in moet om naar China te vertrekken, waar de ruimteschepen liggen. Hij onthult ook aan Adrian dat hij zelf niet mee zal gaan, omdat iemand de rest van de wereld op de hoogte zal moeten brengen van de komende rampen die tot het einde van de wereld zullen leiden. De president vindt dat hijzelf daar de aangewezen persoon voor is. Adrian gaat vervolgens met Anheuser en andere personeelsleden aan boord van een Air Force One. Jackson beseft intussen dat als ze het willen overleven, ze de locatie van de schepen moeten zien te achterhalen. Hij overtuigt Gordon er daarom van om naar Yellowstone te vliegen en Charlie te vinden, om zo de locatie van de ""ruimteschepen"" te achterhalen. Terwijl Gordon het vliegtuig bijvult met brandstof, gaat Jackson op zoek naar Charlie en vindt hem. Hij vertelt dat de kaart in zijn camper ligt. Jackson weet net op tijd weg te komen als de vulkaan onder Yellowstone plotseling uitbarst. De familie ontsnapt met het vliegtuig net op tijd aan de aswolken. Jackson ontdekt op de kaart dat ze naar China moeten en ze landen uiteindelijk in Las Vegas om nieuwe brandstof te tanken. Hier lopen ze Yuri en z'n gezin tegen het lijf. Hun vliegtuig is gecrasht. Yuri's piloot Sascha neemt vervolgens een oude Antonov An-225 over, maar heeft een co-piloot nodig, waardoor de familie Curtis en Gordon mee kunnen. Ze willen landen in Hawaï om meer brandstof te tanken, maar ontdekken dat Hawaï volledig is veranderd in een vulkanisch gebied. Ze zijn gedwongen verder te vliegen. Sascha voorspelt dat ze binnen 15 minuten in de Stille Oceaan zullen neerstorten. Wanneer hij door de wolken heen is, ziet hij dat waar de oceaan zou moeten zijn, een grote ijsmassa te vinden is. Jackson realiseert zich dat de aardkorstverschuivingstheorie werkelijk bestaat. Ze storten neer op een gletsjer waarbij Sascha omkomt. Vervolgens worden ze gevonden door Chinese troepen, die bezig zijn dieren over te brengen naar de schepen. De soldaten nemen Yuri en z'n kinderen mee wanneer hij zijn tickets laat zien. Daardoor blijven de familie Curtis, Gordon en Yuri's vriendin Tamara (die geen ticket had) achter. In China, bij de schepen, wordt duidelijk dat van één van de arken het dak is ingestort door de aardkorstverschuiving en wordt het Laura en Adrian duidelijk dat de passagiers helemaal niet op basis van DNA en wetenschap zijn gekozen, maar dat rijke mensen hun toegang hebben kunnen kopen: zij hebben per ticket 1 miljard euro neergeteld. Adrian wordt vervolgens door zijn Indiase collega opgebeld met de mededeling dat India op het punt staat overspoeld te worden door een gigantische tsunami. Hierdoor beseft Adrian dat de tsunami hen eerder zal bereiken dan gepland, en dat ze op moeten schieten. Wanneer Anheuser dit hoort, maakt hij de beslissing de poorten van de schepen eerder te sluiten, waardoor tienduizenden mensen, onder wie Yuri en zijn zoons, buitengesloten worden.
Jackson en z'n familie worden intussen opgepikt door een Tibetaanse monnik die op weg is naar de schepen om aan boord te gaan. Ze worden door diens broer aan boord gesmokkeld van een ark via de machinekamer en Jackson beseft dat de schepen geen ruimteschepen maar arken zijn. Ze komen vast te zitten wanneer de poorten weer zakken op bevel van Adrian, die de buitengesloten mensen toch wil binnenlaten. Gordon wordt tussen de tandwielen geslingerd en overlijdt, en tegelijk komt ook een drilboor vast te zitten tussen de motoren, waardoor de poort niet meer volledig kan sluiten. Yuri weet z'n kinderen net op tijd aan boord te krijgen, maar valt vervolgens zelf van het platform en sterft. Nu de poort niet meer volledig sluit, kan de bemanning de motoren niet starten. De tsunami komt al snel hun kant op en water begint de ark binnen te stromen, waarna de passagiers benedendeks door het water waden. Jackson en z'n gezin worden gesplitst doordat waterbestendige deuren sluiten. Daardoor komen zij in verschillende compartimenten terecht. Adrian ziet via de camera's dat Jackson aan boord is weten te komen en haast zich naar de compartimenten om hem en zijn familie te redden. Tamara, die alleen zit, verdrinkt al snel wanneer het water te hoog komt. Jackson hoort van Adrian dat de compartimenten alleen maar open kunnen gaan wanneer de boor uit de motoren wordt gehaald en het hele systeem weer werkt. Met hulp van z'n zoontje Noah weet Jackson dit voor elkaar te krijgen. De poort sluit weer zodat de motoren kunnen worden gestart en een botsing met de Mount Everest ternauwernood wordt voorkomen. Jackson en z'n familie maar ook de monniken worden bevrijd, en Jackson en Kate herenigen zich.
27 dagen later (datum: ""27ste dag van de eerste maand, jaar 0001"") krijgen de arken de eerste satellietfoto binnen, waaruit duidelijk wordt dat Afrika het enige continent is dat niet volledig is overstroomd. Het ligt nu zelfs hoger, waardoor de Drakensbergen nu de hoogste bergen ter wereld zijn. Uit metingen wordt duidelijk dat de lucht weer enigszins schoon is en dat de poorten van de arken kunnen worden geopend. Daardoor kan de mensheid voor het eerst sinds de overstroming weer naar buiten. || And the public gets what the public wants.

Roland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.

The carnage effects are grade ""A"" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.

2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun. And this even as you have to massage your buttocks at the two hour mark. 7/10 || If you like end of the world type movies, then this one is for you.

Sometimes the only solace this girl can take is when she imagines herself living a more glamorous, escapist, lifestyle - but those are merely momentary escapes from her tough urban existence. There might be a blessing from her latest pregnancy, though, as the school principal sees it as an opportunity to transfer her to a school where she might actually get some attention, feel more included and make some new friends. It's that evolving characterisation that the young Sidibe delvers potently here as she gradually begins to feel a little more empowered, finds some inner strength and courage and maybe even starts to see a corner she can turn. There's also something to be said for the less frequent but still quote powerful contributions of Mo'Nique as a mother whom, as the narrative develops, might not be so drastically different from her daughter and who is quite possibly just as lost and out of her depth. It's a film about appreciating self-worth more than anything, and though this particular scenario also adds racial tensions and a great deal of frustration and hopelessness, it isn't without a degree of optimism if the spirit is there - and it gets a little timely help now and again. It's a solid indictment of one-size-fits-all educational politics and proves that teaching is most definitely a vocation that requires vision, patience and understanding.

What's actually more effective here is the dialogue and quite intense style of photography. Violent and angry it is, yes - but these prisoners are victims too. Their protests against a brutal regime of solitary confinement have long since fallen on deaf ears, so this action is quite literally their last resort - just ask the previous occupant of cell 211!

A holistic doctor in the town of Ennis (Seagal) seeks to find a cure to a deadly disease unleashed by an unhinged paramilitary leader (Gailard Sartain). Meanwhile, a Federal biological response team seals off the area.

""The Patriot” (1998) smacks of a Western-in-the-modern-day, just meshed with elements of “Outbreak” from 3 years earlier. It’s no where near as compelling as that movie (which had twice the budget), but there’s quite a bit to appreciate, like the southwest Montana locations, the commentary on lethal viruses, the expected action sequences and the focus on medicinal plants & traditional medicine over popping pills, not to mention dubious vaccines.

Since Seagal is a Conservative who readily exposed the LIEberal “Russian Collusion” propaganda, I wouldn’t take the militia side plot as a demonization of militias or Conservatives. Seagal’s character in the story makes it clear that even a generally positive group of people can be tainted by a wacko leader and misled. The script simply needed a villain and, since there’s no ANTIFA-like groups in small town Montana, the writers opted for the easy target of a militia organization.

There’s a siege at the beginning reminiscent of the 51-day Waco siege in 1993, which involved the FBI & ATF’s controversial handling of the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh had visited Waco during that siege and later described the Fed fiasco as a major factor in his radicalization. I’m sure Gailard Sartain’s character in the story, Floyd Chisolm, was modeled after someone like McVeigh.

This marked the beginning of Seagal’s second decade as a lead actor (he starred in ten movies in the previous ten years, 1988-1997, not including his cameo in “My Giant”). The $25 million budget is quite less than the $60 million it cost to make “Under Siege 2,” but it’s way more than his more recent direct-to-video flicks, which cost $5-6 million or less. Yet $25 million is more than enough to make a competent picture, keeping in mind that his most famous film, “Under Siege,” only cost $5 million more than that.   

It runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Ennis, Montana, as well as nearby Bozeman, which is an hour’s drive to the northwest.

I love Robin Williams and Seth Green, but man, I don't know what is wrong with Travolta in this.  I'm not a big fan of his to begin with, but he's just a jackass.  Not only does he have a jerk character, but he looks like he's phoning it in too.  ""I'm here, I'm saying the lines.""

It wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't the lead character.  The movie is about THEIR business, and Robin's character's kids, but personality wise Robin has to play this push over character that can't do anything but take the punches, and he doesn't do abuse humor well.  He's known for absurd humor, that the situation is ridiculous and out of control, not that he's suffering from it persay.

I've also always like Robin William's connection to kids and that, at heart, he's a family guy.  This character that lives isolated from his kids, that can't be fun was a poor casting for him.

Honestly, looking at the story even, I don't know why anyone decided to make this, unless the right names made it happen, and they just left big blank spaces in the script that said, ""something ridiculous and funny"" and they just slotted in things like ""Seth Green gets adopted by a Guerilla"".

Don't waste your time with this unless you're just on a Robin Williams marathon for completionist sake. || I wanted this to be good, but it's anything but.

There is nothing I enjoyed about <em>'Old Dogs'</em>, every second of its 88 minute run time is a hard slog. Robin Williams and John Travolta are the only reasons that I haven't rated this even lower, I'm not saying those two are all that noteworthy in this but their acting ability raises things up ever so slightly.

The premise is incredibly lame and painstakingly predictable, while the comedy is very lazy - I didn't laugh once, there's not even a minutely chucklesome moment. There are some terrible attempted gags in there.

A major disappointment, I wanted to like this due to the two leads but I just couldn't. Dreadful film.

This film will always be remembered as the breakout role for the incredible Saoirse Ronan. It will also be remembered as one of the most controversial films ever made. People tend to break off into two camps: Team Salmon or Team Harvey.

It starts off innocently enough: a boy-crazy teenage girl in the 1970s is crushing on a man at school. It seems that he is interested in Susie too and despite the disparity in age, she falls for his charms, mostly due to his exchange student allure and suave accent. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that another gentleman is also interested in the nubile teen. His name is Mr. Harvey and he lives in Susie's neighborhood. Unlike the man from school, Mr. Harvey puts in a tremendous amount of effort in an attempt to win the love of Susie Salmon. He builds her an amazing underground clubhouse, complete with all the stuff young people from that era loved. He had beverages such as Coca Cola that he selflessly shared with Susie as they hung out. It became clear that Mr. Harvey, while having great taste in females, was a bit awkward around them. His nervousness around Susie Salmon was evident and she picked up on that. Girls prefer a man with confidence. I also feel that maybe she was turned off because the Coke that Mr. Harvey gave her was warm. I didn't see an ice-filled cooler in the clubhouse anywhere. So I think these factors all led to Susie Salmon losing her patience, which erupted in an unfortunate display of rudeness. Mr. Harvey only had one rule in the clubhouse: Be polite. Susie Salmon broke that rule and the series of events that followed spiraled into one great, big, unfortunate chain reaction. 

There are no bad people in The Lovely Bones. True, Susie Salmon came off as being a little narcissistic and immature but she was only 14 years old. Mr. Harvey was socially awkward and made some unfortunate choices in life but he had a deep desire to be loved and respected. Despite his talents and generosity, it seemed nobody opened up their heart to him. 

The Lovely Bones is a film that will force you to take sides. Whether you end up on Team Harvey or Team Salmon, be prepared for an emotional ride. There are great performances all around. 8/10. || This was a very good movie.  I never heard of this movie so i was watching my tv,lazy day so i left this on  my tv and i was really interesting movie.

Forgiveness is a mighty powerful weapon that can make or break nations.How a sport can unite a divided nation into ONE, it is a well known fact but to actually be able to do that in a country like SOUTH Africa,at a time when it was ready to rise from the ashes or to fall into its own crevices lying beneath the surface and ready to torn apart the whole nation again into TWO,is what gives me INSPIRATION to rise whenever i'll fall...

The entire cast is brilliant without going overboard in situations that could've been intense.A truly inspiring movie that can be imprinted in your heart for the rest of your lives if you're **ready to FORGIVE people and make this world a better place to live in!** || A little bit hit-and-miss, though <em>'Invictus'</em> still manages to produce the requirements for a solid sports drama.

Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are two actors I enjoy a lot, but by the end of this 2009 film I was a tad underwhelmed by them. Freeman as Nelson Mandela sounds great on paper, but in reality you kinda lose what makes Freeman so great - his voice, given he has to act with a South African accent. He still does a good job nevertheless, I just don't think I'll remember this particular portrayal of Mandela - unlike Idris Elba's attempt in 2013's <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/mandela-long-walk-to-freedom/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom'</em>.

The merging of the two plot points - politics and rugby union - is done well, though the former is easily more interesting than the latter... and I say that as someone who loves sport and dislikes politics!

7 stars. || I have some questions, I have some comments, both of which may come across as moderately hostile, but I still enjoyed _The Princess and the Frog_. I'm not too sure why though. I won't be coming back for the soundtrack, which is generally one of the biggest appeals of these Princess deals, and certain things are so *yawn* Disney that you can call them before you press play, but at least it's a little different.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Solid.

<em>'The Princess and the Frog'</em> makes for a good time. It's nothing incredibly different from the studio's other animated princess films, but still produces what you'd want from a film of this type.

Anika Noni Rose works well in the lead role as Tiana, while it's pleasant to hear John Goodman as Big Daddy; albeit not as a major character. Keith David (Shadow Man) and Oprah Winfrey (Eudora), meanwhile, are welcomed cast members.

The music is rather forgettable, though the (traditional) animation is nice. There's a few moments where it drags its heels slightly, but the pacing is mostly fine. It all comes down to whether you enjoy princess stories, given how predictable and formulaic they are. I'm nonplussed about them, to be honest.

Mid-range Disney, for me."

The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron's luridly imagined tropical other world that keeps us fascinated. I like this film and I have written many review for <a href=""https://domywriting.com/"">essay writing service</a>. The special effects are so good here that you don't even notice them. It is eerie how Cameron has made it look and feel like he is just pointing a camera at the action. || It's cinema Jim, but not as we know it. 

So here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.

No doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.

The cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen ""The Party Crasher"" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron's Behemoth. 5/10 || Rewatching Avatar confirmed my love for Pandora. Exquisite world-building by James Cameron, memorable score by James Horner & jaw-dropping, innovative visuals that complement wonderful storytelling.

In Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) & Dr. Watson (Jude Law) enter into a clash of wits and brawn with a serial killing Lord involved in black magic who, apparently, has risen from the dead (Mark Strong). Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly play the women in the protagonists’ lives. 

Directed by Guy Ritchie, “Sherlock Holmes” (2009) takes Arthur Conan Doyle’s popular Victorian detective and successfully morphs him into an action hero with rapid-fire dialogues and over-the-top thrills. It’s like an old Hammer flick on steroids, but it works as long as you can keep up with the snappy dialogues, which are often mumbled by Downey Jr. (so you’ll have to listen closely or use the subtitles).

The interesting thing about the character of Sherlock Holmes is his talent for making sweeping deductions based on the slightest details and this flick highlights that to amusing effect, like when Holmes easily assesses Watson’s fiancé at the restaurant (which is one of the movie’s best scenes). Speaking of the ladies, both Rachel McAdams and Kelly Reilly really shine here.   

The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes, and was shot in England.

It was more about the female chipmunks in this. I know there being introduce in this movie. But it was funnier when the male and females were making fun of each other. || Like the first movie, this one also is a quite nice family-friendly movie about cute stuff and how families and friends should support each other.

The main theme is ""highschool comedy"", with all the many tropes you're used from highschool movies, but of course silliness instead of horny teenagers. :-D

When it comes to humor and dancing, it's very close to the first movie, which I consider good. It does have some advantages over the first movie, though:

- Theodor: Alvin finds other people at school that he wants to interact with, causing a rift between him and his family, especially him and Simon. Theodor, in this way, basically acts as the ""child in between arguing parents"", and he does so in a very emotional way that makes you really care for him. But Alvin's and Simon's role are also really well-displayed.

Thus the movie teaches much of responsibility towards family and friends and how you have to find the people you really belong to.

- The Chipettes: The biggest addition to the movie, the boys' counterpart, and I'd lie if I'd say their cuteness does not influence how much I like this movie. But seriously: The Chipettes are a really cute addition in behavior and looks. Like the boys, their models and fur look lovely, and damn, their dancing is animated SO smooth and impressive.
Adding them in this movies especially fits really nice as the whole ""boys vs. girls"" thing fits well into the highschool setting.
While the Chipettes start off as mere fangirls of the boys, they quickly develop their own personality, show the familiar ""supporting each other"" the boys, as of the beginning of the movie, still lack.
In addition: Great compliments to whoever designed their costumes, because they look great!

Once the movie turns from a highschool comedy to something a little more serious with dangers and chases through the city, the full strength of the Chipmunks and Chipettes constellation is shown and makes for a fun and enjoyable second half or last third.

The only things I did not like:

- Toby Seville, the human main character is...not really important. A very cheap stereotype of a ""good for nothing"" gamer that only gets character development in the very last bits at all and could've easily be ignored in the movie completely.

- The typical highschool bully which plays an elementary role in the story, but is over-the-top asshole and can be exhausting in some moments.

--

Like the first movie, a nice family movie about supporting your friends and family with the Chipettes as a great addition."

With just the medium of radio he successfully created an atmosphere of panic so real people listening (who had not caught the beginning where it stated that the following was a radio drama) fled their homes thinking aliens from Mars had invaded Grovers Mill, New Jersey!

""Pontypool"" takes place almost exclusively inside a small radio station in the town of Pontypool, Ontario Canada. What starts out as an ordinary day slowly morphs into an extraordinary situation told almost entirely through eye witness call ins, a weather reporters sky view, and eventually the towns doctor who has a preposterous yet undeniably believable theory as to what is going on.

Director Bruce McDonald and writer Tony Burgess expertly create an atmosphere of frustration, disbelief, and panic all within the confines of a single set. Never once did I feel limited by not seeing what was going on outside. Like the aforementioned ""War of the Worlds"" radio drama, the situation unfolds by audio reports coupled with the unexpected entrance of the doctor.

For blood and gore fans there is a scene that is both shocking and heartbreaking. But this film is generally not for that audience... unless they have good imaginations and can be taken in by ""eyewitness"" accounts of brutality.

The other part of the tale that is refreshing is that the antagonism that is affecting the outside world is not a virus nor is it the dead come back to life. No... it is something... as the doctor explains... preposterous yet undeniably believable.

The casting of Stephen McHattie as the past his prime but not ready to go quietly DJ was a masterstroke. He brings to life Grant Mazzy in a way I cannot imagine another doing as perfectly. He mixes a jaded world view with pathos, anger, humor, and a just the right touch of madness as all around him slides into madness.

I'm not a fan of dogs... in fact, I'm one of those people who never had dogs, and that's why I didn't develop a great admiration for these animals, despite recognizing that they are excellent companions and can make a difference for many people, in different situations (for example, as part of police units or as guides for the blind). But the truth is that I feel every day how uncomfortable dogs can be, if they fall into the hands of careless owners, or those who do not teach them properly: they howl when alone, they make a lot of noise when other animals pass by, they run to sniff and lick other people without their owners paying attention if they want to have contact with their animals and, worse, they defecate anywhere without their owners taking care to collect the droppings. Yes, the education of dog owners in Portugal is non-existent in most cases. The fault, of course, lies entirely with the imbecile human owners, but it helped me not to harbor sympathy for these animals. The fair, in these things, always pays for the sinner.

However, even the human being with less affinity for dogs will recognize the value and the moving beauty of this film, loosely based on a true story that took place in Japan, before the Second World War, and which has already given rise to at least one Japanese film, in 1987. What this film does is to take this Japanese story and transport it to the United States, telling it as if it had taken place on US soil, but keeping a lot of elements, implicit and discreet, that link us to Japanese culture (the dog breed, the dog's name, even the martial arts). I have nothing against remakes and I have to admit that Hachiko's true story deserved a movie... but the truth is that there are a number of similar reports around the world attesting to the loyalty and unparalleled attachment of various animals to their owners. So, if the idea was just to take Hachiko to the US, maybe it would have been better if the script had created a new and entirely fictional story, albeit inspired by the real Hachiko (and other dogs).

Having made all these considerations, I believe that we owe a tribute to Richard Geere for another exceptionally well done and very palatable work, in which the actor manages to monopolize our attention in a friendly character, that touches our emotional side. However, and if we exclude the three dogs that participated in this film and played the role of the protagonist, there is virtually nothing more to say about the cast! The remaining actors only say what they are told to say, without adding anything truly positive, nor receiving interesting and developed material for their respective characters. This includes Joan Allen, who appears to have dropped in this movie by parachute.

On a technical level, there are several positive aspects to be highlighted, such as the pleasant cinematography, the good choice of filming locations and the intelligent use of the sets and some visual and sound effects. It's not a flashy movie, but it does everything it can to touch our hearts and can even feel corny and sentimental, especially towards the end. I handled it very well, but of course not all people will like it. The choice of animals for this movie was really good, and they are just cute and adorable in the extreme. And we can't forget about that incredible soundtrack, based on sweet piano melodies. It all helps this movie to be exceptionally sweet and suitable for family evenings. However, I leave a note for parents: if you don't want your children to ask you, in an insistent way, to adopt a puppy, don't let them see this movie."

And of course, the bad guy. Sure, there are many more films like this you can find at any local video store.

However, when you put two acting grandmasters like Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman head to head, you already know you're in for a treat. And in that respect, ""Eli"" absolutely delivers. Denzel Washington, in the role of Eli, does what he does best: he delivers his most perfect rough-around-the-edges, I'm-a-good-guy-but-I-don't-care routine we all know and love. He is a hard knock alright, and he has absolutely no problem whatsoever severing a few of your body parts if you get in his way. But he is still good to the core, one of the few decent human beings left in a world forsaken of decency. All you need to do to know this is look in his eyes, because the warmth and charisma Washington possesses say it all, even if he is completely covered in scar tissue.

And then there's Gary Oldman. Good old Gary Oldman. I have to say, it's really nice to see him play a stone cold, heartless scumbag once again, especially after his soft good guy role in Batman, where he was almost dorky – to no fault of his own of course, but still. This man deserves to get every inch of space to act freely, and thank goodness, the Hughes brothers allowed him exactly that. He plays a sort of mob boss, the self-appointed leader of a dingy little town and owner of the bar. He beats his wife, prostitutes his stepdaughter and he does it smiling. He is the most filthy kind of evil, absolutely rotten and loving it. Why? We don't know. He's just a bastard, and that's that.

Which is another thing I really like about this film, even though I realize many other people might actually hate it: it offers absolutely no motives, no answers, no explanations to anything, no bite size plot lines, nothing. There's no intro, no voice-over telling you where we are and what's going on. Only half-way through the film there is a scene with Eli and Solara (played by Mila Kunis) where he tells her a little bit about his life, but that's it. Like I said, some people might hate this, so if you are the kind of person who likes a formula-driven action flick with catchy punch lines and nothing to think about, this is not the film for you.

I would also like to make a little note on Mila Kunis. I must admit, I first had some doubts about her taking on a genre like this (although I was impressed with her performance in Black Swan, but that's a completely different kind of film, and other than that I only know her from That 70's Show), and throughout her first couple of scenes, she didn't do much to remove those doubts. However, as the film progressed, she got her act together and in the end, delivered a credible performance.

The visuals are stunning from start to finish. If you are a fan of the new, Frank Miller type of film style with high contrast colours and surreal scenery, you really need to see this. The bleak colours and images of darkness set against a really bright sky make the atmosphere heavy and haunting, making the anxiety of the characters almost tangible. You can just feel dryness, the desert, the hunger and the thirst. The western-like scenery of the town with the ""saloon"" at the heart of it, only adds to that sensation.

Another thing I'd like to mention is a quality not many modern-day films possess: the lost art of being silent. It is very rare for a film in this genre to simply be so... still. There is no dialogue except where it's absolutely necessary, and even the music is only used to actually add something to the scenes, but never as filler. The absence of sound here is just as important as its presence. Perfect.

On a similar note, the final credits go to Atticus Ross, who created an absolutely magnificent soundtrack, with music that sounds somewhat like the hybrid lovechild of Trent Reznor and Thom Yorke. It's just stellar and truly adds (emotional) value to every scene.

Finally, I'm not going to tell you what the story is about, I will simply recommend that you go into it with an open mind and no prior knowledge. That's what I did and it worked perfectly. (I will only say that you really need to stick around for the awesome, slap-in-the-face plot twist at the end!)

Of course it's not the best film ever made, but I still give it a 10, simply because it's beautiful, it's cool and it delivers a few excellent and satisfactory action scenes. And because it's been a really long time since I have downloaded a soundtrack immediately after seeing the film.

Original? No. Eye-candy? Absolutely.

Go see it.
_(April 2011)_ || This time it is Denzel Washington's turn to star in a post-apocalypse tale and although he is competent here, the film offers very little new for us. He (""Eli"") treks across the USA, ostensibly aimlessly, seeking comfort where he can; avoiding the lawless gangs who would steal his clothes if they got a chance whilst he feasts on small critters and takes solace from his secret book. Eventually (it seemed) he encounters the rather ruthless ""Carnegie"" (a menacing but rather under-used Gary Oldman) for whom he initially takes up the cudgels before realising that what ""Carnegie"" really wants is the book and he will stop at nothing to get it! The production looks good, plenty of attention to detail, but the pace is really slow for the most part. It takes an age for us to accumulate enough information about the man and his book, and the set-piece fight scenes are more a testament to acrobatics than acting. Religiosity is part of the narrative, but it is too superficial and undercooked to make more than a tangential impact on what is essentially a derivate and unremarkable pilgrim's story that could have offered us so much more had that thread been better and more fully developed. The use of light and the photography in general are effective; they do present us with an eerily effective bleakness, but otherwise - it's all a bit so-so. || **The Book of Eli is a gritty post-apocalyptic tale with savage action and a twist ending that will make you want to watch it all over again.**

The Book of Eli plays like a modern-day Mad Max or other 80s post-apocalyptic tale but stripped of its campiness and reinforced with Denzel’s reliable, powerful, and yet vulnerable performance. Washington’s mysterious Eli is driven and focused solely on his mission, but as the plot progresses, he grows to care for a person in need. The action sequences are brutal and precise, emphasizing Eli’s incredible skill and immediately defining him as a force to be reckoned with. Mika Kunis and Gary Oldman bring strong performances to the supporting cast, further grounding a movie that could have easily ended up as another goofy end-of-the-world film. The ending surprises making the audience want to immediately rewatch the movie with this new revelation and see it with new eyes. The Book of Eli is one of my favorite Denzel movies in a catalog of incredible films."

His character - ""Mailk"" is an illiterate eighteen year old who is sent to jail for six years for attacking a police officler. One inside, he has little protection but the clothes he stands up in. The place is governed by ""Luciani"" (Niels Arestrup). He's a man of Corsican descent who has twenty or so hoodlums to do his bidding and the guards in his pocket. It's the Arabs who are causing him some chagrin so he alights on the newbie to be his instrument of murder. Initially terrified and reluctant, it's soon clear that a choice isn't on his list of options. Do this, though, and he will be protected and, well, alive. He elects on the survival path and becomes gradually more riled upon by his boss whilst learning to read from his friend ""Ryad"" (Adel Bencherif). By half way through his sentence, he has grown in confidence, is trusted with more ""delicate"" tasks and even gets the odd day's leave in the outside world. As the demographic of the inmates changes, it falls to both him and ""Luciani"" to adapt - and that's quite a challenge. Now it is a bit long, and takes a while to get up an head of steam, but once we know who's who and likely to betray or kill the other this developer into a tautly directed and compelling story that doesn't shirk from conveying the epitome of a dog-eat-dog environment. Arestrup also delivers really strongly here as the man with the power who slowly realises that change is not his forté, not is patience nor any likelihood of release looming. It's a little predicable, but gives us a rough ride that conveys criminal and cultural clashes with an earthy plausibility and it whizzed by."

Art has existed since human beings learned to understand the beauty of the world around them, and to capture it, to immortalize it on a surface. Initially, it was on the walls of caves, where our most remote ancestors represented the animals they lived with, the hunts they did and themselves. Whether in vivid color or simply engraved in stone, it was the birth of art as a concept, and the flowering of civilizations, the evolution of societies and the improvement of techniques led to an explosive and incredible evolution in artistic expression, and an enormous legacy that we, today, take care very badly. It is difficult for us to understand, now, in the 21st century, that art is a public good, not the exclusive property of a museum or a given collector. They are just guardians, sometimes temporary, of something that is much more universal and that should be cherished, valued and appreciated. And this reasoning also includes objects and buildings of historical and ethnographic value, archaeological remains and even documentary and archival funds. Not being art, together with it, they constitute a great cultural assemblage that is, in essence, our collective memory. As a historian, I am one of those who devote my life to studying, preserving, disseminating and caring for this memory.

This film, being a very light and funny comedy, shows very well the impact that art can have on someone's life, if we allow ourselves to be touched by it. The script, light and well written, brings together three museum security guards who, unhappy with the sale of their three favorite artworks to a Danish museum, decide to steal them before they are taken away. The plan involves replacing them with identical copies, and things, as is often the case in this type of film, will not go well without several funny incidents, and without the plan, on several occasions, running serious risks of failing. Spirited, it is a light film, but one that shows the affection that art deserves from all of us. Honestly, I would show this film to those groups of spoiled upstarts who are throwing mashed potatoes, tomato soup and the like at museum paintings!

The film brought together three great actors for the main roles: Christopher Walken, Morgan Freeman and William Macy. Each of them did their best, and we could see very well that they even had fun working on this project. Marcia Gay Harden is also present, and is very supportive of the trio, but keeps a low profile. The film is not particularly original, it even reminded me a little of “Ocean's Eleven” or “Thomas Crown Affair”, and the whole heist has a certain degree of credibility: it is not a complicated or far-fetched plan, but something that could be credibly carried out. However, not everything was so good: the biggest problem with this film is the domestic sub-plot of Walken and Harden, where some things aren't properly explained; the characters (except for Walken) are unexplored, and their past and personality is not revealed. But being a comedy, I think it's a minor issue.

Technically, it's a very good film, considering the relatively low budget, and the fact that it went straight to video. Normally, this is something that is done to very basic films, but this film would even have deserved an afternoon session in any “multiplex”, because it made every coin pay and does not appear modest, although it is a discreet film that will be, surely, quickly forgotten. Filmed in various locations between Boston and Puerto Rico, it has good production values, good sets, good costumes and good cinematography. The jokes are quite unobtrusive, they don't always work and won't make fans of more brazen humor laugh. The soundtrack is effective."

It's not that the movie is confusing in any way. It was just, well, it came out when my dad (rest his soul) was 12. And, at least until recently, it was on the air every year since.

I remember watching it when I was really little, and I remember watching it until just a few years ago when it started to slowly vanish from Network TV tradition. Like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" this was a part of Christmas to the point where it was an unofficial Christmas tradition that brings up memories of childhood and family every time you view it.

Because of that there is a heavy nostalgia to it, and because of that it's hard to tell if the show is as great as I think it is, or if I think it's great because it's a tradition that comes with memories."

The fights here are definitely illegal, but they happen in an actual ring — as opposed to Undisputed’s Cage of Death. 

George Chambers returns to prison, convicted of a crime he didn’t commit (unlike the rape charge from the original film). After defending his cellmate, Chambers declares that ""I don't like to see people being bullied"", and although he adds ""unless I am the one doing the bullying"", it’s still a 180 degree personality change. People can and do change, of course, but seldom do they go from Ving Rhames to Michael Jai White.

In Russia to shoot a vodka commercial (if only this Isaac Florentine-directed movie had been about a down-and-out boxer à la Apollo Creed), the rejuvenated Chambers is arrested for possession of cocaine (planted in his hotel room) and summarily sentenced to Chornya Cholmi maximum security prison. Chornya Cholmi translates to Black Hills, although the hills, if any, would be more likely to be white with snow; I guess it's just a name, like 'Monster Island' (which is actually a peninsula).

This is one of those Russian prisons, like the one in Black Widow, where everyone — warden, guards and inmates alike — speaks proficient English (continuing the unintentional irony, Chambers is one of the few characters to say anything in Russian, in the aforementioned commercial), including the undisputed prison champion, Yuri Boyka (Scott Adkins). 

A far cry from the boxing of Undisputed, the name of the game here is mixed martial arts choreographed like wrestling (complete with ref bumps, which I guess is the only reason why clandestine, anything-goes prison fights would have a referee to begin with); in that sense, Adkins's gravity-defying moves are the best thing about the film, though not quite what one would expect under the circumstances (a gritty Fight Club aesthetic would be more pertinent).

Chambers starts out as a boxer, so his first matchup with Boyka is fought under a ""fists only"" stipulation. In the film’s one instance of Truth in Television, Chambers easily overpowers Boyka; the problem, however, is that White and Adkins are both consummate martial artists, so this first encounter is as underwhelming as one-legged only ass-kicking contest — that is, until Boyka stops giving a crap and starts throwing kicks and knees at Chambers, who on top of everything has been drugged by his cornerman.

All things considered, White's casting is a misfire. Rhames can't do half the things White does, but he didn't need to either; his Chambers was the irresistible force as well as the immovable object. White, through no fault of his own, has to pretend he doesn't know zilch about martial arts and then pretend that Chambers learns everything White knows about MMA in an impossibly short period of time."

She gave it a voice.,"Drama, History",108.0,2010-02-06,en,7.81,496.0,1.973,"Claire Danes, David Strathairn, Barry Tubb, Melissa Farman, Charles Baker",Mick Jackson,"boston, massachusetts, veterinarian, autism, biography, new hampshire, slaughterhouse, university, livestock","Temple Grandin (Claire Danes) is just out of high school and sent to her Aunt Ann's (Catherine O'Hara, fitting into dramatic character roles very nicely) Arizona ranch. Her initial reaction to the climate and awkward way of behaving shows us that she has Asperger's Syndrome and/or autism. Asperger's is a milder form of autism, where the subject has better communication skills like speech, but is still unable to connect with our view of normal behavior. Temple grows to love the ranch, working with the animals and inventing an automatic gate that can be opened with the pull of a brass rod. She is very smart and detail-oriented, but must go to college. Temple's mother Eustacia (Julia Ormond, also maturing nicely into character roles) has been dealing with Temple's outbursts all of her life, and knows what it takes to calm Temple down. Unfortunately, college life is tough for Temple, who builds a machine that calms her but horrifies other students (it's a version of a cattle hold). Temple is thrown into this collegiate setting in the days before special services, yet she manages to make it through, and goes on to get her master's degree in animal husbandry back in Arizona. Again, Temple runs into obstacles- in the form of the cattlemen who don't want her around studying such silliness as what the cows' mooing mean- plus she is a woman, and they just aren't allowed. Temple designs and implements a new way to send cattle through a medicinal dip that is more humane to them, and then goes about rethinking the way cattle are slaughtered. Temple feels that animals were put on this earth for the service of man, but there is no reason we cannot be kind to them as part of their use as food and other products, and it makes good business sense.

Temple is headstrong, but she does not see the world like you and I do. She sees everything as a picture, and takes puns and jokes literally. When she hears the term ""animal husbandry,"" her mind calls up a person marrying an animal, and so on. Death is a foreign concept, too, for both animals and humans. When a major character dies, she wonders where they went, and doesn't understand saying goodbye to them at a funeral, since she just told them goodbye when she saw them last. Somehow, Grandin went on to write for technical ranching journals, before becoming an autistic advocate, and the screenplay is based on two books- both of which she authored. Mick Jackson's direction is fantastic. Using special effects appropriately, he shows the viewer how Grandin is able to picture things in her mind. These scenes are a great learning experience without overwhelming the screen with technical wizardry, and tell us that autistics are not mentally deficient; they are different, not less (a line from Temple's mother). While the screenplay jumps back and forth in time too often (college, and then boarding high school?), it does not lose its focus on Grandin. While the supporting cast gets to use their onscreen time, the film has one central character who is fascinating enough to watch without any melodramatic gristle to get in the way. O'Hara is great as Aunt Ann, who knows her niece so well. Her reassuring phone calls and scenes with Temple's worried mom are well-played. Ormond is phenomenal as Temple's mother. I could completely associate with her, watching her offspring doing something strange, and blaming themselves for their child's condition. Eustacia is no screaming battleaxe, telling everyone where to stick their assorted diagnoses. She has the patience of a saint, deciding to teach Temple to speak with flash cards, and hesitantly accepting that her child is not able to show love and affection. David Strathairn is also wonderful as Temple's science professor at the boarding school, recognizing that Temple is brilliant if the coursework is changed to fit her learning style. Claire Danes is a revelation. She has been simply good in ""Romeo + Juliet"" and the third ""Terminator"" film, but her googly-eyed emoting in the overrated ""My So-Called Life"" drove me batty. I have seen interviews with the real Temple Grandin, and Danes doesn't just do a good job, or master some observed mannerisms, she becomes Temple Grandin. She nails it from the very first scene, and consistently got it right. The viewer doesn't need someone to come out and explain every one of Temple's quirks; her fear of automatic doors and lashing out physically when she feels threatened are all embodied by Danes. She is so good, I forgot I was watching a performance. This is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen, and I have been reviewing films in one way or another since elementary school. I loved ""Temple Grandin."" I could associate with it thanks to a family situation, but many more can find inspiration here. Not only will Temple's story inspire autistics and their families, this work might demonstrate to emerging artists what a powerful medium film can be."

Really don't waste the 95 mins it'll take to watch and be stupidly disappointed (stupidly, because you'll feel like an idiot for getting to the end of the film and realising you were being taken for one the whole time!). This film's writer/Director/producer(s) were clearly so besotted with false nostalgia for horror films of the 80s, that they misguidedly picked the worst flaws of the worst films of that era and replicated them here, believing themselves to be making something 'authentic' and true to that time. What they actually made would've been called crap then as much as it should be now! 90 mins of creeping around with no plausible characters, situations or even anything resembling actual *suspense*; then 5 mins of ""whooaaah, look: blood and satanic ritual! Isn't that scary?!"" Answer: NO, IT BLOODY WELL ISN'T! Now give me back the last 95 mins, you fools! || This one night changes everything for me.

Ti West seems destined to be one of those horror film directors who forever will polarise opinions. For those of us who love the slow burn approach and admire his evident adoration of retro horror, then he hits the mark. Reference The House of the Devil and latterly The Innkeepers. If those two things don't strike a chord with you then it's very likely that The House of the Devil will drive you nuts -  but not in a good way.

Plot is simple, Jocelin Donahue plays student Samantha Hughes, who has found the ideal apartment to live in, but needs funds to pay the deposit. Sooooo, answering a flyer advertising for a babysitter, she winds up at some spooky house out in the sticks, where the job isn't exactly what was as expected, and, well the night isn't as expected either...

It's her own fault really, if you ring the bell at a spooky isolated house and Tom Noonan answers the door, well then you should know better than not to run away! But I digress. West's film taps into the satanic panic that gripped certain parts of the states in the 70s and 80s, set in the early 80s the film is a vibrant homage to that era, with a real sense of time and place pulsing away as Samantha is set up for a night of god knows what.

The house is a splendid old creaker and within it Samantha always looks to be one cat's whisker away from being in peril. West doesn't go for continuous boo-jump scares, he lets us and Samantha use our imaginations to unnerve all parties. The screw is slowly turned until hell comes to the party, moving things swiftly to a frenetic finale that closes with a final denouement that old nick himself would approve of.

Dee Wallace Stone does a cameo to add more to the retro flavours, while Noonan and Donahue are superb. It's a film that is patient and asks you for your patience, so those of that ilk, and retro horror hounds too, will love it. Others, not so! 7/10 || After watching _X_ and _Pearl_, I was very excited to dive deeper into Ti West's filmography, unfortunately for me this one does not live up to the hype. This movie has a very old school feel to it, giving me flashbacks to the original _Halloween_ and _Friday the 13th_ with its film quality, atmosphere, and audio effects/music. I really enjoyed this aspect, and it left me feeling somewhat nostalgic. These feelings did not carry over to the rest of the film. I thought the plot was fine, although the main characters incredibly stupid decisions were the catalyst for the entire story. This is fine in slashers or an action horror film as the kills are what you are there for, but with this it felt cheap and left me unsatisfied. The movie lingers on scenes all too often, resulting in a very slow pace. I understand these long-drawn-out sequences were supposed to build tension, but it was not effective, and left be bored. I really wanted to enjoy this more than I did and unfortunately the best I can give this is an average rating.

The Wolfman is directed by Joe Johnston and adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self from Curt Siodmak's original 1941 screenplay. It stars Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and Shelly Johnson is the cinematographer. Plot is set in 1891 and finds Toro as Lawrence Talbot, who upon learning of his brother's grizzly murder, returns to his estranged father's estate in Blackmoor to investigate. Upon arriving he forms an instant bond with his dead sibling's fiancée, Gwen (Blunt), but soon Lawrence finds himself mired in a world of lycanthropy and family secrets.

It had a much publicised troubled production, with a director switch, numerous release date changes and enforced cuts to the running time, sitting atop of this particular iceberg. With that it mind, film is arguably better than it had any right to be. What is now readily available is an extended cut of the film where some 17 minutes of footage have been put back into the story. Footage cut originally to foolishly speed up the moment when the first transformation from man to wolfman arrives. Is the extended cut a far better movie than the trimmed theatrical version? The answer is resounding yes it is. It still contains flaws, but now the narrative is stronger and crucially by waiting much longer for the first ""big change scene"", tension and anticipation now exist where previously it didn't. 

In spite of some modern day advancements for this 21st Century wolfman - 
excessive speed for the wolf - creature smack down finale - Johnston's movie is very faithful and respectful of the 1941 original. Which is perhaps not surprising since the weight of Universal is backing this remake of one of their original classic monsters from the 30's and 40's. But it's nice to see that a remake keeps the things that made the original so beloved. Gothic texture is rich, none more so than with the mist/smog shrouded village, while the tortured sadness that permeated Lon Chaney's take on Larry Talbot back in 1941, is perfectly essayed by del Toro this time around. 

The creature design itself cleaves close to the original, with Rick Baker and Dave Elsey picking up the Academy Award for Best Makeup for their excellent efforts. Fans of shred and gore are also well served here, with Johnston (The Rocketeer/Jumanji) showing a keen eye for action construction. An attack at a Gypsy camp and a bloody rampage through a bus are the stand outs, while an asylum sequence is also not to be sniffed at. Chuck in the murder mystery element, and the intriguing father and son axis, and it's a film that has more to it than merely being a CGI popcorn piece. Even Elfman's score fits neatly into the period setting. 

Problem wise it comes down to Blunt and Weaving being under used, and Hopkins veering dangerously close to over hamming the omelette, yet all remain strong in characterisations. Toro, though, is not, as some have suggested, miscast. Already lupine like before transformation, he plays it perfectly troubled and brooding like. Talbot has inner demons and unanswered questions in his past, a past he has tried to shred but finds he now must confront those demons. The onset of lycanthropy serving, one feels, as a metaphor for his personal torment finally being unleashed. Toro nails it with an excellent and subdued portrayal, even if the choice of hair style leaves much to be desired. Worth a mention as well is Shelly Johnson's photography, where nice atmospheric visuals complement the tone and period flavour of the piece. 

More homage than outright horror, but with a little something for everyone interested in Horror/Gothic/Mystery type movies, The Wolfman in extended form is an enjoyable enough experience. 7/10"

I think I own almost every filmed version of every Austen novel. I find different strengths and weaknesses in all of them, but I would not trash any of them the way people do some versions because they don't stay true enough to the books. I write novels myself in my spare time and - were I lucky enough (or good enough) to have any made into a film - I would not be offended if they were changed. Books and movies have different needs and ways of telling a story. That said, I really love this interpretation of Persuasion.

I greatly appreciate how British productions often don't automatically lunge for the most beautiful or most handsome actors and actresses for their lead roles, as American productions are apt to do. Sally Hawkins is by no means ugly, but she is almost homely in some of her scenes, such as when she is weeping. I read a criticism in a review of how the actors stare into the camera, but I think Sally is at her most masterful doing just that, looking right at us, such as in the very first scene, or the weeping scene I just mentioned. Her facial expression changes are sometimes dramatic and other times subtle but still very effective. I think all of the acting is wonderful here, from the effete snob father right down through to the many minor characters.

I do admit I was a bit mystified by one aspect of the ending. I will try not to give it away to those who may actually be deciding whether to watch it, but the book's ending is changed for the film, which as I said above, isn't a problem for me in itself. There are enough versions of Austen movies or mini-series out there that I am fine with each doing some interpreting. And in this version, they want to make the final scene more dramatic. That is fine. But what struck me as weird was that Anne follows a character out the front door just seconds behind him, but that person is nowhere to be seen on the street, and she goes off in pursuit. It wouldn't have taken much to have Anne be delayed leaving just long enough to make it realistic that there would be no sign of him when she steps outside. But I forgive them that oddity. Perhaps it was the result of an editing room dilemma. Also in that scene they show her walking from above, which makes for a strange angle. Since then I have seen that technique used more, so perhaps it is a new thing. 

The music by Martin Phipps is also wonderful, moody and rich. I am surprised that the soundtrack was not made available (the last time I checked). The closest I have come to finding it was, oddly enough, a CD called H2O by the Canadian nature CD producer Dan Gibson. It is similar to the main theme music of the movie, though obviously not the same thing."

Despite the commendable acting by Rachel Weisz and Oscar Isaac, the movie, which was created with a significant budget, strangely exudes an air of thriftiness typically associated with lower-budget productions.

The storyline itself verges on the absurd, taking considerable liberties with historical facts by reshaping them and even conjuring entirely new occurrences. This departure from reality transforms the work from a scholarly biopic into a realm of pure fantasy.

The library of Alexandria no longer existed during the time of Hypatia. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the destruction or closure of the Library of Alexandria remain shrouded in mystery. The precise cause, whether through fire or deliberate demolition, eludes us. Yet the film decides to come up with its own narrative as to how the library was destroyed. Additionally, the depiction of Christian riots in the film does not align with historical accuracy, a complete falsehood just to add drama and tension to an otherwise boring feature film.

For a historical biopic, accuracy is important and this film fales miserably. Definitely do not watch this as an accurate representation of historical events. || Agora is a well-crafted film that manages to be both entertaining and educational. While the movie takes some creative liberties with the historical events, which is understandable given the gaps in recorded history, it does a great job of capturing the essence of the time. The writing feels solid, and despite some moments that might stretch historical accuracy, the story remains compelling and thought-provoking.

The acting is another highlight. Rachel Weisz shines as Hypatia, bringing intelligence and grace to the role. Her portrayal makes Hypatia’s struggle with philosophy, reason, and the changing world around her deeply engaging. Most of the main cast delivered strong performances that added depth to the characters and their relationships.

The directing is to the point, keeping the narrative focused on the tension between reason and dogma. The production design deserves credit too. It successfully recreates the feel of ancient Alexandria, immersing you in the historical setting. From the bustling streets to the grandeur of the Serapeum, it pulls you into the world of the film.

Overall, Agora is a beautifully executed movie that is as educational as it is entertaining. It offers a glimpse into an important and tumultuous period of history while exploring timeless themes about knowledge, power, and humanity. Despite its fictionalized elements, it is a powerful film that is worth watching."

Directed by Breck Eisner and written by Scott Kosar & Ray Wright, The Crazies (2010) is a remake of the 1973 film directed by George A. Romero. It stars Timothy Olyphant, Rhada Mitchell and Joe Anderson. The plot sees a toxic spillage make its way into a small American town's water system and turns some of the locals into marauding maniacs.

Eisner's movie is that rare old thing these days, that of the horror remake that greatly improves upon the original. That might annoy some Romero purists, but the truth is, is that his original film really isn't that great to begin with. Thus it's ripe for a remake, whilst acknowledging that a certain weariness creeps into our thoughts at the seemingly never ending line of horror remakes getting churned out by a Hollywood running out of ideas. Hell I will even venture that we have seen all this before, nothing in this ""Crazies"" will have the horror faithful rushing out to tell their buddies about some overtly cranial splendour piece they have just watched, but this is a very effective horror piece, taut and tense at times, at others sick and splendidly disgusting. Eisner may not be a ""Craven"", or for sure no ""Romero"", but he executes the material with gusto and shows a knack for knowing how to make the material work.

The film is structured over three parts. Character formations in the little town of the delightfully small Americana sounding Ogden Marsh, which leads into the infected going doolally. Then it's the army attempting to get things under control. Lastly it's the the fall out as our brave survivors, erm, try to survive and make sense of what is happening. Eisner and his writers even get away with not fleshing out the principal characters. We know Olyphant's Sheriff is a toughie, and that his pregnant wife, Mitchell, is equally resourceful, while the deputy played by the film's standout performer, Joe Anderson, we know is loyal and sharp with a rifle. Who cares about flesh on these bones, let the crazies after them and see how they cope. Where the writers score plus points is with the portrait of a world losing its humanity. The sick are rounded up and contained, nobody cares enough to try and help them, while those sent to restore order, to protect the people, are as dangerous as those bleeding from the eyes and ears. There's madness everywhere.

With memorable blood pumping scenes, bona fide suspense and metaphorical smarts in the writing, this is one damn fine remake shocker. 7.5/10 || I didn’t have much expectations for this film, other than thinking it would be a low budget, easygoing horror film. How wrong I was! Not only it is a decent horror film but also scary at times. Yeah, it certainly is not a 10 out of 10 horror film, for sure, but it’s certainly worth watching.

Would I watch it again? Yeah! Would I make my friends watch it? Absolutely! || Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

I have no idea how I went 10 years without seeing this one.

It shows you my frame of mind when this was the most uplifting thing of my day.

This is a great survivalist movie: an unknown infection occurs in a small rural town, and the government is closing in to secure and ""decontaminate"" the area.  And get nothing wrong, ""our"" government will contain, secure, and then protect, in that order.

Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell kill in this, they're great start to finish.  Joe Anderson does steal the show a few times though, really embodying the spirit of a rage filled person.  Danielle Panabaker is the reason this got on my radar at all, but she is sort of ""emotional teen girl"", and I feel she's too big an actor for that, so it wasn't my favorite part.

The writing is well done, in a progressive manner that makes me think that we really missed out on a ""The Crazies"" videogame.  The thing that makes this the infection more interesting than the average rabid / zombie movie, is that these infected are still ""smart"".  Now they're uncontrollably driven to kill, but they can do it by car / rifle / coordinated attack, and even an overwhelming mob.  Hell they can even set traps.

So you're basically fighting insane people on PCP.  The infection effect seems to differ based on how inclined you are to kill people.  There were a couple that managed to hide until they came across someone they had motivation to kill before infection.  Some people are just confused, like they don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.  Others ""round up da' boys"" and go a hooting and hollering.  The range of behaviors keep you on your toes.

On top of the infected, you have the military cleansing the area who (in theory) are still in their right mind, and no idea what is the infection vector.

I really enjoyed this, it did remind me of ""Mom and Dad"" which has a similar infection, but the psychological motivations are much clearer and have a very nice built in complexity."

I've fantasized about Dwayne Johnson in a tutu as much as the next guy, but this is kind of the movie equivalent of when the Rock went heel in the WWE (WWF at the time).  He's playing an obnoxious, borderline MEAN, character who isn't all that smart (basically a dumb jock type) , and while the movie is about redeeming the character it is hard for the character to be redeemed.

It's just awkward, he normally plays smart capable roles where he is likeable, as Dwayne is naturally on-camera-likeable, so making him a jerk is hard, and they overcompensate.  You seem something closer to what they should have done in ""The Pacifier"" where Vin Diesel is rough but well intended, and you can see elements of that in this, but he just goes full jerk.

I have a lot of issues with it being common practice to lie to children (which we teach them to be wary of when strangers do it), but digressing.

I have all sorts of issues with the logistics of a world where this type of tooth fairy exists, not to mention the other things they mention existing.  It's not too far off from the ""Santa Claus' sleigh flys by christmas cheer"", so there is a theoretical version of ""The Santa Claus"" in here somewhere.

So the movie doesn't make sense a lot, but it's a kids movie: which would be fine, but it wildly goes back and forth between goofy antics that should almost only make kids laugh, and high concept business jokes.

I think this movie tried to do too many things and ended up getting some of the fundamental things wrong.

It's not a terrible movie, and it's probably better for a younger audience, but I don't think it's a good movie, and there are a lot of other movies, even just ones with Dwayne Johnson to watch."

_Final rating:½ - So bad it’s offensive. I may never fully recover._ || After seeing the Disaster Artist, I had to see this movie! HORRIBLE! Laughing my ass off but HORRIBLE! Good for you Tommy! Live thendream!!! Still laughing that I'm really watching this! Kind of like a porn movie without the porn!!! || Brought to us by Wiseau-Films working with Chloe Productions and TPW Films is probably one of the worst films I have seen recently as I have discussed the film with others in my own podcast on Inside Movies Galore and I’m still on the fence whether I actually like the film. I watched this film twice once for my podcast and once for another that is enough and I will probably never watch this film again in my life if I don’t have to.

This is Tommy Wiseau’s debut film from 2003 where he plays a man named Johnny who has a beautiful blonde hair girlfriend named Lisa played by Juliette Danielle whom is actually kind of a bitch. Johnny has a working class job as a banker, takes care of a teenager named Denny, who insists almost on being a peeping Tom on their sex life, comes home to his woman Lisa and over time finds out she is cheating on him with his best friend Mark played by Greg Sestero then offs himself… on a budget of six million how can you film something like this?

Denny a young teenager is not entirely living with Johnny but is more like a son to him is caught up in the mix and gets into trouble with a drug dealer but you also see some kind of turmoil that Mark Goes through as he does feel guilty sleeping with Lisa but he enjoys it but is probably the most annoying actor on the set with his high pitched squeals. Also the fact of Lisa’s friends whom just can’t keep from fucking, started story plots that weren’t entirely needed and felt they were an after thought.

The Music behind the film feels like it should be in one of those older 80’s Canon fairy tales or something like Masterpiece Theater, but also elicit’s the feel of soft core love scenes like that what you would see on HBO after dark when it comes to the passionate scenes between Mark and Johnny. I also feel that when Johnny taped the phone calls Lisa made on one of those old tape machine’s feels slightly dated as this was a film done in 2003. I feel like the balcony scene was the worst scene as when they were up there you could tell that there was a stage wall behind them as the cast was talking as I understand this was called a green room.

Though I love dubbed films in Martial arts type films and Toho productions I think that having the actors and actress’s including Tommy Dub their voices in was absolutely awful, mixed with his geriatrics of getting angry at Lisa, Tommy was annoyingly eccentric, there wasn’t a line in the film that was even remotely original. It’s all been said before but I do have to say are quotable. I feel like I should love this movie but I’ve decided that I do not and only mildly enjoy the film as it is just that bad and even then I’m not sure that enjoyment can be the word decribing how I feel about the film. I don’t understand the reason behind why people enjoy the film but point blank it’s terrible. Terribly edited, basically a film you can probably take to a film class and say here’s what not to do.

I didn’t enjoy watching this film. I watched it for the purpose of discussing it on podcasts. I’ll definitely not recommend it to others either but I will say it paved the way to “the Disaster Artist” which looks like it could be an even better film than this piece of trash. I’m sorry to shit on film growing a cult standing but this was not a good film at all. Sorry ladies and gentlemen. Though I own it you go ahead and enjoy it not me.

As I understand it Tommy Wiseau at least in Greg Sestero’s book had actually not been a nice person to his cast in fact he’d actually been quite abusive so those whom are actually on his side you have to wonder at their sense of morality in believing this film was remotely good. I guess I’d say this was one of those films where Tommy had the money to buy his film haters the ones that find it just that enjoyable to hate movie goers.

I understand that he, Tommy Wiseau, probably took the films he knew growing up which probably had more to do with those soft core roughies you saw at the peepshows after midnight but ladies and gentlemen I’m not into belly porn… Enjoy the film if you must just don’t lie and say it was a great film…

Three positives that I can say about the film is I loved that beginning shot of that cool looking Architecture, The part where the friends have fucked and dude comes back for his underwear and I guess the fact that all the lines are quotable in the same accent that Tommy has.

My grade for this movie??? A. Wonderful story. Great cast. A movie that is pleasing to the eyes. I strongly recommend this to children, adults, and anyone in between. A great family movie. || _TL:DR    
A modern sequel to a classic. Feels like it has a few narrative issues, but it wasn't enough for me to really dislike it. (It gets a 6/10 on the Dragon-Scale, because the Jabberwocky has an amazing design and it's walking looks so off-putting.)_

Alice... who hasn't heard of or watched it at some point? This is a sequel to the original, Alice is now 19 when she returns to Wonderland. Which... she has no obvious memories of, which, for an adventure with the scope she undertook when she was younger, I find a little hard to believe. 

She never acknowledges having any memories of Wonderland until the end of the movie. Which again, strikes me as odd, because even if she would write off her earlier adventure as a dream, you'd still acknowledge having seen it all before, right? Perhaps I'm just overthinking this, but even subconsciously you'd recognize some of the things you see... right?

In any case, Wonderland has gotten a lot darker and has gotten a healthy CGI coating. Which, might not seem super today, but I think it gives everything a very 'this is not reality' vibe. Which works in Underland's favor in my opinion, it's chaotic, lacking in conventional logic and absolutely infused with magic. And it's bizarre denizens all immediately pop out at you, with many strange shapes, weird behavioral tics and tend to defy the laws of physics.

The story is a coming of age story, which is immediately set up in the beginning as Alice is forced into a marriage with someone she barely knows. Something not uncommon for the time it is set in. And during the movie she figures out who she is, someone who'll do things her own way, prophecies and expectations be damned. Despite not being the easiest way, everything still falls into place eventually and the prophecy fulfills itself.

When she comes back to her reality, she turns down her chosen fiancé, gives everyone she's encountered at her engagement party some snappy one-liners, which, they all seem to take in stride. She then takes up her father's passion to establish brave new trade-routes all the way to China. Which, perhaps feels a little _too_ easy. (Considering everyone was calling her father insane for his plans, which she promptly takes a step further.) But then again, this is a story with talking rabbits, a hookah smoking caterpillar and playing card knights, so perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.

All in all, a fun watch with a satisfying payoff in the end! || Wasn't expecting much out of this movie. It surprised me and turned out to be a pretty decent movie."

What now follows is a rather pedestrian affair with loads of CIA cloak and dagger drama as the team constantly come up empty in their search. Is there a leak somewhere? Did the things just simply never exist? Is their a broader game afoot? Well those are the questions about which I couldn't say I was really very bothered. To make these intrigues work effectively, the writing and the acting have to be far sharper and nuanced than here in this rather simplistic take on not just the Allied (i.e. not just US involvement in Iraq) activities, but on the attitudes of the local population who are portrayed here as either little better than sheep farmers, or as duplicitous murderers. Damon is going through the motions, as is a slightly oddly cast Jason Isaacs (""Briggs"") and a completely underwhelming Greg Kinnear as ""Poundstone"" - the Pentagon man charged with leading the search. Add to the mix the faintly annoying interventions of investigative journalist ""Lawrie Dayne"" (Amy Ryan) and the whole thing is, frankly, a derivate mess.

Another adaptation of the Oscar Wilde story. Film is about Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes), a man taken by the hedonism bug shown to him by Lord Wotton (Colin Firth). Upon having his portrait painted, Dorian comes to never age, but at what cost?

Clearly not faithful to the literary source, Oliver Parker's film is an interesting misfire. As a sexy chiller it kinda works, having more in common with Hammer Films of the 70s than with Wilde's prose. Yet it often feels like style over substance, blood or nudity for blood and nudity's sake. While strong performances by Firth and late in the play by Rebecca Hall hold the attention, Barnes is bland and apart from being pretty, is unconvincing. Also irritating is Charlie Mole's musical score, it's good, it's just not in the right movie!

The makers try to make a Gothic horror film from a Gothic horror novel, but never quite get to grips with the undercurrents of the story. Shame. 5/10 || Handballs it in on just about every important (and engaging) aspect of the actual _Portrait of Dorian Gray_ story. 

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || It's a shame that such a theoretically perfect Dorian Gray as Stuart Townsend was wasted on The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Sure, at 31, Townsend was arguably too old for the role in 2003, and even more so in 2009, the year this Dorian Gray was released; he was also too expressive, and based on both this film and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), it seems that the ideal Dorian Gray is a blank page — an unpainted canvas, so to speak, and while this makes a degree of sense, it does leave us wondering what exactly everyone sees in the titular character.

This is especially true of Ben Barnes, who’s so irresistible that he strips a young debutante of her virtue and, when her mother tries protests, he sleeps with her too, winning a bet in the process; this is a development that even Oscar Wilde would find vulgar (but, worse than vulgar, screenwriter Toby Finlay is trite, making Dorian say, when asked by Lord Henry (Colin Firth) what his secret is, the line ""If I told you, I'd have to kill you."" ”; I shudder to think that someone watching this film might believe that Wilde is responsible for this cliché, even if in 1890 it was not yet a one), and that we find it incredible because Dorian is nowhere near as fascinating as director Oliver Parker would like us to believe (but he is rich, though, so there’s that).

Now, Dorian is a Faustian character, and as such, he has little choice but to be a thankless role — yes, in theory he has a lot of fun (fun that the 1945 film, unlike this one, wisely left offscreen; Dorian’s vices are unspeakable, and trying to flesh them out is useless and counterproductive), but in practice he discovers, like Marcello Mastroianni, that the Dolce Vita is actually very bitter. The movie even manages to screw up the really juicy role of Lord Henry; Firth is a good actor, but wrong (especially when compared to George Sanders in the 1945 version) for this role for the same reasons that made him a poor choice for Valmont."

Unless this is someone's exercise therapy in getting out a experience they had getting sober, I don't really know for whom this movie is made."

A TSA worker at the Pittsburgh Airport (Jay Baruchel) starts a relationship with a woman many consider to be a perfect 10 (Alice Eve), which surprises his friends and family. Can the relationship survive their pestering?

""She’s Out of My League"" (2010) is a surprisingly well-written, well-casted romcom that’s entertaining throughout, but it’s ruined for me by a little too much gross or profane (non)humor and I can’t in good conscience give it a higher grade. This is unfortunate because the flick didn’t need to stoop to that low-level.

But if you can stomach the needlessly gross bodily fluid & raunchy ‘humor’ of “There’s Something about Mary” (1998), “The Girl Next Door” (2004) and “Forgetting Sarah Marshal” (2008) you might like it more than me.

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the Pittsburgh area.

GRADE: C || I enjoyed She’s Out of My League; let me get that out there at the outset. It is witty, mostly intelligent, and downright hilarious in places. Mind you, there were a few places that made me shake my head. There was some old fashioned gross-out humor, the sort I thought stopped being used in romantic comedies years ago. I particularly didn’t like the semen stain interlude, though I admit that Kirk’s friend’s advice later on how to explain it to Molly nearly saved it completely for me. 

I also thought that having every male within twenty yards of Molly being paralyzed and struck dumb by her beauty was a bit overdone, but I am willing to overlook small issues if the movie is intelligent enough otherwise.

I liked most of the characters, especially Marnie, who says the stuff everybody wants to say. Even Cam is made into a nice guy rather than a jerk, as most movies would make the handsome rival of the dweeb for the lady fair. All in all a fair entry into the crowded romantic comedy genre. || **She’s Out of My League is edgier than need be with language and some of the humor, but in the end, it’s a solid rom-com that isn’t fun for the whole family but definitely fun for some.**

I’m not typically a fan of rated-R comedies because of the over-the-top sensuality, inappropriateness, and frequent nudity. While She’s Out of My League definitely has inappropriate jokes and suggestive moments, the movie plays more towards the awkwardness of dating rather than the sexuality of the movie’s stars and avoids nudity altogether. The focus on the embarrassing, awkward normalness of the main character leads to hilarious situations and laugh-out-loud moments. She’s Out of My League could have been one of my all-time favorites if it had toned down the raunchiness a little further, but the spotlight on goofiness and an ending with some heart and sincerity make it my favorite R-rated rom-com."

This is not a heavy drama movie. It's just right. Of course I didn't really like the love interest of Robert in this movie.

Petty,"monster, funeral, underground, dakota, native american, buried alive, paralysis, crucifix, cavalry","The Burrower Tribe in BurrowerVision.

The Burrowers is written and directed by J.T. Petty. It stars William Mapother, Sean Patrick Thomas, Clancy Brown, Laura Leighton, Doug Hutchison, Karl Geary and Robert Richard. Music is by Joseph LoDuca and cinematography by Phil Parmet.

August the 11th 1879, the Dakota territories, and after a family of pioneers are abducted a posse is formed and go off in search of the culprits. It is believed they have fallen prey to hostile Native Americans, but once out in the wilds the truth hits home and the posse find themselves in a brutal and bloody fight for survival.

It's not like Tremors! That wonderful homage to the B movie creature features of the 1950s is played for laughs and action thrills. The Burrowers admittedly on plot synopsis' does lend one to think that a fun packed creature feature is in the offering, but as many unaware film fans have found out, this is far from being the case.

I would rather walk in the right direction than ride with my head up my ass.

The Burrowers takes itself seriously, and not insultingly so. J.T. Petty wanted to make a Horror/Western but not in the schlocky sense. He even infuses the narrative with some human concerns and statements, ecologically and racially so.

The pace is very, very deliberate, so potential first time viewers need to take that into consideration. Once the plot is kick started in the opening salvo, the posse go out into the wilds and interact, for better and worse, dialogue is sharp and pointed, intelligent even.

A number of great character based scenes are setting the tone for what is a downbeat picture, while when the action comes in tantalising spurts, it's well marshalled by Petty, and it's not just all about the creatures either.

The look is of a classical Western, which considering the modest budget is quite some achievement. From costuming and props, to the colour palette, the film convinces as the Old West of 1879. In this regard it would have been very interesting to have seen Petty make a standalone Oater.

Practical effects are very decent and CGI is wisely used sparingly, though the big showdown at pic's end is something of a let down. Elsewhere Sir Clancy of Brown and Doug The Thug Hutchison are sadly under written, though the face fuzz department scores high marks!

A tricky one to recommend to either Horror or Western fans, but for atmosphere and a great sense of period - and no little amount of originality as well, it's worth checking out as long as you don't expect Tremors. 7/10"

Frozen is a fairly straightforward film.

Don't expect deep character development or powerful themes. But what Frozen does offer is a horror movie with such realism that it feels like a true story.

Not being a big fan of either Jennifer Aniston or Gerard Butler, even with a great supporting case, and some amusing ""villains"", I'm had low expectations for this one, even the first time I watched it.

Most of it is those two just screwing each other over as they explore their relationship, which is funny, but it's like a more action focused, versus version of ""Duplex"", and it was more entertaining to see them work together in that, than these two against each other in this.

I expect anyone with an ex-wife is going to really enjoy the first half of this movie, at least.  The obvious reconciling, and general unlikeability of the characters just sinks this one for me.  I was never on board with either character, so I don't care if anything good happens to them. || It is funny enough. The acting is good enough.

The issue here is that, well, we have seen this before. There were a run of movies like this, both comedies and action films in the 70s and 80s and they even occasionally popped up in the early 90s.

The Bounty Hunter doesn't add anything new. It doesn't take the story on a fun and interesting turn, and it doesn't even cover old ground in a way that is fresh and entertaining.

It's sort of just there and for the time and energy it takes to watch, you can easily tune into another of the many movies in this genre that are less of a bland rehash. || Only if you are a fan of Rachel ..."

Case 39 is directed by Christian Alvart and written by Ray Wright. It stars Renee Zellwegger, Jodelle Ferland, Ian McShane and Bradley Cooper. Music is by Michl Britsch and cinematography by Hagen Bodanski.

Another in the long line of demonic/psycho children films, Case 39 sat on the shelf for a few years before finally seeing the light of day around 2009. Met with a whole bunch of negative reviews it is somewhat pleasing to find that while it’s not a misunderstood classic or anything, it actually works well within this sub-genre of horror.

Story in short order form has Zellwegger as Emily Jenkins, a social worker who after rescuing young Lilly Sullivan from crazed parents, takes her in on a temporary foster basis and soon comes to regret it.

Offering up a more supernatural slant than many other films of a similar ilk, German director Alvart does still follow the familiar formula for crazed child movies. Lillith (unsubtle name or what?!) serenely ingratiates herself into Emily’s world and that of the people around her, then of course things start happening, bad things. Having taken his time to build it up during the first half, Alvart then revels in unleashing demonic chaos, with young Ferland giving an unnervingly superb performance as Lilly. The shocks and psychological torments are tidily crafted, and it all builds to a suitably daft and frenetic finale.

It’s too long at nearly two hours in length, it’s sometimes silly and it’s cliché heavy. However, some striking scenes, a mightily strong child performance and the decent chiller thriller fun factor, lifts this just above average status. 6/10 || **Just do your job! Don't think above that like you can be a saviour!**

It looked like some kind of thriller, that's what anybody would say if they read the title correctly. The story was suspense, well developed to keep that for a very long time. Though it had no major twist, just a revelation like clarifying our doubts. Because most of the storyline seems alike 'Orphan', the film that came just months before this one. But this is a horror theme, I mean real horror, not a terror-horror like 'Orphan'. The overall story relied on one big secret that revealed at some time in the final act.

I have seen many films about the child abuse, and this one set in as a same kind of theme, but takes a turn during the end of the first act. So when a social worker, Emily, finds a ten year old Lilith was abused by her own parents, she takes her away from them, followed by theirs arrest. Later, Emily adopts Lilith, but soon finds some strange events around her circle. That leads to suspect Lilith, but could not prove anything. Finding the truth becomes her first priority, but how she's going to solve it is what leads us to the conclusion part.

I haven't seen Renee Zellweger in any recent films, she looked so good in this. Jodelle Ferland too was good as a little girl, the most important role in the film. But Bradley Cooper was in a small part. I think it was a decent film, but not a fresh theme, except developed differently with a new cast. If you are a big horror film fan, you might disappoint with it. Because those parts were minimised and the suspense was maximised. Yet surely most of us can easily predict many scenes, event the ending. So I conclude my review saying it is a decent watch.

My rate for this movie is A. Good for kids. Good for adults. || First of all, the animation in this is spectacular. All the scenery in the film looks like something you could find in real life. The action, mainly the climax, and flying shots in this film also show how great the animation is. The main thing about the animation that is amazing is how the dragons look. They all look like real, kinda cartoonish, dragons that come across as vicious but also cute. The cinematography in this film is stunning. The lighting in each and every scene was chosen correctly for it. I really like the score in this film that was done by John Powell. The music in the film just helped bring you into this fantasy world of Vikings and dragons. Now my main problem is mainly the casting of the voice actors. They all did great jobs as their roles but I think some of them would have been better casted if their character was older and not a teenager. That can mainly be seen with Hiccup who is supposed to be a teenager but sounds like an adult who already went through puberty. I also had a few issues with the pacing in this film. Some scenes were way too short and I would have liked to have seen them a tiny bit longer. Now I do get that it’s a film made for children but as long as there’s moving objects on screen kids won’t care what’s happening in the movie. In the end How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent film for everybody no matter how old you are. I give How to Train Your Dragon a 9/10. || Who wouldn't want Toothless as a pet?

Honestly I can see my future kids and their future kids loving this movie as much as I do. How To Train Your Dragon is just that great of a movie. It's gorgeous, funny, heartfelt, and it's got something to say. I can't praise this wonderful film enough."

This movie is about Greek Mythology. I'm really not into that subject. It's a good thing I saw Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief so I was able to get a background on the gods. I think Percy Jackson is the modern Clash of the Titans.


I appreciated Sam Worthington here. I always thought he looked better as an avatar than in person but in this movie he looked good.

My grade for this movie is B. || A mixed bag.

I didn't really enjoy <em>'Clash of the Titans'</em> but I didn't dislike it all that much either. The cast do alright, as Sam Worthington sticks out most - the rest kinda merge into one in my memory. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes feel very underused, in fact the parts of the story involving them onscreen didn't do anything for me - Worthington & Co.'s bits are far more watchable.

The special effects aren't the best, including those used for 'the gods'... though Fiennes as Hades looks fine enough. It's mainly the creatures that don't work as well, most notably for the giant scorpions on the wide shots. On that note, I did rate the long, sweeping shots that are used throughout... the music is strong too, I'd even say Ramin Djawadi's work is the best thing about this 2010 flick to be honest.

Not one I'd personally revisit... still gonna see what they did for the sequel, though."

Henson, William Fichtner, James Franco, Mila Kunis, Mark Wahlberg, Kristen Wiig and Ray Liotta - that's not even all, as Mark Ruffalo, Gal Gadot and Jon Bernthal - plus yet more others - feature too.

After his umpteenth beating he is rescued by a like-minded father and daughter team who take him under their own wing and set about training him. Meantime, the kingpin of crime ""D'Amico"" (Mark Strong) is running the town with a ruthless rod of iron, watched adoringly by his hapless son ""Chris"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Surprisingly, the former trio start to have some success against this arch-baddie so battle lines are soon drawn and, well you can guess the rest. Up to a point, this works. ATJ (especially with glasses and curly hair) is very easy on the eye and there is a degree of chemistry between his character and his cohort ""Mindy"" (Chloë Grace Moretz) all under the tutelage of a rather underplayed Nicolas Cage as her dad ""Damon"". Sadly, the initially quirky start that sees real people aspiring to make their community better - without the ability to fly or laser things with their eyes - peters out quite quickly and the jokes that are quite attitudinally sharp at the start just become a little more puerile and expletive-dependent. Mr. Strong isn't really much of a baddie and the combat scenes are well and truly prolonged to the point where they end up a bit repetitive and dull.

Like with <em>'The Emperor’s New Groove'</em>, all the goodness comes with the humour which is again amusing. David Spade (Kuzco), who only appears for short cameos here, is definitely missed but Patrick Warburton (Kronk) does a respectable job at leading this sequel.

The premise isn't as memorable as the 2000 production's, with them deciding to split a few flashback stories across the relatively short run time. I'm not usually a fan of doing that (see: <em>'Tarzan & Jane'</em>), but Elliot M. Bour, Saul Andrew Blinkoff & co. do well to keep things interesting. The format probably works better for these films due to them not taking themselves too seriously; which is a positive.

It's nice to hear the return of Warburton, Spade, John Goodman (Pacha) and others - I'm likely to enjoy a follow-up film more if the same cast remain, changes almost always end up in failure. Tracey Ullman is one of a couple newcomers to this, she's alright as Miss Birdwell.

Sure, this isn't something that needed to be made. However, it is a sequel that is actually fairly entertaining - which isn't always the case, especially with Disney's animated films. Worth a watch."

But is it really necessary to push for a gag once a minute throughout the movie? The movie's pacing leaves the viewer breathless, and grasping in vain for any semblance of a coherent storyline. Aside from the fact that two incompetent agents are searching for a destructive weapon, it is impossible to understand what is really going on in this movie.

I don't know the source material. In the event that it is exactly as the movie turned out,they should have fleshed it out with something that would have made it work as actual storytelling.

As for the characters, none of them are remotely relatable, and the gags aren't really funny. The actors are seemingly just waiting to get squashed, beaten or otherwise manhandled, so they don't have to do any real acting work.

The movie hit new lows with cruel torture scenes (especially the one where the mother is tortured), generally misogynist behavior,and racist renditions of several different ethnic groups.

From other reviews on this site, I understand that the movie is based on a very popular Spanish comic,but there must be a better way to adapt the source material than this. As it stands now I can only speculate that the director (Fesser) was experiencing a drug induced delirium during the making of this movie.Mistaking rapid-fire slapstick,and complete nonsense for a flash of genius.

Mostly I am sorry for Dominique Pinon,a quality actor who cannot have known what lay in store for him,participating in this movie.

Now, I might be somewhat biased on this particular subject, because I am a huge fan of 70's (punk)rock, and especially female rock artists, but I am also a very critical film reviewer. The Runaways therefore, leaves me feeling in limbo.

I love musical biopics as much as I love the music itself, and since The Runaways falls exactly into my favourite genre of music, I thought this film would be nothing other than a win-win flick for me. However, I felt rather quickly discouraged from the build-up on. When you are telling a true-to-life story, I consider it an important issue to let the audience know who we're dealing with, what's going on and perhaps most importantly, why. These are real people and I want to know why they are who they are, and what motivated them to walk their chosen path in life. The film starts off with alternating scenes of Joan Jett and her soon to be band mate Cherie Currie. Doing stuff that, well... isn't that interesting. It doesn't tell us much about these girls except that they like punk rock and David Bowie. Honestly, having only seen the film last night, it's all I can remember about the first 15 minutes or so. And so the film continues.

They form a band, are taken under the wing of weirdo record producer/manager Kim Fowley, become famous and at some point, break up. The way director Floria Sigismondi tells the story, you'd think it was actually that easy. And this is exactly where the problem lies: bad direction. Possibly even worse editing and screenplay. We are given almost zero back-story of the lives of these young girls, and strangely, literally nothing at all about the personal life of Joan Jett. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the real Joan Jett was actually executive producer of this film, which completely puzzles me considering her part was so badly written. Her character comes across as not much more than a bystander in her own story.

At least we're offered snippets of information about Cherie Currie. We know that she comes from an instable family and that her sister (who is in fact her twin – something I had to learn from Wikipedia since it's never told in the film...) is the only one she is at least somewhat close to. Again though, strangely, what is never told here is that this girl was raped when she was 14 – an incident which strongly determined the person she would become later on. Very weird to leave out of a biopic.

It is my understanding that the rest of the band didn't give permission for their life story to be used in the film, and it shows. On the one hand, it's a shame because the back-story of the band is already so badly underexposed. On the other, I can't blame them, because this film would have done them no justice whatsoever.

The story of The Runaways is told as though it all happened overnight: formation, fame, break-up; in what feels like no more than a short year maybe. When in fact they released four albums, three of which with Cherie. Truly awful screenplay.

The actors though, are not at all to blame. Kristen Stewart embodies Joan Jett perfectly, she's got the looks, the voice (she sings all her parts herself) and the swagger. Dakota Fanning as Cherie does a very good job also. Although she may not look or sound that much like the real Cherie Currie, her acting more than makes up for it. But then again, anyone who's seen Dakota before, whether as a child actor or teenager, already knows she's a very convincing young actress. The rest of the band, much like their characters, are barely there to be noticed...

The part of Kim Fowley is played by Michael Shannon, and he approaches it with a ""love it or hate it"" attitude. Personally, I think he was an absolute scene-stealer (which is not necessarily a good thing, because obviously this film is not about him – though it is the direction that is to blame, not the actor), acting completely over the top, crude, and horribly inappropriate. Though I can see why some people absolutely hated his character. Simple: there is nothing likable about him. He's an a**hole, and a big one too. As an acting part however, it was obvious that Michael Shannon had a ball playing this guy, and I think that's what makes his role very enjoyable to watch.

The actors really do make up for a lot in The Runaways. All parts are equally well-played and very enjoyable. But when the technical aspects of a film are this poor, not even the best actors in the world can make it a success. Zero story, zero character development, shoddy editing and, worst of all, not enough music! Probably the stupidest thing about the whole film – you'd think that, in a film about The Runaways, there'd be more than two or three original Runaways songs! Yet we have to listen to ""Cherry Bomb"" over and over again, and we get only titbits of their other songs. Sheesh.

The Runaways may not have been the most groundbreaking band in history, but they certainly were a cool band of young rock chicks, and they deserved a better film than this one. I would say it's fun to watch once if you're into this kind of music, but that's it. Such a shame.

This is a remake of the 2007 ""Death at a Funeral"" which was English where as this is the black / american version.  Personally, this was very large shoes to fill only 3 years after the original.

Surprisingly, the movie is almost beat for beat the original, and they even got 	Peter Dinklage to reprise the same role (apparently a rare thing to do in the industry), which begs why they didn't get Alan Tudyk, also American, to reprise his role (and my fav from the original).  James Marsden tries to put his personal spin on it, but it does look like he is very much imitating Tudyk for the most part.

Luke Wilson replaces the Scottish role, being the only other white actor which says more about how the English take to the Scots as out of sorts than anything.  It's a stupid thing: the whole world should get along better.

This is an awesome cast: Zoe Saldana, Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Danny Glover (probably my favorite in this one), Tracey Morgan, Kevin Hart, and Keith David.  And they're all fantastic, even the people I'm less familiar with were on point.  So I do give this version points for better casting and bigger personalities.

Nicolas Winding Refn directs and Mads Mikkelsen stars in this ponderous exercise in arty veneers. Refn boldly strips back the dialogue and plot to reveal a picture big on ideas but poor in execution. As the story plods along, stopping only briefly for some guttural violence now and then, it becomes evident that the makers have made a painfully boring movie. At first the drained out colour photography looks like a masterstroke of ethereal atmospherics, but this also wears off and only compounds the overall feeling of monotony that pervades the pic.

Hugely disappointing venture from a director capable of so much more. 3/10 || Twilight of the grim, grey… um…

RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, ""Valhalla Rising” takes place in the 11th century where a one-eyed mute thrall (Mads Mikkelsen) obtains his freedom in the Scottish Highlands and joins a band of Viking Christians on a voyage to the Holy Land to fight in the Crusades, but the expedition doesn’t go as planned.  

The movie definitely LOOKS and SOUNDS awesome with an ambient score reminiscent of Agalloch, but without the heavy riffing or manic drumming. It’s an artsy non-blockbuster with a tone akin to ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"" (1972) and ""Black Robe"" (1991). “Apocalypto” (2006) is a good modern comparison, although the story isn't as compelling as “Black Robe” or “Apocalypto.” It has elements of “Apocalypse Now” (1979) but the thin story just isn’t anywhere near as fascinating. Still, it’s okay.    

There are some weak points, like the Viking chief saying ""It's a river"" when this would've been obvious about an hour earlier when the mist first cleared (aduh). I'm sure the director would chalk it up to artistic license. Another issue is that the film is slow with not enough events to justify its runtime. As such, we get needlessly drawn-out scenes like the discovery of fresh water (which was obvious from the get-go of the sequence). The whole episode could’ve been done in a third of the time given.
                   
THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in Scotland. WRITERS: Refn, Roy Jacobsen and Matthew Read. 
 
GRADE: B

INTERPRETATION ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don’t read further unless you’ve seen the movie).

The silent One-Eye is the incarnation of Odin. He is invincible and holds the power to see the future. He disdains the Christian Vikings who’ve usurped his influence over his people. He tests many in battle to see if they’re worthy, but finds none. Nevertheless, he sullenly sees his people off to their new (holy) land, America, where Scandinavians were the third most numerous immigrants. The Boy is a type of Thor, his son, who will sort of replace him in America once the grim god ironically sacrifices himself à la Jesus Christ. || Rubbish! A true waste of 90 minutes... and of Mads Mikkelsen!

It evidently attempts similar as to what we would later see in 2022 with (the excellent) <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-northman/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Northman</a>'</em>, though simply falls flat in every department for me. The whole production just looks so cheap and low-budget (which it wasn't), without even noting the (admittedly intended) pure misery of the look of it all too. Editing, notably with the needless chapter breaks, is also a negative.

As mentioned already, a mute Mikkelsen is completedly wasted... may as well have cast Joe Bloggs. The rest of the cast have very little to work with either, though minutely interesting to see Gary Lewis and Jamie Sives involved. I wouldn't say anyone onscreen deteriorates the film (it does so itself), but they also don't do anything to improve it either.

I was anticipating <em>'Valhalla Rising'</em> to be an entertaining one. It wasn't. Thankfully they had the awareness (or were restricted?) in keeping it 'short' at 90 minutes... a dreary 90mins, albeit."

The big problem I have with is this is that the protagonist is irredeemable until he's basically a broken person in the 3rd act, and even then he's not a better person, he's just punished for his shallow attempts of social power advancement so much that accidentally chooses the correct political move to stumble into a happy ending.

The rest of the movie is surprisingly good, and reminds me of a younger ""Mean Girls"" where the social environment of the social is dissected as if it a ""natural environment"" and there is a metaphoric pecking order of life or death.

So we were finally able to buy tickets BUT we were seated separately. It was fine though. The movie kept me entertained. Except for the guy near me who was snoring pretty loud, the movie was great.


Of course Robert Downey Jr was amazing as always. There might be weird critics with this movie but for me, I liked it. The action scenes were just right. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together. But all in all I liked the movie. Seeing old characters from the first movie and new characters. I can't wait for a 3rd Iron Man movie.


My rate for this movie is B+. || Yet another ridiculously high rated Marvel movie, we get it Marvel fanboys you just love it when a new Marvel movie comes out, so much that you forget any flaws in it and give it a 10 or a 9 anyways.

But come on seriously? Wouldn't you rather they spent a little time at actually writing a somewhat decent script and making it a bit more entertaining than to praise EVERYTHING they do to the skies just because you want a new chapter in the Marvel universe?

Cause this is NOT a good movie, 35 minutes of decent at best action and 85 minutes of nonsensical blabber.

Mickey Rourke was the only highlight in this movie, the scene at the racetrack with him was really cool but then he just became a wasted opportunity just like the rest of the movie.

A really boring turd of a film. || **A long form review originally posted in 2010:**

I find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.

On the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.

When films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are ""Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it."" Very classy.

Although Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.

The Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; ""Congratulations sir, you have created a new element"", is a little flawed.

Though if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.

They are both equally good, and for different reasons. Pierre (Roland Giraud) the architect, Michel (Michel Boujenah) the cartoonist, and Jacques (Andre Dussollier) the air steward all live in the same Paris apartment. Their swinging ways are turned upside down when Jacques' hitherto unknown infant child is left on the doorstep with a note attached from the mother saying she will be in the United States on a modelling shoot for a few months. Jacques is not there, either, as he is in the Far East. He did promise to hold a package for a friend, and Pierre and Michel assume baby Marie is it. Very similar to the remake, so far. The baby is given to drug dealers, who come looking for a ""package"" of heroin. The exchange is not made, and the police follow Pierre and Michel, looking for the narcotics. Strangely, halfway through the film, Michel hands off the heroin in a diaper to the dealer, and this plot, which never worked in either film, suddenly ends! No hidden camera, no dressing like a woman, and no eccentric detective. I wondered just what the heck these people were going to do for the rest of the film.

This is where the darkness creeped in. The mother, Sylvia (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu), comes home and takes the baby back. The three bachelors try to get back to their womanizing and drinking, but they are set upon by such an omnipotent depression, I thought I might have to call the mental health hotline. Michel and Jacques do see the baby on occasion, but try not to bond with it. Pierre is downright suicidal, laying in bed with a squeaky toy. While the first half of the film was not the light fluff of the remake, the second half was so sad and depressing, it gives many foreign films a bad name. The baby is cute, but all the adults here come off as self-centered. A birthday celebration where the shallow guests complain that a child is not ""interesting"" until it is a toddler was meant to be funny, but is a little painful to watch. In the end, the mother brings the baby back, and the men dance for joy. This was a truly happy scene, and I wish some more happiness had creeped in to other scenes. I can see why the remake made such a big fuss about the drug dealer subplot, can you imagine Tom Selleck looking like he wanted to die, and Steve Guttenberg stalking the model mom from afar? Women do not come off well at all, being either sexual toys for the men or completely selfish shrews who are only concerned with their own happiness, forget the kid.

The budget for the Wes Craven original, $1.8 Million. You don't always get a better movie if your budget is huge, look at Avatar. You just get a really pretty movie that looks polished and has flawless special effects. Again, see Avatar. That movie was nothing but flash. The story is unoriginal and weak... and don't try coming at me with this whole ""Shut up man! Avatar proved itself!"" shut up! The larger budget in this case makes the movie look too polished to be takes seriously. Why the hell are we caring about watching clones of the Twilight teens being chased by Freddy Kruger? Were not. This movie didn't need a budget of $35 Million. It feels wasted. Some of the appeal of the original came from watching the director be a director and figure scenes out. This movie didn't do that. It felt trite and forced.

Freddy Kruger is less of a movie villain in the horror industry and more of an icon. Everyone I knew growing up all had Freddy Kruger nightmares when they were a kid. Perhaps this new version of Freddy will serve to scare the shit out of kids these days. I would hope so. Maybe when they remake this movie again in twenty years they will bitch about it then as well. Who knows. || ***A more realistic and morose version of the original film & franchise***

The specter of a dead pedophile fatally haunts the dreams of the children of his self-appointed executioners who burned him to death years earlier.

Released in 2010, this is a reboot of the original 1984 movie, freely throwing in elements from other flicks in the franchise. I think Jackie Earle Haley works well as creepy Freddy Krueger and I like the more realistic tone, which some say makes movie bland and boring. Rooney Mara (Nancy) and Kyle Gallner (Quentin) are decent as the main protagonists and I think the bedroom scene is superior to the same attack scene in the original; it’s more shocking. The prison scene’s great too.

Unfortunately, the concept of Freddy is a bit of a mess. For instance, his bladed-glove is never explained. And what was the point of the boiler room since he was just a gardener at a small preschool? The filmmakers just threw in these elements because it's Freddy, figuring people knew the character. But how do these components fit into THIS movie? And what about viewers who never saw the original flicks?

The film runs 1 hours, 35 minutes and was shot in northern Illinois and nearby Gary, Indiana, with reshoots done in Los Angeles.

GRADE: B-/C+ || I really liked this new nightmare. I wish there was more action in it but still pretty good. I hope this is the start of a new Freddy movie series."

What usually happens when a remake of a film so acclaimed and so well remembered comes out that it's considered a classic? As a rule, we tend to think that the remake was totally unnecessary and that the original is always better. This film, in fact, is a remake that has everything to be considered unnecessary and, perhaps because of that, it was put a little aside by almost everyone. It wasn't a film that caught the attention, it went automatically to the television market without even going to the cinemas and disappeared quietly.

I have to admit that this remake was not necessary. The original film is incredible value and did not lack for such a thing. However, this production for television also has some value and some merits that we cannot fail to observe, otherwise we are not being fair. And the cast is, perhaps, one of the greatest merits of the film, which will keep the characters from the original, taking extreme care in reinterpreting some of them and including greater racial mixing. And we can say that all the actors hired are good, and they all do a truly exemplary job. Jack Lemmon and George Scott deserve all the attention, with colossal and powerful interpretations, but it is also worth seeing the work of James Gandolfini, Ossie Davis, Hume Cronyn or Dorian Harewood.

The movie also works pretty well considering it's a made-for-TV movie. I don't know if I can say that it has cinematic characteristics, but I wouldn't be shocked to see it in the movie theater. The cinematography is quite good, the sets and costumes meet what you expect to find, and the film is, in practice, a modernized copy of its old version. It was needless, it will never take the place of the original film, but it turned out to be a well done remake nonetheless."

But I'll be honest, I can watch Prince of Thieves over and over again. It's a fun movie, so long as you only watch the Alan Rickman parts.

But Rickman was kind of out there on his own for most of the film and able to do his own thing and cut loose...while poor Freeman was stuck opposite Costner in every scene and, being a generous man he stepped back and gave Kevin the opportunity to not even attempt to act.

Here wen have, again, some pretty good actors and some pretty clever character actors...and Russel Crowe.

My issue with a LOT of Crowe movies is that he's not generous like Freeman. He doesn't step back and let others do their thing so the movie will succeed.

Crowe hogs as much of every scene as he can and, when he's not directly talking, moves, does things to draw your attention to him and not the other actors.

Master and Commander suffered for it. He was probably too afraid to do it opposite Pacino in The Insider, I can see Bale being just as aggressive in 3:10 to Yuma...but in Robin Hood, Crowe is up to his old tricks again.

So you have the Russel Crowe show once more and that gets tiresome. It gets tiresome fast.

The rule, at least my rule for Crowe movies is simple, if it looks like he's going to be forced to share it will be a great film...if it looks like he can hog it, the movie is going to stink.

Romantic dramas aren't exactly my favorite type of film, but I recognize the quality of work done in this film, and the skill of director Derek Cianfrance. In almost every way, this film was a labor of love, drawing heavily on the director's personal experience who, as a young man, witnessed his parents' divorce. Although the film has a name that reminds us of the rosier side of love, the film actually does a very detailed dissection of a relationship, from beginning to end.

I can even agree if someone tells me that this film is not for everyone: it is a dense film, something slow, there are very monotonous passages, dialogues that seem to be there just to fill time, but that actually help us to understand the personality and way of acting of the two elements of the couple. In addition, the film does not have a linear narrative, making several setbacks and temporal advances, in order to intersperse the past and the present, showing us the evolution of the relationship and, also, its wear and tear. It's not a nice movie or easy to watch, and in large part this is due to the authenticity of what we see. That couple could be our neighbor, or one of us. It is a film that, for many people, can evoke painful memories of past and present courtships and marriages.

I really enjoyed the interpretation of Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Both actors were fully committed to the work, built a powerful chemistry and partnership, they are largely the soul of the film. Gosling played a romantic who absolutely believes in love and seems willing to do anything to try to make their marriage work. He's passionate, absolute and enthusiastic, the kind of man who doesn't mind taking risks, and has the self-confidence to run after the ones he loves. Williams made her character more reserved, tough, a little defensive, but full of personality and inner strength. Moreover, the actress would get an Oscar nomination for Best Actress with this work.

The film has a very well executed cinematography, excellent editing work and good production values. It's not a flashy film, it will surely go unnoticed by many people, and in fact it's not a perfect film or totally likable, but it's interesting, it's intense, and if we give it a chance, it's impossible not to feel sympathy for the characters. and suffer with the difficulties they go through. || A really rather dreary depiction of two young people from pretty dysfunctional backgrounds who get together - with her baby from another relationship - and struggle through life. Ryan Gosling is ""Dean"" a working class man quite content to make his way as a handy man/painter whilst ""Cindy"" (Michelle Williams) is a nurse who has (slightly) greater aspirations for both of them, and her little girl. The story is delivered in threads that try to reconcile their separate, rather depressing, routes to their current predicaments alongside their prevailing issues. Certainly there was love, once, in their relationship but that has long been supplanted by resentment, frustration and even some jealousy before it all culminates with a rather disastrous ""romantic"" night in an hotel. The relentless inevitability of the story is writ large from the start, and although the film is well put together, it cannot elevate it from the realms of a rather drab, angry melodrama. || A film that feels like falling in and out of love in the same breath. It doesn’t warn you, it just wounds you - with all the tenderness and cruelty of real intimacy. Ryan and Michelle aren’t acting - they’re remembering. And maybe that’s the most painful thing of all."

There's also quite possibly one of the most obnoxious phone calls I've ever heard between him and his ass-covering personnel director that really did have me shouting ""lie, for God's sake"" at the screen.

I guess ultimately it is what it is, a Disney backed video game adaptation of the blockbuster kind.

In truth it works just fine and dandy as a family fantasy adventure, with swords and sandals - shields and sarongs, all in abundance. There's the mythical and the magical, the swish and the swash, the HD photography a treat for the eyes. The leads are pretty, likable and energetic, and even though it consistently reminds us that it is based on a video game (jumping and rolling, jumping and rolling), the choreography is niftily arranged and there's a lovely old fashioned feel to the story; which works in that wonderful Sinbadish way.

Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and if one was so inclined? One could deconstruct the faults of the production with the same clinical impact of that achieved by Ben Kingsley's (Sir) wallet when it hit the floor after this paycheck was deposited. It should be viewed in the spirit of how Alfred Molina plays his character, with tongue in cheek and a complete understanding of how to have a good time with popcorn fluff. Prince of Persia is forgettable come the end credits, but at least it was a fun date. And for that we are truly grateful. 7/10 || It's very, very bad but I guess I was in just the right mood for it because I actually kind of enjoyed watching _Prince of Persia_. I can't pinpoint even a single good thing about it, whereas I can immediately conjure many of its failings, but I just remember having some fun. 

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Never played the video game, but I enjoyed this film suitably.

It has flaws, though there's enough to like about <em>'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'</em>. I rate Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor, while I don't think he's perfect for this role I did enjoy his performance all in all. The special effects are neat, especially for the dagger. The support cast are satisfactory, Alfred Molina being the standout behind Gyllenhaal.

The premise is a pretty fascinating one, but I don't feel there is enough there for a near 2hr production. It felt, a number of times, that the story was going round in circles and overextending itself in order to fill the run time, there are many times where 'A' runs from 'B', 'B' finds 'A' instantly, 'A' gets away. In many different guises, but it kept happening.

Could've been far greater, but I still come away from viewing this fairly positively."

Jackson, Carrie-Anne Moss, Michael Sheen, Stephen Root, Lora Kojovic","Peter Woodward, Gregor Jordan","psychological thriller, videotape, hard, disturbed, philosophical, serious, suspenseful, sentimental, intense, bold, cruel, empathetic","Unthinkable raises a question which has been an issue for many people all over the world for a very long time, and especially since 9/11. This question is, is it ever justified to torture an individual to save the lives of many? And if the answer is yes, how far can you go?

This issue is indeed a very sensitive subject and I think it takes guts for any filmmaker to put it out there in the open like Gregor Jordan did. Add to that the clever fact that he doesn't actually make a choice, but rather lets the audience decide on whatever they want to think and feel, and you have a pretty gutsy and controversial concept.

In a nutshell, this film is about a man of American descent who has become a Muslim and has now, as an act of terrorism, planted 3 nuclear bombs in 3 major American cities which will go off in four days. Screenwriter Peter Woodward made some very tactical decisions considering the characters in the story. They are all somewhat stereotypical, but this is no bother because they're all there for a reason. Carrie-Anne Moss, as an FBI investigator, represents the conscience, the sensitivity and the struggle to make the right decision. Samuel L. Jackson is her polar opposite; the brutal, rational, stone cold ""interrogator"" who does what he does because he's the only one who can and willing to do it. The means he is willing to go to in order to get his subject to talk are almost as unwatchable as they are unthinkable. This is quite possibly the most gruesome film I have ever seen, but that mostly has to do with the fact that the things you see are in fact very real. This stuff does happen, and it's way harder to stomach than any slasher horror movie because it sucks you in emotionally. Intelligence agencies and secret services the world over DO use these techniques, whether we like to believe it or not.

All of this sounds like a great opportunity to address a major issue and stimulate people to really think about it, doesn't it? One would like to think so, alas there is one big problem: bad writing. As hard as they try, the filmmakers do not, at any point, manage to evoke sympathy on either side of the fence. Not with the terrorist, for the complete lack of background and motivation, but neither with the people who try to stop him from executing his horrible plans that could claim the lives of millions of people. Especially Carrie-Anne Moss' character, Brody, is quite a pain in the butt because even though her struggle is understandable, quite simply because she's a decent human being, she comes off as kind of naive because she – from a professional point of view – is unwilling to sacrifice the life of one to save millions. Her constant interference gradually becomes increasingly annoying, up to the point that you just want her to get out of the way. However, Jackson's character H. turns out to be such a volatile psycho that you almost start to feel sorry for the terrorist! There is one scene in particular which throws you off so badly that you really don't know what to think anymore. I'll only say that it involves the terrorist's wife, and as much as I would like to warn you, I don't want to give any spoilers, but you can take it as a warning anyway... It'll make your skin crawl. 

The rest of the characters are about as lively and relevant as cardboard-cut-outs, I've already forgotten about most of them, but they don't really matter to the story anyway. However, all of this could have still turned into a decent film, if it wasn't for one major flaw: the horrible ending. It's so incredibly hollow and unsatisfactory that it leaves you wondering why the hell you just spent an hour and a half watching a man being tortured, if there was absolutely no point to it?! It could have been worthwhile if only the filmmakers had any resolve to offer, but there is none. Why did the terrorist do what he did? We don't know. Did the agents accomplish anything? Not really. So what's the point? There is no point. It's just 90 minutes of torture, bad decisions and failure. That's it. 

Overall, it's not all bad. There is some really good dialogue and despite aforementioned flaws and inconsistencies in the script, there are a few really good scenes which do involve one into the minds of the people on screen. The actors do the best they can with what they're given, Samuel L. Jackson is as reliable as ever and Carrie-Anne Moss is convincing in her role, which makes me sad to think that since The Matrix and Memento, she hasn't really had any memorable roles, and that's too bad because she is a good actress. Michael Sheen as the terrorist is good too, though it's hard for him to make his character a 3-dimensional human being because the writers offered him no history or character development whatsoever, but he definitely makes his character's ""in-the-moment emotions"" work from scene to scene.

So, final conclusion. I wouldn't really dissuade anyone from watching this film, you now know what to expect and it does offer some interesting food for thought here and there, but you should really understand that this film is pretty challenging, mentally as much as physically. And don't watch this if you're under 18. Seriously.
_(November 2013)_ || Unthinkable is one of those movies that forces you to confront moral dilemmas head-on and leaves you questioning your own boundaries. It delivers a bold and unapologetic message that’s impossible to miss. While the plot centers around a high-stakes scenario involving a terrorist threat, the real tension comes from the ethical lines being blurred in the process of handling it. It’s not an easy movie to watch, but it’s definitely one that sticks with you.

The first act sets the stage well, introducing the characters and pulling you into the gravity of the situation. Once the story transitions into the heart of the conflict, the tension ramps up significantly, and the movie almost throws out traditional storytelling to focus entirely on its message. Surprisingly, this works in its favor, creating an unpredictable and unsettling atmosphere. It’s intense, uncomfortable, and keeps you glued, even when it’s hard to watch.

Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Sheen deliver standout performances. Jackson’s commanding and unrelenting presence contrasts perfectly with Sheen’s calculated and chilling portrayal, creating a dynamic that drives the story forward. The production supports the narrative effectively, with its cold, clinical setting amplifying the tension. Even the camerawork, especially the subtle shifts between perspectives, adds to the unease.

That said, the movie isn’t without flaws. It misses an opportunity to dive deeper into the emotional and psychological effects on everyone involved, which could have added more layers to its themes. And there’s one moment near the end involving a technical detail that feels out of place and undercuts the grounded realism. But despite these missteps, Unthinkable succeeds in delivering a tense and thought-provoking experience. If you’re into movies that challenge your sense of right and wrong, this one is worth a watch."

Splice is a tricky picture to evaluate, for its ideas are superb. One could argue that it brings a new petri dish full of meddling scientists facing the consequences of their actions, while conversely it justifiably feels like a Cronenberg knock-off.

Psychological discord is in abundance, with its slants on skew-whiff parenting giving the pic a dark fascination, and as unpleasant as the male fantasy angle is, it does hold a morbid interest factor.

Yet come the final third the makers let things run away from them, the bonkers dangers of tampering with science giving way to daft schlock, even managing to be distasteful in the process - while the finale is a weak attempt at a ""TBC"" cliff hanger.

Lead cast members are turning in good perfs. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley as the meddling science couple hold court well, and Delphine Chaneac as the Chimera splicer of the piece really nails all the various emotional strands required for a tricky role.

Director Vincenzo Natali  has shown with Cube and Cypher he has something to offer the horror/sci-fi splinters of film, but this is a mixed bag.

I was quite interested in the underlying premise but the execution here is really poor. I never did really get why Brody was ever successful in the first place and here there is no chemistry between him and Polley; the storyline which could have been challenging and thought-provoking instead borders on the absurdly far-fetched and the ending couldn't really come quick enough as we really do struggle to reach any sort of a satisfactory conclusion - either from a personal or a scientific perspective. It does highlight the dangers of unfettered scientific experimentation but sadly in no more an entertaining fashion that we have seen many times before - more enjoyably - from Hammer Studios!"

I did not like Western comics very much. Thus, I have no point of reference as to whether the movie is true to the original comic series. Maybe that is an advantage when seeing this movie in that I cannot get upset by the movie not being true to the original. Actually I am reasonably sure that this movie with it supernatural and steampunk influences are not entirely true to the original comic series.

Despite what seems to be the general opinion I quite liked this movie. The story is mostly comic book material but then this is a comic book character after all. I thought the story was good enough. There is plenty of quite enjoyable action in it. Josh Brolin is doing a good job of portraying the bad-ass Jonah Hex and John Malkowich is perhaps not managing to project the diabolical übervillain image that the Turnbull character is supposed to have but he is still not doing a bad job. Megan Fox is, well…Megan Fox. She is fitting the character and the movie fairly well though.

It is my understanding that the supernatural element of the movie is not something that can be found in the original comic series. It did not really disturb me. I am not sure that it added very much but it was okay.

I understand that people having read and being fans of the original comic series would be upset if the movie did not follow the original but I have to say that I do not understand why everyone else seems to bash it as well. It was an enjoyable hour and a half of fun action. Jonah Hex was the bad-ass that you hoped for. This movie was a much better “interpretation” of a comic series than the abysmal Green Hornet for instance where the hero was turned into a fumbling idiot.

For me personally, this movie was definitely on the upper half of the enjoyment-factor scale. || _**Comic book Western with an excellent metal score**_

I was never a big Jonah Hex fan, but I have a handful of the comics from the 70s and was therefore mildly interested in this cinematic adaption from 2010, especially since Megan Fox looked so good in the promo pics, lol.

""Jonah Hex"" reminds me of those gazillions of spaghetti Westerns from the 60s and 70s, like ""Django"" and Leone's ""Man with No Name"" trilogy except that it's more modern and entertaining.

To be expected, the atmosphere is very comic booky and the filmmakers do an outstanding job with the title character's hideously scarred face. It's like the comic come to life. Josh Brolin is fine in the eponymous role. On top of this, Megan Fox proves in her peripheral part that she was the foxiest woman in Hollywood at the time.

At only 82 minutes, the story is simple and the pace is fast, which I don't mind since too many films overstay their welcome. But the writers did strive for some depth and that's commendable. If there was more depth and epic-ness I wouldn't hesitate to raise my rating. As it is, ""Jonah Hex"" plays like a spaghetti Western that's actually decent. Imagine the style and pizazz of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" updated to 2010, but half as long, no tedious stretches and less one-dimensional characters and you'd have a pretty good approximation of ""Jonah Hex.""

One of the film's highlights is the incredible metalized score by Marco Beltrami and none other than Mastodon. The movie's worth seeing for the music alone, no kidding.

The film was shot in Louisiana with some re-shoots in California.

GRADE: B || Actually not terrible though some of the editing and directorial choices, especially in the finale, were questionable. I did like Josh Brolin in the lead even if his prosthetics weren't always the best but the action and pyrotechnics were decent enough and John Malkovich as usual makes for a vicious bad guy while Megan Fox was... Megan Fox, at least looked great. I did wish it leaned more into the weird elements as we only get a few moments.

I was worried that, as a fan of the original TV-series when I was a kid, I would be disappointed but it had actually captured the spirit of the series quite well. It was fun to watch, with a nice blend of comedy and action. Okay, the famous tank scene was perhaps a bit over the top but, what the hell, it’s supposed to be an action film with a touch of comedy so...Naturally the so-called ""critics"" wrote it down, for instance on Rotten Tomatoes, but if you switch to the tab which shows what the actual audience said, it got a greater than 70% approval rating. IMDB also gives it a bit more than 7 stars out of 10 which I would say it’s well worth. || I never watched the original TV series, beyond a vague awareness of Mr. T I knew literally nothing about it. Which meant that I couldn't feel like this reboot was letting me down, but I also was in no way ingratiated with the franchise. Seemed like the positives and negatives of going in blind like that sort of cancelled each other out, and that's pretty much the attitude I've got to the movie itself. There was cool stuff, there was some lame stuff, and all in all they levelled themselves out for a pretty average movie-watching experience.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || The A-Team (2010) felt like a chaotic attempt to modernize the classic show, but it never really stuck the landing. The directing leans hard into the over-the-top action vibe, but instead of giving us slick sequences, it delivers a messy blur of noise and explosions. The pacing is all over the place, and it’s clear they were trying to make it cool and energetic, but it just ends up feeling loud and confusing. There’s no real rhythm to the way scenes unfold, and some of the more intense moments lose their impact because they’re drowned in shaky visuals.

Speaking of visuals, the cinematography was frustrating at best. Way too much shaky cam, weird half-face angles, and quick cuts that make it hard to enjoy any of the action. It felt like the camera was constantly moving just for the sake of movement, not to actually enhance the scene. That kind of editing usually screams, “we didn’t have great footage to work with,” and unfortunately, it shows. I found myself trying to follow what was happening rather than getting pulled into the story. It’s one of those movies that mistakes chaos for excitement.

The cast is actually solid, with Liam Neeson bringing his usual presence and Bradley Cooper doing his thing, but the script gives them very little to work with. The dialogue feels forced, and the characters never really breathe or evolve. It’s like the movie assumed the audience already loved these guys, so it skipped over giving them depth. The score tries to hype things up, and while I did get a flash of Indiana Jones vibes early on, I realized it was just a modern remix of the original A-Team theme. Nostalgic, sure, but it didn’t save the mess. Overall, it's got energy, but not much substance."

The Scalphunters is directed by Sydney Pollack and adapted to screenplay by William W. Norton from the novel of the same name written by Ed Friend. It stars Burt Lancaster, Ossie Davis, Telly Savalas and Shelley Winters. A Panavision/De Luxe Colour production, music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Richard Moore and Duke Callaghan.

Joe Bass (Lancaster) is a fur trapper making his way home with his latest haul when he is stopped by Kiowa Indians. Taking his furs they give him as payment a well educated slave, Joseph Lee (Davis), who they had previously commandeered from a group of Comanches. With Joseph tagging along, Joe sets about pursuing the Kiowa to reclaim his furs, but the Indians fall victim to a band of ruthless Scalphunters led by Jim Howie (Savalas), who gain his furs whilst also by accident capture Joseph. It's Joe Bass against the rest, and only Joseph knows what the Scalphunters are up against.

""Those furs and that man out there are the Scorpio satanic configuration of death for Jim Howie""

Impressively mounted by Pollack, gorgeously shot at Durango, Mexico, The Scalphunters is an interesting blend of a Western action comedy with drama and Civil Rights morality. Film is structured simply by thrusting Lancaster's ignorant and illiterate man of the wilderness together with Davis' literate but ostracised slave. Both men poles apart, but both able to benefit the other if racial barriers can be broke down? Once Joseph falls into the hands of the Scalphunters, film sees Joseph once more held captive, but by using his nous he may be able to finally gain his freedom should the group make it to Mexico.

All the time Joe Bass is tracking the group, picking them off any chance he gets, this means the banter and lively group dynamic of the Scalphunters is pleasantly interrupted by an action scene of some standing. Be it Joe Bass leaping about the rocks and causing a rock avalanche, or the Scalphunters horses going loco, film never lacks for genuine thrills. Some great stunt work in here as well. It's a fine screenplay of much intelligence, not least because it doesn't crowbar in its messages, while it also doesn't patronise the Joseph Lee character. Even as the laughs flit in and out of proceedings, the script pings with smarts as brains are afforded the black man and the ignorance belongs to whitey.

With the cast on fine form and Bernstein scoring it with trademark robustness, it rounds out as a hugely enjoyable Western. So pick a favourite scene and a favourite character, whilst all the time acknowledging that behind the froth and machismo beats a potent thematic heart. 8/10 || ***Amusing late 60s Western with Lancaster, Ossie Davis and Savalas***

A rugged trapper (Burt Lancaster) is forced by a band of Kiowas to trade his valuable furs for an educated runaway slave (Ossie Davis). To get the furs back, they follow the Indians and, then, a band of scalphunters, led by a boisterous bald guy (Telly Savalas). Shelley Winters is also on hand. 

What’s notable about “The Scalphunters” (1968), besides the cast, is that the entire story takes place in the Southwest wilderness. There are no towns, buildings or teepees in sight. But there’s some gorgeous location photography.

While there are entertaining comedic bits, don’t expect anything outrageous like “Blazing Saddles” (1974). This is more in the mode of contemporaneous Westerns like “Bandoleros” (1968), “The War Wagon” (1967) and “The Undefeated” (1969). It’s not as great as the first or as good as the second, but it’s about on par with the latter.  

The film runs 1 hour and 42 minutes and was shot in Arizona (Quartzsite, Parker & Harquahala Mountains) and Mexico (Barranca del Cobre, Chihuahua, Durango & Sierra de Organos).

After the monstrosity that was Shrek the Turd, the Dreamworks team behind the Shrek franchise woke up and realised what made the series so popular in the first place. Shrek Forever After is not a particularly great film, but it finds some firm footings to appease the adults and children alike.

Thematically it's as safe as houses, it pitches Shrek into a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" scenario, where the big green ogre gets to spend a day away from the life he didn't realise he was happy with in the first place. Making a deal with the nefarious Rumpelstiltskin, Shrek finds a world of darkness for ogres, a world ruled by a psychotic who has an army of flying Margaret Hamilton's to do his bidding. Worse than that, Fiona doesn't know him, she's the leader of the resistance and has no time for some big green ogre love. Donkey is all mangy and Puss in Boots literally has become a fat cat, it's a horrible life, man!

The action and graphics whizz past the eyes in what is a perfectly pitched time frame of 90 minutes. It never reaches the heights of the first two movies, but it doesn't strain for laughs or narrative cheek (Pied Piper as a bounty hunter? Genius), or more crucially, it's never dull, something part 3 can't safely claim to not be. It bows out with head held high, not so much in a blaze of glory, but with a dignified recognition of the fact it's time to retire to the swamp and chill out. Take it easy Shrek and the gang. 7/10 || Didn't really want to watch this. I mean, 4th movie??? Please stop already. But then it's hot and we have nothing else to do so ok. Shrek it is.

Meh. Can't say that I entirely buy into Adrian Brody as an action hero lead, either. Arguably the worst leading tough-guy since Danny Glover in, um, Predator 2.

Something else bugged me about it, too. It's a petty quibble, but it irked me nonetheless:

SPOILERS AHEAD:

Did you ever see the trailer for Predators? At the 1.23 mark is IMO the most effective shot in the trailer: Brody's character has one of those iconic triangulated laser sights (from the predators' shoulder-mounted guns) pointed at him. It moves up his body to his head. As it does, many more sights appear, all over him. More than a dozen. He has about fifteen predators all training their guns on him. How's he going to get out of that? He's fooked. Well, no, he's not, because that scene DOESN'T HAPPEN in the film. The first laser sight happens, yes, from the ONE predator of three (?) that are chasing them, but fifteen? No. All those other sights are added in just for the trailer, to make the film look more Predator-filled than it is.

As I said, a rather petty quibble, but it's one thing to edit the best bits of a movie together into a trailer to make it look more exiting than it maybe is over the course of two hours, and quite another to lie about what one can expect to see in said movie. || They can hear you. Smell you. They see you. 

Predators is directed by Nimród Antal and stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne, Oleg Taktarov & Danny Trejo. It's co-produced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez, John Davis & Elizabeth Avellan, with writing credits going to Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and Jim & John Thomas. It's shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography, while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestri's score from the 1987 film Predator. 

The plot sees eight former members of Earth - mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and a doctor, who are literally dropped into a jungle on an alien planet. Why or how they got there is not known, but pretty soon it is apparent they must work together for they are being hunted by an unseen enemy. Hunted, it seems, for sport. 

In 1987 John McTierrnan gave the movie world Predator, a ballsy Vietnam allegory that pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other considerably sized beefcakes against one bad ass mandible wearing alien hunter. Since then the franchise has steadily got worse (though the Danny Glover led sequel is far from a disaster), reaching a crushingly bad nadir with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007. Enter Robert Rodriguez who in the mid 90s had done a treatment for a Predator sequel - with Schwarzenegger in mind to return. However, it didn't happen and it's only now, with the franchise at rock bottom, that his script has been reworked and funded to give us Predators, the sequel to McTiernan's 87 ball buster. 

The set up is a little different but in truth the formula is exactly the same as the original movie. Macho guys and a girl in the jungle are being hunted by something very bad. Alpha male, though, is not going to take it lying down, cue deaths, explosions and much macho posturing. Here in is the main problem with Antal' s movie, it's ticking the same boxes whilst homaging for all it's worth, which is fine since it's hugely entertaining in that Saturday night popcorn way. But there's little to no braveness in the writing. Sure there's some bonuses in the form of alien pets, a predator feud arc and a bonkers midsection with the introduction of another character. Yet as the carnage unfolds, the plot doesn't go anywhere other than where we expect it to go, while there's a huge character misstep in the final third that is more laughable than being the twister it's obviously meant to be. 

However, if taken purely as a piece of salted popcorn, the film delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant the viewing because the action comes thick and fast. From the breathtaking opening as we are literally dropped into the jungle with Adrien Brody, to the inevitable face off for the finale, we have been treated to stabs, chops, thrusts, dismemberment's, beheadings and everyones personal fave - spine ripping! All this and there's barely any blood spilt, lest the green kind counts of course? While the new look predators are awesome, more meaner in tone, with new armour and devoid of the pointless characterisation that others in the franchise have tried to give them, these are unremitting killers, lets leave them like that please! And while it lacks the dark humour of McTiernan's movie, it does have a wry sense of knowing, normally with the portrayal of Royce by Brody. 

Brody is just fine, it's a performance that shows that should he ever want to make the easy money available in action/adventure type movies? Then he will have no problem getting work. He's buffed up, given himself a gruffer voice and more than shows a capable hand at punching, firing and sticking the tongue firmly in cheek. The others, unsurprisingly, are walking clichés, with some obviously only there to be deathly slotted more quickly than the others. The fun here is in waiting to see who gets it first/next and etc. It has to be said, though, that Topher Grace is not only annoying, he's also very miscast, but in fairness he's not exactly helped by the writing of his character either. 

Not great but hugely enjoyable popcorn fodder. A sequel would be welcome, but with Rodriguez directing and a new face on the writing panel. 7/10"

RELEASED IN 2009 and written & directed by Tom DiCillo, ""The Doors: When You're Strange"" documents the rise and fall of The Doors from 1966-1971, narrated by Johnny Depp. From beginning to end, archival footage and photos of the band are featured focusing on the members: Ray Manzarek (keyboardist), Robby Krieger (guitarist), John Densmore (percussionist) and, especially (of course), Jim Morrison (singer/lyricist).    

I’ve only seen two documentaries on The Doors, the one featured on Oliver Stone’s “The Doors” (1991) DVD, which features modern interviews with the band members & linking people (like Morrison’s witchy former babe, who loathed the movie), and this one. Both documentaries are great, but “The Doors: When You’re Strange” doesn’t focus on modern interviews, although some of the luminaries are asked questions in the archival footage.

The documentary is just transfixing from beginning to end and features 37 songs by the iconic band. Depp is, surprisingly, an excellent narrator and not goofy at all. Even if you’re familiar with the band you’ll probably gain some new tidbits. For instance, the band curiously never had a bass player, although Elvis’ bass player performed on their last album; as such, keyboardist Manzarek made up for it by essentially playing bass on one hand. Manzarek, by the way, passed away in May, 2013, at the age of 74.

Despicable Me completely took me by surprise! Steve Carrell leads this heartwarmingly delightful, funny film with a fresh premise different from other kid's movies, hilariously lovable characters, and superb execution. Being one of my three-year-old's favorites, I have seen this movie 100 times, and it doesn't get old. Cartel's voice acting is as entertaining as possible, and the Minions are just a masterstroke of brilliance that my daughter exclaims, ""it's so cute!"" every time they're on the TV. But this animated heist film becomes much more as three orphaned girls warm the heart of criminal mastermind Gru as he grows from an evil loner to a caring father. Despicable Me was as touching as hilarious, and its creativity and fantastic characters make it my absolute favorite animated film of all time."

Of course having Leonardo in the lead role helped a lot. 


From the trailer, I already know some things. Dreams. All about dreams. But what about dreams? Who are the other people? At first, I didn't really understand what was going on. It was all very confusing to me. But as the movie progresses, I start to understand it and I wanted to watch some more and know more what will happen in the end. The ending. That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.


My rate for this movie is A. || Whether you watch Inception as a heist movie, a redemption story, or a sci-fi action picture, Christopher Nolan's tour de force of dreams will absolutely work its magic over you. The fact that the film works on so many levels (literally) is an attest not only to the visual queues that make it easy for the audience to follow but to how much in control of all the intricacies its filmmaker had to be. || Is there anyone on earth who doesn't like Christopher Nolan’s films? Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.

The film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.

There are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.

The only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.

A curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi."

Not very surprising of course since those self-proclaimed besserwissers always moan about films made just to entertain.

I found the film well worth the time and money spent. Of course the plot was not very intriguing but is there anyone who would really expect that from a film like this? It’s clearly aimed at younger people and people with a liking for magic and old-fashioned adventure. The effects where really nice and I certainly liked the old-fashioned magic theme. The fact that the lead actor was Nicolas Cage of course helps a lot as well. || Good enough, if nothing standout.

<em>'The Sorcerer’s Apprentice'</em> is an interesting film. The premise isn't anything revolutionary, it follows the same beats that a load of these sorta films do; I recall <em>'Bulletproof Monk'</em> and <em>'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief'</em> having similar-ish set-ups.

That's not to say it isn't enjoyable, as I did like it. Nicolas Cage always manages to entertain one way or another, while Jay Baruchel works well for the comedic stuff in particular. Alfred Molina makes another live-action Disney appearance, following on from <em>'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'</em> two months prior. He's solid, but better in the latter.

The special effects are excellent, I really enjoyed seeing it all come to life onscreen. The score is decent, though the pacing could've been finer. Overall, it's a film I just about feel satisfied with. Worth a watch? Sure. || Aside from an entertaining scene with some of Lukas' wonderful ""L'Apprenti Sorcier"" and some overly enthusiastic mops, this is a really poor adaptation of this Arthurian legend. In days of old, ""Merlin"" manages to imprison ""Morgana"" (Alice Krige) inside a sort of Russian doll. It falls to ""Balthazar"" (Nicolas Cage) to keep it safe over the millennia until the successor to the sagely old wizard emerges. Well it does, in the unlikely guise of the rather geeky ""Dave"" (Jay Baruchel) and so it falls to the former to train the hapless latter in the arts of sorcery. Meanwhile, the nasty ""Horvath"" (Alfred Molina) is bent on releasing the witch from her captivity, and aided by a Billy Idol style rocker ""Drake Stone"" (Toby Kebbell) is hot on their trail. To be fair, the intention is good - there is plenty of quickly-paced action, the visual effects are adequate and it really looks ok. The acting, though, is pretty terrible. There isn't the slightest hint of a spark between Cage and his young protege; Molina as the suave and ruthless ""Horvath"" falls fairly flat and the rest of the cast really just serve to clutter this up. Apart, that is, from Kebbell who is having a little fun. The dialogue is unremarkable, and at ten minutes shy of two hours, this is also just way too long. Pity. It has the resources to be good - just let down by the imagination of Messrs Cage and Turteltaub."

About the mixing of Spanish stereotypes and festivities in Seville ... no comments :( || **Knight and Day is a forgettable but still entertaining Tom Cruise spy action comedy.**

Knight and Day has all the elements of a Tom Cruise action movie: motorcycle chases, quippy one-liners, frequent explosions, and lots of running. It’s a fun formula that I have watched many times. Knight and Day provides all that, along with exceptional director James Mangold and incredible talent with Cameron Diaz, Viola Davis, and Paul Dano, but sadly underwhelms a little. Don’t get me wrong. It’s not a bad movie, but the CGI and green screen throughout the film were distractingly obvious, and much of the dialogue and plot twists oozed with cheese and cliche. But you can’t keep that Tim Cruise charisma from taking a mediocre film and charming it up a little more with all kinds of stunts, jumping, running, and smirks. || This is one of those subtle movies people just don't seem to get. Your average Joe just expects an action flick, so that's all Joe watches it for. WRONG! Well, right, yes it's got lots of action but if that's all you expect from it then you're missing the brilliance of all the nuances Tom brings to this character. There are so many subtle moments throughout this adventure I couldn't begin to count. Just a couple of the main ones are, Roy is a spy who doesn't lie, he also has the morality of an untainted youngster. You need to watch this movie without action-tinted glasses."

The comedic parts and the dramatic parts are just right. The action is okay. There weren't much especially from Jaden. He just got some action in the end. But then it's enough for the film considering kids will be watching this movie.


Jaden Smith is amazing in this movie. I kept on saying that Will and Jada Pinkett made a good investment in their son. Just like his parents, he's a great actor. He's good in both drama and comedy. He did well in this movie. There were even ""kilig"" moments with him. I just love him. 


Jackie Chan is of course amazing as well. His character was an older man but that didn't stop him from having a fight scene of his own. We all know he has great comedic timing but I was really impressed when he did his dramatic acting in this movie. It's a different Jackie Chan. And that's what makes him great. He has always something to surprise his audience with.


Jaden's nemesis is also great. He's scary. But I like the pictures of behind the scenes in the end because it showed that he's not that scary after all. He looks like a nice guy who's friends with Jaden.

39781.0,The Kids Are All Right,"Two women, Nic and Jules, brought a son and daughter into the world through artificial insemination. When one of their children reaches age, both kids go behind their mothers' backs to meet with the donor. Life becomes so much more interesting when the father, two mothers and children start to become attached to each other.","Nic and Jules had the perfect family, until they met the man who made it all possible.","Comedy, Drama",106.0,2010-07-09,en,6.613,1521.0,0.9883,"Julianne Moore, Annette Bening, Mark Ruffalo, Mia Wasikowska, Josh Hutcherson","Lisa Cholodenko, Stuart Blumberg, Lisa Cholodenko","lesbian relationship, dinner, motorcycle, argument, artificial insemination, control freak, vegetable garden, woman director","**A “gay friendly” film that manages to be minimally neutral to also please those who are out of political and ideological struggles.**

The troubled causes have never been so popular as they are today: from abortion to euthanasia, from the historical question between colonizing and colonized countries to the return of looted artworks by European museums, passing through the causes of the Gay Movement, whose acronym grows every year, to embrace any new definition invented for each way of feeling and living sexuality, reflecting a need for affirmation that is felt more strongly than the convenience of presenting a certain union in the ranks. This “gay friendly” film fits perfectly into a growing list of cinema works dedicated to scrutinizing the dynamics of these new families. The advantage of this film is that it is not overly militant.

The script introduces us to two mature women, who live in a stable lesbian relationship and who decided to get pregnant, by artificial insemination (obviously the more traditional method was discarded for obvious reasons), the semen donor was the same and the children who were born are, therefore, half-siblings on the part of the father (whom they do not know). It is precisely the search for her biological father and the creation of a closer relationship with him that takes the plot forward, with the introduction of this friendly and uncomplicated man totally destabilizing the life of that house.

I liked the movie in general. At the same time that it tries to deny that idea, much replicated, that two lesbians would instill their own sexual orientation in their children, the film seeks to create a question around the inviolability of the anonymity of the donors of seminal material… I cannot speak for everyone, but I would never donate semen if I suspected that, years later, someone might have knocked on my door and said he was my son. Anonymity is something that should be inviolable and sacred here, regardless of the will of those involved. It was the point in the script that bothered me the most, but there were a few more.

For me, the strongest point of the film ends up being the cast and its very good performance, strongly supported by a duo of veterans: Julianne Moore and Annette Bening. Both are amazing in their characters, and they establish an excellent working dynamic and good chemistry. Mia Wasilowska and Josh Hutcherson, both still quite young, are a nice and refreshing addition to the cast, both of whom seem to be really enjoying what they're doing. Besides, we all know them nowadays, because they are two young stars. Although it's not that interesting, I have to admit that I liked Mark Ruffalo's work. I think his character was poorly thought out, and poorly written, but the actor manages himself very well and knows how to get around the obstacles that appear.

It's not a technically remarkable film, it's notable that it didn't have a superb budget, and that it was a job done thanks, in part, to the extreme dedication of everyone involved. It doesn't have amazing cinematography and editing, but what it's done works well and is effective. The film has a pleasant, light pace, and a humorous and uncomplicated atmosphere."

Leading Batman to relive some old and hurtful memories of one of the darkest periods in his career, the question is who is under the Red Hood....and is he friend or foe? 

The story as a whole is very compelling with a much darker tone than most other animated features, it shows a level of brutality from the beginning with life and death playing a major role in the story. We also get some flash backs, a small but interesting glimpse into Batman and the Jokers first ever meet, to the early days of Batman and Jason Todd, showing the relationship until the young Robins death. There are  good action scenes as well as some dark humor, the animation is great, with a feel similar to the Animated Series but different enough to stand on its own.

Many actors have played the character of Batman on tv and film, and at least to me, it is easier to adjust and accept the different portrayals of the characters involved when we see them in live action.
When it comes to animated versions of these characters it seems hard not to compare the casting to the amazing voice acting in Batman: The Animated Series. Although it may take a while to get over the initial change you come to hear some great acting from all the cast here. John DiMaggio gets top marks here for his version of the Joker, much darker and with slightly more menace than his Animated series counterpart, he presents a Joker to be afraid of who early on shows a level of brutality not regularly seen in the cartoon version of the character.
Bruce Greenwood gives a good performance as Batman but i couldn't help but feel he was imitating Kevin Conroy, rather than making the character his own.
Jensen Ackles is great as the Red Hood giving the character energy and emotion, which helps you sympathize and understand why he is the way he is.
Neil Patrick Harris gives a great performance as Nightwing just a shame he wasn't present in the second half of the film but memorable none the less. All other voice acting was top notch coming together to create a dark and gloomy Gotham.  

This is a great animated Batman feature and i strongly suggest that all Batman fans should check it out, its darker and more violent than some other Batman animations but this shouldn't put you off it all plays a part in the story and an interesting story it is. From start to finish the story will grab you, plenty of action and some great voice acting makes this one of the best Batman movies around.

It is an action thriller, not a documentary - so don't expect Pulitzer standard writing nor for it to be especially plausible or to make much sense; it's just a good old take-over-the-world adventure movie with decent performances all round. || Salt is a fast-paced action thriller that hooks you right from the start and keeps the adrenaline pumping throughout. Angelina Jolie’s performance is the movie’s backbone, and she carries her role with a perfect mix of intensity and depth. The first act is particularly well-executed, setting the stage with solid pacing and smooth transitions that pull you into the story without feeling rushed. It’s a film that thrives on its direction and character buildup, leaving you intrigued by the mystery surrounding Evelyn Salt.

The action sequences are sharp and well-choreographed, with a sense of purpose that adds to the narrative rather than just filling space. However, the story, while engaging, has a predictable layer for anyone paying close attention to the details sprinkled throughout. It doesn’t take away from the excitement entirely, but it does dampen some of the suspense if you’re quick to pick up on the “tells.” That said, the film’s overall presentation, from its tight pacing to its polished visuals, makes it an enjoyable watch.

What stands out less favorably is the lack of closure in the final act. While the ending teases the possibility of more to come, it feels incomplete and leaves you wanting a resolution that never fully arrives. A sequel would have justified this approach, but leaving things open-ended without that guarantee feels like a missed opportunity. Still, Salt delivers solid entertainment, and Jolie’s commanding presence makes it worth the ride, even if the destination doesn’t fully satisfy."

Toby Regbo bears quite a striking resemblance to Leto which helps his engaging representation of the fifteen year old ""Nemo"" and, indeed, all of the children who take on the junior years of the key roles deliver well, here. It is not a straightforward story, some of it made sense to me, some of it suggested that auteur Jaco Van Dormael had been sitting too close to the glue pot, but there is an effective intensity to the performance from Leto (and his wonderfully expressive eyes) as we embark on this roller-coaster ride. I did not love the conclusion - but don't know that I could have improved upon it either - you ought to give it a try and see what you think.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is unlike anything you have ever seen.

Babes, bikinis, boobs, bums, blood, bazulco and bad acting.

Run from a budget of $24M the film has almost no actors of note in lead roles. Although there is a cameo from Eli Roth (_Inglourious Basterds_), which is always cool.

What we have here, is a virtually flawless example of stupid fun. There's no point in trying to evaluate a film like _Piranha 3D_ on factors like good taste, because it goes out of its way to smash these conventions apart. The film has this crazy energy about it from beginning to end.

It also however, is the perfect example of why 3D is so fucking unnecessary. And though I appreciate how forward the film is, that doesn't make it strictly speaking good. It's part creature-feature, part horror-comedy, but it doesn't stand up in a thrill sense to actual monster movies like _Anaconda_ or _King Kong_, and it doesn't stand up in a humour sense to actual horror comedy like _Shaun of the Dead_ or _Dead Snow_, but it sort of takes off on its own in a passable manner. Though it's kiiinda humorous, the film is mostly just ""fun"", as opposed to ""funny"".

The script seems cobbled together with a couple of different half assed plot points, but several half ass plots taped together is better than just one half assed plot trying to hold its own and ending up looking like no plot at all. Exploitation has never really been A-grade material, and even though the ""suspension of disbelief"" thing that films are supposed to have as a general rule, is sort of... not here, _Piranha 3D_ still manages to somehow get this piece of crap off the ground.

I watched it at about 2am with a male friend of mine who has very similar taste and sense of humour to me, and that's pretty much got to be the best possible setting to watch it in. The CG gore is ridiculous, the 3D focus is ridiculous, the film itself is just fucking ridiculous. But brainless is great sometimes, just don't make a habit of thinking that you can get away with bad exploitation, and calling it Black Comedy, once or twice is fine, but soon it just looks like you're aiming for cult, and getting lazy.

-Gimly || This is the 2010 remake of the old classic. The original is pretty much crap so I bought this one solely based on the fact that it has been getting unusually good reviews from both critics as well as viewers.

I have to say that I am at loss as to why. There are loads of much better films in the action/horror/fantasy genre’s that, at least the so called “critics” totally hammer. Why the hell this trash got so good scores is beyond me.

The female acting consists of showing off your boobs then get eaten. The male acting consists of being an asshole, get your dick eaten, then get the rest eaten. The main “event” is a contrived scene when the main asshole get his dick bitten off and the piranhas eat it and spit it out again under water. I’m sure the 3D effects made it even more ridiculous than in 2d. I usually have rather high tolerance for poor acting and bad scripts when it comes to otherwise effects and gore loaded films but most of this film I was just thinking, “what the f... is this shit!”.

Most of the film was just scenes stashed on top of each other designed to show of 3D effects with boobs and various ways a human could get eaten. This is a typical example of why 3D is bad for the movie industry. || Piranha hunt in packs - not for protection, but for overwhelming force.

Actually many of today's younger multiplex goers hunt in packs, they know what they like and they know how to have a good time with even the most crude or banal movie. I don't mean that as an insult, it's just indicative of the film market available to them, it's the reason why films like this here Piranha remake/re-imaging/re-jig exists and makes money. Even ""spawning"" a franchise on occasions.

Alexandre Aja's Piranha 3D is a complete machine gun of a movie, it knew exactly how to sell tickets at the box office. Even before the 3D was used as a selling point, the word down the grapevine was the promise of lithe bodies in beach wear and loads of CGI killer fish shredding the hell out of a whole community. And that's exactly what is delivered, only with extras that see considerable nudity in the mammary areas and Elisabeth Shue and Ving Rhames kicking buttocks.

It's all very bloody, even lurid and exploitive, while it's difficult to know if you are meant to laugh, scream or do something that Russ Meyer would endorse? But, and I say this as a middle aged old fart, there is so much fun to be had here if you are prepared to unscrew your head and take out your brain. Strap yourselves in Piranha 3D haters, your grandchildren might just be enjoying in the future: Piranha 27: Sexy Mechanoid Bimbos Fight Back. But will they hate themselves in the morning? 7/10"

Here we go with the fourth review of a David Fincher's film this week, in preparation for the upcoming Mank, directed by the same person who delivered phenomenal movies like Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, and more. Now, it's time for The Social Network, which premise can be summed up in ""the story behind the creation of Facebook"". Ten years have passed since its release, and the real Mark Zuckerberg already stated that most of the film is based on fictional events and conversations. Truth is, this movie was never marketed as a true story, but yes as an adaptation of Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires. It's a film like any other, not a detailed account of whatever happened in real life.

With that said, this is easily one of the best adapted screenplays of all-time. Aaron Sorkin, the man behind one of the best movies of 2020 (The Trial of the Chicago 7), demonstrates his incredibly talented writing skills in The Social Network, proving that he's one of the most meticulous writers working today. If you've been reading my previous reviews, there's a couple of compliments I keep giving to Fincher, which are his extreme attention to detail and his impressive dedication to the narrative he wants to tell. So, what happens when you put together two of the most perfectionist filmmakers ever? An award-worthy, ""best of the year"" contender arises from their gifted minds.

There's not even much to discuss besides the narrative itself since this is, by far, the aspect that elevates the whole film. Jeff Cronenweth, who previously worked in Fight Club, brings out Fincher's trademark realistic look and feel through his simple yet powerful cinematography. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' original score is packed with little effects that resemble computer sounds, making it quite addictive while also increasing the movie's energy in the most exciting sequences. Finally, just like in Zodiac, the editing work (Angus Wall, Kirk Baxter) is absolutely seamless, and it's definitely the technical component that better helps Sorkin's screenplay shine due to the latter's structure.

Throughout the entire runtime, the story is told through a nonlinear timeline, mixing up Facebook's actual creation (ideas, planning, programming) with the future legal issues that Mark Zuckerberg faces. This structure allows for an exceptionally captivating and tremendously entertaining couple of hours by never letting the pacing slow down or to have an uneventful sequence. The protagonist is accused of stealing the concept from the Winklevoss twins (both interpreted by Armie Hammer), gets in trouble with his best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), over the website's monetization, and Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) is partially the trigger for a lot of the chaos that ends up overwhelming Zuckerberg's life.

Sorkin and Fincher's greatest accomplishment is their success in making the viewer feel invested in a main character who's an utter ""asshole"", an adjective with a lot of weight in the film. Jesse Eisenberg is remarkable as one of those characters people ""love to hate"" (no wonder the real Zuckerberg didn't enjoy the movie since he's depicted as a contemptible friend). Eisenberg has a unique manner of speaking and distinctive mannerisms that are perfect for this character. Garfield and Timberlake are also formidable, incorporating their characters effortlessly. Once again, comparing with Zodiac, The Social Network is also a dialogue-driven narrative, but the latter resonated with me a bit more due to my area of work.

The only issue I have involves the Winklevoss family. Armie Hammer is excellent as both twins, as is Max Minghella as Divya Narendra, but their subplot occasionally drifts from the main story, losing my interest for those short moments. There's even a rowboat race that feels out-of-place and unnecessary, but I admit that it's gorgeously shot and accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack. Despite this little misstep, Fincher continues to impress me with his outstanding directing techniques, forcing the actors to prove their worth by making them go through their dialogues faster and implementing long takes every time that's possible.

All in all, The Social Network is yet another masterful piece of cinema, this time delivered by not one but two magnificent filmmakers. David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin employ their mutual perfectionism and meticulousness to create an extraordinarily engaging narrative. Boasting a nonlinear but tremendously effective structure, the two pillars of any film - story and characters - are wonderfully built, even reaching the point of making the viewer feel invested in a despicable yet fascinating protagonist. Jesse Eisenberg shines in a career-defining performance, but Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also rise to the necessary level of dedication, dealing with the rapid-fire dialogues and outstanding long takes seamlessly. Technically, great camera work offers a realistic feel, an addictive score increases the excitement levels, and flawless editing makes the different timelines shift seamlessly. Despite an occasionally unnecessary, irrelevant detour concerning a minor subplot, this is another brilliant addition to Fincher's filmography.

Rating: A || Full review: <a>https://www.tinakakadelis.com/beyond-the-cinerama-dome/2021/12/28/no-new-friends-the-social-network-review<a>

Perhaps no other website has altered the course of the 21st century like Facebook. Its launch in 2004 forever changed the way society talks about social media and connects with friends and strangers, and became the lightning rod of a multitude of controversies. Conspiracy theories, political propaganda, and mass surveillance became the norm. All of it a far cry from the basic “hot or not” site Facebook sprang from.

_The Social Network_ takes the audience back to that fateful night at Harvard when a primitive version of Facebook was born in the dorm room of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). Director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin are a dream team in this film. Sorkin’s signature quick dialogue is a perfect match for the pace of this movie. It gives Zuckerberg a smarminess that is easy for the audience to rally against, as though creating a website that objectifies women simply because his girlfriend dumped him isn’t enough to cause immediate dislike."

No new plot but well performed and entertaining. || You know people get up everyday, tell themselves something's gonna change their lives.

The Town is Charlestown, Boston, a place where crime is a way of life. Following a bank robbery, professional thief Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) has to keep a watch on bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) because after using her as hostage leverage during escape from the heist, she is the only witness who could possibly identify his gang. But once the two meet they start to fall for each other, forcing MacRay to re-evaluate his life in Charlestown. It's a re-evaluation that will upset a lot of people close to him and the gangster boss who hires him, and all this at a time when FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the gang.

One of the most startling things about Ben Affleck's second film as director is that even with the conventional plot, and the formulaic characters, it's still an exhilarating and fresh picture. With Affleck comfortable in his Boston surroundings, it's evident that he and the team went for authenticity, something which in the main they achieve. Sure there's the odd implausible moments, they are - like it or not - cops and robbers staples, but ""The Town"" is not your standard run of the mill actioner. It is, for want of pigeon holing, a modern day noir, resplendent with bleak mood and well oiled characters. Based on Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"", pic follows the formula of a rotten town with rotten people doing their best or worst to live and get by. Into the pot comes the bad guy who meets a good woman who wants to leave his crappy life and crappy home behind. So far so well trodden path, then, but this is not a giant gangland operation, like, say, ""The Departed"" or ""The Godfather"" et al, this is a small neighbourhood setting, with a small group of everyday dressed young men. It's one of the reasons why Affleck's film feels so very authentic.

Helping to exude the naturalistic and human feel of the drama is that Affleck doesn't overdo his action sections, yet they are terrific sections for sure. This is not Tony Scott/Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer action for popcorn excess. From the electric kick-start of the first heist, to the mid-section car chase - and to the knock out coup de grâce set in motion at Red Sox Stadium - Affleck shows great skill as a crafter of action - aided superbly by Dylan Tichenor's energised editing. Other violence is swift and to the point, the director knowing not to dwell too long on vicious passages in the narrative, thus keeping his characters free of caricatures. Mind, he is thankful to the great cast assembled for his picture, for this is very much an actors piece. Well written without flabby periods of talk for talk sake, The Town provides proper drama for proper actors - and that includes the director himself.

Jeremy Renner is quickly turning into the go to guy for edginess, here as MacRay's best pal, Jem, he deals out a frightening loose cannon turn. Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite have small roles, but both impact hard on proceedings, both memorable and both adding a touch of classy know how. Hamm arguably has the hardest role, for as FBI Agent Frawley he has to carry on his own the other plot thread that is the investigation. Not just that, but the film lends itself to one which dares you to root for the bad guys, it's a tough ask of the ""Mad Men"" actor but he nails it, with one two-fold scene in a bar, as he grills MacRay's ex, Krista (Blake Lively heartfelt and believable), particularly offering a glimpse of what a good actor he can be. Ultimately the main load has to be carried by Affleck and Hall as the central doomed lovers. There is death and misery every where in Charlestown - and for the protagonists of the story, including Doug & Claire. Their relationship offers hope, a beacon of hope in a murky world, but it's a relationship founded on black secrets and built around falsehoods. That Affleck & Hall draw us in with charm and acting gravitas further serves notice as to why The Town is top draw stuff.

Hardships, hard decisions and hard characters come alive in The Town, a great modern day drama that's showing ""Gone Baby Gone"" was no fluke, this lad Affleck really is some director. 9/10 || **Affleck does an excellent job, where Jeremy Renner particularly stands out.**

I really enjoyed this film, where action, drama and romance are mixed in a well-balanced and intelligent way. The script is set in Boston, and takes us to meet a group of professional bank robbers, some of them with criminality in their blood and with incarcerated parents. The group makes an ostentatious robbery in which they force the manager to open the safe, and to go with them in the escape, as a human shield. Later, fearing that she might recognize them, one of the robbers decides to keep an eye on her, but ends up approaching her and starting a more personal relationship, which could threaten the group's illegal activities.

The screenplay is very well written and is intelligent in the way it presents itself and develops. It is not an original film, it brings elements and themes that have been repeated in cinema several times, and in much better films. Other than that, the film isn't particularly memorable or very impressive. Therefore, we cannot expect a brilliant work, but a good piece of cinema, which entertains us satisfactorily while it lasts.

Ben Affleck takes on the direction as well as the lead role, and he proved to be very confident and capable in both tasks. A recognized actor, he shines in the role of the heartthrob, and makes good use of his personal charisma. Jeremy Renner, however, shines in a very special way, managing to leave us here one of the most complete and powerful works of his career as an actor (not as impressive as “Hurt Locker”, but truly impressive). Rebecca Hall does an equally positive job, she is very beautiful and attractive, but she gives us a character full of content, personality and charisma. John Hamm, Chris Cooper and Blake Lively also don't let themselves be left behind and punctuate their work with high quality notes.

Technically, the film deserves a positive mention for the quality of the visual, special and sound effects, especially with regard to the action scenes. The film has plenty of action for moviegoers, though it's not gory, and the chases and robberies are truly lavish and Hollywood-worthy. The film makes good use of filming locations and sets, and the cinematography is elegant, well-executed, and enhanced by a good job of editing. Unfortunately, everything else, including the soundtrack, is relatively average."

Sometimes funny, but not too much. The cast is good and I like Emma Stone a lot, but she cannot pass as a high school student any more.

It could have been much better if the story would have worked better, in spite of the sometimes brilliant dialogues. || When I first saw the trailer of Easy A, I wasn't particularly intrigued. It looked like just another high school teenage comedy. But then I decided to watch it anyway (mostly because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about), and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise! Coincidentally, I had just seen Emma Stone for the first time two days ago, when I watched Zombieland, and I thought to myself, ""Hey this girl seems kind of cool"". But that still wasn't an answer as to why right now I can't read a single magazine without seeing her face somewhere. After seeing Easy A, I finally know. This girl is FUN. She has a great talent for comedy of the driest, most sarcastic kind and a perfect sense of timing. And you've got to love that husky voice.

Easy A is about a girl, Olive, who's a straight A-student with a flawless reputation, until she tells a little white lie to her best friend about how she supposedly lost her virginity to a guy that doesn't even exist. However, things go awry when this little anecdote spreads like wildfire and all of a sudden she has a reputation of being a hussy. (This plot line demands some suspension of disbelief, because it's obviously very hard to believe that any group of high school students would be shocked at the thought of one of their peers _*having sex*_, but whatever.) Of course, like with any rumour, it changes constantly depending on who you talk to. So before Olive knows what hit her, everybody in school thinks she slept with every guy around. Now here's the twist: once it becomes clear that she can use this newfound reputation to her advantage, she does so to the fullest. Simply put: unpopular guys pay her to PRETEND she had sex with them. Obviously, at some point things get out of hand and she has to find a way to fix it all again.

This concept could have been really stupid, if it wasn't for the great screenplay. It is a tribute to classic 80's teenage films including, of course, John Hughes, and it also features some great references to The Scarlet Letter and Sylvia Plath. The dialogue is quick and witty, and the characters are all really typical people without being cliché stereotypes. Stanley Tucci is a delight as Olive's dad, bringing the same kind of dry-as-a-bone humour to the table as his on-screen daughter. Patricia Clarkson is a wonderful actress, and as it turns out, a really funny one as well. All the actors are perfectly cast.

One of the funniest elements in Easy A is a group of Christian students, the 'Jesus freaks'. The leader of this little group is a girl called Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes. She just can't stop preaching to Olive about her 'indecent behaviour' and the dialogue between the two provides some of the funniest moments throughout the film. Here's a small foretaste; Marianne: ""There's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency."" Olive: ""Tom Cruise?"" 

Overall, this is mostly a 'chuckle' comedy rather than a 'rolling over the floor laughing' comedy, though it has some really good LOL moments. And the 'chuckles' are widespread.

I would definitely recommend watching Easy A if you're in the mood for a witty, intelligent comedy about a smart, sassy girl who takes control of her own life and everybody who thinks they have a right to think badly about her.

The cast is quite good, but not much more to say ... || Yes, but why...? Why make a sequel? It was never going to be as good, as cutting edge and raw as the first film. Is it just to prove that in the intervening 20-odd years nothing has really changed? The world is just as venal and full of greedy gits? Anyway, the newly released ""Gekko"" (Michael Douglas) takes the young ""Jake"" (Shia LaBeouf) - who is dating his estranged daughter ""Winnie"" (Carey Mulligan) under his wing. Ostensibly on the straight and narrow now, but soon we sense - and see - that this young man is every bit as gullible and easily led as ""Gekko"" sets about rebuilding something of his multi-million dollar empire. To be fair to LaBeouf, his portrayal of the young man trying to balance the needs of his relationship with his ambitions is actually quite reasonable, but sadly both Douglas and the writing have lost much of their potency and the on/off familial stuff just drags the already quite weak pace down all too often. I actually found the ending quite fitting - but for the most part this is a very, very, poor cousin of a much better story that I feel probably cinema could have done without. || <em>'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'</em> falls short of its predecessor, even though it is still satisfactory. It does have issues, for example it overruns and has some ill-fitting editing. The original had top (+ better) performances but wasn't fully reliant on the cast, this is more so.

It's cool to see Michael Douglas reprise his role, the same can be for that rather fan service-y moment in the middle of the film. Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin and Carey Mulligan are positive new faces and give enough, even if I've seen greater from each one of them in other productions.

This 2010 sequel isn't as much about Wall Street as the first flick, which I think is a mistake. Of course there is plenty in there about it, but to me it felt much more about Gekko and his personal life - which isn't quite as interesting to watch unfold across 120+ minutes."

However, this computer-generated visual effect of this trembling or convulsion has been removed from the film's scenes and cannot be found within the movie. Therefore, one star out of ten will be deducted.

**2.** Actor Richard Jenkins, who plays the character believed to be Abby's father or guardian, pours a corrosive substance on his face to conceal his identity from the police for an unclear reason. If he wanted to die rather than be imprisoned, he could have simply shot himself. If he wanted to both conceal his identity and die so that the police couldn't identify him after death, he could have detonated a hand grenade on himself instead of pouring a corrosive substance on his face, as it would erase his features without notable suffering. I don't believe he wanted to hide his identity and live disfigured for the rest of his life, as imprisonment without disfigurement compared to the torture of disfigurement by a corrosive substance would be a better option. Therefore, he had two better alternatives than suffering disfigurement by a corrosive substance until death: the first option being imprisonment without disfigurement if he was willing to have his identity revealed, or the second option of detonating a hand grenade on himself if he was unwilling to have his identity revealed. Nevertheless, he chose the worst, illogical, unrealistic option which the film failed to justify. Why to such an extent did he not want his identity discovered? If that would endanger Abby, then why didn't the film clarify that? Even if we assume the film did clarify that, the hand grenade option would still be better for concealing identity and dying together. Don't tell me he didn't want to die when he used the corrosive substance or that he didn't know it would torture him to death. He undoubtedly knew. So why die in agony when he could die without notable suffering? Nothing can explain this except that he wanted to punish himself for his sins of killing many innocent people. But since the film didn't clarify this, I cannot rely on this justification nor can it be considered valid. He should have said something before pouring the corrosive substance, such as ""Let this be atonement for my sins,"" for this justification to be valid and for me to accept it. Since that didn't happen, another star out of ten will be deducted.

**3.** When Owen sneaked out to Abby's house, he had left his home while his mother was sleeping on the couch in the living room. No scenes were filmed showing his arrival at Abby's house, her welcoming him, what they did that night, and how he ended up lying and sleeping on the floor of Abby's house despite the existence of better places to sleep. For example, he could have slept on the couch in Abby's living room, but he didn't. Why not? The reason was never clarified!

**4.** After the police officer played by actor Elias Koteas entered the bathroom where Abby was sleeping in the bathtub, Abby killed him, and in a later scene, we find that the police officer's body was hidden in a hole in the wall of an apartment frequented by a boy who used to live in the building, named Tommy. This boy appears to be Owen's friend, otherwise Owen wouldn't have known about his secret hideout where he goes to drink and smoke with his high school companions. Or perhaps Owen simply discovered this information by chance because he often loiters outside and voyeuristically watches people through his binoculars in his room. So one way or another, Owen was able to know about this place. But the problem doesn't lie here; it lies in the fact that the police officer's body was hidden in this place in an absurdly ridiculous manner. It wasn't shown who did this, but it was likely done by Abby or with Abby's participation. It's inconceivable that Abby, who is accustomed to killing, would hide the body without covering the hole with anything, whether through cement, plaster, a piece of wood, or an amount of pillow stuffing and fabric. Leaving the body exposed in this way was illogical for a character accustomed to killing because there was simply no benefit to hiding the body in this manner. They went through the trouble of hiding it without any purpose; the smell would emanate from it in a short period and spread throughout the neighborhood, and neighbors would soon smell it and bring the police. I know that Abby and Owen escaped at the end of the film, but their escape won't last as long as the body will be discovered within a few days of their escape. The body will be linked to their escape along with the recent rumors circulated by investigators, and it will be easy to find a connection between them even if it doesn't seem logical for children of their age. Their escape will create a question mark that forces investigators to discover what lies behind it. Therefore, it was mentally unacceptable for Abby, who is accustomed to killing, to bury the police officer's body in this way, which would expose her escape operation with Owen to discovery and then destroy their future together.

**5.** Owen learning the language of tapping on things as a means of communication between him and Abby, with Abby's ability to comprehend the meanings of those taps without there being any notable introductions paving the way for such a thing to happen. We didn't see any dialogue scenes between Owen and Abby where one explains this new communication language to the other and teaches it to them. So let's say they learned it from the director behind the scenes."

This is another sports drama from Disney and another film about horses, of which they have been a fair amount down the decades from the studio. It fails to reach the (very) high levels of 1976's <em>'The Littlest Horse Thieves'</em> and 1991's <em>'Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken'</em>.

However, with that noted, <em>'Secretariat'</em> still produces a fine time. Lane and Malkovich are very good together, Lane particularly stands out. Margo Martindale is involved once more, playing a sweet and lovely character as she always does - she's perfect for those roles. Nice to see James Cromwell, also.

The cinematography is solid, as is the pacing of events. It does feel a little light of serious story at times, but that's hard to avoid when you're dealing with something as interesting but repetitive as horse racing. In the end, it's a nice story about Secretariat and Penny Chenery."

The two main characters, though, are very well played by McNairy and Able. || I enjoyed this film. There, I said it. I have watched it twice and will again at a future time. I see it more as suspense rather than as an action thriller, the difference Hitchcock explained between a bomb going off and the tension of wondering if it is going to go off. A bulging muscled hero or a bulging cleavaged heroine wouldn't have improved it in my eyes.

This is a different sort of alien invasion movie. In fact, it almost feels to me like the invaders dropped in on the planet like drunken tourists and now find they aren't able to fit in or leave but are instead stuck in one bar fight after another. Hmm, okay, that metaphor doesn't quite work, but it feels to me that they aren't here to conquer but rather to try to live their lives.

I liked how the connection between the two leads gradually grew stronger after what appeared to be dislike, or at least disinterest. And I have to wonder if the title of the film shares its obvious meaning with a shadow allusion to the monsters within us.

I read somewhere that there is no way monsters built like these could walk upright as they are shown doing. But - they are.  I can overlook a lapse in science when the movie is good.  I am not sure I believe multiple universes Are possible, but a lot of renown physicists do, so there is a fine line between speculative friction and unrealistic plots. What I am saying is that science isn’t my first priority in science fiction. I really enjoy time travel stories, even though most of them don’t bother with making time travel seem feasible. So yes, I liked this film, and you can too if you let yourself || The more sci-fi I watch the more I pray that it isn’t the Americans who discover the potential for extraterrestrial life! This time, NASA sends a probe to collect data from something they think might bear fruit in outer space but they manage to cock up the re-entry of their spacecraft and reduce great swathes of Mexico to the status of a quarantine zone. On the wrong side of this restricted area is hardened photo-journalist “Kaulder” (Scoot McNairy) who instead of getting some snaps of the reason for this new ultra-high security, ends up saddled with “Sam” (Whitney Able) who just happens to be the stranded daughter of his US paymaster. With the infrastructure in tatters and the locals in survival mode, it’s not going to be easy to get them home - especially as the prices are going through the roof and he has a penchant for hookers and getting robbed. It’s this last activity that condemns them both into the hands of the people smugglers and the local, somewhat superstitious at times, tribespeople - but can they make it? Now, first things first, there are virtually no monsters here and it’s a very slowly paced affair - so if you are looking for a sort of alien version of “Jurassic Park” then this won’t be for you. What it does manage, though, on what’s obviously not much more of a budget than these characters had to escape, is take us through a series of effectively photographed and perilous scenarios using the jungle, the rivers, some unscrupulous characters and a solid effort from the audio department to create quite an accumulative sense of menace. There’s a decent degree of chemistry between Able and McNairy, especially as if I’d been her character I’d probably have just thrown “Kaulder” to the crocodiles on more than one occasion! There’s no denying that it does sort of peter out, and the last twenty minutes are not anything to write home about, but if you let your own imagination work alongside that of auteur Gareth Edwards and ignore some of the banal dialogue, then it’s not an half bad thriller that merits a watch."

---

While “Paranormal Activity 2” improves upon the original in a few areas, the film’s underwhelming conclusion ultimately brings it down. The first “Paranormal Activity” was more effective because of its slower but steadily increasing levels of tension and unease; this time around, the tempo is a little over the place. The story isn’t bad on its own, but it falls apart as soon as you connect it with the original. The first film had a more intriguing concept, with a demon nearly showing affection towards Katie, rather than the same old pact with the devil nonsense this one has going on. As a standalone film, Paranormal Activity 2 is a passable horror flick that, like its predecessor, excels at keeping things straightforward. If you liked the first film in the Paranormal Activity franchise, you’d appreciate this one just as much, and even if you didn’t, you might want to give it a go because it’s different enough to appeal to those who didn’t enjoy the previous one. || This is kind of like a meanwhile at her sisters place.

The performances are quite OK but the story is flat from the beginning to the end. || Clint Eastwood has once again proved himself to be a formidable director. The style and structure of storytelling used in Hereafter will not appeal to a large audience, but something tells me he knew this all too well but honestly, didn't care and rightfully so. Because let's face it, he can afford it and it's certainly a privilege he has earned. And with Hereafter, it seems that all Mr. Eastwood wants to do is share a story. A very beautiful one at that.

Hereafter is divided into three story lines, spread over three different countries. We have Matt Damon as a reluctant psychic in the United States, Cécile De France who plays a journalist in France and a young pair of twin brothers (Frankie and George McLaren) in England. All of these peoples' lives are in one way or another affected by different aspects of death, whether that be a near-death experience or the passing of someone very dear. Or, in Damons case, the ability to establish a certain connection with those who are no longer with us. Eastwood has decided on a particularly art house-like approach, which, like I mentioned earlier, will certainly back off a large amount of potential viewers. However, I personally very much appreciate his decision. He has obviously chosen not to make this some big, hyped-up monster movie about all things paranormal. Instead, Hereafter deals with its subject with great integrity and subtlety. Although, despite said subtlety, it features a few moments which are, by contrast, incredibly intense and shocking (in a non-scary way). In fact, I would even go so far as to say it is not for the faint of heart, but I mean that mostly in an emotional sense, rather than a spectacular one. On a side note, I would actually not recommend this film to anyone who has, in any way, shape or form been confronted with the 2004 tsunami, or even the London terrorist attacks. It might be really confronting, so be advised.

I personally think the film's user rating is a bit low, but on the other hand I do somewhat understand why this film has not received the appreciation it deserves. Simply put, not everyone (actually, many people) will not understand it. It is a small story, for a small audience. Also, anyone watching this because they think it's all about Matt Damon will be somewhat deceived. I fully understand why they put his name and picture on the poster, since he is the only big name on the payroll. But this is really not 'his' film, he just plays a part in it. And he does it well, but the rest of the cast actually deserves a great deal of credit, because they are quite simply phenomenal. And I mean *all* of them. Cécile de France is really impressive, she plays her part with great dignity and empathy. She truly carries every scene she's in, and she will definitely do her country proud. Personally, I was most affected (both story- and acting wise) by the 'London segment' of the film. The story of the two young brothers is absolutely heartbreaking, and the McLaren boys do a superb job at translating this onto the screen. Anyone who doesn't at least feel a shudder of emotion when watching their story unfold, well... honestly doesn't have a lot of heart. I refuse to give away any plot points at all, other than what I already have. This is really the kind of story you just need to surrender to in order to really appreciate it. The pacing demands some patience, but if this is your kind of film it really won't be too much trouble and you will be greatly rewarded.

The way the story unfolds (the three-way structure, which doesn't come together until the very end), inevitably evokes comparison to 'Babel', but honestly, that one cost me a far greater deal of effort to sit through than Hereafter. But that is entirely personal of course, and the structure is really the only similarity between the two; the stories are completely different. And I also think Hereafter is actually far more accessible than Babel, despite its subject matter. The stories are told with such tenderness that it didn't actually bother me at all that they were three separate stories which, until the end, had nothing to do with each other. They all intrigued me in their own personal way.

Actually, I could go on and on...

It's been a long time since a film has really touched my heart, but this one has. I've been thinking about what rating I should give it, but honestly, I can't think of a single reason why I wouldn't give this film a 10. Hereafter is a film of true beauty, a real gem. Which, unfortunately, won't be understood by many people, but who knows... Perhaps someday, its time will come.
_(August 2011)_ || Bit of a disappointment, to be honest.

<em>'Hereafter'</em> spends the majority of the 2hr (or so) run time building up the intrigue, but then proceeds to do hardly anything with it. As the credits rolled, I felt like I wanted more from this 2010 release. The three stories take too long to connect, even if each one is actually quite interesting.

So the movie is funny but not LMAO-funny. It has a touching side to it. Of course, I felt so happy seeing Robert Downey Jr. just being his plain hot self. He looks good when he's clean and he looks good when he's dirty.  And then there's Zach Galifianakis. I loved him in Hangover. He's super funny there. But I was surprised to watch him in this movie because not only is he in his funny self, he did a couple of crying scenes which were touching. 

This movie is tiring. YES. Tiring. All the adventures and misadventures that they had made me really tired. My rate for this movie is B+. I can never give Robert a low rating hehehe. || A generic road trip movie with two terrible people who continuously make bad choices in a predictable plot rife with even more predictable ""gags"". Galifianakis portrays an even dumber and less funny version of the Hangover while Downey plays a less intelligent and less humorous version of Tony Stark.

Seriously, it isn't worth your time. If you want a funny road trip film then go watch 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' instead. Doesn't matter if you've seen it before. You will still feel a lot happier than if you had wasted your life on this film. || Decent watch, probably won't watch again, and can't whole-heartedly recommend.

This is an interesting movie to look at critically.  The writing, mostly in the character work, feels weak.  It actually has an interesting plot, for the most part: an idiot, through deceit, drags a jerk with him on a cross country road trip.  It's a decent story, and I'd like to think of it as an spiritual predecessor to ""The Hangover"".  The problem I have with it is that it feels like if there were better actors, then the characters would sell better.  Then I remember it was Robert Downey Jr and Zach Galifinakas, and I'm not sure how much ""better"" you can get for these characters, meaning that they've probably already elevated the characters somewhat.

It feels like a lot of the movie is unnecessary, like antithetical Chekov's guns.  Either it's for a tiny one time joke with little payoff, or it's part of a lot of work for situational comedy.

An example would be the dog, it really only has one significant joke in the entire movie (maybe 2), otherwise it's just a lot of maintenance.

The coffee can on the other hand is repetitively used to throughout the movie as it's part of the character themes.

I'm not saying it's not funny, if you like ""Anger Management"", then you might like this one, but I just think there are a lot better movies out there to watch."

Through a pretty serious event of misfortune, he gets trapped in a canyon by a boulder that pulverises his arm against the canyon wall; literally between a rock and a hard place. And, the desperate measures he resorts to in order to free himself. From a Hollywood perspective, this sounds like it could be turned into a wildly spectacular action film with a bold, heroic protagonist, hysterical relatives and ""Where is my son? PLEASE FIND MY SON!!"" (*intense sobbing*) - type of dialogue. Yes? No. Boy, am I glad this was directed by Danny Boyle... The man we all know for his raw, authentic film style. Instead of aforementioned blockbuster drama, he opted for an incredibly realistic, documentary-like film. 127 Hours starts off with no form of introduction whatsoever. We do not get to 'meet' Aron or any of his relatives. However, any such introduction quickly proves to be redundant as, over the fast-paced opening credits, we see Aron enthusiastically preparing for and taking off on a hiking trip (ignoring his mother's phone call in the process...), and there you have it: this is a 'too cool for school', overconfident adrenaline junkie, and that's all we need to know. This overconfidence gradually proves to be the source of pretty much all his problems, as it is later on revealed that Aron neglected to tell anyone where he was going... Oops.

Like I said, this film looks and feels very much like a documentary, like National Geographic made a big budget reconstruction of the event. The film makers' choice to cast James Franco was a very good one. He is simply amazing. Mind you – he is alone in this film for about 95% of the time. This requires an actor with the guts and skill to carry an entire film, and I must admit, Franco probably wouldn't have been my first choice. But – to my pleasant surprise – he pulls it off, and is actually very worthy indeed of his Oscar nomination. He displays an impressively wide range of emotions, all equally convincing. Panic, disbelief, despair, delusion, hurt and hallucinations. But even confidence, coolness, exhilaration and rationality; it's all there. Aron Ralston, as a character, starts off as a seemingly quite cocky, confident, care-free dude who just wants to enjoy himself and do what he loves most: exploring nature. Without telling his family. But as the film progresses, and Aron realises just what kind of mess he's in, you can slowly see a change occurring in him. And the fact that, after a while you greatly start to sympathize with him and even admire him, despite his obvious stupidity before, is all due to James Franco. He has really proved himself to be a very fine character actor with the capability of moving his audience. There is one scene in particular which I found really captivating. During the 'Tuesday' scene, Aron records himself on his camcorder, acting like he's on a talk show, answering his own questions. This scene is top-notch, acting wise, and this is where you really start to feel for him. 

Throughout Aron's ordeal, we are shown various flashbacks of his childhood, friends, family and loves. This might seem like a cliché, but honestly, what else are you supposed to think about when you're stuck in a canyon for five days? Some people have suggested they think Aron to be a superficial person for not having some kind of spiritual enlightenment while he was trapped, but honestly, I don't think it's anybody's business to judge what Aron thought and felt throughout his ordeal. We all deal with hardship in our own personal way, and talking to God is not necessarily an option for everyone. Some of us simply draw support from family and love and good memories. I know that's what I'd do. 

Now, back to technical talk. The sense of realism of 127 Hours comes greatly from the grainy, unsteady camera work and graphic depiction of everything. Which is a note that comes with a warning: this film is not for the faint of heart. What surprised me is that the scene where Aron 'releases' himself is visually very graphic. I won't go into detail, but you really shouldn't watch this if you don't have the stomach.

There were only a few minor things which bothered me during this film. It has a few moments which, inevitably are a teeny bit boring. But then again, even that seems to fit into the story, so perhaps it makes sense. And I personally think the music wasn't always very well chosen, some of it didn't really fit somehow. But none of this is really any bother.

127 Hours may not be as profound as Into the Wild, but it's certainly a very well-crafted film which deserves respect on its own merits. Also, the photography of the film is really beautiful and some of the scenery of the canyons is truly breathtaking. I would recommend it for the pretty pictures alone. Anyhow, if you're interested in a really good episode of ""I shouldn't be alive"", this is the film for you.

Sam Fuller's first film direction is a version of what happened to Robert Ford (John Ireland), the man who famously killed his friend - Jesse James (Reed Hadley).

Taking up the basic elements of the real life story, Fuller keeps the narrative tight whilst ensuring the complexities of the main characters come to the fore. All the quirks and peccadilloes of the human condition are explored (the detail of Ford's torments and troubles superbly told), which is something of a rarity for a late 1940s ""B"" standard Western. The use of close-ups are to purposely highlight the psychological discord on show, marking this out as a good pointer to the later work of its maverick director.

Unstoppable is directed by Tony Scott and written by Mark Bomback. It stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee & Kevin Dunn. Cinematographer is Ben Seresin and the music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams. Plot finds Washington and Pine as Pennsylvania rail yard workers at the opposite ends of their working careers. Whilst working on their first job together, and not exactly hitting it off, the two men are thrust into a frantic pursuit of a runaway train. The runaway (coaster) is pulling tankers containing highly explosive material, and hurtling along at 70mph it has to be stopped before it hits civilisation.

Almost as if to atone for the misfire that was The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, Scott and Washington jump on board another type of train movie and literally let it rip. The film is as simple as its plot synopsis suggests, it's a disaster movie on the railway, but with Scott cranking it up as much as he can, it's as much fun as you can hope to have with a modern day popcorner. Carrying all the trade mark licks of its director; roving camera, scattergun editing and ear splitting sound mix, it's also nice to report that unlike Pelham, the pace never sags. Even as the principal characters hang ups and back stories are unfolded in the narrative, Unstoppable literally doesn't pause for breath. Sure the ""Bromance"" development is signposted at the first stop, and yes, are we ever in doubt about where this will end up? But if you are going into Unstoppable for wry social commentary or an expose on the political shenanigans involved in today's rail yards? Well you deserve all the disappointment you will undoubtedly get.

A runaway train pursued by Captain Kirk and Malcolm X, directed by the man who brought us Top Gun. Yeah baby, it's a thrill ride for sure. 8/10 || Unstoppable is an intense, high-energy thriller that keeps you on edge from start to finish. The premise is simple but packed with tension, and the performances by Denzel Washington and Chris Pine elevate the film. Their chemistry makes the stakes feel real, and you genuinely connect with their characters. The movie does a great job of building suspense, and the pacing never lets up, making it an easy and engaging watch.

That being said, the script didn’t fully hold up for me. While I understand the need for character-building moments, some of the dialogue felt excessive and took away from the urgency of the story. The film could have focused more on developing the plot instead of lingering on conversations that didn’t add much. I also had issues with the cinematography, especially the constant swirling camera movements. It felt like an attempt to create a sense of motion and energy, but instead, it became distracting and even frustrating at times.

Despite its flaws, Unstoppable delivers where it counts. The action sequences are well-executed, the intensity is gripping, and the climax is satisfying even if expected. It may not have the strongest script, but the solid performances and non-stop momentum make it an entertaining ride. If you’re looking for a fast-paced thriller with strong leads and adrenaline-pumping moments, it’s worth a watch."
48303.0,Certified Copy,"In Tuscany to promote his latest book, a middle-aged English writer meets a French woman who leads him to the village of Lucignano.",,"Drama, Romance",106.0,2010-05-19,fr,6.994,418.0,0.9259,"Juliette Binoche, William Shimell, Jean-Claude Carrière, Agathe Natanson, Gianna Giachetti",Abbas Kiarostami,"wedding anniversary, italian art, tuscany, italy, pair of earrings, estranged father","Sweet movie about the living troubles of a 15 years long couple.

Juliette Binoche and William Shimell do a great performance. || Abbas Kiarostami's last few films were made outside his native Iran, and his 2010 effort CERTIFIED COPY is set in the colourful towns and countryside of Tuscany. Its two main characters have arrived in Italy from elsewhere: a Frenchwoman (never named, and played by Juliette Binoche) has lived in Arezzo for several years now, running an antique shop, while James (William Shimell) is an Englishman invited to lecture on an art history book that he has written.

As the film opens, James is in fact giving that lecture, speaking of how a high-quality copy of a work of art may said to be better than the original. He soon meets the French antiques dealer, and the two spend an afternoon touring the nooks and crannies of Tuscany. With the Frenchwoman’s awkwardness and Jame's suave, confident air, Kiarostami is clearly riffing on the romantic comedies of the last two decades. But then the film takes a magical-realist turn: the two begin speaking as if they have been married for many years already. The apparent relationship between the two continues to evolve and morph over the course of the film's 106 minutes (and what seems to be for them just a Sunday afternoon spent together) as Kiarostami broods on the nature of marriage as the years go by: people change over time, a husband and wife will eventually be rather copies of their youthful selves, but will they be copies better than the originals, or a sad mockery of their youthful idealism?

For anyone who has been married (people who haven't may not get much of the film), CERTIFIED COPY is a moving evocation of the rigours of staying together with another person, and the shadowy undercurrents of even apparently happy unions. However, I was ultimately left with mixed feelings. Starting this film with a highly didactic lecture was, in my opinion, a bad choice: no audience wants to feel lectured to right off the bat. Then, the script is a bit too conversation-driven, becoming in parts a logorrhea that will overwhelm even viewers who can understand its trilingual French-Italian-English dialogue (it's probably horrible for those who rely on subtitles). Kiarostami could have trimmed the dialogue without sacrificing any part of his message.

Before making this film, Shimell had been known only as an opera singer on the stages of Europe. He manages to make the leap to film actor quite well, with all the subtlety that his role requires -- indeed, I know someone quite like James in both background and personality, and Shimell's depiction bore a resemblance so close it was chilling. Juliette Binochedeftly manages to change her mood and bearing instantly to signal another shift in the film's intrigue. In spite of the European setting, much of Kiarostami's personal technique remains (as well as general aspects of the Iranian New Wave like only the voices of minor roles heard, with the characters themselves not shown onscreen)."

I mean, please, this film could be a lesson all on its own on how not to write a decent screenplay. Its all in here: one-dimensional characters, supremely poor pacing, multiple threads that go absolutely nowhere and completely implausible action sequences.

And, you know, it's just a B-thriller. It's not like I haven't seen these mistakes time and time again. What really bothers me is just how highly it thinks of itself. It not only thinks it's interesting (which it isn't whatsoever), but it thinks it's smart, edgy, and it probably even thinks it's clever. I mean, there are so many characters who function for exactly one plot point and are then left behind in the dust. For example, this one chick who's name I forget (did they ever even say her name?) is introduced fairly early on in the film, and looks even like Russell Crowe's love interest. We see the very, very beginnings of a meaningful relationship forming and then it turns out that she was only a device to fill in a little potential plot hole (trying not to spoil the movie.) The same with Russell Crowe's parents, there are a handful of scattered scenes with them showing little glimpses of a meaningful relationship, and then the same exact friggin' thing is done, they're used as a simple (and illogical) plot mechanism.

It's almost like one of Paul Haggis's friends was reading the script and said ""hey, Paul, this is completely ridiculous, how could they possibly manage to _________"" and Haggis wrote in these characters as devices to satisfy the issue, realized they were one-dimensional, and wrote in a pseudo-intelligent relationship (which doesn't in reality make them any better.) And this is how the first 2/3 of the movie moves so dreadfully slowly. I mean, I'm absolutely confident that with a decent editor, the first hour and fifteen minutes could be whittled down to maybe half an hour.

They could have especially left out the symbols that don't actually symbolize anything. Which seems silly to say, but the jar of quarters that keeps recurring in the movie not only has no plot significance, but has zero metaphorical significance. They barely explained what they were doing in their house. They were quite literally only in the film to make it look a little deeper. Not to make it more meaningful, but to make it look more meaningful. To make it ""smart,"" and ""edgy,"" and ""clever.""

Some nice suspense-filled moments throughout (the bump key scene still gets me).

However, the final scene with detective ""seeing"" how the crime went down seemed like something the studio wanted to give a clear conclusion, and felt so unnecessary. **4.0/5**"

What would you do if you knew that you have a few months to live and a life full of problems and unresolved issues? That's what happened to the central character of this film, a production made halfway between Spain and Mexico, skillfully directed by Alejandro González Iñarritu. The film is set in Barcelona and the main character, Uxbal, is a dubious individual who has a close relationship with organized crime and is far from the likable type that we easily like. In addition to his illegal business, which goes relatively poorly due to various problems and setbacks, Uxbal has an alcoholic, bipolar wife from whom he is, in effect, estranged, and two beloved children who are the real joy he has in life.

The film is interesting and tackles difficult, indigestible and complex topics. I can't say that it's the type of film I would recommend to a friend, because I think it's a film that lacks a certain disposition, on the part of the public, to be properly appreciated. It is not an easy film, nor does it seek to capture our sympathy, although it ends up doing so because of the way we see that man suffering. We see beyond what he does and says, we see that deep down he is not a bad man. Still, it's a depressing film and one that leaves us with a feeling of emptiness and dissatisfaction at the end.

With this film, Javier Bardem had a character and material tailored to what the actor knows and is capable of doing. It's no secret that Iñarritu wanted him to be the protagonist from the start, and Bardem rewarded him by giving him a dose of commitment, experience and professionalism that anyone who wants to see the film can see. The actor is excellent and does a truly impeccable, deep, emotional job here. The film also has good performances from other actors, such as Hanaa Bouchaib, Guillermo Estrella and Maricel Álvarez, but it is Bardem's overwhelming performance that delights us and sustains the entire film.

Technically, what caught my attention the most was the excellence of the resources and sound effects and their dexterous and competent use. It is in the details that the best qualities are found, such as the absence of echo, the sound clarity, the good sound effects used or even situations like the sound of the heartbeats of two actors, when they embrace.

Book 7 is my favorite Harry Potter book so being able to see it on film is really exciting. I was satisfied. I know I won't see everything that I read in the movie although there were some parts wherein I wished I saw it like the goodbye of the Dursleys to Harry. It made me tear up while reading the book but I didn't really see it in the film. Also, the way how Hedwig died in the film did not make that big of an impact. I was surprised though in the part where Harry and Hermione kissed. It was in the book but in the movie, they were naked! I was really surprised. And then Hermione looks gorgeous as always and Harry looked good in the movie too. The part where Harry and Hermione danced was not in the book but I liked that part.

My rate for this movie is A. || Since their inception with the ""Philisopher's Stone"" (2001) I have really enjoyed the series that depicts the trials and tribulations of the ""boy wizard"" and his two best pals, and this last, but one, episode in their adventures is super. It's no longer a cheesy, children's franchise - but a dark, gritty and thoughtful piece of work from David Yates that really does convey some of the sinister and malevolent aspects of JK Rowling's book. Harry, Ron and Hermione are all but grown up - whether they are old enough, or not - and with their friends and allies must now prepare for the final battle with ""Voldemort"". This involves the seeking out and destruction of the crucial horcruxes that each contain a part of the life-force of their evil foe. The writing is taut, as is the direction - the personalities of the three characters we have followed for the last 9 years have developed into plausible people - with quirks, strengths, weaknesses - and (sadly) even romantic tendencies. It's fantastic cinema, with captivating visual effects, characterisations and a much more mature storyline that deals with both triumph and disaster using a superb ensemble cast drawn from amongst the best actors who all contribute to build a real sense of unity and jeopardy ahead of part 2....

It has it all. || The gift of cinema does credit to the gift of speech.

The King's Speech is directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. It stars Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi & Michael Gambon. Music is by Alexandre Desplat and photography is by Danny Cohen. The idea for the film came about after Seidler read about how King George VI (Firth) overcame his stammer after a friendship was formed with his voice coach Lionel Logue (Rush). Having himself overcome a stutter problem in his youth, Seidler set about writing his story from informed information. A bonus came before filming started when notebooks belonging to Logue were put forward for use. These enabled Seidler to incorporate works from the books into the screenplay. Plot picks up just prior to George's brother, Edward (Pearce), abdicating the throne, thus thrusting the stammering George on to the hottest seat in England. With World War looming, George will be needed to make the speech of speeches to becalm his nation, but first he must work closely with the affable Logue and hope it brings an end to his vocal woes.

I first viewed The King's Speech just a couple of days before the Academy Awards that year, so I didn't know how it was going to perform there. It would garner the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth) and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler), with 12 nominations in total. This was a year when Oscar and BAFTA (where it won 7 of the 14 categories it was nominated for - including Best Film and Best Actor for Colin Firth) got things right. The film at that time I watched it had already made over $230 million in profit, which was a figure guaranteed to rise considerably since the film was still playing to packed theatres in the UK (which was indeed the case as the last figure put forward was $412 million).

I myself ventured to the theatre on 22nd February 2011, which was over 6 weeks after it was first released in its homeland. As I approached the cinema I saw there was a queue! A queue? I haven't queued to get into a film since the halcyon days of Jaws, Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind! I noticed there was many youngsters in this line, so of course they were going to see the Yogi Bear movie, or that Gnomeo & Juliet film, Surely? Not so actually. In they went to see The King's Speech, an audience that ranged from 12 years of age to the fragile OAP day trippers. For the next two hours the only sounds I heard were that of laughter, hushed words of praise for what was on the screen, and even sobs during some of the more tender moments within. No mobile phones, no chitter chatter about acne or the boy next door, just an across the board appreciation for expert film making.

There in is the reason why The King's Speech coined it in at the box office and broke merry records as it went on its way. It has universal appeal, a film without tricks, just a simple involving story acted supremely by a cast of bona fide thespians. It beats a true heart,  whilst doling out a visual history lesson to those so inclined to matters of the British Monarchy and the political upheaval about to surface as Adolf started his surge. Even for a film so chocked full of dialogue and basic human interactions, the pace is brisk and never sags, the quieter reflective moments only bringing anticipation of the next enjoyable scene. When all is said and done, The King's Speech success snowballed because of word of mouth, it started out as an intended independent picture, to be shown in selected theatres only, and now it holds up as one of the best films of 2010/2011. Believe me, believe the hype, that if you still haven't seen it then you owe it to yourself to see this beautiful movie. 10/10 || Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth make for quite a pairing in this touching drama of King George VI and his speech impediment. Being called upon for public speaking only increased the anxiety of the then Duke of York (Firth) and so his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decided that there had to be a better way to treat her husband than sticking an handful of marbles in this mouth. She, as ""Mrs. Johnson"" sets up a chat with speech therapist Lionel Logue (Rush) and he, having no idea who she really is, only agrees to see him if he comes to his consulting room. Unfamiliar with the backchat, but impressed by his independent mindedness, TRH duly arrive and once Logue gets over the shock, he begins to deal with his new, cash-are, client in a polite but hardly deferential fashion. Gradually we see that progress is being made. Not just with the confidence of the Prince at speechifying, but also with his attitude and behaviour in general. He likes Logue, Logue likes him and thanks to some airfix kits, quite a bit of the old Anglo-Saxon and all under the discreet but potent supervision of the Duchess, the young man comes better prepared for what is to come next - after the Abdication Crisis, that is... There's a great rapport between the two men here as this speculative story offers us a plausible and engaging look at just how tough and unforgiving society was to those who stammered - regardless of their rank. Rush also juggles Logue's role of a career man with that of a loving family man well as well as a budding Thespian entertainingly too. Astutely, Tom Hooper leaves the vast majority of the film to just those two men. HBC adds a touch of diversion now and again and Sir Derek Jacobi weighs in as the outwardly rather unsympathetic Archbishop Lang but for the most part it's just them. It's history, we know what actually happened but over these two hours we do get a sense of beginning to know a little of the man beneath the crown and of his honest and forthright advisor and of why they might have become firm friends. No gimmicks, no CGI - just a solid script, some great production design and two strong performances."

I liked how the Princess was not the typical Disney princess. Rapunzel was strong and active. She wasn't very timid and proper like the usual Disney princess that I grew up watching.

<em>'Tangled'</em> kicks off Disney's animated releases for the 2010s in very strong fashion. It's nicely created, with fun characters and a hearty storyline. It actually sets a lot of the foundations that 2013's <em>'Frozen'</em> uses, there's a fair amount of similarities between the two.

Mandy Moore does a terrific job in the lead role, she's brings an energetic edge to the character alongside good humour. Zachary Levi (Flynn) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) are more than decent in their respective parts. You also have the amusing (non-speaking) Maximus.

It's still very much the usual fairytale/princess thing, but it manages to add a lively turn to proceedings which keeps it entertaining."

London Boulevard is written and directed by William Monahan. It stars Colin Farrell, David Thewlis, Ray Winstone, Ben Chaplin, Keira Knightley and Anna Friel. Music is by Sergio Pizzorno and cinematography by Chris Menges.

After serving his stretch for GBH, Harry Mitchel (Farrell) returns to his manor and finds gangland boss Rob Gant (Winstone) wants him as one of his charges.

Written and directed by the man who co-wrote The Departed, it's not hard to guess what sort of tone London Boulevard is set at. Which for anyone who follows neo-noir will find plenty to like here, not least the stylish and tonally compliant photography of Menges.

However, falling under the neo-noir banner becomes a curse in a way because there are far greater films of this ilk to liken it too. Pic at least does have the courage to not cop out in resolutions, but again there is no surprise factor for the genre faithfuls.

The narrative often meanders, shoehorning in Knightley's (underused) harassed actress as a love interest in the process, and London accents are choppy. It also is criminal to have Stephen Graham and Eddie Marsan in your movie and barely give them screen time!

On the plus side of things, the violence and dialogue is often taut and tart respectively, backed by a scorching rocky hipster soundtrack. Farrell is good value as a tough guy, Winstone does what he does best, menacing of course, while Thewlis steals the film as a wired cool cat with menace surprisingly lurking in is heart.

As a whole it fails to hit all the right spots, but enough in here for neo-noir fans to feed on as an appetiser to a more fulfilling noir meal. 6/10"

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || ***Aliens attack Earth and seek to SUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT***

A couple (Eric Balfour & Scottie Thompson) visits some friends in Los Angeles when aliens attack the city and they hold up in a posh apartment complex. The other protagonists are played by Brittany Daniel, Donald Faison, Crystal Reed and David Zayas.

""Skyline"" (2010) combines elements of other Alien invasion flicks like “Independence Day” (1996), “Battle: Los Angeles” (2011), “Cloverfield” (2008) and “War of the Worlds” (1953/2005) with an ending reminiscent of the same in “Night Skies” (2007). The people-snatching aspect recalls “The Forgotten” (2004).   

The director brothers are visual effects designers who were working on the blockbuster “Battle: Los Angeles” while making this indie, which only cost about $10 million. Sony Pictures sued, but the case was later dropped. It must’ve scared the directors because they haven’t returned to directing since (as of this writing) even though “Skyline” made $21 million domestically and $78 million worldwide, which led to the sequel “Beyond Skyline” (2017) by other filmmakers.

Being made by effects experts, it’s not surprising that the F/X in “Skyline” are top-of-the-line. Some of the aliens or crafts look like they were modeled after sea creatures, like octopi and jelly fish. There are also probing tentacles, as seen in “War of the Worlds.” Meanwhile the main vessels and some of the aliens are similar to those in “Independence Day.”

Unfortunately, there’s not enough human interest and the story is too one-dimensional to be overly gripping, for me anyway. Still, this is a grave, tense account of what a malevolent alien invasion might be like. It lacks the lighter side of “Independence Day” and other eye-rolling aspects (e.g. the pro-American angle), but “ID” had more human interest and a plot with a much larger scope. This one amounts to: Aliens attack earth and snatch victims, the end. Yet it’s well done for what it is. 

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles with shots of New York City, London and Hong Kong at the end.

GRADE: B- || The story does unfold slowly, but it was far from boring (in my opinion).
I'm not sure why they started off with backstory and explaining why the two main characters were at the apartment block. It didn't help the story.

I thought the story was well presented and from a Sci-Fi perspective was plausible.
The production values were very high with excellent special effects. The feel of the movie was very real and you felt what the characters would be feeling... so I guess this means the acting was believable.

At no time did I need to suspend my disbelief.
To me, that is the mark of a good Sci-Fi movie."

However, what sets this movie apart from its contemporaries is its poignant exploration of Maggie's struggle with Parkinson's disease.

The movie can be divided into two halves: the first is a typical rom-com, complete with witty banter and charming flirtations between Jamie and Maggie. However, midway through the film, the tone takes a dramatic shift as the focus shifts to Maggie's struggles with her illness. The movie becomes intimate and shockingly raw as Jamie tries to cope with the future struggles he and Maggie will face together, while simultaneously portraying Maggie's struggle to let someone in and take care of her. This story really works and brought tears to my eyes near the end.

While the direction is pretty bland and lacks any real sense of style, the performances are strong. Both Hathaway and Gyllenhaal have excellent chemistry and play off each other perfectly. However, the real standout performance comes from Josh Gad, whose comedic timing is brilliant and whose scenes had me laughing out loud.

One aspect of the movie that detracts from its overall impact is the excessive use of nudity. Hathaway is shown topless in almost every scene, to the point where it feels quite predatory. While I am not sure if the choice to include this excessive nudity was made by the director or writing team, its frequency detracts from the intimacy of the characters' interactions and feels quite gratuitous.

Overall, Love & Other Drugs is a solid romantic comedy that attempts to do something a little different, which I can definitely appreciate. Its exploration of illness and its effects on relationships adds a layer of depth and emotion that the typical rom-com formula usually lacks.

When I write reviews, I do try to give at least a modicum of context, be it a history of the film itself, predecessors to its place in cinema history, or my general feelings on the type of film. In this case, I've just referenced Francis Ford Coppola's classic take on Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" Apocalypse Now. What does that have to do with Dawn Treader? Nothing, and I couldn't be happier. Why? Because it's distracted my mind with thoughts of a far, far better film. Allow me my few moments of happiness before I have to rifle through the dark filing cabinet of my mind to marshal my thoughts on this atrocity.\

What went so wrong here, you may ask? We'll start with the history of this franchise. I do not have the highest opinion of this series. We started out with the most famous of C. S. Lewis' Narnia cycle, The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. I don't know...perhaps if we hadn't been in the middle of such a fantasy film renaissance, I would have found it more palatable. Instead, coming on the heels of Peter Jackson's generation-defining Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the high class and quality of the Harry Potter franchise, that weak take on a book series that didn't thrill me as a child struck me as a cheap, childish appetizer compared to the magnificent feasts audiences had already been served, their stories facile, their acting (aside from a typically great Tilda Swinton) either poor or phoned-in (Paging Mr. Neeson, your paycheck is waiting for you). SHREK co-director Andrew Adamson was the helmer of both Wardrobe and Caspian, and I had hoped those film's failings were due perhaps to his inexperience as a director of live-action. The first film of course wore its Christian allegory on its sleeve (Lewis, for all his writings, never managed to find the definition of ""subtle""), and it found favor with the churchgoing crowd, whose turnout afforded it a huge box office windfall. The second film was more of a straight actioner (in the vein of Star Wars Episode I, which is to say the supposed action was mired in a swamp of facile and achingly dull political machinations), and didn't find purchase with the same demographic, and box office returns were disappointingly low. Disney, who had financed the films, saw the writing on the wall, and dropped the series. That should have been the end of it.

Until 20th Century Fox stepped in. Now, let's remember: Fox doesn't have the best track record with adapting beloved fantasy series into films (a moment of silence for the tragedies that were The Dark is Rising and Eregon, please). Hiring Michael Apted as the director seemed to be bucking the trend of shoveling out crap. Apted isn't really known as an action, fantasy, or epic film director, but he showed promise with the last Pierce Brosnan/James Bond film, The World is Not Enough (I'll not blame him for Denise Richards'...nuclear physicist...sigh). Still, director in place, 20th Century Fox and Walden Media cobbled together another Narnia adventure, and the results were predictably terrible.

Honestly, I wish I hadn't expected a poor film going in. Because this film not only met but exceeded my expectations of terrible, and it's not because I was pre-judging it. It's because it was simply that bad. The plot is nonsensical, randomly shunting characters from one loosely-connected vignette to the next, with hokey dialogue and dire predictions of eeeevil standing in for actual menace or intrigue. It's a shaggy dog road trip story, waterlogged on a boat, and I found myself half an hour in wishing desperately that the characters would all get scurvy and die.

The plot's so thinly-sketched that I may as well not even try to recount it here, but it has something to do with two of the kids from previous films being once again pulled into Narnia at absolute random, with no thematic or plot reason for any of the nonsense in the first place. Once there, our cast is rounded out with their exceptionally annoying cousin, and despite no one knowing quite what's going on, they stumble upon the titular character of the second film, Prince Caspian, and join him on his completely random quest to recover seven old friends of his long-dead father who disappeared for some reason, and no one knows why. So they fight an island made of evil. Good wins, evil is defeated, the end. Please, let it be the end.

Listen: I love fantasy. I love science fiction, I love horror, I love all of the outré genres, the fantastic, the unreal. It fascinates me, and I love wrapping myself in the trappings of the genre like a favored blanket, letting their comforting warmth wash over me in waves of escapism and nostalgia. But this half-assed bunch of hokum had me rolling my eyes, with the stilted dialogue and the hastily-sketched characters and the nonsensical plot and the ARGH it's too much.

The icing on this crap cake was the ham-handed, in-no-uncertain-terms Christian allegory with which the film beat the audience over the head with all the grace, power, and strength of an industrial-size sledgehammer. Yes, the evil was SIN. And Aslan is JESUS. Who exists as a lion in an alternate universe or something, apparently. Who pulls children into this alternate universe at random for...no apparent reason whatsoever (the film explicitly states that it's ""to know Him (Aslan i.e. Jesus, in case you didn't already pick up on that) better,"" but if that's the case, why just these four kids? What's the thematic point of this? Why were the elder kids now judged worthy of not having watery allegory poured down their throats again? What did these kids learn at the end of this film that made them better people?

ARGH again. I cannot even begin to catalogue the problems with this series, from either the internal ""logic"" of the series or the external logic of the human brain. Doing so only hurts my head.

Remember how I said the second film in the series lacked the ham-fisted Christian allegory of the first? Well, 20th Century Fox apparently recognized the church-going demographic was what made the first film such a success, and had them ramp up the religious content from ""allegory"" to ""explicit yelling at the audience and rubbing its nose in it like it's a puppy who peed on the carpet."" This sentiment struck me as wholly insincere, a manufactured ""message"" shoehorned in by a film studio who wanted nothing more than to reap the box office rewards of the first film which felt, though unsubtle, genuine in its intentions.

I've seen films more poorly shot, more poorly acted, more poorly assembled. But this boring, useless, preachy slog with no purpose or point had me at the absolute end of my rope. Rare is it that I sit in a darkened theater constantly looking at my watch, biding my time, aching for the dross on the screen to end so that I simply don't have to endure it anymore. But that's exactly what happened with this film.

Before anyone jumps on the obvious point of attack, let me say in no uncertain terms that I am Christian. But (and this is an exceptionally important point) just because a the message of a particular film/book/song/etc. is Christian doesn't make the work inherently good. Nor does criticism of the work in some way equal an anti-Christian sentiment. I often feel that works perceived as ""Christian"" get a free pass on quality because of their message, but quality doesn't work like that. Lowering one's standards results only in mediocre pablum like this continuing to be passed off for media conglomerates to make a quick, insincere buck. Do me a favor. If you've enjoyed these films, fine. I whole-heartedly disagree, but I'm certainly not going to tell you you're wrong for enjoying them. But I beg of you: Don't shut off the critical area of your brain just because something agrees with your worldview. Doing so is a disservice not only to yourself, but everyone else like you who has to suffer through trash like this. || Growing up in the Canada in the 70's and 80's, I fondly recall vastly enjoying an animated version of Lewis' 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' that was presented by Kraft on CTV. Now as a father of a son, I want to see with him the contemporary versions of the books I adored in my youth, though at present I greatly prefer the craftsmanship of cinema pre-1970.

It never bothers me in the slightest, to the ire of my more obsessive-compulsive cinephilic friends, seeing films of series with complete disregard to their order (one of my friends nearly had a heart attack, when he discovered I had watched 'Spider-Man 3' without having previously watched films 1 and 2--don't even get me started about the 'Harry Potter' series...), so, especially curious about how one of my favourite contemporary directors, Michael Apted, would do in the realm of big-budget, CGI-intensive fantasy filmmaking (I expected a fish-out-of-water, like Lord Richard Attenborough helming 'A Chorus Line'), I gave this a shot.

I enjoyed this more than 'Harry Potter' films I have seen, though it does stretch things from the literary works, but unfortunately, that seems to be the way things are, since film became less about artistry and more about business (just see at Toys R Us how many possible toys you can purchase, and similar commercial off-shoots, and I don't even consider this series a major player in this sort of area, because of its Christian undertones, which really doesn't mesh perfectly with selling tons of toys, though of course the realms aren't mutually exclusive, not by any stretch of the imagination). I think that Apted did a decent job, especially considering that yes, he is a fine director, but this isn't really his cup of tea. I distinctly feel that if these films are your comfort food, you won't be disappointed. I look forward to checking out the series' two preceding entries, and, though they left an opportunity for more films, which I believe wouldn't be from Lewis' works at all, it was a nice summation at its conclusion.

Finally, it was great to see (or at the very least, hear) Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson and Simon Pegg, they seem to be thrown in everything these days. I heartily salute their agents--they must have the very best in the business. || I wouldn't class this as a good or bad film, it's in a weird sorta in-between to me.

<em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'</em> is, comparatively, bad. It loses the vibe and all the intrigue that the first film has, as it continues the downward trajectory set by the other sequel. However, it's still just about got a decent adventure feel to it.

Only two of the youngsters reprise their roles 'properly', those being Georgie Henley (Lucy) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund). I'd always prefer a cast to remain the same, but if I'm honest this doesn't miss William Moseley (Peter) and Anna Popplewell (Susan) all that much. That argument is helped by the arrival of a young Will Poulter as Eustace. He's great.

Plot-wise is where it gets meh. I didn't care for it, even if I did like its swashbuckling nature. I can see many finding enjoyment with it, but for me it doesn't quite come out positively unfortunately - it's sluggish. The ship set also feels rather cheap.

Not at all a bad film; one that was interestingly made without the involvement of Disney, Walden Media joined up with Fox instead. I just couldn't find enough entertainment in it."

They've tackled adaptations (No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and remakes (The Ladykillers) before, of course, but even these films have borne the brothers' unmistakable mark of originality, their skewed vision of the world, and their cynical, sarcastic sense of humor.

What, then, to make of True Grit?

It's termed a re-adaptation of the original Charles Portis novel, a ""re-imagining,"" in the parlance of our time. One is hardly able to discuss the film without the spectre of John Wayne, however: the best-known adaptation of the book was one of the film legend's definitive roles, one of those cultural touchstones that rarely if ever are engineered. Discussion of that film invariably centers on Wayne and his performance: a washed-up, forgotten cowpoke that seemed tailor-made for Wayne to draw on his position at the time. A direct predecessor of Mickey Rourke and The Wrestler.

I'll admit that it was the Coens' pedigree that moved me to see this film. I've by nature little interest in Westerns, but despite producing a few lesser films (I'm looking at you, Burn After Reading), the Coens' sheer talent, along with the casting of Jeff Bridges in the John Wayne role, had me intrigued.

The story is simple and straightforward: The father of young Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is murdered by a two-bit criminal (Josh Brolin), and she takes it upon herself to see him brought to justice. To that end, she hires a reputedly ferocious US Marshal named Rueben ""Rooster"" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), while a prideful Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) tags along, hoping to bring the perpetrator to justice for a big reward.

And that's it, really. Completely absent is the trademark Coen plotting, convoluted subplots that twist and turn over onto themselves as though the script were one enormous Möbius strip (Möbius script?). Gone are the defiance of genre definitions, the satirical take on stories, the feeling of the brothers Coen peering through the camera lens at their subjects as though they're studying specimens in a jar. This is straightforward filmmaking, telling a simple tale with all the incredible talent and creative power the Coens command.

So what's not missing, then, are the richness of character, impeccable performances, beautiful cinematography and arresting score that are the other hallmarks of a Coen film. Attention is naturally centered on Jeff Bridges, having the audacity to take on one of the defining performances of one of the most famous actors ever. Bridges doesn't attempt to mimic Wayne. He crawls into this character and wears him like a suit. A hairy, shaggy, smelly suit. But Bridges inverts the typical presentation of such a character: instead of offering the audience with a cold, unfeeling badass whose heart is gradually thawed by the presence of a precocious youngster, this Cogburn is introduced as a shiftless layabout with a reputation who seems to have all but given up on such activities in favor of sleeping and boozing, the events of the film conspiring to scrape away that useless crust to reveal the force of nature beneath. Matt Damon, an actor who's never been in a Coens film before but seems as though he should have, also offers a great performance as the proud and buffoonish Texas Ranger LeBeouf, as do Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin in their short but effective appearances as heavies.

But the yeoman's work lies not on Bridges' grimy, slouched shoulders. Instead, our focus is on fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross, and the performance given by fourteen-year-old Hailee Steinfeld is, in short, one-of-if-not-the finest performance I've seen in quite a long time. Not content with giving such an incredible performance as a young teenager, this is, to boot, Steinfeld's first film performance. Steinfeld's Mattie Ross is smart, wily, mature, childish, scared, brave, and a force of nature in her own right. She has been wronged, she will see that wrong redressed, and nothing will stand in her way. An early scene in which she negotiates with a trader for horses and money is not only hilarious but revealing, one of the best character introductions in film history.

Such an unexpectedly straightforward film from the Coens deserves an equally straightforward judgment: I truly loved this film. There is so much greatness contained within it, from the powerhouse performances of Bridges and Steinfeld to the dark, touching, hilarious script, to Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography, to Carter Burwell's haunting score comprised of reorchestrations of classic hymns. It's one of the most perfect films I've ever seen. This is the second fantastic remake I've seen this year, the second to eclipse the original (the first being the superlative Let Me In). If you're wondering whether or not to see this film, wait no longer: go immediately to your nearest theater and buy a ticket. Speaking for myself: I can't wait to see it again. || Some people have said that this film followed the book better than the original one with John Wayne. I have not read the book but I must say that I did not feel that there was that much difference between the John Wayne version and this one. Sure, there was a difference in the details but the main elements was pretty much the same. There was an epilogue on the end which was a tad more sad, but certainly not misplaced, than in the original film.

I have to say that the film it was very good. Jeff Bridges was doing an excellent interpretation of Rooster Gogburn. I found him to be quite “John Wayne like” in this film which is perhaps why I liked it so much. || There's not much point in comparing this to John Wayne's version from 1969. In may ways it's similar - especially the dialogue - but in most it's a completely different telling of the story of the determined young ""Mattie"" (Hailee Steinfeld) whose father has been slain by ""Chaney"" (Josh Brolin) and who has now engaged the services of the curmudgeonly US Marshal ""Rooster"" (Jeff Bridges) to track him down. They are not the only folks looking for this man. ""LaBoeuf"" (Matt Damon) - a Texas Ranger - is also on his trail and so after a rocky start this trio set off in search of the man, now reportedly hooked up with the lawless ""Ned Pepper"" (Barry Pepper). What now ensues sees these three people, quite different in nature, spar and spat as they hone in on their quarry. Though I felt Damon rather underplayed the charismatic Texan, there's a solid effort here from Bridges who manages to imbue his character with a stubborn decency born out of experience and, I thought, a certain respect for this already well established role. The writing provides for some light-heartedness and Steinfeld delivers quite well too as the glue that holds the plot together as it builds to a menacing denouement that is altogether more plausible than the earlier iteration. The supporting cast chip in well too, with Dakin Matthews also quite entertaining as the hard-as-nails horse trader beaten into submission by her frequent references to a lawyer who can conquer all-comers. The photography grandly captures the scale of their trek and the beauty of their territory and there's a steady development of the story keeping the pace steady for just shy of two hours of this characterful adventure. It's not, for me, as good as the original - but it's a new look at the Western genre peppered with plenty of bile and bullets that works well."

It’s a sequel to a minor cult hit that arrived in theaters 28 years ago, a film more renown for its (at the time) state-of-the-art design than its coherent story or classic characters, rekindled now not as a reboot or remake, but as a direct sequel to that long-ago work.

Tron's esteem may have grown in the intervening years (much the same fate as another maligned-at-the-time science fiction film, Blade Runner), but time has been mostly unkind to it; Disney attempted to stage a run of pre-LEGACY screenings of the original film, but modern audiences greeted its dated appeal as unintentionally hilarious. Frightened by the impact this might have had on their $170 million spectacle, they pulled plans for a theatrical release, and whisked the recent 25th anniversary DVD off of store shelves. And so, bereft of a childhood that contained Tron, I went into the sequel with naught but a Wikipedia plot breakdown (which was, to be honest, frustratingly informative) to fill in what turned out to be largely irrelevant narrative gaps. I say that to say that I am reviewing Legacy solely for Legacy's sake, untainted by nostalgia or high expectations.

More than two decades after the events of the first film (which, for the uninitiated, involve a computer programmer [Jeff Bridges, reprising his role] being zapped from the physical world into the computer world he created and fighting an oppressive digital tyrant within), we’re introduced to that computer programmer’s twenty-something kid, heir to his father’s tech empire and not terribly happy about it. It seems he’s still hung up on his father’s mysterious disappearance long ago, and a mysterious message leads to him discovering Dear Old Dad’s secret underground lab, where he’s accidentally zapped into the digital world as well. I’m afraid I’m not spoiling anything to go ahead and say that within he finds his trapped father, and they must fight their way back out. To give more plot details would be unfair and pointless. Suffice to say that once within the digital realm, it becomes action beat after action beat wherein our young hero rescues dad and his requisite romantic interest until the film ends.

Oh sure, there are good guys, and there are bad guys, and there’s a token stab at depth, but what does it matter? That digital world looks really cool, right? And that’s why we go. The sad truth of the matter, however, is that what looks awesome in a two-minute trailer begins to wear on the eyes when presented long-form. “The Grid” exists in three colors: neon blue, neon orange, and black. Well, two colors and an absence of color, I suppose. As nifty as this may seem, two-plus hours of this (particularly at the reduced light offered by 3D projection) robs it of interest, and the whole thing becomes a dull slog. 3D works by enhancing depth, but little to no depth is present when the film is lit and shot in such a stylized manner. To boot, only the bad guys are orange. And as our audience proxy characters are good, we’re robbed even of the contrasting orange to break up the monotony.

There are some neat sequences, of course: the initial lightcycle battle, a digital dogfight later on, etc. Garret Hedlund and Oliva Wilde are perfectly fine in their frankly bland roles, and Jeff Bridges squeezes what depth he can into his dual characters (actual Kevin Flynn and his twenty-years-younger digital duplicate, thanks to some unnerving but nifty visual trickery). The film is far from the unwatchable dreck of, say, The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader. It’s just...not very interesting. Techno group Daft Punk’s score was easily the best part of the film, and something I’d actually recommend picking up with no hesitations. At its best, the Daft Punk score and stylized imagery (early in the film, before it wears you down) do provide a unique and imaginative experience. It’s just one fit for the length of a music video, not a feature film.

But let’s not kid ourselves: Tron: Legacy is a flashy, ridiculous spectacle that exists solely to put pretty pictures onscreen for two hours and drive a $4+ 3D surcharge. And I say that with no judgment. Some films simply are what they are, and you’ve no more right to expect a dog to meow than to glean from them deep meditations on the human condition. The history of cinema is full of this kind of shallow but aloofly entertaining distraction. But is it wrong to want more of these kinds of films? Take Star Wars, for instance: its strength lies mainly in its revolutionary aesthetic and special effects, but it’s the characters that we remember from the film, not just how cool some set-piece looked. And Lucas isn’t even a terribly good writer; the strength of his characters came from that universal pull all great archetypes have, that ability for audience identification and empathy. Will the name Sam Flynn have the same kind of longevity? What about...uh, Oliva Wilde’s character? Apparently not, at least for me. (Note: IMDb says it’s “Quorra.”) If nostalgia for the first film is strong for you, or you’ve no qualms about paying $14+ for a mildly-distracting if uninvolving experience, go for it. Everyone else may as well save themselves the money. Maybe catch it on Blu-ray.

I should note, though, that I can honestly say 3D added nothing to the experience, so if you want to be able to actually see in The Grid, save yourself the money and hop into a 2D seat. || A massive upgrade on the first film, at least for someone like me who certainly doesn't enjoy the 1982 production.

<em>'TRON: Legacy'</em> is much more vibrant, developed and tangible. I actually formed a connection with the characters in this one, which is the complete opposite to the original. The special effects (bar the de-aging) are a vast improvement, which is to be expected in fairness; I love the look of this.

It's nice to get a proper view into the 'outside' lives of the protagonists, rather than receiving a tiny backstory before shoving them into the new universe; I appreciated the build-up to the eventual entry. The score is also terrific, even if it's strange hearing Daft Punk's ""Outlands"" due to my familiarity of it coming from Sky Sports UK's Formula 1 opening credits.

Garrett Hedlund is great in the role Sam, I enjoyed his performance from the get-go. Jeff Bridges is excellent too, I feel all the actors in general were given much more to work with in this one; I barely took notice of Bridges (& Co.) in the predecessor, but he stands out big here. Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen are good, also. Cillian Murphy even makes a minute appearance.

It does, at least to me, feel like a very different film when compared to <em>'Tron'</em>, which may disappoint lovers of the latter but will be relief to opposing folk; e.g. me.

Wasn't sure what to expect from this, but thankfully it produces an entertaining time. || **Overall : Kosinski upgrades TRON in every way for a new generation with this stunning sci-fi adventure.**

Believe it or not, Top Gun was not the first franchise Joseph Kosinski revives with a legacy sequel over 30 years after the original. And just like Top Gun: Maverick, Kosinski did a masterful job bringing a series back to life. TRON: Legacy improved on its predecessor in every way. I remember seeing it in 3D IMAX and being completely blown away at the effects (although the de-aging effects are pretty dated but were impressive at the time), the soundtrack, the story, and the acting. Kosinski connected the past with the modern age by bringing back Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner while providing a story that engages and intrigues a new generation. I can't say I was a major fan of the original, but I loved this movie. This sci-fi adventure felt like the beginning of something incredible, but sadly Disney acquired Marvel shortly after the release of TRON: Legacy and shifted their focus to the MCU. Hopefully, after Kosinski's success with Top Gun: Maverick, the chances of a TRON 3 will be reignited because I am ready for more!"

It's the rom com equivalent to watching paint dry.  Everything about it draws enormous attention to what you would expect to be happening and not doing it.  Trust me, I understand that subversion of expectation is comedy, but there is a rate of diminishing returns on the repetition and duration of the joke, and if you play with that line, then you're writing a comedy for comedy writers because they are the only ones that are going to look at the movie / life as a punchline, and I don't think that is what they were going for.

There is an underlying theme of patience and adaptability: life will even out even in the roughest of situations, but the movie just sort of stops without even an epilogue, they're just literally and suddenly not there anymore.

I think there is a lot to get out of the movie, if you're strong enough to reach for it: a man who has everything but doesn't give you what you need isn't as good a man who has almost nothing and wants to give you what you need.  It's a counter argument to ""Nice guys finish last"".

No ups and downs. Everything goes as expected and, of course, we have a hopeful positive ending for the needs of the US viewer.

The cast is impressive and direction, cut and performances are OK. || The Company Men calmly reflects a recessive economic climate through a downsizing company. Financial stability is the sole craving in everyone’s life. The upper class. The middle class. Every class. The notion to which one will never encounter the fear of losing their personal possessions and their career position. Corporate employees specifically seek the solidity in their salaries, to be able to provide for their own pride and families. When the economic recession devastated the States last decade, its impact was critical. Innocent workers essentially lost their lives, driving themselves into the descent of debt.

Wells’ well-intentioned drama explores the collapse of a shipbuilding corporation, following various employees that have been made redundant and/or steering the metaphoric sinking ship. It’s an off-beat peculiarity that forces Wells’ direction to be enticing and inadvertently unappealing simultaneously. The characters themselves, particularly Marketing VP Walker, HR Manager Wilcox and CEO Salinger, are insufferably narcissistic. Walker especially who envelops himself in pride, given the immense financial loss he encounters that prevents him from fully supporting his family and being able to play at luxurious golf club houses. The response to his firing, whilst natural in the sense that he refuses to release the life that he leads, abnormally thinks more about himself than his family. The overwhelming aura of egotism, not just from him, constrains these characters to be unlikeable.

Yet the peculiarity in Wells’ execution is that, despite the vehement behaviour, there’s a sympathetic undertone throughout. Not because you relate to the characters, but the scenario instead. Wells delicately leaves several moments to hang, simmering on a bed of dismissal, that forces you to position yourself in the characters’ shoes. With that in mind, he manages to transform the unappealing characteristics of these employees and turn them into tolerable motives. Slowly but surely, through enduring perseverance, opportunities are tackled. And that’s exactly the purpose of The Company Men.

It illustrates the tenacity of the human spirit during uncertain times. The orienteering session being a prime example of depicting this motive. Anyone who has been in a situation such as redundancy will relate to this film for its situational representation, not for its characters. That’s no criticism on the acting though, as each performance is competently given without resorting to melodrama. Cooper in particular gave a nuanced and credible performance, that left his character’s fate somewhat unpredictable.

My main issue however is the scope of The Company Men. Instead of focussing on just one employee, Wells’ decided to explore the entirety of GTX’s corporate ladder. Whilst harmless for its narrative structure, it did downplay the severity of the recession. Almost making light of the national economic declination. Solely following one employee through this hard time would’ve produced greater character development whilst also tackling the recession from each angle. Wells’ intentions were clear, just didn’t entirely work for me on an emotional level. Fortunately Deakins’ cinematography consistently entranced with his beautiful autumnal shots, but that’s not surprising let’s be honest.

Much like precariously balancing on the corporate tightrope, The Company Men occasionally stumbles with its peculiar narrative and character choices yet seemingly gets the job done with assured performances and a heartfelt motive. Remember, remain positive even in the darkest of moments."

The idea being that he wants the killer to suffer and suffer and suffer, again and again, until his fear is as great as that of his victims, before he kills him.

I Saw The Devil is not without its faults; at almost two-and-a-half hours, it's too long, the brutal nature of the characters threatens to slide into absurdity especially when our killer takes refuge with a cannibalistic mate who doesn't mind his wife being raped (she doesn't mind, either; I guess your standards slip when your old man eats people for shits & giggles), and the concept of getting this serial rapist/killer to a point of sheer terror, like his victims - is flawed; this guy, as played by Min-sik Choi, is NEVER going to feel any fear. And so it is, by the end, rendering the whole catch/release premise redundant. That said, it's gripping, it's tense throughout much of the runtime, the lead performances are superb, it's astonishingly violent and gory, but it's meted out just right; more Seven than Saw, and it is photographed exquisitely. A serial killer movie bordering on torture porn, set in Korea in the snow, shouldn't logically have a colour palette this vivid, but every frame is just beautiful."

I cannot conceive of a pain stronger than that which a father or mother can feel when having to bury a child. No matter the causes of death, it must be as if the World, God or Fate, whatever, took away a part of us that we couldn't live without. I have to confess, honorable reader, that I have never been in a comparable situation. I can only imagine, and I honestly don't want to go through that, nor do I wish that on anyone. I am still young, and the closest person I saw go was a loving grandfather, whose memory is still with me. I suffered with that loss, and that certainty of never seeing him again, but I faced it peacefully, after all, none of us live forever and the elders leave first… it's the nature of things.

This film addresses, precisely, the mourning of a child and the way in which the parents, each in their own way, live this pain and try to find ways to digest it. The world and society almost force us to overcome this after a certain moment, and return to normality. But what normality? There will be “normality” for a parent after something like this? These are questions that deserve reflection and that the film leaves open. We see that couple look at things differently: the father want to keep their son's memory, wants to feel surrounded by his things and touch his objects as if a portion of his son were inside them; the mother prefers to get rid of that objects and even move, in an effort to go forward where anger and frustration are vented on a lot of people around her. To what extent is it pain, not love, that unites them as a couple?

For all this, I need to leave a note of warning, advising this film for people who have lost someone and are going through a grieving, or for people with depression or who are more negative. It's not an easy movie, it's one of those movies that squeezes where it hurts the most. It is based on a play that Nicole Kidman had the good idea of ​​taking to the cinema, and the script is by the same author of the play. Kidman brought the lead role to life with great skill, in a deeply psychological work, full of commitment and awarded with a nomination for an Oscar. Aaron Eckhart brought the heartbroken father to life in a poignant, heartfelt way, in one of the actor's most interesting works. The film also has the frankly positive collaboration of Sandra Oh, Tammy Blanchard, Diane West and Miles Teller.

The production wisely decided not to bet too much on big technical resources, giving the story and the cast's performance all the space needed to shine. Even so, I wanted to leave a note of praise for the cinematography, with a good shooting work, low contrast, a palette of cold or pastel colors and a very well done editing, which gave the film a slower pace that seems to be perfectly adequate. Without flashy visuals and sound, everything is elegant and discrete. The set of the couple's house is perhaps the most relevant, with the large, empty and almost impersonal spaces being, in practice, the mirror of a family that no longer exists, and of an increasingly distant couple."

Tucker & Dale Vs Evil follows two redneck hillbillies- Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) who head into the woods in the Appellation Mountains so that they can drink some beers, do some fishing and fix up a worn down cabin to turn it into the holiday home of their dreams.

At the same time a group of preppy college kids are on a camping trip into the same woods also to have a good time. After a couple of run ins with the hillbillies, they assume that they must be your stereotypical inbred manic chainsaw wielding killers right out of Deliverance or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So when one of the kids Allison (Katrina Bowden) is rescued from drowning by the hillbillies, prejudice and paranoia reign supreme with the others mistaking it as her being hauled away in a kidnapping attempt. So they embark on a mission to rescue her from her saviours with hilarious consequences.

Despite the premise of the movie being based on one long running joke of a massive misunderstanding, the story remains fresh and the scenes extremely funny for the majority. I'm not aware of any other movie that has done this type of role reversal with hillbillies in this type of scenario and managed to blend in the right amount of comedy with horror and gore. In fact across all the genres, it is not often that you get to see the perspective of the 'bad guys' (far from it in this film).

The best moments come from the writing as we follow the bickering between Tucker and Dale as a bromance emerges on screen. Both Tudyk (aka Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball) and Labine impress making the characters extremely likeable and charming so that by the end you really do care what happens to them. Bowden plays her part solidly as well and definitely brings some eye candy to the film!

Most of these types of films tend to lose their drama element but this keeps the anticipation and as I said, you end up really caring about what is going to happen to the characters. However, the only major fault that I can pick out is that despite all this, it does begin to fade as a spectacle in the last 15 minutes as they focus a bit too much on the back story and tying up loose ends when what they were doing up to that point was more than enough in my books.

It's usually hard to combine the right amount of comedy and horror without creating a somewhat tacky result so credit must go to the new guy on the block- director and co-writer Eli Craig. If you are looking for a unique comedy horror that has a chance of hitting cult status/settling in nicely behind Shaun of the Dead then you need look no further than this.

Tucker & Dale vs Evil is directed by Eli Craig who also co-writes the screenplay with Morgan Jurgenson. It stars Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine, Katrina Bowden and Jesse Moss. Music is by Michael Shields and Andrew Kaiser and cinematography by David Geddes. Plot has Tudyk and Labine as two harmless mountain/country men who head to their newly acquired vacation home in the woods to fix it up and get some R & R. But after a misunderstanding at a roadside store with some college kids, who think Tucker & Dale are hillbilly psychopaths, the wheels are set in motion for a bloody battle for survival, but who for?!

In 1996 Scream came slashing forward to inject witty life into a fading horror genre, with freshness and inventive splinters from the slasher formula, Wes Craven's movie rocked the horror faithful's world. Tucker & Dale vs Evil will not have the same impact, its limited release and low budget worth ensured it never had a chance of being a big thing, but still it's the freshest horror/comedy to have come out since Scream made its bloody bow at the box office.

It's such a simple idea at the core, you have to wonder why it wasn't thought of before? Craig and Jurgenson have flipped the age old Hillbilly Killers vs Preppy College Kids idea on its head, and in the process smothered it gleefully with dark humour, laugh out loud moments and inventive deaths. There's also some social comedy nestled nicely in the narrative, big points about first impressions and ideas of stereotypes, and hell yes! There's even an opposites attract arc - though that admittedly helps to bog the picture down as the central joke premise runs out of steam towards the end. In fact were it not for a relatively sloppy finale, this would surely be falling into sub-genre classic status. Thankfully all that comes before it is so full of vim and vigour, blood and bluff and fun and frolics, it's not hard to forgive the debut director his one misstep.

The neat trick is having the film unfold from the Hillbillies viewpoint, where the carnage that unspools gets increasingly difficult for them to explain, this in spite of their innocence. Each death is logical to the college kids who go on the attack when one of their number, they think, is kidnapped. And it's logical to us the audience as well, were it not for us being privy to these wonderfully funny sequence of events, we too would have them hung, drawn and quartered after a guilty verdict was reached in 10 seconds. This is the ultimate horror/comedy flip-flop movie. So many funny sequences light up the picture, with a chainsaw scene one of the finest moments to have ever graced a horror comedy movie, but the dialogue, too, is not found wanting in the fun and charming department. Cast are on top form, with Tudyk & Labine a most agreeable double act, where their comedy timing is impeccable, and Bowden & Moss are more than just pretty faces.

Craig (Sally Field's son) has started with a bang, if he can top this then he is a name to really get excited about. If he can't top it? Well he will at least always have one of the best horror comedy movies on his CV. Yes it's that good, fans of Scream, Severance, Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland should seek it out post haste. 8.5/10 || **Overall : a self-aware satire that takes joy in ridiculing overused horror movie tropes in hilarious and, at times, heartwarming ways.**

Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a delightful satire of stereotypical teens trying to survive an attacker in the woods horror movies. I laughed nonstop from start to finish. This dark comedy hilariously mocks horror trope after horror trope producing a wonderfully funny film that horror and cinema fans will most appreciate. Still, anyone who has ever seen a slasher movie would also find it entertaining and amusing. Even with its dumb fun, Tucker and Dale somehow finds a way to make you care for the main characters and root for their survival. This movie is a hidden gem for any movie fan."

You kinda feel as an amateur reviewer that you need to spell out that you have no affinity with a comic book/TV/film franchise. For the venom and bile that gets spewn by fans of said franchises when filmic adaptations don't meet expectations - can get quite scary at times!

The Green Hornet was released in 2011 and I remember how poorly it was received by the fans of the origin productions. Nothing new there in reality, Green Lantern, that was also released this same year, received the same treatment. So how does something like The Green Hornet stack up to someone who's just after a mindless couple of hours of high energy thrills and witty repartee?

Is it funny? Is it packed with action? Is it showcasing some nifty set pieces, some nifty set design and some bonkers escapism? Well the answer is yes to all of those. The writing away from the gags is nothing to get excited about (Cameron Diaz gets short shrift on the page), while if you have an aversion to Seth Rogen this is a film to make you choke on your own vomit, but to the standard super hero/crime fighting frolics fan, this has it all. Including Christoph Waltz having a great time as the villain and Jay Chou being simply wonderful.

Fart gun and disco santa, bromance and car carnage, delightful. Sorry Hornet purists, it's a riot. To me at least... 7.5/10 || My what a disappointment! I was kind of looking forward to this movie. I had read a few of the magazines as a kid and I think I might even have had a Green Hornet toy car. A masked hero with a martial arts expert and mechanical genius as his side kick and a really cool car. Not one of those ridiculous wimpy ones but a real old-fashioned American car having a large V8 engine with the proper sound and everything. So what could go wrong?

Well a lot! Half way through the movie I was wondering how bloody stupid the producer really thought the audience was. The bad guy was a total joke. Completely wacko in a very stupid way. Not fun at all. But the worst thing was that the hero, played by Seth Rogen, was even more stupid. He was nothing but a dumbass, loudmouthed, idiot throughout the entire movie. Even when he wasn’t directly screwing up just the fact that he was in the scene and opened his mouth was enough to ruin it.

And what about these ridiculous slow motion scenes with the targets flashing red just before some action taking place? The guys where not supposed to have real superpowers so stop making it look like they had for Christ sake! Seth Rogen had a part in writing the script as well and that was probably a huge mistake. Scripts should be left to professionals and not wannabe comedians. || Decent watch, might watch again, but I don't feel it's a confident recommendation.

I know it's based off a (1936) vigilante hero that actually pre-dates Batman (1939), and that means there is a long, rich history there, but....I don't care.  I'm not sure why it started, and I don't feel like researching it.

This movie, looks like it just lifted part of Seth Rogen's life and put a Green Hornet skin on it.  I'm sure he pays some asian guy to perform martial arts for him while he parties.  Jokes aside, it was nice to see Rogen hit his limit on a believable action front: which does involve someone else (in this case, Jay Chou)  doing most of the work.

Rogen fits right into the role of a spoiled, obnoxious party boy, but even though he's supposed to be the funny one, Jay Chou is just as funny with Cameron Diaz putting out some humor as well.

I'm clearly not a Seth Rogen fan, and I don't think I'm a Green Hornet fan: I'm realizing I'm not even a Batmobile fan just now.  I guess I'm not into cool cars, and a firefight is a firefight, having a gas gun isn't interesting.

All said and done, it's a good experience, there are just a lot of other movies, even ""super"" hero movies to watch before this."

Then again, I never really like it when my favorite actors die at the end of the movie. Also the CGI, especially at the end of the film, was of rather mediocre quality.

Anyway, on the whole it was a fairly nice medieval sword swinging fantasy/supernatural action flick and not at all as bad as the critics tried to make it but then I’m not really surprised that the critics are off-whack as usual. || ***Knights, crusades, black plague, witches, castles, foreboding forests and demons***

RELEASED IN EARLY 2011 and directed by Dominic Sena, ""Season of the Witch"" chronicles events when two ex-Teutonic Knight crusaders (Nicolas Cage & Ron Pearlman) traveling through Styria in modern-day Austria are enlisted to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the black death (Claire Foy) to a remote monastery in the mountains for trial and to hopefully stop the devastating plague. Stephen Campbell Moore (Debelzaq), Stephen Graham (Hagamar) and Robert Sheehan (Kay) accompany the Knights.

This is basically the American version of ""Black Death,"" a European film released around the same time. Both movies are dark, gritty and brutal in their depictions of Medieval Europe, but ""Season of the Witch"" is more of a stereotypical blockbuster with modish protagonists, amusing one-liners and CGI-laden climax. ""Black Death"" is deeper, more thought-provoking and realistic, which is why I give it the edge in overall value (see my review).

""Season"" is the more conventionally entertaining movie and anyone who appreciates Dark Ages-based flicks are highly encouraged to check it out. Films which come to mind include ""In the Name of the Rose"" (1986), ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005), ""Robin Hood"" (2010), ""Ironclad"" (2011), ""King Arthur"" (2004), ""Dragonslayer"" (1981), ""Red Riding Hood"" (2011), ""Tristan + Isolde"" (2006) and ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves"" (1991). It's as good, or better, than any of these.

The colorful Medieval cinematography (castles, dungeons, villages, dark forests and breathtaking mountains) is mind-blowing and the two protagonists are great with their amusing rapport. Furthermore, Foy is easy-on-the-eyes. Look out for a thrilling rope-bridge crossing à la ""Sorcerer"" (1977). Although the climax is over-the-top cartoony, the tone up to that point is quasi-realistic, similar to ""Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.”

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 35 minutes and was shot in Austria, Hungary and Croatia with reshoots done in Louisiana. WRITERS: Bragi F. Schut. ADDITIONAL CAST: Christopher Lee is almost unrecognizable as the plague-ridden Cardinal D'Ambroise.

GRADE: A-/B+
 || **A perfect example of how disrespect for the past and history can totally annihilate a film, even if it is fiction.**

I really enjoy watching period films. However, my work as a historian gives me some antibodies to these films, for reasons linked to the lack of ability to harmonize creative freedom and strict respect for the historical facts and period customs. So, it was with some curiosity that I decided to see this film. After seeing it, I just wanted to slap director Dominic Sena and screenwriter Bragi Schut. None deserve any respect for what has been done here. The film is an insult to historians… even if it is not deliberate!

The script is the film's biggest problem, with a writing that seems to glue together fragments of several different stories: we start with the Crusades, we follow two knights in several military episodes and then, somewhat brusquely, they turn their backs on the Church (supposedly) and leave, probably for their homeland. It turns out that, on the way, they come across the Plague, and there is a woman, supposedly a witch, who was arrested, accused of causing the disease. Now, it's up to them the task of escorting the so-called witch to a monastery where some friars will judge her, in the light of a book that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.

When you make a film with a historical background, at the very least, you should ask for the support of a consultant, someone who really knows History. No one should have the presumptuous arrogance to think they know everything, much less to take the public for an idiot, thinking that they will swallow everything that is shown to them! This film is an authentic case study in cinematic anachronism! How can the production admit the placement of clearly baroque decorative pieces in the midst of a medieval setting? How the hell can characters to disinfect their hands with alcohol if that was something totally unknown to medieval man? Since when is there a sea in Styria, if that ancient region is an inland part of present-day Austria and Slovenia? How can characters defect if this military concept simply didn't exist at the time?

And if these small questions seem serious, there is something much worse: the Crusades were an entire religious, political and military effort that involved Christianity for about 300 years, but that effort had practically ended decades before the Black Death, and much before the dates that the film uses for the fights where the characters take part. There were, in fact, no serious crusades in the 14th century. The Battle of Artah, which is shown in the film, took place two hundred years earlier, in 1105. Therefore, the film deliberately delayed the Crusades two hundred years, in order to almost coincide with the Black Death, and the characters could participate in both situations! It's absurd! Another thing that simply didn't exist in the Middle Ages was the notion of a witch hunt! Of course, for medieval man, the Devil was a threat, and of course there was a relationship between diabolical art and the works and studies of many scholars, alchemists or sages who contradicted the religious knowledge. But the so-called witch persecutions only began to be more notable in the 16th century, framed in a clerical response to the Reformation and to ideas (all of them) that endangered the dominion that the Church had over knowledge!

I pity Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman. They are actors I respect, and seeing them participate in such a poorly made film is quite unfortunate, given that they have talent and are, as far as I've seen, almost the only positive things to highlight. Even if everything had been done in a way that respects history, the end of the film is so unbelievably stupid that it would spoil any previous effort. The rest of the cast, except for the two names mentioned, do not stand out in any way."

The plot hooks you and the staging is impressive but the movie is not as thrilling as it could have been. || ***Better to die free than live under the shackles of communism***

""The Way Back"" (2010) takes place circa 1940-42 and details a group's mad escape from a Siberian gulag through the cold, desolate Soviet wilderness into Mongolia, across the great Gobi desert, through mountainous Tibet and ultimately freedom in India. The film was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' popular book ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,"" but not based on it.

After records of Rawicz' release from the gulag by the USSR in 1942 were unearthed the veracity of the book was called into question; others suggest that, although the circumstances of the story may not have happened to author Rawicz, they're apparently based on real events with real individuals, like Polish soldier Witold Glinski. 

Moreover, in light of the millions of prisoners carted away to Siberia during that time period, isn't it likely that a handful of them successfully escaped and had experiences similar to those shown in this movie (and the book) regardless of whether or not they made it all the way to India? In any event, director Peter Weir has plainly stated that the film is largely fictional and only inspired by the book, which may or may not be a true account.

The group's natural leader is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), not because he has any leadership charisma but simply because he spent half his life in the woods and KNOWS how to survive in such an environment. As Solomon said, ""A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength.""

Also along for the haul is a cynical American called Mister Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian hooligan named Valka (Colin Farrell), a comic accountant, an artistic pastry chef, a priest, a Pole with night blindness and a teen-aged girl named Irena, played by Saoirse Ronan, who incidentally celebrated her 16th birthday on the set.

This a story of survival. The group faces freezing nights, lack of food & water, bugs, death, the never-ending Gobi desert and the Himalayas, not to mention the inevitable moral questions that arise from such a life or death situation. Some have complained that the film involves too much walking, but that's the whole point: the film's about a 4000-mile escape on foot to freedom.

It drives home some powerful messages that will be pondered well after viewing:


•	The government in communistic or extreme socialistic states is a cold, uncaring, demonic machine that will immediately squelch dissidents through any measure possible, including torturous coercion, slander and execution.
•	Such godless governments are a vile social infection that spreads and must be escaped at all costs.
•	Is this socialistic disease now spreading to America? Of course it is and it’s been obvious for quite some time (the Dems).
•	Better to die free than live in a gulag (aka labor camp or reeducation camp) or under dictatorial socialistic governments.
•	No matter how bad it is, at least you don't have to live in a gulag.
•	Mongolians and Tibetans are people of true honor.
•	Saoirse Ronan is a precious young lady.

In addition, the film features a great score and spectacular locations, shot in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.

FINAL WORD: ""The Way Back"" is a must if you love survival stories like ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (especially the original version) or ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" as well as films like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Black Robe"" and ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan."" It's unique but it has the same general tone. Stay away if you have ADHD or solely relish films with conventional Hollywood plotting and roll-your-eyes BS, not that there's anything wrong with that, lol.

Amer is more about the visuals and mood than the story, and while some parts are really interesting, it doesn’t always keep your attention the whole time.

What stood out to me was how much effort went into making it feel like a classic giallo. The colors are super vibrant, and the editing is sharp and sometimes unsettling, with lots of close-ups and weird, creepy moments. Even when the story felt slow, the way it looked and sounded kept me watching. The soundtrack is awesome too, with music from legends like Ennio Morricone and Stelvio Cipriani, which makes it feel even more like a proper tribute to the genre.

It’s not the kind of movie you watch for a strong plot. It’s more about creating a certain feeling and exploring themes like sex and sensuality. If you’re into this style of film, it’s worth checking out."
