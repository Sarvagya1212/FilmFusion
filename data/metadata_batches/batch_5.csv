<em>'Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar'</em> doesn't have anything to it and is just barely strung together to form a plot. I didn't enjoy it, mainly as the film gave me no reason to. It has the usual questionable animal welfare from this era, while there is hardly any acting involved.

Rex Allen does an OK job with narration, but the likes of Ron Brown and Brian Russell fail to bring anything to the table in terms of the human performances in this. The animals are naturally cute, but the earlier mentioned questions constantly arise when they are onscreen.

As with the Disney films that preceded this in <em>'The Legend of Lobo'<em> and <em>'Nikki, Wild Dog of the North'</em> and the ones that followed in <em>'King of the Grizzlies'</em> and <em>'A Tale of Two Critters'</em>, this is a film that I found tedious to watch.

I would be rating this higher if it had been a 70-85 minute run time, that would've been perfect. I will say, from start-to-finish, the film is superb visually.

Charles Martin Smith is very good as Tyler, he also does a grand job with the narration; the dialogue for which is excellent. This is a lot better than Disney's other wild animal style productions, this is probably what they were aiming for in the likes of <em>'The Legend of Lobo'</em> etc.

It just ends, at least for me, in a disappointing manner. With that stated, it still rounds off to be classed as a film I liked - just with a hint of what could've been."

It was the year of two Mars based movies, with the other being Red Planet, of Pitch Black and the chaotic history that produced the Supernova. Plenty of sci-fi around but sadly few decent offerings.

Mission to Mars is a film you can see had good ideas on the page, some brainy and emotion based narrative threads. Effects work is OK for the era, while there's a very impressive cast put together to tell the story. Yet the script stinks to high heaven, the surprises are as absent as Martians are, while the steals from previous sci-fi movies grate on the nerves. The odd sequence has quality about it (dancing in space, woo-hoo, storm attack, yay), while the finale - all be it still a steal - is well constructed and further proof that someone somewhere had the kernel of a good story idea, but it's laborious trite and devoid of the basic film principals - to entertain and engage.

So many things wrong here, so much so the names of all involved have been spared. Join this Mission to Mars at your own peril. 4/10 || When a mission to explore the red planet goes wrong, stranding ""Luke"" (Don Cheadle) alone on this hostile world, his colleagues ""Woody"" (Tim Robbins), ""Jim"" (Gary Sinese), ""Terri"" (Connie Nielsen) and ""Phil"" (Jerry O'Connell) put huge pressure on their boss to let them take the spare rocket ship and head to the rescue. After a minimum of persuasion, off they go and are soon in sight of the planet and of an anomaly that is defying their instruments and their instincts. They land, discover their friend is alive and well and that there is a strange construction on the planet that needs investigating. Sense might dictate they go home and return to proceed in greater numbers but there's no taming the inquisitiveness of mankind and, well, the action starts to heat up. To be fair, this film looks very good and the use of visual effects and the spaceship interiors are complementary rather than overwhelming. The dialogue, well that's another story - it's pretty poor from start to finish and the plot itself is fairly derivative (and a bit repetitive, too). The acting is really only adequate, but Brian De Palma does manage to engender a sense of camaraderie amongst his astronauts and a workable sense of menace as the plot develops. Jeopardy? No, not really. Of course some of the crew are going to end up Martian toast and I found the science a little bit implausible as we advance. As a throw-away sci-fi adventure film this works fine and passes two hours effortlessly. If you are looking for anything more cerebral and/or original then perhaps not... || Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars (2000) delivers an engaging space exploration adventure that still holds up as a fascinating depiction of outer space, especially given the limited technical knowledge available at the time. While it may not be flawless in its execution, the film does a commendable job of portraying the challenges and mysteries of space travel.

The performances, particularly from Gary Sinise and Don Cheadle, are standout elements. Their characters bring depth and emotion to the story, grounding the film's high-concept premise with human connection. The storyline is another highlight, offering a plot that’s unpredictable in true De Palma fashion. The layers of mystery and the well-written underlying message keep the audience invested throughout.

The script may not be perfect, with some moments feeling a bit thin, but it works well in service of the overall narrative. Combined with De Palma’s direction, the dialogue and pacing help to maintain the film’s emotional and intellectual impact.

Mission to Mars is a movie for those who appreciate science fiction with a thoughtful touch. Its visuals, strong performances, and engaging plot make it a memorable exploration of both outer space and the human spirit. Even after all these years, it’s a film that remains enjoyable to revisit"

He is an unscrupulous, but knowledgable, New York rare book dealer who is charged by the millionaire Frank Langella to authenticate a text. ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"" may or may not be able to summon the devil - or, at least, bestow the owner with some semblance of Satanic power. His search for the truth involves deceit, lust, many murders and a cat and mouse game with deadly consequences. Emmanuelle Seigner is suitably enigmatic as ""the girl"" - a sort of angelic person with ninja skills and Lena Olin hams it all up nicely as the sex-kitten (with claws) baddie. I enjoyed this; it is a complex supernatural thriller that doesn't try to impress with cheap special effects (though the music can be a little annoying at times); it's well written with a strong cast. At 2½ hours, however, it is too long; there are plenty of establishing shots that could have been trimmed/dumped to up the pace a bit more."

The son of a working class family in Bloomington (Christopher Dennis) is obsessed with Italy and bicycling as he hangs with his three “cutter” buds (Dennis Quaid, Jackie Earle Haley and Daniel Stern). He deals with his amusing parents (Paul Dooley and Barbara Barrie) while chasing a college lass (Robyn Douglass). Everything leads to the Little 500 bicyclist race at Indiana University. 

“Breaking Away” (1979) wisely focuses on the characters rather than bicycling and is comparable to “Dead Poets Society” from a decade later. It’s a coming-of-age drama with lighthearted bits, but it’s definitely not a comedy, as I’ve seen it wrongly designated.

It’s about young people facing the rest of their lives just after high school and trying to figure out what they’re going to do with their lives. I can relate because, when I was 19, I spent the entire summer bicycling the landscapes. The longest day-trip I took was 60 miles. I was starting to think I was hot stuff until I met a fellow cyclist the next day who was traveling across several states.

The scriptwriter graduated from Indiana University in 1965 and drew from his experiences there for the story. The protagonist was modeled after David K. Blase, who had an Italian fixation and led his team to victory in the Little 500.

It runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Bloomington, Indiana, as well as nearby highway 37 (due south of there).

Had nothing to do with the movie, I just remember it to this day so I'm rambling about it.

Really though, it has a message, there is a moral to the story, but you aren't watching it for that. And when I was 11 or 12 I didn't record it for that. No, you're watching it because Albert Brooks is pretty funny and the film seems quirky and light hearted.

And, honestly, it delivers. It's one of those increasingly rare films that announces what kind of movie that it is, makes promises for a happy ending, and delivers on it. There aren't really any surprises, you assume how the movie is going to end before you even sit down to watch it, and you're only really watching it in the first place because you feel the need to see that kind of story.

The story centres on basketball coach “Dale” (Gene Hackman) who takes over a third rate school team in Indiana. Their team spirit is pretty non existent but there are spirits a-plenty going down the throat of the enthusiastic “Shooter” (Hopper) whose son plays for the team and who isn’t the worst tactician - but is never sober often or long enough to consistently make much odds. With a team that couldn’t beat an egg and a deputy who can barely stand up, we now set off on a fairly standard story from a 1950s United States where opportunities were thin on the ground and sport could offer a way out for many. Hackman is fine, but not really anything more as we discover his character’s baggage and demons; Barbara Hershey tries to impose herself but her “Myra” has little to get her teeth into and Oscar nominated or not, I just didn’t take to Jerry Goldsmith’s confused score that was half Vangelis and half AOR. Even if you didn’t know the actual history upon which this is based, it’s an easy guess and that very procedural nature of the drama robs it of much jeopardy, even as the simulated match action takes place. It’s a motivational feel-good film and ought to be shown to illustrate to kids that winning is important, but not so much as the team-building aspects of sport that only work if everyone playing can rely on everyone else.

Thus I came across this film, which I had on DVD forever. It'll interesting to watch the recent documentary on the character Pacino portrays, 'The Dog'--just found out about it earlier today. I loved Lumet's films he made before this that I've seen--'12 Angry Men', 'The Fugitive Kind', 'The Hill', 'The Anderson Tapes' and 'Murder on the Orient Express'--and he's superb at getting the gradual self-destruction of his characters that just seethes through the screen.

At this point, Pacino could do no wrong in his work--he had that firm grasp on his immense talent and just what he needed from it to do remarkable work, some of the finest characterizations in contemporary cinema. Do both he and yourself a favour and don't bother with anything he's made since 'Heat'. || **A good film, but not as memorable as some people say.**

Director Sidney Lumet created this film based on a true incident that is still the subject of study by police cadets today: a homosexual who decides to rob a bank to pay for his partner's sex change, but who takes the manager and the employees as hostages when things get complicated, and desperately tries not to be killed or arrested by the policemen, who surround the place and try to control a maddened crowd, who are not sympathetic to the authorities. The film was made and released in 1975, and it could not be more appropriate to the time in which it was made: the great decade of civil disobedience, of challenge to authorities and the affirmation of the gay movement.

I confess that I'm not quite aware of the real incident behind the script. For that reason, I prefer to focus on this very well done dramatization. In addition to the design of sets and costumes, and an intelligent choice of the filming location, the cinematography is very well executed, and the film has very good visual qualities. The pleasant pace is reasonably fast at first, but slows down midway through, perhaps emulating the back and forth of negotiations between the authorities and the clumsy robbers. And if history is a mirror of its time, the same can be said of the dialogues, where swear words are used with a liberality previously unthinkable.

Although many consider this film a must-see, I honestly disagree. It's a must-see for fans of Al Pacino or Lumet, it will certainly be a good suggestion for a 70s film cycle, but that's basically it. It's a pretty good film, but it can hardly be classified as memorable. Al Pacino is a great actor and is experiencing a particularly happy moment in his career when he makes this film, but I have to recognize that he made several better films, before and after. Just think of “Godfather 3”, “Scent of a Woman” or “Devil’s Advocate”, to name a few. John Cazale is good in a more understated role, and Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon both deserve praise for a job well done."

Just when you think one's all right, he turns legit.

Out of MGM, The Asphalt Jungle is directed by John Huston and based on the novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett. It stars Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Teresa Celli, and in a minor but important role, Marilyn Monroe. Miklós Rózsa scores the music and Harold Rosson photographs it in black & white. Plot sees Erwin ""Doc"" Riedenschneider (Jaffe) leave prison and quickly assemble a gang to execute a long in gestation jewellery heist. However, with suspicion rife and fate waiting to take a hand, the carefully constructed caper starts to come apart at the seams.

John Huston liked a tough movie, having given film noir in America a jump start with The Maltese Falcon in 1941, he also that same year adapted W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra. Burnett also had on his CV crime classic stories Little Caesar & Scarface, so it's no surprise that Huston was drawn to The Asphalt Jungle. As it turned out, it was a match made in gritty urban heaven.

The Asphalt Jungle was one of the first crime films to break with convention and tell the story from the actual side of the criminals. Where once it was the pursuing law officers or private detectives that were the heavy part of the plotting, now under Huston's crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminals, villains and anti-heroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters, and yet they have a common bond, for they each strive for a better life. Be it Hayden's luggish Dix, who dreams of buying back his father's horse ranch back in Kentucky, or Jaffe's Doc, who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls - it's greed and yearning that binds them all together - With alienation and bleakness, in true film noir traditions, featuring heavily as the plot (and gang) unravels.

With gritty dialogue and atmospherically oozing a naturalistic feel, it's also no surprise to note that Huston's movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good, some bad, but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence in this. Fabulous in its authenticity, and with that out of the way, it then sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the ""gang"", including their respective women (Hagen, Monroe & Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie), we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either! This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate, and closing with a finale that is as perfect as it gets, this is a top line entry in what is the most wonderful of film making styles. 9.5/10"
3114.0,The Searchers,"As a Civil War veteran spends years searching for a young niece captured by Indians, his motivation becomes increasingly questionable.",He had to find her... he had to find her...,Western,119,1956-05-16,en,7.704,1478,2.9745,"John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond, Natalie Wood",John Ford,"brother, native american, uncle, racist, prejudice, racism, massacre, desert, cavalry, reverend, comanche, technicolor, civil war veteran, abduction","What makes a man to wander?

Upon returning from a trip out to find cattle thieves, Ethan Edwards finds his brother and sister-in-law murdered by Comanches and their two daughters missing. Driven by a hatred of Indians, and a motive of some determination, Edwards and his part Indian companion set off to find the missing girls - it's a perilous journey that will span many years.

The Searchers is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, in fact it's one of the finest pictures all told ever made. Its reputation as such is most definitely warranted, directed and photographed with almost peerless precision, The Searchers stands tall as a triumph of cinematic achievement. Plot wise the piece is really very basic, based on a novel by Alan LeMay, its revenge/hatred driven pursuit theme is one that will forever be trundled out to gather easy Hollywood coin, but with director John Ford pulling the strings on this picture, this is cloaked with a beauty that belies the bleakness of the main protagonist's driving force. As a character driven picture it's something of a flag bearing lesson for all other directors to make note of, for the thematic heart of it lays with Ethan Edwards (superbly played by John Wayne), an embittered man that incredibly, in spite of his evident bile, manages to keep the viewer from hating him due to the complexities of his make up and the surrounding sprawl of the American West.

The film is bookended by brilliant shots from open doorways, with both sequences impacting to almost steal the breath away, yet these are merely the crusts of an incredibly delicious sandwich. Many scenes here could be framed as pictures to define the classic Western, with Ford making the Monument Valley location one of the best Western characters to have ever graced the screen. Rolling hills and dusty odd shaped rocks are given impetus by scorching reds and oranges that themselves are aided by the everlasting fold of a vividly potent blue sky, all of it dwarfing the characters as Ford adroitly weaves the Civilization versus Wilderness thread. This is a film that positively begs repeat viewings, where each subsequent viewing brings further insights into character dissections and a lyrical lesson in racial indifference, all played out with almost hauntingly poignancy by Max Steiner's memorable score.

Back in the day the film never won any awards, presumably because the racist core of the film had many twitching in their beds, or maybe because the film doesn't rely on dialogue to make its points? (the body language and facial acting here is quite brilliant). Perhaps some just wanted a basic Western of shoot outs and shallow characters that barely have time to show some heart? Either way, what we do now know is that The Searchers is revered across the globe and often hits the best of lists formed by those with a very keen interest in cinema. Maybe it's only one for those willing to invest and observe it on numerous occasions? I am of course but a mere mortal film fan for sure, but really I feel this film is as good an experience as a film fan could have, technically and thematically the piece has few peers, it's a true American masterpiece. 10/10 || _**Overrated Wayne Western with a young Jeffrey Hunter**_

Released in 1956 and directed by John Ford, ""The Searchers"" chronicles the story of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) who returns from the Civil War to his brother's ranch in the Southwest; and to his brother's wife, whom he secretly loves. After the ranch is raided by Comanches, Ethan and his 1/8 Indian nephew (Jeffrey Hunter) search for the band of Indians to get his captive niece back (Natalie Wood). As time passes and the niece assimilates with the Natives it's not certain if Ethan intends on rescuing the girl or killing her.

Touted as a masterpiece and one of the greatest Westerns, I've seen ""The Searchers"" twice now and was disappointed each time. Sure, the Monument Valley locations are breathtaking and the cast is great, but the story leaves a lot to be desired. The plot's excellent, but the way the story is told isn't interesting and so there's very little momentum. On top of this we get sequences, characters and dialogue that seem to be stabs at amusement, which (1.) aren't funny, (2.) are awkward because the main story is a serious drama/adventure in a Western context, and (3.) make some of the characters out to be dimwits (note to the writers: just because someone lives in the wilderness it doesn't automatically make them doofuses).

Give me ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""The Alamo"" (1960), ""North to Alaska"" (1960), ""True Grit"" (1969), ""Chisum"" (1970), ""The Cowboys"" (1972) and ""Rooster Cogburn"" (1975) any day over this mediocre Western. Heck, I'll even take ""The Comancheros"" (1961), ""El Dorado"" (1966), ""The War Wagon"" (1967), ""Rio Lobo"" (1970), ""The Train Robbers"" (1973) and ""The Shootist"" (1976).

The movie runs 119 minutes and was shot in Arizona, Utah and Colorado.

GRADE: C- || **An interesting film, very well made, but with a weak script.**

This is one of those old Western movies where the cowboy figure is glorified as the epitome of the common American hero, the women are helpless youths waiting for a gunslinger to keep them safe, the West is a lawless land where everyone does their own thing. whatever and the natives – in this case, the Comanche – are true terrorists, whom it is lawful to persecute and kill because they commit serial atrocities.

I'm not going to get into any thoughts about the moral of the film or how it views not only Native Americans but women as well. Nowadays, there is no shortage of moral police officers to rewrite books, defend “more inclusive” neutral languages, throw statues of historical figures into the mud for having done or said something that was not to the liking of “political correctness”. I am not like that, and I condemn anyone who is like that. Therefore, I want the introduction of this text to serve as a mere prophylactic warning of what the film is: a film made in the 1950s by people with the same and natural mentality of that time. A normal film, made according to the mentality of its time, and which we have no right to arbitrarily criticize.

John Ford did an excellent job as director and gives us a very elegant film that stands out, essentially, for its artistic aspects. Cinematography is worthy of study at any school of film arts, with magnificent lighting, a palette of bright, vibrant and somewhat cheerful colors, and an exquisite use of sets, costumes and filming locations. By the way, the sets and costumes are also good and give us what we can expect in a Western film (and the best thing is not to expect great historical rigor because that was a minor concern at the time). In addition to all this, we have a heroic soundtrack that harmonizes well with the film.

In the cast, the figure of John Wayne is unavoidable. He's not even close to an artist that I really appreciate, but he has undeniable charisma, and he's in good shape here. Jeffrey Hunter also gives us an interesting job, but much inferior to that of Wayne while, when it comes to female faces, we can only positively mention the effort, almost heroic, of Vera Miles, in a film that did not consider the female characters.

Where this film really gets lost is in the Franciscan poverty of its script. The story is more than lukewarm, it never really captivates us, and it just seems like a gigantic excuse for a cavalcade full of fights between Indians and cowboys."

Retired sea Captain James McKay (Gregory Peck) arrives in the sprawling land of the West to marry fiancée Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker). With an amiable, almost pacifistic approach to life, McKay confounds the ranchers he is now mixing with. Particularly the Terrill ranch foreman Steve Leech (Charlton Heston) who takes an immediate dislike to him. Not only that but it seems that James has landed right in the middle of a family rivalry between the Terrill's and the Hannassey's: just as it's about to fully ignite into war. 

Directed by William Wyler (Ben-Hur/Mrs. Miniver), The Big Country is adapted from a short story called Ambush at Blanco Canyon that was written by Donald Hamilton. Beautifully photographed by Franz Planer on location at the Red Rock Canyon in Mojave, California and at the three-thousand acre Drais ranch in Stockton, the film is epic in many ways. Though the story, with its twin themes of violence begets violence and you don't have to act tough to be tough, is a thin one, it's given such an operatic make over by Wyler that it's not hard to be swept away by it all. Helped enormously by the afore mentioned Planer, music composer Jerome Moross, and an impressive and on form cast (Heston in superb tough guy mode and Burl Ives delivering a Oscar winning performance as head Hannassey patriarch Rufus), it's a big production in many ways. 

Overall, The Big Country sees a small story made big as it's told in an astutely classic style. With memorable acting, gorgeous scenery, big music and notable moments of action (a fist fight between Peck & Heston alone is epic and apparently took three days to get right) it's a must see for the Western enthusiast. 8/10 || Gregory Peck (""McKay"") is a well off, retired, sea captain who arrives to marry his fiancée ""Pat Terrill"" (Carroll Baker) and finds himself amidst the mother of all turf wars between her father ""Major Terrill"" (Charles Bickford) and his arch rival ""Rufus Hannassey"" (Burl Ives) and his disparate sons. Add to the mix, quite a bit of rivalry from Charlton Heston (""Leech"") who is the Major's right hand man, and a man who has designs on ""Pat"" and finally Jean Simmons who own the ""Old Muddy"" - the river that both are essentially fighting over and we've got a great recipe for a top class action adventure. It has the greatest of cinematography, a score that you instantly recognise and performances - especially, I felt, from Ives that really do resonate - they engender a sense of just how tough, dangerous, uncompromising and beautiful life for these pioneers must have been. Also how civilised it could be with men of honour and principle prepared to stand their ground - however misplaced that might have been. It's well written, with potent, occasionally sparse dialogue and William Wyler is on top form bringing the big country to the big screen; the bigger the better...."

Marshall",John Guillermin,"world war ii, bridge, soldier, explosion, thoughtful, dramatic, commanding","The Amazing Story of March 7, 1945.

The Bridge at Remagen is directed by John Guillermin and collectively adapted to screenplay by William Roberts, Richard Yates and Roger O. Hirson from the book The Bridge at Remagen: The Amazing Story of March 7, 1945. It stars George Segal, Robert Vaughn, Ben Gazzara, Bradford Dillman and E.G. Marshall. A Panavision/ De Luxe Color production, music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Stanley Cortez.

Film is a fictionalised account of the battle for control of The Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine during the tail end of World War II.

A war film that’s rich with action and no little intelligence as it views the battle equally from both sides of the warring factions. The bridge is crucial to the war effort to both sides, but for different reasons, here the narrative is a little complex so total investment in the dialogue is strongly recommended. The characterisations are high quality, even if the war is hell weariness of the American soldiers had been done many times before in other notable war movies. Guillermin thrusts the psychologically hurt soldiers into desperate combat situations, from which we the viewers indulge in seeing the survival of the fittest. A  sweeping score from Bernstein, gritty looking photography by Cortez, and a cast giving good turns, rounds this out as a thoroughly enjoyable World War II picture. 7/10 || _**Sorta obscure WW2 flick from the late 60s with George Segal and Robert Vaughn**_

As the Allies are about to invade Germany in March, 1945, the Germans decide to blow up the last bridge on the Rhine in the area of Oberkassel, but a dissenting general (Peter van Eyck) convinces a major (Robert Vaughn) to keep it up as long as possible so troops can escape Germany. On the American side George Segal plays a lieutenant, Ben Gazzara a sergeant and Bradford Dillman their commander.   

""The Bridge at Remagen"" (1969) is a WW2 film loosely based on real-life events similar to the later “A Bridge Too Far” (1977), but with a lesser cast, albeit more streamlined and colorful, like the contemporaneous “Castle Keep,” but less artsy and more straightforward. It may not be great like “Where Eagles Dare” (1968) or near-great like “Kelly’s Heroes” (1970), but it’s solid and fills the bill if you’re in the mood for WW2 movie from the European theater. 
     
The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in Davle & Most, Czech Republic (the river is the Vltava). Filming was interrupted by the Soviet invasion of August, 1968, wherein Cast & crew were taken to safety via a convoy of 28 taxis. The film was completed in Hamburg, Germany, and various Italian locations. The film unit was amusingly accused by the Soviets & East German press of smuggling weapons into the country, supposedly being a cover-up for the CIA.

Stanley Kramer and John Paxton adapt from Nevil Shute's novel. Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire, Anthony Perkins and Donna Anderson star, with music by Ernest Gold and cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno.

After a global nuclear war, the inhabitants of Australia realise that the radiation clouds are heading their way. A group of people try to come to terms with this fact.

A well regarded film by the critics, and lauded by the makers at the time as an important and potent piece of cinema, On the Beach is still a film that's not for everyone.

The star appeal holds weight, though much of the narrative is tired and weary, trite and cheesy. In fact Shute himself was less than happy with what Kramer made of his literary source, the director in his element with a message movie.

If it was Kramer's intent to make the viewers also feel like what it's like waiting for death? Then he achieved it, while Gold's overuse of Waltzing Matilda in his musical score also ends up boring the senses. 4/10 || Well acted story with an obvious anti-war theme, written during the cold war provided an interesting portrayal of how different people may react facing  impending doom. Fearful, Angry, Fatalistic.
It developed feelings for the characters as they dealt with the situation each in their own way. 
Overall, at the end, there was a sadness that prevailed and led one to contemplate the possibility of this occurring. That is the success of the film and the book that inspired it, to create an atmosphere against nuclear war. I saw this film in the 1960's and enjoyed it immensely and read the book because of it. Watching it again as an adult I understood it with a 
different point of view and enjoyed it more.
for what it is worth, I would recommend this film highly, not only for the great story, but also to enjoy the performance of truly talented professionals."

Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. On 24 September 1964, the President's Commission on the Assassination was presented to Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, presenting the results of the official Government investigation.

_JFK_ follows New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) as he form his own alternative investigation, culminating in the trial of businessman Clay Shaw (Robert De Niro) on 29 January 1969 for conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy. This is, to date, the only trial to have been brought for the assassination of President Kennedy.

As political dramas go, _JFK_ is aimed at the truly hardcore fans. With its three hour runtime, the first two hours of the film are spent delving into the background of Kennedy's death and setting up the plausibility of the ""alternative"" scenario. It is important to remember that this is, ultimately, a propaganda film and whether you believe the events or not, it differs from the official Government narrative.

For a newcomer to the events of 22 November 1963 - which I was - this extended setup is simultaneously extremely helpful and mentally exhausting, and it is difficult to keep both awake and aware, so approaching the film with some knowledge - even of the Government narrative - is beneficial.

However, the final act of the film is extremely compelling watching, featuring Costner delivering a famous soliloquy that undoubtedly helped to influence later courtroom dramas, such as A Few Good Men and Amistad, as they pitch one man against the Government.

While _JFK_ was - rightly - nominated for a number of Oscars, including Best Picture and De Niro as Best Supporting Actor, and won Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it is difficult to feel that Costner was inexplicably overlooked as he singlehandedly carries the final act.

Extremely dry, but immensely compelling. You will question what you have just witnessed. || It's all the more fascinating to watch this again in 2021, almost sixty years on, when the office of the US Presidency is still mired in conspiracy and controversy. This film deals with Louisiana District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his almost obsessive quest to prove that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963 was a concerted effort by rogue elements in the American establishment - government, military and industry - to avert his withdrawal from Vietnam and ensure billions of dollars continued to line the pockets of many a vested interest. Oliver Stone has amassed a creditable cast to illustrate the developing theorem postulated by Garrison - despite personal and professional threats - that proves both compelling and interesting to watch. My snag is that the hook on which much of this drama is based - the characterisation of Garrison - is really poor. Costner just doesn't deliver. He is weak and uninspiring; his impassioned search for truth and justice is set up well by the strong supporting efforts, but his on-screen persona just lacks the zeal and intensity needed to sustain the intensity of this investigation. Plaudits ought to go to an excellently enigmatic Donald Sutherland as his latter day deep throat ""X""; and to Tommy Lee Jones as the seriously seedy ""Shaw"". Kevin Bacon also performs well as the aptly named, glorified rent boy ""Willie"". Maybe it is the presence of such acting luminaries - Matthau, Lemmon and Sissy Spacek (Garrison's wife) that serve to further compound the inadequacies of the lead? A failure that is finally embodied by the missed opportunity to present his rousing denouement to an open court that is quickly reduced to something akin to a third grade chemistry lecture with little inflection or potency. It's long, at times feeling unnecessarily weighty. Perhaps, had the director not gone for a box office pappiness to head this otherwise gripping docu-dramna, then it could have been a great movie. As it is, it's good but lacking. Congress ordered an evaluation of the documents supporting/contesting these assertions in 1992 - the absence, meantime, of any further developments will ensure this film stays pertinent, however flawed, for many years to come..."

Bruce Willis made this film in the middle of his stint in the hugely popular TV Show, Moonlighting, and it's very much in keeping with the fun side of that particular show.

The plot revolves around Walter Davis (Willis), who needs a date for a very important business dinner, his brother sets him up on a blind date with his wife's cousin Nadia (Basinger) with the express warning of not getting her drunk as she goes wild when taking in too much booze. Naturally things go from chaos to bigger chaos as Nadia promptly gets drunk and tears Walter's world to shreds. Some fun set pieces and tidy humour dialogue keep the proceedings jovial enough, but a running gag with one of Nadia's ex boyfriends turning up quickly becomes annoying, while the standard plot gag of Nadia ruining everything also becomes very tiresome.

It's has its moments but just not enough to lift the film above average, the two leads do well enough to keep the mood going, but ultimately the film for me is straight down the middle with a rating of 5/10. || It might be dated now but it's still a great little movie.

Please, don't ask me to give it up.

The film is based on a real case and is about real people so to that ends it is obviously simple in structure, and nagging away as you watch it is the fact that the ending is never in doubt, it ""is"" all too predictable. However, what made Erin Brockovich the success it was is that the title character is not only interesting but also, importantly, intriguing. A foul mouthed hard bitten, twice divorced mother of three has to fight her corner just to get an honest days pay. It's a fabulous story backed up by a simply incredible performance from Julia Roberts. Here Roberts has let her hair down, puts on a push up bra and a short skirt, she is clearly enjoying the freedom of the role, and the results are real effective.

I have no doubt that working alongside Albert Finney helped Roberts no ends, but it is her show all the way, and she alone masks over what really is an ordinary film, there is nothing we haven't seen before here, it's just a more modern take on the good versus evil corporate company scenario. It's steadily directed by Steven Soderbergh, emotional scenes are not overstretched to treacle point, and all in all it's good solid story telling. Repeat viewings prove to dilute the uplift factor of the finale, but Roberts' performance certainly holds firm for evermore.

8/10 for the film, 10/10 for Roberts' ballsy show. If only we could have had more of these performances from her. || Very good film. Julia Roberts is terrific.

It may go on for 10-15 minutes too long, but even so <em>'Erin Brockovich'</em> is a fascinating biographical film. The dialogue is pretty sharp, there are a few good lines in there for Roberts. She herself is terrific here, I enjoyed her whole performance.

Away from Roberts, you have Albert Finney and Aaron Eckhart involved, as well as a few minor roles for recognisable faces from television - namely Michael Harney and Wade Williams. Finney and Eckhart are more than decent, but Roberts is most definitely the one that keeps the film moving forward.

Well worth a watch. || Not that bad of a movie. Honestly there's all kind of plants around the world that pollute a lot of different things that are harmful to us. I wish they would have had trial in this movie and make them sweat. Would have been nice to see."

It's fun, it's exciting, and it looks fabulous at times, it is however far from being a great movie. In the absence of Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck steps in to Hornblower's shoes and as much as he gives it his all (rumoured to have been one of his favourite performances), it's a spot of miscasting that thankfully doesn't kill the picture dead, he's just sadly a tad too straight laced to really make the role work. The same can be said for the casting of Virginia Mayo as Lady Barbara Wellesley, pretty as she is, it's an odd bit of casting that never quite comes off, yet as daft as it may sound, neither case of miscasting hurts the picture, and this comes down to the astute direction from Raoul Walsh.

The pace never flags so we are never over concerned with the central actors struggles to make the characters work, backed up by Guy Green's camera work and Robert Farnon's jaunty score, the technical aspects of the piece steer the viewer on to safe waters (ahem). The sets are excellent and the recreation of the ships is first rate, with the final quarter of the movie giving us a blood pumping battle that's full of heroic bluster. It's a film that is easily recommended to adventure fans, though far from perfect and it remains a wasted opportunity in my eyes, but it's still a very enjoyable film for all the family. 6/10 || This is effectively three short stories bolted together as Raoul Walsh creates quite an exciting and enjoyable seafaring story based around the Napoleonic Wars. Gregory Peck takes the lead role as the eponymous, rather stiff-necked, Royal Navy captain carrying out a mission to provision a rather unreliable ally with arms and munitions. When events in a Europe being terrorised by Napoleon take a series of more treacherous turns, he must now battle his way across the Atlantic and return to help protect his country from the French. Virginia Mayo provides the love interest and Robert Beatty and a feisty James Robertson Justice work well too, to help keep the ship off the rocks as the battle comes down to tactics and becomes personal! It is a good, old-fashioned and enjoyably paced, boy's own yarn based on the C. S Forester character and well worth watching."

This ship is going to founder.

Directed by Roy Ward Baker, A Night To Remember is adapted by Eric Ambler from the book written by Walter Lord. Though only met with a lukewarm response at the box office on release, the film has since received critical acclaim and is highly regarded by Titanic historians for its accuracy.

The story of the ill fated voyage of the RMS Titanic is here given a first rate telling by Baker and his crew. Kenneth Moore heads up the multiple cast list (there's over 200 speaking parts), but crucially they let the story be the star. This is about that desperate and distressing night, when people of all classes perished due to a number of circumstances. Circumstances that are all fully formed here. They largely stick to the source story, and by using research with actual survivors they have kept it straightforward and factual. There's also no sub-plots to bog it down, there's time spent with the principals of course, but only enough time to hold our interest when disaster strikes and decisions are to be made. 

Given a story with so much detail it's a major achievement that the film never sags, the outcome of which is a classic movie that's as memorable as it is poignant. 8/10"

Before taking off for Paris, Alex Browning has a vision that the plane is going to explode. Pannicking he gets off the plane and in the mêlée a teacher and a group of his class mates are forced off the flight, the plane goes on to explode in mid air, killing everyone on board. But pretty soon after the disaster strange accidents start to befall those who got off the plane, it seems that death is out to get them.

With the number of hugely disappointing teens in peril movies that were made post the success of Wes Craven's hugely successful Scream, it's refreshing to find one that was, well, refreshing. Not purporting to be anything other than a wickedly entertaining piece of horror based nonsense, Final Destination is inventive, funny and above all else, shock laden.

From the opening, and terrifying air crash sequence to the clever and gross way that our protagonists shake hands with the grim reaper, this film is gloriously proud of its horror intent. One peak at the surnames of the characters will tell you just how into their horror roots the makers are here, whilst not a homage movie as such, James Wong and his team clearly know what makes a modern horror picture work.

If you find yourself complaining about the writing then you clearly are missing the point of Final Destination's existence, either that or you are in fact dead yourself! Four fun but vastly inferior sequels would follow, but really this is the one to watch, as good a 100 minutes of horror fun as you could wish to have. I dare you not to jump out your seat at least once! 9/10 || ***Innovative premise for a 'Dead Teenager Movie,' but the last act isn’t compelling***  

This first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper. A group of people escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways. The opening tragedy in this case is a plane crash; in the second film it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.

I've seen (and own) the first four of the currently five-film franchise, but they all tell the same basic story with different characters and a different location and are all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same.

This first one has a quality heroine or 'final girl' in Ali Larter. Amanda Detmer is also on hand as a fellow student while Kristen Cloke plays a freaked-out teacher. They coulda done better showcasing these women IMHO. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum there’s Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Chad Donella. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his first of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.

For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most certainly die in the sequel.

The script began as an X-Files teleplay and, indeed, the movie was made by two veterans of that series. And you can tell due to the basic feel of the movie and the inclusion of two government agents. I’d give “Final Destination” a higher grade because I love the concept, but this one curiously gets dull in the final act (despite all the ‘exciting’ things going on) and they coulda done more with the women.

The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area (although the events take place around New York City).

GRADE: B- || Love this movie. A person has visions of a disaster or people dieing. All his visions come true. This one is my favorite out of the series."

Two women from Arkansas (Susan Sarandon & Geena Davis) become fugitives and travel through the Southwest pursued by authorities (Harvey Keitel & Stephen Tobolowsky). Brad Pitt plays a cowboy drifter while Michael Madsen and Christopher McDonald are on hand as the beau and hubby of the women. 

""Thelma & Louise"" (1991) is an iconic crime drama/road movie spiced with a few thrills. It’s entertaining, but not really empowering for females, unless making rash, stupid decisions and ruining your life is empowering. It’s amusing, dramatic and scenic, yet ultimately tragic. 

Sarandon was 41 during shooting while Davis was ten years younger. Both look great, but their characters are a bit of a turn-off during the opening reel, especially the ditzy Thelma (Davis), yet they win sympathy as the movie progresses.  

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal and Utah, as well as Bedrock, Colorado.

GRADE: B || Thirty-odd years later, and this is still a classic piece of cinema. It all centres around best pals ""Thelma"" (Geena Davis) and ""Louise"" (Susan Sarandon) who are a bit bored with their respective fellas and set off on a drive. Stopping off at a roadside bar, things get out of hand when the latter woman shoots dead a man trying to rape her friend. Now it's a dark car park and they had been drinking and dancing with this guy all night, so circumstances being what they are - the girls decide discretion is the better part of valour and off they drive. Not long after, Harvey Keitel's dogged police officer ""Hal"" shows up and pretty soon the girls are on the run. They have to stay one step ahead of their pursuers, find a way to get some cash and decide what to do with the hunky ""J.D."" (Brad Pitt), an hiker who has hitched his team to their wagon - much to the delight of ""Thelma"" - en route to safety in Mexico (just not via Texas!)! It's a film about self discovery I suppose, but really it is an entertaining romp from two women letting the badger loose. Pitt provides the now legendary eye-candy in his 501s and the whole things demonstrates a light-hearted criminality reminiscent of ""Bonnie and Clyde"". There are plenty of laughs to be had, the performances all round are engaging and charismatic and it's full of attitude. If I'd been on a jury - they'd have walked!"

There are comedies that are well-made, elegant, interesting, and there are comedies that are of no interest and will only have some kind of additional appeal to those who saw them when they were young or at the time when they were successful. I think this film fits into the second group: everything takes place on a university campus where the rector tries, with the help of a group of students, to come up with a plan to extinguish a student republic famous for its large number of problems and the poor academic performance. Of course, the students of this republic fueled by beer and madness will find a way to respond in kind.

This is a film especially aimed at rebellious teenagers that came out at a time when being rebellious was fashionable. The world was in the aftermath of the Sexual Revolution and struggling with the first problems arising from drug and alcohol abuse that had spread at the beginning of the decade, but there were still those trying to keep this revolutionary flame burning. Today, almost fifty years later, with almost all of these actors experiencing the pain of old age, it is a film that is forgotten and seems completely distant from our current realities. A dated, aged film of no particular interest.

For me, the most positive and interesting point that this film had was the inspired and good-humored participation of Donald Sutherland, an actor who is currently a veteran and has a wealth of work and awards to present. Seeing him here seems strange, considering who he is today, but he seems to simply be having fun and enjoying the pleasure of doing what he loves most. I can't say that the rest of the actors did a bad job. I honestly think that they all did very well, within what was asked of them. They simply cannot perform miracles. || Filipe Manuel Neto is a retard who says that this timeless classic is ''Dated and not very appealing to the current public''.

On a hot summer day in a predominantly black neighborhood in Brooklyn, one person makes the wrong decision and sets off a chain of events that results in havoc. Rosie Perez is a highlight on the feminine front.

“Do the Right Thing” was Spike Lee’s breakthrough film that he made when he was 31. It’s a stylish and spirited account of a mostly black community in New York City that’s well-rounded with drama, humor, entertainment, honesty and tragedy. 

On the one hand, this neighborhood seems like a pleasant enough place to live, if you don’t mind the big city. The characters are not painted as one-dimensional, generally speaking; they have both attributes and faults. Yet it’s a relatively peaceable environment with the various races/ethnicities getting along just fine with only minor (and amusing) altercations. Nevertheless, it’s a tinderbox that doesn’t take much to set aflame.

The last act leaves a bad taste. I can’t believe Lee had the gonads to be this honest, but he shows why most people don’t want to live or do business in black neighborhoods, including many blacks.

While people debate who’s right and who’s wrong, it’s simple to figure out: Buggin Out taking offense about something immaterial at Sal’s pizzeria is unjustified. If he thinks it’s that big of a deal he doesn’t have to dine there, plus he can start his own restaurant and decorate it however he wishes. At the same time, it could be argued that Sal should’ve reacted in a wiser way that turned away Buggin Out’s curious anger, rather than augment it. Meanwhile Radio Raheem makes a foolish decision by allowing Buggin Out to negatively influence him. Why can’t they just do the right thing? It’s frustrating.  

This is a well-made classic and worthy of its iconic status, it’s just not exactly my cup of tea due to the exasperating last act that’s too brutally honest. How about doing the right thing by making art that inspires hope, unity and healing for inner city communities? This piece points to the problem, inspires questions & debates, but offers no solutions except… move away from black neighborhoods.   

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

GRADE: B- || Whilst there can be no doubt of the potency of the theme here, I thought the nature of the story telling was all over the place and angry. With temperatures rising, literally and metaphorically, the bored youth of an area of Brooklyn are becoming more and more frustrated. The thrust of these frustrations is epitomised by a battle of wills between Italian American pizzeria owner ""Sal"" (Danny Aiello) and his growing number of African American clientele. His walls are covered with famous faces - Al Pacino, Frank Sinatra, etc. from his heritage but his new customers feel that they are under represented. ""Sal"" isn't about to be bullied into anything, and to be fair to Spike Lee he does cleverly use this slow burning fuse to illustrate an whole slew of racial attitudes amongst a diverse community where change was coming - like it or not. As the heat shows no sign of abating, tempers finally flare and a denouement results in quite some eye-opening tragedy that though effective, I found completely anachronistic. It's told very much from one perspective but not puritanically. I think that might actually exacerbate my dislike of the proceedings because what appears to be happening to a decent and hard working American citizen is that he is being bullied, coerced and ultimately violated because he won't abandon his own traditions in favour of someone else's. It's cunningly depicting a change of identity for this community in a survival of the fittest fashion that I found quite intimidating. This isn't really about the characters themselves, more about the politics of a situation that became more and toxic as people left their conciliation hat at the door of reason on their way in. The dialogue struggled to get past the fu section of the dictionary and that just compounded the sense that it was more of a not so subtle rant than a story of respect offering any decent form societal evolution and equality. Maybe Lee would do it differently now? As it is, it's raw - but not in a good way."

Michael Winner once again pushes the buttons of Hollywood with this sequel to his controversial hit, Death Wish. Plot follows a familiar trajectory, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is now in Los Angeles living a normal life, when wouldn't you know it, some scumbag youths cross his path after administering some rape and pillage on folk close to him... 

The problem here, and the reason why some critics positively burst blood vessels after watching it, is that for the first half it just is pure exploitation, this in spite of some decent production value. Did it really need to be another sex crime? Could it not have been a murder et al? There gets a point in the film where you sense it's boobs for boobs sake. Though you have to wonder if Winner dared to ask Chuck and Jill Ireland (playing girlfriend of Chuck...) if Jill would do a nude scene? I think a broken nose may have come about if that subject had of been broached... 

Once Kersey (Bronson hard as nails again) goes about dealing out his brand of justice, the film hits its straps, teasing the viewers with moral - cum - ethical outrage or conversely, vicarious thinking. Vigilante films are always going to swim in tricky waters, provoking anger and heated debate from all walks of the political spectrum, but better to have them out there to provoke a response than not. Surely? 

There is nothing remotely high end here, but it's a film worthy of its above average rating on IMDb. It can shock, annoy, dismay and even induce unintentional mirth (three of the rapist thugs dance the campiest dance ever), but it will not be ignored and people are still seeking it out today to watch for the first time. Michael Winner still showing the ability to pique interest with his vigilante franchise. 6.5/10 || Not great and really uncomfortable to watch (as was the first film, but this one takes it up a level in the assault) but seeing Charles Bronson exacting revenge was good and he's in his element as Kersey. Not as good as the first but still ""entertaining"" (for the lack of a better word), if not a bit hokey at times late with Kersey getting lucky for the number of people covering for him. **3.0/5**"

To be fair, the bad guy did warn Bronson that he would kill the girl - but Bronson did not listen. He kept on coming at the other guy until the guy delivered his promise and killed the girl. Bronson pushed the guy into it. He _did_ warn Bronson. Here is the unacceptable part - _Bronson then mercilessly blows him to pieces._

The man was trying to reason with Bronson and gave him ample warning but Bronson just opted for a violent conclusion. Bronson should have not killed the man - especially as the guy was trying to make concessions for Brosnan. 

Bronson brought it on himself. || ""Death Wish 4: The Crackdown"" really ought to have a more routine and listless quality about it by this late date and while there is a faint sense of that detectable here it isn't as prevalent as it could have been. The film pushes incredibly hard to create some sort of new and innovative angle on its central theme - a theme which has now gone from being highly controversial and politically and socially divisive to becoming acceptable and commonplace action movie fodder in just a span of fifteen years - to trigger the mayhem and by and large this results in a much better film than you could have ever expected. There is still an abundance of gunplay on display, but fortunately the unpalatable and lurid violence towards women (which still exists here to a certain extent) receives far less attention from screenwriter Gail Morgan Hickman than some of her male counterparts in previous times and best of all there are no deliberately cruel and horrifically over extended rape  scenes to fast forward through this time around."

Ah yes, the Death Wish series of films, each and every one guaranteed to invoke some ire and even hatred from critical circles and film lovers alike. Yet to think that they don't have fans from movie land would be wrong - case in point Death Wish 5: The Face of Death.

Often considered to be the runt of the litter, it's actually better than what some would have you believe. OK! So the formula is the same as usual, Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey will have to take up his vigilante arms once again when someone close to him falls by the wayside. The law is still an ass and the bad guys can literally get away with murder, but they can't get away from crossing the path of Kersey.

It is what it is in that respect, another chance for Bronson to please fans of the series, to attack his role with machismo and a quip on the tongue. Where inventive deaths are conjured with a side order of vigilante relish. There's even strains of film noir in here, with a henchman as a transvestite and another with a dandruff problem that bothers him so. There's even a mannequin factory for added noirish flavours.

The production isn't exactly high end (tongue in cheek folks), and the usual suspension of disbelief is very much required, but for fans of Chuck and the series, then this delivers the goods. Bloodily so. 7/10"

He was one of the finest at getting straight through the bullshit and to the heart of all things noir (as the immortal Jean-Luc Godard stated, 'All I need to make a film is a man, a girl and a gun'). 

Barbara Stanwyck is one of my favourite actresses of the period, and is a classic 'femme fatale'. I've never been a huge fan of Fred MacMurray, but his 'nice guy' persona is used to sheer advantage by Wilder, and he end up both doing his finest work for Wilder (here and in 'The Apartment') and being the ultimate noir male protagonist. Interestingly, one of my favourite actors, Edward G. Robinson, thought so much of the script that he opted out of his demand of never doing a supporting role. Many people admire Wilder the director, but as a writer (or co-writer) he's just as cinematically important and influential.

Like any other film of his, at least that I've had the pleasure to see, it's worth a purchase and re-watches. The dialogue, especially, is simply fantastic. I'd take just one of his early works over a hundred of the films Hollywood churns out nowadays. They're simply that better and intrinsically satisfying. Immortal cinema. || A banner movie from film noir's classic era.

Double Indemnity is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-adapts the screenplay with Raymond Chandler from the novella written by James M. Cain. It stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by John F. Seitz.

For a film lover such as myself it feels redundant writing a review for Double Indemnity, because quite simply there's nothing to say that hasn't been said already. The esteem it is held in is justified, it's a razor sharp noir across the board and can be put up as one of the classic noir era pictures that got lovers of the form interested in the first place.

Based around the infamous Snyder/Gray case of 1927, Wilder and Chandler fill the story with a sinister cynicism that is palpable in the extreme. With a script positively pumped with hard boiled dialogue, a simple case of murder becomes so much more, a labyrinth of devious cunning and foolishness, with a trio of top performances crowning this topper.

Technically via aural and visual work the story gains extra spice. Rosza provides a score that frays the nerves, imbuing the sense of doom and edginess required for plotting. Seitz excels, the photography a trademark for noir, heavy shadows, abrupt camera angles and menacing shards of light come to the fore.

And to top it all off, it gets away with so much, a real censorship baiter. The story takes a journey to the dark side of morality, and the makers, bless them for they know what they do, gleefully tease the production code to give film noir fans a reason to rejoice.

Quintessential stuff. 10/10 || Perhaps the single best example of a film noir movie, _Double Indemnity_ (1944), stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson. Based on a novel written by James Cain, the screenplay was co-written by Billy Wilder and the amazing Raymond Chandler.

Set in 1938 California, the story is based on the true-life 1927 murder of a married Queens, New York woman's husband who was killed by the woman's boyfriend after she took out a large insurance policy that contained a double-indemnity clause. In this movie, Phyllis Dietrichson (played by Stanwyck) takes out a life insurance policy on her husband with the help of insurance salesman-soon-to-be-turned-murderer Walter Neff (played by MacMurray). Robinson plays Barton Keyes, Neff's co-worker and a very suspicious claims adjuster who suspects Phyllis Dietrichson might have had something to do with her husband's sudden death.

This movie is an hour and forty-seven minutes of pure movie love. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards [Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Barbara Stanwyck), Best Director, Best Writing-Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Recording, and Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture)], though it won none."

Bloodsport is directed by Newt Arnold and written by Christopher Cosby, Mel Friedman and Sheldon Lettich. It stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Norman Burton, Forest Whitaker and Bolo Yeung. Music is by Paul Hertzog and cinematography by David Worth.

One of the earlier films that made Van Damme into a star, Bloodsport finds Van Damme as real life martial artist Frank Dux. Dux enters into the famed Kumite, a no nonsense tournament in Hong Kong and must overcome various hurdles to hopefully achieve his goals.

As is the norm for a Van Damme action movie, particularly where his late 80s and early 90s output is concerned, one has to be prepared for some at best average acting and a flimsy plot. Plot follows a familiar Van Damme trajectory, his character will yearn to overcome adversity, go through a strenuous training programme, meet and make friends and enemies, produce some outstanding martial artistry, and end up in a winner takes all fight for justice, revenge, honour...

Away from the seriously great fighting skills showcased by Van Damme and the other martial artists he comes up against, there's not a lot of artistic film making craft on show. But as fans of this sort of stuff will tell you, and I'm one of that number, it matters not, for they deliver exactly what we expect. Great fight choreography, a super Kumite montage, a vile villain who needs his ass kicked, and of course lots of Van Damage as we hurtle towards what we hope will be a triumphant finale. Hooray!

Though supposedly based on facts in Frank Dux's life, this has been called into question over the years, so best to just observe it as an energised martial arts film rather than a part biography piece. 7/10 || I've been pretty harsh reviewing Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, and even though he is significantly older than me, I have the feeling he can still kick my butt, so maybe I should back off a little.

Honestly though, this one is pretty watchable. Make no mistake, it is no Chinatown, but, who cares, it is a fun way to hit all the tropes of the martial arts genre and it does it in a way that you know is going to be copied, even if it was already kind of a copy of Enter the Dragon only without the art.

So, what you have is a bloody trope filled film that is fun to watch and vaguely (in the vaguest sense of the word vaguely) based kinda sorta on a true story that one guy said happened and was never really verified.

So.... sit back and pop some corn, you'll love this."

Robin Williams (Adrian) is in strong form, while it's amusing to see a less experienced Forest Whitaker (Edward) in a rather dorky role. 'Good Morning, Vietnam' all makes for satisfactory viewing thanks to Mr. Williams' humour, even if I didn't have a great deal of interest in the plot et al. || **_An unseen side of the Vietnam War_**

Airman Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is a DJ in Saigon, 1965. While Cronauer is a hit with the troops he incurs the wrath of his superiors for what they consider irreverent and subversive tendencies. When he's off the air, Cronauer pursues a cute Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) while befriending her brother (Tung Thanh Tran). Forest Whitaker plays Cronauer's friend at the station while J.T. Walsh and Bruno Kirby play his nemeses.

Based on the real-life story, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" (1987) came out when Vietnam films were popular. While categorized as a war comedy, it's more of a war drama with amusing touches, mostly due to Williams' antics. It was a box office hit when released and hailed by critics. Roger Ebert, for instance, gave it a perfect rating. I didn't see it until a couple of nights ago, far removed from the hoopla of the period, and found it decent and somewhat amusing, but a tad overrated. 

Nevertheless, there's an unexpected twist in the third act and the movie is a necessary companion-piece to movies like ""Platoon"" (1986) in that it provides the non-grunt, political side of the infamous conflict. For instance, the story takes place just _before_ the troop levels were beefed up to 385,000 in 1966, which would escalate to 536,000 by 1968.

The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute, and was shot in Thailand.

It's a new era of film and the makers of Grumpy Old Men have tailored it to suit impressively the twin talents of Matthau and Lemmon. Both of whom are wonderful, their chemistry set in cement, their timing and reactions to scripting an utter joy. It's not without problems, anyone can see that, especially when the film veers onto the drama path, but the comedy over rides it all to leave a adult friendly holiday movie full of warmth and chuckles. 7/10 || Really funny movie. Wasn't expecting this to be a good movie I was wrong. Great story good acting and funny."

_Lord of the Flies_ is a classic book that I have never read, and its the source material for two movies, one from 1963, and the other in 1990, both of which I had also never seen. Having spotted the 1963 version on Kanopy, I loaded it up for a look. 

If you're not sure what it's about, here's a brief rundown:

_Amidst a nuclear war, a plane carrying a group of schoolboys crash lands on a deserted island. With no adult survivors, the boys are forced to fend for themselves. At first they cooperate, but when they split into two separate camps their society falls into disarray._

Opening with a pretty effective photographic prologue that sets up things nicely for the commencement of the film itself this got my attention quite quickly, but boy does it go downhill very fast after that. The kids are not very good actors - most of their lines sound like they're reading them, it's poorly edited, and overall comes off feeling like something made by a first year film student in their back yard.

I spent a lot of the runtime thinking ""okay this isn't very good, but let's see where its going"" but ultimately it goes nowhere. There's no real explanation as to why certain boys go so wild, they just suddenly do. And as there is no time scale given you can't gauge if this was a slow descent into madness or not, and because of that we're just left with the choppy editing so it seems they went wild in a matter of days which makes how wild they go even more ridiculous. For a movie that sets out to be a serious drama film that asks the ""what if?"" question, it hasn't a shred of logic to it.

Any metaphorical meaning is lost in its terrible execution and complete lack of explanation. If I had not been primed by years of ""this is an examination of the breakdown of humanity"" and gone into this blind, I would have come away thinking it was a shoddily made movie with an incoherent story and no message. In fact, even going into it primed for a ""breakdown of humanity"" story, I still came away thinking it was a shoddily made movie with an incoherent story and no message.

There are no explanations, no exposition, and I couldn't help but be left thinking ""why on earth is this a classic?"" || True enough to the book.
It has been decades since I've read the book, and also since I've seen the movie.
For the few who are unaware, it's about the savage ways that a group of young boys take on when left on their own after a plane crash.
One of the boys becomes a sort of ""anti hero"" just by not being a sadist. He begins by being a leader, but some of the other boys begin being sadistic savages.
It's a bit of a reflection on the debate long ago between Voltaire and Rousseau, about the nature of man. The French Revolution and other incidents bore out Voltaire's cynicism and mocked Rousseau's optimism.
Other movies have the same motif. Anzio, Ulzana's Raid, End of the Spear, while which reflect on the need to understand that we have to fight inner demons.
Here, two boys totally give in to the demons, and two boys totally reject the demons. Other boys fall in between, but find that if they reject the demons, they must do so in an underground movement.,
It does make for some characters whose motivation is just pure evil, because they are totally possessed by demons. It's something everyone must fight against all the time.
A film to compare this with is ""Fortress"", which is much the better film, because there is an adult who mentors the young boys and girls who go through an ordeal, and in ""Fortress"" we see them work together for a common good to help every individual.
Which is the exact opposite of what ""Lord of the Flies"" does. The boys here do the exact opposite. It's depressing, but not contrived IMO. It shows how ugly that ugliness truly is, which is its saving grace."

The writer of Frankenstein (Natasha Richardson), her beau (Julian Sands) and half-sister (Myriam Cyr) visit the mad, bad recluse Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne) at his lavish estate on Lake Geneva in Switzerland. There they meet Byron’s equally bizarre physician friend (Timothy Spall) and spend the stormy night of June 16, 1816, in hallucinatory revelry, including a challenge to write a spooky story, which gave birth to Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” and John William Polidori’s “The Vampyre,” the first published modern vampire story.   

The premise of “Gothic” (1986) is great, the first act is interesting and the short epilogue is effective. Unfortunately, the hour in between is meandering, hedonistic, perverse, outrageously overdone and utterly tedious. I can handle the unsavory elements (and expected them) as long as the story is compelling, but that’s not the case. It’s basically a string of coked-up theatrics and perversions in an attractively gothic setting. 

Speaking of attractive, one of the few consolations is the jaw-dropping Natasha Richardson in her prime. She was Liam Neeson’s wife from 1994 until her death in 2009 from a skiing accident. 

If you want to see a gothic flick set in the 1800s that’s actually decent, check out “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992). For a movie that treads similar terrain that’s really good and in some ways great see “Marie Antoinette” (2006). “Gothic” is trash by comparison and fittingly bombed at the box office. Sometimes director Ken Russell’s unique projects work, like “Altered States” (1980), but not this.  

The film runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot at Gaddesden Place & Wrotham Park in Herfordshire, England. Thomas Dolby wrote the score, his first and last.

24748.0,Hud,"Hud Bannon is a ruthless young man who tarnishes everything and everyone he touches. Hud represents the perfect embodiment of alienated youth, out for kicks with no regard for the consequences. There is bitter conflict between the callous Hud and his stern and highly principled father, Homer. Hud's nephew Lon admires Hud's cheating ways, though he soon becomes too aware of Hud's reckless amorality to bear him anymore. In the world of the takers and the taken, Hud is a winner. He's a cheat, but, he explains, ""I always say the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner.""",The man with the barbed-wire soul.,"Drama, Western",112,1963-05-28,en,7.278,329,2.1999,"Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal, Brandon De Wilde, Whit Bissell","Harriet Frank Jr., Martin Ritt, Irving Ravetch","based on novel or book, rodeo, texas, ranch, alcoholism, rebellious youth, housekeeper, neo-western, hero worship","You're an unprincipled man, Hud.

Hud is directed by Martin Ritt and adapted to screenplay by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., from the Larry McMurty novel Horsemen, Pass By. It stars Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal and Brandon de Wilde. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by James Wong Howe.

Hud Bannon (Newman) doesn't care for much outside of himself, life is to be enjoyed by drinking, fighting, bedding women and basically anything as long as he avoids responsibility for it. This greatly upsets his father, Homer (Douglas), a very principled man who is tormented that a son of his could turn out so rotten. Troubling him still further is that his grandson, Lonnie (de Wilde) is getting closer to Hud and he's in danger of being corrupted to Hud's unprincipled ways

I done my time with one cold blooded bastard, I'm not looking for another.

It may be filmed in Panavison, with sumptuous black and white photography by Howe (Academy Award for Best Cinematography), but this is a dry dust bowl set drama, one that is thriving on dialogue and propelled by a mean spirited protagonist. Film is essentially a four character piece, with those four characters confined to small town Americana and a family ranch that is going under now that the livestock has contracted deadly foot and mouth disease. Bannon's senior and junior battle it out for the soul of young Lonnie, with Patricia Neal's smouldering older woman house keeper simultaneously playing mother, wife and potential girlfriend to all three Bannon men. It's a hot-pot combination given great edginess by the Ravetch and Frank screenplay. There's very little action, except some brief bar room brawling and speedy car driving, but there's terrific literary drama in the narrative. As Hud Bannon strips off each self-absorbed layer, so the film shifts up another gear.

Old people get as hard as their arteries sometimes.

Be warned, this is no happy picture. This is not a case where the supremely handsome face of Paul Newman will ultimately warm your heart, picture is dealing in grimness and there is trouble waiting for everyone involved. Even Bernstein's score is on the reflective side of the fence, tenderly blending with Howe's melancholic images captured in and around this small Texas town. The four principal actors turn in wonderful performances, with Neal winning an Academy Award for Best Actress (though it's a relatively small role!) and Douglas also winning for Best Supporting Actor. Nominations went to Newman for Best Actor, Ritt for Best Director and also the screenplay and art direction was up for awards as well. As a production and execution of a moody story, Hud is up with the best of them. That is if you don't mind sombre dialogue driven stories? 8/10 || Study of a creep.
I don't want to be a spoiler, but that's what the movie is. And it's done in a very flowing way. We have four main characters, although the woman, played by Patricia Neal, soon leaves.
The others are Hud, played by Paul Newman, his father, played by Melvyn Douglas, and his nephew played by Brandon de Wilde.
Hud is vicious and selfish to the max. His father tries to get him to reform. At first we see this through the nephew's yes of innocence, thinking Hud is just a misunderstood rogue, but Hud is no Shane for Brandon de Wilde.
They have a ranch, and Hud's brother had a bad ending, for which Hud doesn't seem to care about much. We soon learn Hud isn't hiding feelings. He tells his father that if the herd is infected with a disease, to sell the meat and not tell anyone, when they both know full well that the herd would infect every herd in the area if that happens. As the father says, ""hud is an unprincipled man.
The film is mostly about how the nephew learns the truth about Hud. It's disappointing to the nephew, but he becomes a better man for it. It isn't exactly a feel good movie, but it isn't exactly a feel bad movie, either, because the nephew is a beacon of hope. || Although he takes top billing here, it isn't actually Paul Newman's eponymous role that stands out for me here. That would jointly be Patricia Neal's long suffering 'Alma"" and Brandon De Wilde's naive and innocent ""Lon"". The latter lad is the nephew of ""Hud"" and all live with his grandfather ""Homer"" (Melvyn Douglas) on his cattle ranch. ""Homer"" is a decent cove, ""Alma"" is their housekeeper and ""Hud"" - well he just boozes and womanises his way through life with an engaging aptitude that seems to have turned him and his father against each other. ""Lon"", meantime, adores his uncle and wants to emulate him - a fact that ""Hud"" is aware of and, to a certain extent, exploits to make himself feel better. That's maybe the root of his problems. He doesn't feel. Not for himself, nor for his lovers, nor for his family - his life is all rather empty and at that Newman delivers well - without imbuing his character with even the merest hint of melancholy or regret. The threat of disease hits the herd, though, and that potential disaster starts to focus all attentions on this dysfunctional familial relationship and events start to focus ""Hud"" on his priorities. Is it all too late, though? De Wilde seems to me to be the eyes of the story. From his perspective we see the behaviour around him vacillate from kindly, loving and friendly to violent and thoughtless. It's his very butter-wouldn't-melt character that serves to highlight the strengths and weaknesses amongst the others and by the denouement, well I almost felt sorry to Newman's strikingly sad and lonely persona. I thought it might be hard to take a dislike to any character the usually charming Newman might play, but this performance made that easy - a testament to his versatility. Neal features quite sparingly, but her character comes across and strong and determined, a little vulnerable but in the end, cognisant of the flaws in a man whom, ultimately, she just couldn't trust. As we learn a little more of the back story, maybe we feel a little sympathy for the wayward cowboy. Maybe not."

They are able to communicate rudimentarily and pretty swiftly they realise that without their wily and respectful guide they would perish amidst the wintry conditions. Indeed, after the tour has finished they all owe this diminutive man an undying debt of gratitude. Many years later, ""Arseniev"" returns to this wilderness and again happens upon his old friend. This time, though, it's not mapping they are doing but hunting the hunters. A tribe of Chinese who are killing for the sake of killing, using brutal traps to ensnare their pray. They also find themselves on the trail of a tiger - a creature protected by the great spirits of the forest. It's when Dersu mistakenly kills one, that he fears the revenge of the land in which he has thrived for so long, and so accepts an invitation to live with his friend in the town. Here, though, there are no tents, he can't shoot or fish - and somehow the central heating doesn't quite compensate as he yearns to return to his wild, untainted, homeland. This is a gorgeously photographed story about the human spirit. About what happens when mankind collaborates - not just with each other, but with the nature that surrounds us. Munzuk is superb as the hunter, as convincing as I reckon an actor could ever be as he dons his furs and wades through the mire and the snow with his squad in tow almost as if they were duckings following their mother. It's also a story about friendship, loyalty and inter-reliance, it dwells heavily on the symbiotic nature that works best when collaboration is the order of the day and by the conclusion, it illustrates clearly the love and respect between the two men whose cultures could have clashed; should have clashed, but that ended up bringing them together in a fashion neither could ever have anticipated.

One of Spielberg's best with a nice cameo by French director Francois Truffaut. || I always remember as a child hoping/praying that if extra terrestrials ever did come to visit us, that they wouldn't arrive in America. Think ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) or most other sci-fi stories: the first things they would see when they opened their door would be guns, tanks, missiles, soldiers... This film takes a far more sophisticated approach to how we might engage with an alien species, and together with some super effects and a far more nuanced storyline leaves us with room for optimism that we might not just try to shoot first and ask questions afterwards - should anyone ever do arrive. Spielberg was still, in my view anyway, learning his craft when he wrote/directed this and that shows in the real paucity of pace for the first hour. Richard Dreyfuss is adequate, but the constantly amazed/perplexed looks on his face start to become annoying after a while. François Truffaut features now and again - largely as part of a parallel storyline - but really, this only begins to engage in the last thirty minutes when the threads all knit together giving us a clever denouement as the scientists discover an innovative, musical, way to communicate that doesn't involved threats and bullets. Oddly enough, even when I first saw this at the age of 9, I never got any sense of menace from our travellers and the absence of any substantial physical form for us to identify with seems to help keep the magic working.

What I can say is that a doctor goes to Vietnam, and then leaves his wife, marries someone else becomes a Postal Employee, and that is about as much as I can honestly say without throwing the spoiler alert up.

It is one of those movies where everything you love about the plot would be a red flag on the spoiler radar... so watch it, enjoy it, you won't be disappointed. And you will see what I am talking about with the spoilers when you get there."
13531.0,Empire Records,The employees of an independent music store learn about each other as they try to stop the store from being absorbed by a large chain.,They're selling music but not selling out.,"Music, Comedy, Drama, Romance",90,1995-09-22,en,6.6,735,1.5561,"Liv Tyler, Johnny Whitworth, Renée Zellweger, Robin Tunney, Anthony LaPaglia",Allan Moyle,"pop star, older man younger woman relationship, shoplifting, cupcake, twenty something, gameboy, money bag, sidewalk, independent film, record store, romantic dramedy, long time crush","**An animated film, full of rebellion and energy.**

Remember the stores that sold music records and CDs? There are still some, and the rebirth of vinyl, very recent, has allowed a certain rebirth of the commercial sector, somewhat in response to the massification and popularization of music in “streaming” and digital downloads that we already have as something common in our lives. This film is about a store open 24 hours a day, with spaces to sell and listen to music. It is managed by young people, with young employees, an idiot owner and a manager who dreams of buying the space. It turns out that one of the employees decided to go to a casino and lost all the money saved for that project.

The action takes place the day after the incident. In addition to the fate of the store and its employees, which is at stake, each one lives their own story, has characteristics and personality. Incidentally, the entire construction and development of the story and characters is one of the most positive aspects of the film. We have a young teenager who particularly wants to lose her virginity but has serious problems with amphetamines, an aspiring art major, a crook with a complicated childhood, a liberal girl who seems to particularly enjoy sexual adventures, a crazy rocker. In addition to the employees, we also have a former musical star who decides to go there to promote a new CD and cause some funny problems.

The film has an impressive cast, and it's worth seeing who the actors are and where they are today. We understand well that each one wanted to make the best use of this opportunity. Contrary to what the posters suggest, Liv Tyler, who is the daughter of a rock musician, has a character without a leading role, but does an excellent job, even acting opposite her (then) stepfather, Coyote Shivers. Rory Cochrane, Renée Zellweger and Ethan Embry are also here, and each of them does a very competent job. Despite the centrality of his character, Anthony La Paglia does not steal the spotlight for himself and shares our attention with his co-stars generously and doing a very well done job. We also have Robin Tunney, bald and rebellious, Debi Mazar and Johnny Whitworth. The less sympathetic roles go to Max Caulfield and Ben Bode, and they're refreshingly comic.

On a technical level, what stands out positively is the enormous animation of the film. There are no dead moments. The story is constructed in such a way as to give us a kind of moral about the brevity of life and the need to take advantage of the time, live life, even taking risks and making mistakes. Added to this is a strident soundtrack, full of strength, where rock predominates and emanates energy, positivity and rebelliousness. The songs used here are well known and fans of the rock genre will love it. Incidentally, the albums released with the soundtrack were a success, in absolute contrast to the film itself, which failed in cinemas, was bombed by critics and only acquired a certain popularity and public recognition in much more recent years. Perhaps it was simply ahead of its time."

I liked it enough at the time to not only keep the vhs tape, but also, when we transitioned to dvd, I used my DVD player/recorder to transfer it to a disk.

Of course the viewing quality is subpar, but when I saw it is on a streaming service I don’t subscribe to, I decided to watch my flawed copy. I didn’t quite like it as much as I did previously, but perhaps the intervening 30 years have something to do with that. It is still a pleasant watch. Corey Haim does a fine job portraying the brainy nerd who is advanced scholastically and attends with students a couple years old than he is. He is basically a Junior high (or middle school) student in high school.

Lucas spends much of the movie pretending. He assumes he has a chance with an attractive older girl who obviously just wants to be friends, he tells fibs about his living situation, and he unrealistically tries out for the football team.

I thought the movie could have done more with Winona Rider’s character. She has a few lines but she is interested in Lucas herself, and I suspect more of her was on the cutting room floor. The scenes of the actual football plays on the field were totally false. I know that science fiction, for example, doesn’t always use appropriate science to explain stuff that happens, but just a little consulting with someone who knows the game at all could have made the plays accurate without changing the result. Come on, refs!

There is a small twist at the end that is a nice touch, an appropriate ending for a movie aimed largely at teens. || ""Lucas"" is a low key film throughout which tackles the difficult subject of first love and all the pain and heartbreak it can sometimes bring. It doesn't treat such delicate matters of the heart in a superficial manner and there is ample opportunity to actually get to know the small ensemble of characters at the heart of this film and that provides us with a genuine reason to become interested in them and in what happens to each one of them during the unfolding events of the story. The overall ambitions of this film are extremely modest and that is its strength, so when young Lucas achieves a measure of respect from his once dismissive peers this triumph has a lasting effect in what is essentially a memorable and well made film."

High Fidelity is directed by Stephen Frears and adapted to screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg from the Nick Hornby novel. It stars Cusack, Jack Black, Iben Hjejle and Todd Louiso. Music is by Howard Shore and Cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.

Record store owner and compulsive list-compiler Rob Gordon (Cusack), embark's upon a what does it all mean mission when his latest girlfriend leaves him.

Cusack and Pink take Hornby's hugely popular novel and redirect it to Chicago, with joyous results. High Fidelity is a tale of human love and a love of music, a sort of battle of the sexes with a soundtrack of masculine life. Rob's voyage of self discovery is highly amusing, the trials and tribulations of relationships bringing out a number of scenes and scenarios that ring true, not just tickling the funny bones, but also tugging the heart and cradling the brain.

Away from the doomed love angles it's the music threads that literally strike the chords. Rob and his two co-workers Barry (Black) & Dick (Louiso) worship music and continually indulge in making top 5 lists whilst bickering with sarcastic glee in the process. All three actors are superb, a trio of odd balls bouncing off of one and other with a zest that's infectious, though it's decidedly Cusack's show. A perpetual miserablist who addresses us the audience at frequent intervals, Rob in Cusack's hands garners sympathy, pity and laughs in equal measure.

In the support slots is a ream of talent well in on the joke, beauties like Catherine Zeta-Jones (dropping F-Bombs like they are going out of fashion), Lisa Bonet & Joelle Carter are complimented by the comic skills of Joan Cusack, while Hjejle turns in a wily and womanly performance as the girlfriend who kicks starts Rob's search for meaning. Elsewhere the sight of Tim Robbins as a new age hippy type - with a black belt in martial arts - is so much fun it reminds of what a good comic actor he can be as well. 

As with Grosse Point Blank, another Cusack/Pink production, sound tracking is everything, and naturally given the setting of the story there is an abundance of classic tunes to delight in. All told it's a special movie, for all sexes and for all music lovers, but especially for anyone who has had relationship problems. Now what did come first, the music or the misery? Priceless. 9/10 || Seen this one a few times over the years, still great each viewing with John Cusack in his element, might even argue should've been nominated for an Oscar. I'm not a music fan but still liked that element and features a good supporting cast. **3.75/5** || **_Romantic head games become tedious_**

Released in 2000 and directed by Stephen Frears, ""High Fidelity"" is a romcom/dramedy starring John Cusack, as Rob, the owner of a Chicago record store, co-starring Jack Black and Todd Louiso as his two employees, Barry and Dick. When Rob's relationship with his live-in girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle) falls apart, he reflects on the five worst break-ups of his dozen years of dating. His past girlfriends are played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joelle Carter, Lili Taylor and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Tim Robbins appears as Rob's rival for Laura's affections while Joan Cusack is on hand as Laura's sister. Lisa Bonet plays a rocker chick, a passing fancy for Rob. Sara Gilbert has a bit part.

What's interesting about ""High Fidelity"" is that it features the five general prototypes of guys' dating life: (1.) the first crush & kiss, (2.) adolescent urgency & loss of virginity, (3.) the hot babe out of his league, (4.) the rebound best friend & soul mate, and (5.) his one true love (maybe).

If you've ever made a compilation tape for a babe and worked at a record store you might appreciate this film. You'll particularly like it if you favor romantic head games, which I find irritating and is the main reason I have mixed feelings about the film (speaking as a one-woman type of guy). Because of this, I had a hard time staying with it, although there's enough good in the movie to make it somewhat worthwhile. It's witty and you can tell the creators put a lot of thought into it, but Rob's mopey reflections as he constantly speaks to the camera get tedious after a while. Don't get me wrong, John pulls off the challenging lead role and does so convincingly; I just found his perpetually-smoking character uninteresting. As far as the soundtrack goes, the 90's pop rock struck me as mostly bland.

Thankfully, there are several amusing moments. For instance, the scene where someone confronts Rob at the record store in the second half is laugh-out-loud funny, but Rob's relationship with Laura is decidedly Uninteresting; and Laura's emotional instability and indecisiveness become increasingly annoying (anyone who would marry such a relationally fickle person would have to be insane). Actually, most of Rob's romantic relationships become annoying although, like I said, there are amusing bits. Then there's Barry who arrogantly thinks his opinion on music is law; I kept hoping he'd get his teeth knocked in. On a positive note, the mental manipulations of Rob's unstable romantic life are offset by Dick, who shows the way to go.

""Empire Records"" (1995) is the better movie simply because it doesn't go overboard with the dating/romance head games crap.

The film runs 113 minutes and was shot in Chicago.

This is a Dreamworks animation at a time when Disney was still doing strong 2d animations.  It does look like Dreamworks attempted a shift to digital cell animation around the same time (based on this movie), so at least the animation is smooth and of a good quality.

As with most Dreamworks products, I don't enjoy the same art style they seem to love, which always makes it a little hard for me to watch regardless of if the movie is actually good.  I also didn't care for the voices, not saying the actors did a bad job, but the direction was of my taste.

The story itself is based on El Dorado being a big deal, but as worthless as gold actually is, it is really hard for me to personalize with it.  They're also criminals, and not the redemptive kind.  They don't become good people until they start actively going against the head priest.  Thinking about it, I also have a lot of issues with the European-god confusion, so there may be a lot of me not enjoying the premise more than anything.

I'm honestly struggling to find things that I enjoyed other than it was a well produced animation, and I can't say much else that the story is at least structured well so there is something you could enjoy."

What if he returned to Neverland?

RELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Hook"" stars Robin Williams as a corporate American Lawyer who must go to the island of Neverland after his two kids are kidnapped in London by Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). He has misadventures with the fairy Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts), pirates and a group of ragtag lost boys led by Rufio (Dante Basco); meanwhile hook tries to win the affections of his kids. Maggie Smith and Gwyneth Paltrow are on hand as older and younger versions of Wendy respectively.

This is a family-oriented adventure/fantasy/comedy cut from the same cloth as ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968), ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" (2004) and ""Into the Woods"" (2014); it’s just not a musical like some of those flicks even though a song or two are featured. Depending on your tastes, “Hook” is no better or worse than any of these movies (although “The Wizard of Oz” is in a league of its own, of course).

While I love serious swashbuckling, Peter Pan was always too kiddie/fantasy-based for my tastes. This is ironic since I have Peter Pan Syndrome, which Spielberg also admitted to; and my wife has The Wendy Dilemma (look ’em up). Fans of Peter Pan will favor this flick more than me.

Nevertheless, it was made by scores of talented people and contains some genuinely amusing moments (I busted out laughing at least four times). Hoffman’s titular character is iconic. And Roberts works surprisingly well as Tinkerbell, but they should’ve accented her beauty further. Speaking of which, the film needs more feminine sex appeal. Even the makers of “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” knew enough to include a little bit.

Both Spielberg and Williams liked the two bookend sequences, but have reservations about the long Neverland middle-piece, which is the bulk of the picture. Williams admitted he felt lost in Neverland, probably because he was thrust from one misadventure to another so briskly. But the pre-CGI sets are colorful and imaginative; it’s a fun movie with a lot of energy. Peter Pan just ain’t my thang.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour, 22 minutes (overlong). WRITERS: James V. Hart, Nick Castle and Malia Scotch Marmo wrote the script based on concepts from the works of J.M. Barrie, particular “Peter and Wendy” (1911). BOX OFFICE: The movie cost $70 million (not including marketing) and made $301 million worldwide with $120 million of that domestically. While it was the fourth highest-grossing movie worldwide in 1991, it was still considered a disappointment by producers, the greedy bastages.

GRADE: B-/C+ || There will never be a better Peter Pan movie ever. This movie is so old but every time I watch it, I love it. || Ok, so it's not the original 1953 Disney classic, but it is still a great fun adventure that, surely, brings out the kid in all of us. ""Peter Banning"" is an hot shot businessman who rather carelessly neglects his family. When he heads to London from the USA with them to meet with ""Granny Wendy"" (Dame Maggie Smith) we learn that he was adopted, but only after being discovered by the old lady who looked after a great many orphans - not least his wife ""Moira"" (Caroline Goodall). It's only when his two children are mysteriously kidnapped from their nursery late one snowy evening, he begins to remember his life before his adoption - and with the help of some magic and sparkle from ""Tink"" (Julia Roberts) is soon back in ""Never Never Land"" facing his arch-nemesis ""Capt. Hook"" (Dustin Hoffman) in a battle royal to reclaim his children. Still sceptical about the whole thing - he must learn to believe, to hope and to feel joy again before he has any hope of convincing the ""Lost Boys"" to assist in his dangerous quest. It's great fun, this film. Hoffman is super as the hook-toting' sophisticate-cum-baddie, and even the kids are not too annoying. Indeed, they have some cracking food fights and there is loads of acrobatics and mischief too. I wasn't mad about the concept of ""the Pan"" - that seemed just a little too oppressive, menacing - sterile even given the whole purpose of Sir J. M. Barrie's book is to remind us about what is important life - people, loyalty, love - and most of all - fun!! Yes, it is a bit lengthy. It takes far too long to get going, but once it does it is well worth a chortle as the script offers humour for all ages and the score, well that is instantly recognisable from John Williams. I'm a great fan of this story, and if this goes half way to perpetuating the delightful sentiment (and partially funding London's Great Ormond Street Hospital) then that can only be for the better.

Just as with it's forbear, this is a great looking piece of cinema. The sparing appearances of Agnes Ayres (his mother) help to ensure the narrative continues smoothly and this has altogether more pace and adventure to keep the hour or so from getting too bogged down in the rather formulaic plot. There is clearly some chemistry between the two, Valentino seems more invested in this than with his 1921 character - and that engages the audience more. You feel that he really has some skin in the game and though we wouldn't know it at the time, this serves as a fitting cinematic epitaph - following the excellent ""Eagle"" (1926) - as his last film before his untimely death."

When her father is shot and killed, Mattie Ross is outraged and thirsting for revenge. Seeking out Rooster Cogburn based on his gritty reputation, and aided by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, they head off to find the killer.

It's not bold or foolish to say that John Wayne has not only been in better films, he's also given better performances than his Oscar winning turn here in True Grit. However, few of his fans, or anyone who had watched his career closely, were complaining that the big man collected the pinnacle of acting awards. True Grit is a highly entertaining picture that when all is said and done, is as much about Wayne's image as it is a revenge character driven piece. Suffering with ill health in the twilight of his career, Wayne delivers a warm and humble performance as Cogburn. Eye patch over one eye, Rooster Cogburn is a rapscallion who is impossible to dislike, and that comes down to Wayne and his mannered performance.

True Grit is boosted by the sparky performance of Kim Darby as Mattie Ross, with the chemistry between herself and Wayne warm and honest, and this gives the film its emotional core, with both characters needing each other without even knowing it. It almost wasn't to be for Darby though, Mia Farrow was the preferred choice for Mattie, but Farrow unwisely took advice from a mischievous Robert Mitchum and turned down the part, something she is quoted as saying she regretted for the rest of her career. Faring not so well, though, is Glen Cambell as LaBoeuf, guilty of trying too hard, he just becomes hard to take seriously, and this even in the jovial moments. Robert Duvall lands bad guy duties but doesn't quite get to grips with it, and the rest of the cast are merely making up the numbers. 

Thankfully director Henry Hathaway shoots it just about right, he, along with his excellent cinematographer Lucien Ballard, are framing Wayne and all his iconic being in one loving movie. So in what could have been a standard hunt the villain picture, actually turns out to be quite a character driven treat. 8/10 || This has got to be one of the finest of this genre ever made. Wayne is superb as a tough, uncompromising US marshal engaged by a naive, but headstrong Kim Darby to avenge the murder of her father. The vain, self-assured Texas Ranger ""La Beouf"" (Glen Campbell) is also on the hunt and the three of them set off to track down ""Lucky Ned Pepper"" and his gang. The photography is stunning and we do get quite a sense of the sheer scale of the territory as they close in on their prey. This is a well written, tensely, even - on occasion - quite humorously directed movie with some great music and indubitably a legend out in front who isn't afraid to look old and out of condition. Robert Duvall plays a mean ""Ned Pepper"" and Strother Martin has some fun as the horse-broker. This is super cinema."

She’s rather an eccentric woman but she instantly recognises that this lad has skills - and, that he has a few issues too. As his home life becomes more strained and his mum’s business goes down the tubes he begins to lose focus. That’s only made worse by her upstairs neighbour “Jenny” (Twiggy) with whom he becomes just a little bit obsessed. It may be that the rapport between teacher and pupil and a forthcoming chance to prove his mastery of the piano on a grand scale are the necessary steps “Manek” needs to take as he nears an adulthood he craves? It helps that there are some gorgeous piano solos from Chopin and Schumann here, and I thought that aside from turning in a solid effort as the young lad, Chowdhry also did a mean job on the piano-synch work too. Dame Peggy Ashcroft’s “Lady Emily” provides, sparingly, for a benign influence on the proceedings but it’s really all about a MacLaine who portrays her flawed, proud and frustrated character - and I think she does it with some skill. There’s that horrible adage about people who can do and people who can’t teach - and to an extent you see her character almost jealous of the potential of her young charge as he gradually, under her sometimes quite aggressive tutelage, begins to show his true potential! It’s quite an intricately knitted combination of the prolific with the obligatory melodrama, but that latter familial discord element is kept to manageable levels that leaves us with quite an engaging combo of veteran and newcomer and there’s even a ditty from Twiggy, too. The production design is classy, the dialogue doesn’t let the story hang about and though it does sag a little from time to time, is still worth a watch."

More than that, she’s a superfan of his work and so makes it clear that his care is a labour of love she is well prepared to carry out. Gradually, though, he begins to realise that she isn’t quite the woman she’s claiming to be. He is locked in and isolated, and when she begins to suggest that he reactivate one of the lapsed characters from his novels - well let’s just say she has some fairly unique methods of persuasion at her disposal.

Some of Caan’s facial expressions are super here, especially towards the end - but it’s the menacingly angelic effort from Bates that steals the show here and makes this quite possibly my favourite adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Those, I usually found, were rarely the most substantial of stories, but here he has provided some personas for both to sink their teeth into, and it also delivers one of those scenes that will live in cinema history for ever. The bleakness of their surroundings adds an extra degree of chill and Rob Reiner manages to build then sustain quite a degree of peril from pretty early on in the proceedings. It’s really not for the squeamish, nor probably for anyone who has ever written-out a popular literal character, either!"

They say that ‘Midnight Express’ did to Turkeys tourism, what ‘Jaws’ did to bathing in the sea.

Highly recommended. || Hmmm. I’m not sure time has been so kind to this, and as we look on it now it comes across as a rather condescending and stereotypical judgement of a Turkish penal system that dared to deal harshly with a drug smuggler. That character “Billy” (Brad Davis) doesn’t make it through immigration as he tries to leave Istanbul with loads of hashish strapped to his torso whilst sweating nervously. Initially, he is released on bail on the basis that he helps the authorities to trace his suppliers, but he decides to pull a fast one and that just ends up with him on the wrong end of a four year prison sentence. Now there’s no denying that life in the prison is brutal and the chief guard and slightly sexually ambiguous “Hamidou” (Paul L. Smith) has clearly got it in for the attractive young American and is aided and abetted by the odious prison Quisling “Rifki” (Paolo Bonacelli) who doesn’t much care for “Billy” either. Luckily, he does manage to make a few friends, not least the ailing Briton “Max” (John Hurt) and they manage to keep him on the straight and narrow for a while, but as some stomach-churning news reaches the young man on the verge of his release, it becomes clear that if he is to get out he is going to have to resort to more drastic action. What bothered me about this whole thing is that the entire premise seemed to be squarely attempting to illicit sympathy from us for this young man, even though he is undoubtedly guilty of his crime, by creating a culture amongst the Turks of obesity, brutishness, arbitrary violence and even a degree of depravity. At no point does Alan Parker make any effort to remind us that this real-life idiot was imprisoned because of his own actions - rather arrogant and selfish ones at that, too - and that perhaps the court was indeed trying to make an example of him to deter other likeminded individuals whose contempt for Turkey was just as culpable as his. Might we in the West not react the same if someone was caught here, and have we never seen films depicting atrocities in our own prisons? I don’t like being manoeuvred into a position where I’m encouraged to sympathise for a character just because of excess and exaggeration provided for creative licence. Davis, it also has to be said, looks easy enough on the eye but his acting prowess is ropey and inconsistent throughout. Indeed it’s really only Hurt and Bonacelli who can lay claim to any dramatic plaudits as this dark and gritty drama leads us by the nose.

I won't lie - it can be slow progress at times. It's not always helped by the rather soporific Artemyev score, and the pace is a little wobbly as we get to grips with the scenario, but once there this is a considered look at just how the human mind may/can/will work when tested and it's well illustrative of the fact that there is way more out there that we don't understand than we do.

According to the Writers Guild of America the greatest screenplay of all time belongs to _Casablanca_. A sentimental favourite, no doubt, worthy for a handful of catchy one-liners capped off with a convincing dump-the-dame speech. While Bogie plays himself, Bergman, who may have been the most beautiful woman of all time, didn't have much to say. The best moments in Casablanca were, in fact, the silent ones, and without Bogie and Bergie's chemistry, it probably wouldn't have made the top 10.

Best screenplay suggests best story, best plot, best characters and dialogue; best combination of drama, comedy, intrigue, emotional engagement, suspense, social and political relevance; one peppered with casual everydayisms, baited with humour and simmering with intelligence, threatening to release an experiential payload of euphoric proportions; a work that can transcend genre and demographics, build up simultaneously on various levels, plumbed by the weight of it's essential voice, sending out intuitive signals, rippling with perplexing channels and insightful glimpses that are symbolically blended into plain words on paper; all with a properly superb balance of sex, wit, desire, comfort, fear, anger and wisdom in an accelerated narrative leading us to a magnificent crescendo and--fade out--leaving us to wonder. Furthermore, great screenplays serve the motion-picture medium's incomparable ability to effortlessly jump time and space. _Casablanca_ is static and contained, framed and nailed to the wall: a pretty photograph. 

Despite the WGA's endorsement, there can only be one candidate good enough to qualify for the all-time best screenplay, and fittingly it goes to the all-time best screenplay writer. Paddy Chayefsy's _Network_ has dazzled us for four decades and counting. The scene where a mob of murderous bank-robbing terrorists who have their own reality TV show bicker over the wording of their contract alone demonstrates we are dealing with a higher grade of pertinent genius. The corporate cosmology of Arthur Jensen, a pivotal lesson in global economics, tops it off, leaving all Network's competitors in the dust, burying any climactic speech written before or since, Bogie's famous brush-off farewell included, thus slamming the lid down on anything _Casablanca_ can play. As for ill-fated romances, the doomed alliance between old-school journalism (Holden) seduced and corrupted into severing his ties with his compassionate spouse to hastily shack up with the opportunistic post-modern media wench (Dunaway) is fraught with more complications than anything _Casablanca_ can muster, and it's only one of the sub-plots.

Of course _Network_ is most famous for the ""I'm mad as hell"" rant, which swells from a nuanced and complex story arc demonstrating the rise and fall of an iconic media star. Hell-raising public mischief aside, Howard Beale's profound narrative leads off with a suicidally desperate, washed-up newsman who impulsively hits a nerve, rockets to stardom as a modern-day prophet, then is shaped and sensationalized as an overcooked parody by the media, stigmatized by maniacal Fox-news-like delusions that overtake him until he gets too big for his britches and needs a walloping corporate scolding, causing his starry streak to fizzle out, before getting gunned down by the greedy TV execs who made him, leaving hapless undiscriminating audiences to grasp for the next new thing.

_Network_ is inspired writing that doesn't require heart-throbbing movie stars to pull it off. It could have been directed by my illiterate grandmother, shot on VHS in a dingy church basement, performed by eager boy scouts and girl guides, and it would still be the greatest screenplay of all time, one not just for the spectacle of projecting on a giant screen, but for doubling as a giant mirror with just enough sugar-coated satire to swallow the shitty truth about ourselves. Though calling _Network _a satire is like calling Hamlet a murder mystery. Satire is either spineless and passive-aggressive, or specific and short-lived. Chayefsky's bombastic pronouncements become more exceptional and relevant each passing year. || Network broadcasts its televisional corruption through satirical poetry that beckons democratic madness. “I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it anymore”, screams Howard Beale from the confinement of his studio desk. Exerting his ornate insanity upon the entranced viewers who innocently stare at their cubic televisions, watching the news broadcast fuelled by media misrepresentation and propaganda. “Go to your nearest window and scream”, acting as the voice of the working class, benign to the American corporate fundamentals that masquerade the politics of democracy. In an age where leading actors can represent constituencies or states, and businessmen can be presidential candidates for a nation (and successfully winning...), Lumet’s timeless satire on conceptualised democracy is one that grows more appropriate with each passing decade.

A statement on the American financial system, where colossal stock markets rule the supposed freedom of the people. Broadcasting networks more focussed on combating against each other for monetary viewership, leading to exaggerated fabrications, rather than reporting the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Exploiting the frail mentality of humanity to feed the greed and lust of “humanoid” managers, capitalising on the naivety of man.

Network depicts the modern evolution of communicating false truths. As technology evolves, we grow more and more susceptible to the “truth” that is conveyed to us. We, much like sponges, absorb the information demonstrated through the porous pixels that we subject our eyes to. Televisions. And through hyperbolised satire, including planning an assassination attempt and coercing suicidal tendencies, Lumet offers a cutthroat insight into broadcasting institutions and the meticulous methods in which networks function. Motivated by stock shares and rating dominance. Pioneering the consumption of propagandist material. Lumet exploits the audacious power of televisions and its communicative abilities, turning an often comedic satire into a transcendental horror feature.

Powered by sterling performances all-round, including the elusively commanding Dunaway, the maddening lunacy of Finch and the smoothly suave Holden, the poetic dialogue immediately captures the attention of its audience. Concisely elaborate with a hint of existential analysis, an ornate lexicon that refrains viewers from tuning out. Lumet’s long sumptuous takes, allowing the performances to ironically hypnotise, further extend the reach of its material. Superlative direction that, whilst suddenly throws you into the immediate chaos of Beale’s mentality, eases the hectic pace with its scathing power.

The offscreen affair between Dunaway and Holden was the only underdeveloped sub-plot, reinforcing her workaholic agenda that likened her to a corporate machine than to a human with emotive capabilities.

Aside from that, Network absolutely deserves its near-perfect acclaim. A considerably profound illustration of the American system that tantalisingly exposes the fraudulence of promised conceptualised democracy, whilst also enforcing the relinquishment of humanity through television sets. Harrowing times we live in... || The UPS network is a television network that suffers from a lack of viewership. This led to the layoff of a group of their employees, including the great media night news presenter, Howard Beale, and this led to the events of a psychological impact on Beale, so he promised that he would commit suicide in front of the camera the next day.

The conditions and conditions of the network changed after Beale's decision to commit suicide in front of the camera the next day. The film takes us through the changes that occur to the network after this incident. How did Howard get the situation to the brink, how does the network deal with the crisis, and how do they benefit from the incident, or in a more correct, how do they exploit it to increase the number of views and return the network to the most powerful television network in America.

The film focuses on 4 characters, the first character is Diana Christensen, a character who doesn't care about high principles in the media and tries in various ways to do anything, even if it is bad, in order to make the network gain more views, a character that surprises you a lot because of her orientations. The second character is Howard Beale and the internal factors that led him to stand in front of the camera, fragile and mind-bending. Is it personal or is the network related?

The third character, who are the members of the network and the fate of the company, what are the things they will do in order to save the network from collapse and raise viewing rates and ratings, even if at the expense of harming others, literally anything?

The last character is the viewers. How do they want to attract viewers to the network as long as possible to ensure higher profits and the viewer to stay for as long as possible? This requires many things that you will see in the movie.

What I liked about the film is that the film was able to mock companies, criticize societies, and focus on the weakness of people through its story and not through direct messages. The highest number of views.

What we see now in the media in the 21st century, we see that this is true, although the film says that it is based on fictional events. How do the minds of the media founders play with the minds of the viewers through the television screens that reach every home? It was formulated well. Are people only looking for entertainment, even if it is at the expense of harming others? All these ideas and questions are employed in a coherent story and seen through its complex characters."

No Way Out is directed by Roger Donaldson and adapted to screenplay by Robert Garland from the novel ""The Big Clock"" written by Kenneth Fearing. It stars Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, Will Patton, George Dzundza and Howard Duff. Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by John Alcott.

Already filmed impressively as The Big Clock in 1948, Fearing's ingenious source material gets a shift to a Pentagon backdrop and still comes out a winner. Putting their own spin on the central story, that of a man finding he is investigating ""himself"" during a murder enquiry, the makers unfurl a labyrinthine plot that keeps up the suspense quota right to the very end.

In true noir style, the story is crammed with double bluffs, deceit, sex and death, with the added ingredient of politico intrigue to spice things still further. Cast are led superbly by Costner and Hackman, though Young is a bit too dull an actress to really put fire into the key femme role, and Alcott makes great use of the real Washington locations to bring visual authenticity to the story's setting.

Jarre's score is hokey sounding and doesn't sit right with the dramatics on show, while the big reveal at the finale is still as divisive today as it was back on the film's release, but this is still a fine example of a film noir remake that really works for the neo-noir loving crowd. 8/10 || Life in DC and The Pentagon during the mid-80s

RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Roger Donaldson, ""No Way Out” is a political drama/thriller starring Keven Costner as a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy who falls in love with a woman of dubious morality (Sean Young) and is thrust into a cover-up/witch hunt after a tragedy. Gene Hackman plays his “boss” at the Pentagon, the Secretary of Defense, while Will Patton appears as the Secretary’s loyal and diligent assistant. 

This remake of 1948's “The Big Clock"" makes great use of Washington DC & surrounding area (e.g. Arlington) with sweet opening and closing aerial views. The Pentagon is a focal point with much of the drama taking place in that iconic building. There’s a worthy surprise in the plot so pay attention.    

Roger Ebert overrated this movie in 1987, giving it a perfect rating. The first half is a great setup, but the second half is merely okay and sometimes comes off as a TV production, verging on amateurish (you’ll see what I mean). The photo that the computer slowly materializes is a particularly quaint element; and the distinctly 80’s score doesn’t help. 

Still, there’s enough good here to make “No Way Out” worth checking out if it sounds appealing to you. Although Hackman is almost wasted in a role where he is relegated to sitting around looking concerned, Patton’s passionate work makes up for it; Costner and Young too.

Aside from a few scenes from their card-playing buddies and a rather difficult double date with posh Brits ""Gwendolyn"" (Carole Shelley) and ""Cecily"" (Monica Evans) - which follows a scene of domestic petulance over some tardiness and meatloaf that is instantly recognisable to most of us, this is a fine example of two actors who gel really well on screen.

The Outlaw Josey Wales is directed by Clint Eastwood, who also stars as Wales, and is adapted by Sonia Chernus & Phil Kaufman from the novel ""The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales"" written by Forrest Carter. Joining Eastwood in the cast are Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, John Vernon & Paula Trueman. Music is by Jerry Fielding and Bruce Surtees photographs on location in Utah, Arizona & Wyoming.

We are at the very end of the American Civil War and Josey Wales is a contented family man working on his Missouri farm. But his peaceful world is shattered when Union soldiers raid his home and murder his wife and child. Surviving the attack, Josey takes up arms with a group of Confederate guerrilla fighters who take the fight to the Redlegs. However, when the news comes that the war is over and the Confederates are required to surrender, Josey refuses to do so. A wise choice since his group are rounded up and slaughtered in cold blood. So Josey is forced to go on the lam as an outlaw, where hot on his trail are the Redleg group fronted by bloodthirsty Captain Terrill. On his way, as he contemplates survival and what life has in store for he and his aggressors, Josey acquires some interesting companions.

Acclaimed by the critics upon its release, The Outlaw Josey Wales is ageing like a fine wine. It's a film Eastwood himself is very proud of, citing it as one of the high points in his career. Yet the film got off to a difficult start. It was originally given to Kaufman to direct with Eastwood's Malpaso company producing, but the star and director fell out over Kaufman's directing style - and that a certain Sondra Locke was turning the heads of both men. As we now know, there was only one winner there.

The story is a classic Western tale, hell it's a powerful tale, one with layers that peel off as the film progresses. Josey Wales starts out a peaceful family man but after having that stripped away from him by violence, he too is forced to take up violence in response. So far so formulaic then. But the film is so much more than just a Western revenge yarn, even if that aspect of the story is darn good as Clint gets mean and broody and pulls his pistols. There's a real strong family thread throughout, from losing his own kin in the beginning - to a father son relationship - and on to the way he acquires a new family on his travels, it's very strong and gives the narrative a real emotional kick. As Josey goes on his way, angry, bitter and prepared to face the consequence of his choices, the character is constantly forming. It was only after a number of viewings that I personally realised that Josey Wales the man was being healed by the ragtag assortment of individuals that he collects on route to his character being rebuilt.

Eastwood the actor here is on fine form, cool and every inch a man's man. But even Eastwood wouldn't decry the scene stealing excellence of Chief Dan George as Lone Watie. His dry wit puts him in the top tier of Western comedy sidekicks, but rest assured the character is more than that. For Watie acts as a sort of spiritual mentor to Wales, and Eastwood reacts positively to George's serene acting to give the film its tight bonded centre. The rest of the cast are a much of a muchness but all serve the story well with solid performances. In fact it's a rare occasion when Locke's vacant method acting actually works well! Eastwood the director is calm, assured and subtle in pacing, with his storytelling boosted considerably by Fielding's popping score and Surtees' gorgeous cinematography. The script is awash with attentive dialogue and punching moments of humour, whilst its noticeable denouncement of violence and intelligent portrayals of the Indians is to be roundly applauded.

Iconography unbound and bulging with class in the writing, The Outlaw Josey Wales is not just one of Eastwoods best Westerns. It's one of the best Westerns period. I reckon so. 10/10 || **_One of the Great Westerns_**

The Civil War is over and the remaining rebels in Missouri are encouraged to turn over their weapons and pledge loyalty to the Union, but Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) hold out and thus a generous reward is put on his head. Josey heads to West Texas and maybe Mexico to find sanctuary, but will he make it alive? The cast includes the likes of Bill McKinney, John Vernon, Sondra Locke, Chief Dan George, Sam Bottoms and Will Sampson.  

“The Outlaw Josey Wales” (1976) is Eastwood’s best Western and a standout of the genre. Everything clicks for a top-of-the-line drama/adventure. A critic said that Wales’ encounter with the Federals in the first act establishes him as invincible and thus destroys any sense of suspense. No, it just means that he caught the soldiers by surprise and he escaped the clash unscathed with a mixture of skill and luck. A later scene reveals he’s decidedly mortal. 
 
The movie starts with the typical Bob Steele revenge plot and soon morphs into a trail movie (similar to a “road movie,” but with horses). As such, some interesting characters come-and-go (or, more accurately, come-and-die), but several stay on. It’s a string of memorable episodes on the long trail, like the river crossing and Josey’s well-done pow-wow with Ten Bears (Will Sampson). I like the emphasis on how an outcast can acquire an unconventional family, even if inadvertently.     

The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Oroville, California; Arizona; and Kanab Movie Ranch, Utah. Wyoming is also listed.

GRADE: A || A little overlong, though <em>'The Outlaw Josey Wales'</em> is an entertaining watch - with cool action sequences and a pleasing ending.

You have a strong performance from Clint Eastwood and good support showings from the likes of Chief Dan George and John Vernon. The plot is interesting and the road-esque nature of it keeps it moving well. I do think they could've trimmed the run time slightly, while Eastwood's character really didn't need to spit so much - on a dog and some insects, no less. Just bizarre, it adds zero and simply becomes an irritation.

A sequel, without the involvement of Eastwood, was released ten years after this - I'm intrigued to check it out."

The story gets sappy and sentimental in places, is rather predictable and has too much religion to suit me, but that last thing may suit you just fine, praise be. It was co-written and directed by the actress Bonnie Hunt, who is a supporting character in the film.

But there is a spark of chemistry between the two lead characters, the dialogue is smart and sharp, and the movie is rich with its supporting cast, such as Jim Belushi, Robert Loggia and Archie Bunker - I mean Carroll O’Connor. Plus I have liked Minnie Driver since Circle of Friends.

10479.0,Rules of Engagement,A Marine Colonel is brought to court-martial after ordering his men to fire on demonstrators surrounding the American embassy in Yemen.,A hero should never have to stand alone.,"War, Drama",128,2000-04-07,en,6.252,735,2.1137,"Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Greenwood",William Friedkin,"vietnam veteran, court case, wound, colony, life-saver, lawyer","**It had everything to be much better and complex, but it was deliberately simplified to become a courtroom drama with touches of puffed up patriotism.**

I was never in the military, I didn't need to be (I'll be the first to volunteer if my country needs it), but I am the son of an ex-military man, a war veteran with years of combat in Africa. And I know that, when you are in a combat scenario, the rules don't matter, what matters is getting out of there alive, and the concern of an officer with soldiers in his charge is to accomplish the mission with the minimum of casualties, to do the job and come back with all the boys. My father taught me this and told me several stories that prove it, and I'm talking about this now because the film, due to its theme, makes me remember and think about it.

The script begins with a combat in the middle of Vietnam, where an officer, Terry Childers, executes a captured Viet Cong to force the commander of the hostile force, also taken prisoner, to order his men to retreat. That is, he clearly violates a combat rule in order to save the lives of soldiers under his command. Years later, he is sent to Yemen to protect the US embassy, which is surrounded by a hostile mob and under sniper fire. In the evacuation of the embassy, Childers loses three soldiers and sees a fourth comrade fall, mortally wounded, ordering the others to return fire and fire on a crowd killing 83 people. In the following months, however, he is taken to the Military Court and accused of murder and inappropriate conduct of an officer, calling to defend him an old friend from Vietnam, Hays Hodges, who owes him his life for what he did there.

We've had our fair share of movies with military courts and trials, that's not new, and director William Friedkin made the mistake of turning the movie into a simple courtroom drama. The plot is effective in the task of making us doubt Childers' guilt, and leaves the public free to support him or not, but it does so effortlessly, going in simple ways: for example, demonizing politicians and highlighting a cabal. to withhold evidence and force the court to convict him. It is quite obvious that there are powerful people interested in condemning him and using him as a sacrificial lamb to remedy a political and diplomatic imbroglio. Unfortunately, the film does not explore this, it pushes more complex issues out of the way, it never addresses the position of the State Department or even that of the President and everything is simplified, resulting in a film that, despite being entertaining, is quite forgettable.

The cast has a range of excellent actors and very solid credits for the characters they will play. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson have already done other similar jobs and are very safe bets for the two central characters in the plot. However, none of them will one day be remembered for this film. Guy Pearce also does a satisfactory job and within what could be expected from the actor. Ben Kingsley makes a relatively brief appearance and doesn't add much to the film, but the one who really does poorly is Bruce Greenwood. He plays the role of a cabinet politician... yet the character is downright underwritten and is only here to be hated by all of us.

Technically, the film is up to the standards of what I call ""American patriotic films"". It has good cinematography and good effects, a very martial soundtrack, excellent action scenes with good combat moments and, of course, the ubiquitous flag of the USA, revered and protected by the blood of heroic soldiers. Here, without a doubt, we feel the aroma of advertising. The USA is a country that likes to meddle in the affairs of other countries and assumes the role of the planet's police, but it is enough that the polls of the electorate are more adverse than the generals immediately order the withdrawal of troops. We saw the result of all this patriotism in Kabul very recently, but those of us who are older will remember Saigon. || After a squad of US Marines are despatched to rescue their embattled ambassador to the Yemen (Sir Ben Kingsley), the mission turns quite deadly and the National Security Advisor (Bruce Greenwood) concludes that it’s in everyone’s best interests to take the commander - Col. Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and hang him out to dry. Luckily for them, he has a bit of a reputation as a maverick and so the court-martial could just be a box-ticking exercise for the prosecuting Maj. Biggs (Guy Pearce). Short of allies amongst the powers that be, Childers recruits veteran Col. Hodge (Tommy Lee Jones) to put together his defence. Basically, he is being accused of ordering the indiscriminate killing of seventy-odd civilians who were besieging the embassy whilst his men were under lethal sniper fire. Unhelpfully, the video recordings from the security cameras appear to have gone missing and the diplomat he evacuated has considered his career prospects a little more pressing than worrying about what happens to this soldier. The drama delivers nothing at all new, here, but the message is a little more poignant as those judging from the safety of a courtroom have to second guess those actions under fire of a man whose face no longer fits politically. The dialogue is all pretty ropey, though, and the whole thing has a disappointing inevitability about it that fails to capitalise on quite a perilous start. Jones doesn’t really have enough to get his teeth into, Pearce seriously over-eggs his accent and the courtroom drama element is all just a bit flat, including, the rousing closing speech that makes then labours it’s point. It’s all watchable enough, but I’m not sure I will ever remember it."

Fronted by James Stewart and Kim Novak, supported by Jack Lemmon & Elsa Lanchester, this screen version of the theatre play has a modicum of charm befitting the story of a publisher who falls under the love spell of a modern day witch, but ultimately it plays out as dull.

It looks nice, both in art direction and colour photography, Jimmy and Kim are pleasant of course, and Elsa, Hermione Gingold and Pyewacket the cat are bundles of fun, yet the belly laughs are missing, a need to care about the lovelorn and the restless sadly some place else.

Major Mallory and Sgt. Miller (Robert Shaw and Edward Fox) from “The Guns of Navarone” (1961) are commissioned to Yugoslavia to find & eliminate the German spy who tried to sabotage their mission at Navarone (Franco Nero). To get there, they have to join with an American unit on a covert mission to blow up a bridge. Harrison Ford plays the leader of the operation while Carl Weathers plays a sergeant escaping the MPs, a last minute addition. Barbara Bach and Richard Kiel show up later. 

""Force 10 from Navarone” (1978) is the McDonalds equivalent of the first movie. This doesn’t mean it’s necessarily bad (after all, McDonalds ain’t bad), just that it lacks the class of its predecessor and trades it in for cartoonish writing and loads of action. It’s sort of a mixture of the first film with ""Where Eagles Dare"" (1968) and “Hornets’ Nest” (1970), but with a wildly comic book tone à la “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981), albeit less goofy and not as proficient. The cast is great, though, and the locations are to die for. It’s just that the writing is glaringly juvenile.

FYI: This was Robert Shaw's second to last movie; he died of a heart attack three months before release at the too-young age of 51.

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was mostly shot in the former Yugoslavia (e.g. Durdevica Tara Bridge on Tara River, Montenegro; and Jablanica Dam, Jablanicko Lake, Bosnia and Herzegovina).

GRADE: B- || You could always count on Ron Goodwin to come up with a lively score for a wartime movie, and he does so well here with this “Guns of Navarone” spin-off. It keeps the “Mallory” (Robert Shaw) and “Miller” (Edward Fox) roles and introduces them to American colonel “Barnsby” (Harrison Ford) as they hijack a Lancaster bomber and end up in Yugoslavia where the partisan army is fighting the encroaching Nazi war machine. The former two are up for tracking down a fifth columnist called “Nikolai” who had caused them considerable grief in Greece earlier in the war. The Colonel is to try and help the locals - led by “Petrovich” (Alan Badel) to stop the advancing army, and that means holding a vital bridge. Of course, when they arrive they have to find their potential allies, and with nobody quite sure who to trust, and the menacing “Drazak” (Richard Kiel without shiny teeth) on their trail, it’s dangerous stuff. A combination of fairly easy clues let us know who the baddie is, but as the adventure heads to it’s quite exciting denouement, there are loads of escapades for our ever diminishing squad as they set about their tasks. Ford and Shaw work well together, Fox and Franco Nero also do just about enough and the whole thing rollicks along nicely for just shy of a two hours that also introduces us to some earthily disguised WWII explosive devices. It was probably made just a decade too late to really resonate as a film about the atrocities of war, but as an action adventure film from a lesser-known theatre of the war, it’s quite an enjoyable watch that passes the time without stretching your grey cells too much."

The writing team included the writers who also gave us two other movies I like: City Slickers and Fever Pitch.

Parenthood accomplishes in general what the movie Rain Man did for my wife and me. It reminded us of our autistic daughter And made us laugh at stuff that frustrated us in “real life.“ Similarly Parenthood touches upon a lot of hotspots in the parenting experience and helps us laugh at them. Their is a fine Ensemble cast. I particularly like KianU Reeves as Tod, who seems like an inappropriate boyfriend for the daughter but who proves to be valuable in mentoring their disaffected son.

There are many memorable situations but one line my wife and I often quote even after all these years occurs when the other son Larry is pushed out of a still moving vehicle by people he owes money to. His father, played straight by Jason Robards, asked who they were. Tod replies that they were just some friends. The memorable line by Robards’ character is, “Friends. Friends slow down; they even stop.” The movie is full of good one-liners, as well as more in-depth sources of humor. You must give it a try if you haven’t seen it and you need a feel good movie. I suspect we will watch it again soon,  as we have it on DVD And it has been a while Since we have watched it. || ""Parenthood"" effortlessly covers all the trials and tribulations, the successes and the failures, the hopes and the disasters of being a parent in the modern age while also managing to underscore some of the truths about the hardships of being both a child and an adult at the same time. According to this film a man's life is all about having to do things while a woman's life is all about responsibility. Life isn't all swings and roundabouts, it is all roller coasters and roundabouts. The highs and the lows. The good and the bad. The rough and the smooth. A fistful of cliches? It doesn't matter because this film cheerfully wheels them out one by one and dusts them off and successfully manages to refresh them in a very entertaining manner."

It was the first non-pirated VHS I ever owned, and it probably informed more of my youth than I'm comfortable with admitting. _Predator_ is the sort of movie that somehow both encapsulates and transcends the 1980s, I implore anybody who unlucky enough to never have seen _Predator_ to watch it, just to fulfil the life experience.

One of only five movies that I've ever given a 5/5 star rating to.

_Final rating:★★★★★ – Transcendent entertainment! An all time great._ || Ball busting Vietnam allegory McTiernan style delivers wholesale. 

I will start this by giving my ratings, yes plural because to me as a sci-fi/action film fan the film has few peers, it is 100% pure suspense testo explosive fun that along side John McTiernan's other action template Die Hard, stands the test of time to the point that it will be thrilling viewers long after we have left this earth. So with that I give it a personal rating of 10/10, it's faultless for my needs in a genre I indulge and lose myself in on a frequent roster. For any other movie fan aware of the genre's traits and peccadilloes without being a fan of sorts, then I rate the film easily at 7 or 8 out of 10, what's not to like here?

The film is without a shadow of a doubt another allegory of Vietnam, a crack unit of soldiers are stuck in a central American jungle being killed off by an invisible enemy, the soldiers are there after being lied to by the powers that be, tactics are paramount but the enemy that stalks them holds all the aces. This crack special rescue team are a testosterone fuelled band of beef, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke & Jesse Ventura, these five alone have a combined muscle weight heavy enough to have sunk the Titanic, and McTiernan uses the beefcakes to the max in a series of joyous ball busting sequences.

The dialogue is sharp and funny with Schwarzenegger quipping his way thru the first reel, and the score from Alan Silvestri pumps the blood at just the right time, whilst the effects crew have done sterling work to bring this ""hardest man in the world versus bad ass alien predator"" to life, none more so than when viewing POV heat seeking infa-red shots as our deadly alien killer. The end throws up some interesting thoughts, that have for better or worse? Been fleshed out with further films involving the predator of the title, but one should judge this film as a single entry because it sits at the top of the tree as one of the best of it's kind; so truly this is a benchmark for the genre that will take some beating as far as I'm concerned.

Enjoy 10/10 || _**Schwarzenegger vs. ""the demon who makes trophies of man"" in the Latin American jungles**_ 

An elite squad of commandos is enlisted for a mission to the jungles of Central America to rescue some VIPs after their helicopter is downed. They soon discover that they are hunted by some kind of predator… not of this world. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star.

“Predator” (1987) mixes jungle action with otherworldly sci-fi for satisfying adventure/horror. The macho cast is superb, counterbalanced by Elpidia Carrillo as Anna. The flick’s iconic and uber-“cool” with exceptional jungle locations and cinematography, as well as F/X that hold up. Unfortunately, there’s little depth. It’s enjoyable as a popcorn movie, but also forgettable. Catch “Apocalypse Now” (1979) for the real deal in jungle adventure/horror.    

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in southern Mexico.

It is one of the most important films during the last 20 years and one of the powerful movie that left an impact on American cinema. The film talks about a hysterical, insane, murderous character who herself is a character who realizes from within that she is a murderer and describes herself with important dialogue sentences that talk about the nature of the character in the voice of the hero himself.

Patrick Bateman was a thug who wanted to convey his suffering to others, and he did not see that no one had a future. He did not show any good feelings to anyone, because his suffering wanted to convey it to everyone around him, while he was without emotion and did not desire anything but hatred and hatred for everyone. It was these sentences at the beginning and end of the movie that were a complete description of the character.

The director wanted to show the viewers the nature of Wall Street work and who works inside it in the old periods of this time, and all their concern and only goal was appearances and pretending with suits, glasses and cards that they made for themselves.

Acting was at the highest level from Christian Bale. Acting was the distinguishing element in the work, in addition to music. The idea of ​​linking musical or romantic works with a murderer was unique || I want be Patrick Bateman, well without the sociopathic tendencies and the murder, but his workout routine, apartment, and job are cool...

Though he has integrated, up to a point, he is determined to ensure that the traditions of his homeland and his faith are continued with his children.

It’s a very dark comedy this, and it captures the clashes of cultures and sexes entertainingly as well as quite potently at times. The actors playing the siblings deliver competently enough, but it’s the young snorkel-jacket wearing “Sajid” (Jordan Routledge) who steals the scenes as his youthfulness gives his character (and us) an unique observation point from which to watch his family turn from two adults with children into one all adults and just two children. It takes a swipe at arranged marriages, pride, snobbery and bloody-mindedness but it also pays respect to the older man’s traditions and illustrates with a degree of sympathy just how difficult he found it to adapt to the profound changes that were emerging around him and about which he had a frustrating lack of control.

Introduced by the outstandingly ambiguous Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies, we are introduced to the star attraction - ""Miss Sally Bowles"" (Liza Minnelli) and for the next two hours we see aspects of their stage entertainment interspersed with her life, and that of her new-found friend ""Brian"" (Michael York) as they fall in and out of love, of bed - and of bed with their friend ""Max"" (Helmut Griem) too! Just to defuse some of that intensity, there is a parallel storyline featuring the lovestruck ""Fritz"" (Fritz Wepper) who is the initially gold-digging, but ultimately sincere suitor for the hand of the Jewish heiress ""Natalia"" (Marisa Berenson). The threads of the story are perfectly knitted together by Bob Fosse, who demonstrates the odious political and anti-semitic politics whilst also presenting us with some wonderfully entertaining dance numbers staged within the confines of a real theatre. This gives us an added intimacy and richness to the performances. We see their faces, the holes in their stockings, the audience are in the thick of things and frequently participants (willingly or not!). Of course, the whole thing is really about the superb voice of Miss Minnelli - and ""Money, Money""; ""Cabaret"" and the show stopping ""Maybe This Time"" from Messrs. Kander & Ebb are the stuff of showbiz legend. Also, to be fair - which I am not always to Michael York; he turns in an honest and authentic effort as the hapless young Englishman who must adapt to his new friends and surroundings. I saw this on stage very recently, and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is as close a representation to theatre staging as I reckon it is possible to make and I thoroughly enjoyed it too! || **With qualities and many problems, it is a film that proves that the Oscars do not make films immortal or more significant.**

It's hard for me to believe how this film dominated the 1972 Oscar ceremony. That night, it proved to be a devourer of statuettes in a head-to-head duel with “Godfather”, Coppola's greatest work, winning eight awards: Best Original Soundtrack, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Actress (for Liza Minelli) and Best Supporting Actor. I know that a lot of people like to detract from the Oscars and I agree with some of their arguments, but it will be an award to be taken into account as long as it is the most prestigious cinematographic award in the world. And let's face it: eight Oscars is a lot. After seeing the film, however, I started to think that, despite his qualities, he may have been too lucky.

The film gives Liza Minelli everything she needs to shine as a top star, even though until then she could barely call herself an actress: apart from a few minor roles, she had only made two films and none of them left any relevant memory. Without much effort and with everything helping, she shows us great commitment, charisma and presence, absolutely dominating the scene. She deserves an applause and her work makes the film better. The film also features the hard-working and committed participation of Joel Grey, as the cabaret presenter. The rest of the cast is much weaker, with some actors, such as Marisa Berenson and Michael York, being particularly irritating.

Set in Berlin in the 1930s, it has good sets and costumes, managing to give us the flavor of the time and of moral decadence and the desire to escape the reality experienced in some parts of society. The cabaret is, therefore, a surreal bubble where reality does not exist. For this reason, the film fails to convey the idea of the growing popularity of the Nazis. As a musical, it's unlike any I've ever seen. In a film like “Mary Poppins”, for example, the music accompanies the action and the story doesn't stop because the characters sing and dance instead of walking and talking. Here, the songs interrupt the action and, sometimes, they do so in an unpleasant way, as if it were an intermission. To make things more difficult, the songs are uninteresting, ugly and don't stick with the ear. The film contains some nudity and touches on difficult themes (sex, abortion, homosexuality and prejudice), so it is completely unsuitable for very young children.

The biggest problem with the film is, for me, the story we are told and the fact that there isn't a single character capable of arousing any empathy. Sally, Minelli's character, is an irresponsible, self-centered, futile and toxic creature in every way, and the story told is ugly, self-indulgent, excessively bizarre and seems disorganized, very confusing and disjointed, a patchwork. surreal. Perhaps this explains why, despite the awards collected, and the qualities mentioned, this film ended up being forgotten, being unknown to most people who didn't see it at the time."

...And there you have it, folks. A single word from every letter of the title to describe the ice-cold spirit of the one and ONLY What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

This Robert Aldrich-directed, old era silver screen jewel is a phenomenal feature of cinematic art, and a legendary masterwork of prestige. Superb performances by the real-life archenemies, Davis and Crawford. Absolutely superb!

Way beyond worthy of its 5 of 5 stars rating. || Now then, settle down - turn off the phone, grab some Malbec and be prepared for one of the finest examples of character-driven cinema you are ever likely to encounter. Bette Davis is the former, rather petulant, child star ""Baby Jane"" who rather grudgingly looks after her sister - the more critically acclaimed actress ""Blanche"" (Joan Crawford) as their dotage approaches in their Hollywood home. ""Blanche"" is largely confined to a wheelchair, so is entirely dependent on her increasingly alcoholic, flaky and downright nasty sibling. Thing is, though, it's Blanche who has the money - and when she starts to discuss selling their house this riles her sister who soon has some pretty menacing thoughts about thwarting this ""betrayal"". Luckily for ""Blanche"" - their maid ""Elvira"" (Maidie Norman) starts to become aware of this rather menacing change in attitude, and well... Crawford and Davis are very much at the top of their games here, and somehow you can't help but wonder if they were really acting their socks off, or whether there was a serious bit of professional ""loathing"" going on on the set of this deftly directed Robert Aldrich classic. There is a positive sense of venom here from Davis, and her counterpart portrays the traumatised victim with great aplomb. Neither woman is afraid to ditch their more traditional glamour. Davis looks truly demented in her part as the woman with one hand on the bottle and the other on the door handle of the sanatorium - and she excels in the part. It's almost 2¼ hours long and it positively flies by. The pace is perfect, the DeVol score ebbs and flows with the frequently pithy and powerful dialogue and the photography - often tight and intimate makes this a superb example of the ultimate cinema sibling rivalry. Big screen if you can - but either way, this is just about as good as it gets."

Guys and Dolls is directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and collectively adapted to screen from the play by Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling, Abe Burrows and Damon Runyon. It stars Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra, Vivian Blaine, Robert Keith, Stubby Kaye, Sheldon Leonard, B.S. Pully and Johnny Silver. Music is by Frank Loesser and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr.  

Gambler Nathan Detroit (Sinatra) has few options for the location of his big craps game. Needing $1,000 to pay a garage owner to host the game, Nathan bets Sky Masterson (Brando) that Sky cannot get virtuous Sarah Brown (Simmons) out on a date. Despite some resistance, Sky negotiates a date with her in exchange for bringing people into her mission. Meanwhile, Nathan's longtime fiancée, Adelaide (Blaine), wants him to go legit and marry her.

Having never seen the play I have no frame of reference about the transfer to the big screen. Whilst concurring with the strongly held belief that both Brando and Sinatra are indeed miscast, the former a great actor who can barely sing, the latter a great singer given the wrong character role to play, the pic still comes out in credit for joyful entertainment.

Samuel Goldwyn forked out big money to put the source to the silver screen, and it shows as no expense is spared across the production (though Goldwyn was hugely disappointed with the box office returns). The songs are simple but all hit the foot tapping mark, the dancing choreography superb, while the booming colour photography gladdens the eyes. All told, Mankiewicz, directing his first ever musical, does a fine job.

One has to wonder how much better the pic could have been if MGM had of released Gene Kelly to play Sky Masterson, while in truth the pic is 30 minutes too long. Yet with Simmons and Blaine beguiling, and Stubby Kaye superb, it's easy to forgive the flaws and just sit back and enjoy the colourful ride. 7/10 || I think I used to like musicals more than I do now, or else I am more particular about them. I wasn’t over impressed with this classic. The acting was credible and the plot jumped along nicely.  It oh, the music. When they jump into song, you are not supposed to wish they were still speaking, are you? And it wasn’t even the quality of the singing; I don’t have all that a discerning ear for music. The songs just didn’t appeal to me, andnthatbisnthe point with a musical, right?

Perhaps it is just me. Maybe I have listened to the pulse station on Sirius satellite too long and I require a hook to pull me in. || Despite the reported controversy over who played whom in this enjoyable adaption of Damon Runyon's short stories, I reckon they got the choice right. Frank Sinatra is ""Nathan Detroit"" host of a legendary weekly crap game in New York. Only this week, with some big out-of-town hitters including legend ""Sky Masterson"" (Marlon Brando) in town - he can't find a venue, unless he can find $1,000. Catch 22? Brando, meantime is bet that he cannot get hoity-toity local Christian mission Sergeant ""Sarah Brown"" (Jean Simmons) to go to Havana with him. There is a bet riding on just about everything here.... What sets this apart for me, is that it is dominated by the male characters; there are few of the traditionally heavily choreographed dance routines; the characterisations have more punch - especially a slick and suave Brando & Simmons; and the casting is driven by cinema not theatre box office stars. Now nobody will ever be able to say that Brando was a natural born crooner; but that didn't matter - his rendition of Frank Loesser's ""Luck be a Lady"" has charm and a certain joie-de-vivre that we wouldn't necessarily have achieved from a more professional stage performer. Likewise, Jean Simmons delivers well as the puritanical salvationist whilst charmingly working her way through ""A Woman In Love"" & ""Follow the Fold"" (with Brando). Of course Sinatra is in is element with ""Adelaide"" his ode to Vivian Blaine who is great, reprising her 1950 Broadway performance as Sinatra's frequently put-upon gal, with a super song and dance routine to ""Pet Me Poppa"", too. In the end, though, I think the plaudits actually belong to Stubby Kaye (""Nicely-Nicely"") for his corking ensemble lead of ""Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat"". To it's detriment, there is little chemistry between the the two leads and that really does come across - at times like two spatting cats, but generally it is a pacy, stylish spin on spivs and gangsters that certainly made me smile and tap my toes."

Once in a while there comes a time when a film lover has their patience snapped, that we can't surely accept in this instance that poetic license is OK as an excuse purely for Hollywood to make a piece of entertainment. U-571 pretty much rips up the history books for its own ends, something that would see even the film makers themselves bow their heads during the years that followed. However... 

As a drama - cum - thriller, Jonathan Mostow's film is top end. There's some iffy acting in the support slots, but the production is still excellently put together. Suspense down below in the submarine is high anxiety, the tactics of war in the Atlantic superbly written, while the finale face off is edge of the seat gripping. It's these things that has let U-571 gain decent ratings on the main internet movie sites. 

Taken as a piece of Hollywood guff, it's a rocking war movie, one that also sounds absolutely tremendous through home cinema systems. As long as you accept it as guff - regardless of your nationality, then there is a great time to be had. But just as with films like Braveheart, do familiarise yourselves with the facts afterwards. 6/10 || I usually enjoy submarine movies. Loads of action and precious little romance to clutter up the thing. On that front, this delivers quite well as Matthew McConaughey (""Tyler"") and Bill Paxton (""Dahlgren"") lead a daring mission to capture the enigma coding machine from an U-Boat. Thanks to a broken down Nazi sub in the middle of the ocean, the initial part of the operation goes surprisingly smoothly, but just at the moment of triumph, well - the rudder comes off. They must now make the best use they can of their captured ship and try to make it home in one piece with their prize. This isn't going to be easy. The torpedo tubes don't work. the thing is held together with chewing gum and willpower and the enemy know that they are out there. If you ignore the fact that this has very little to do with the history of the actual device, well, at least until the few captions at the end - this is quite a passable adventure with plenty of action, some not so great CGI and a competent acting ensemble to do the gung ho, ye ha stuff adequately enough. It can, at times, be effectively claustrophobic and does illustrate just how precarious life could be stuck in an airless tube 600 feet under the surface - especially when some guy on top is dropping depth charges. It's watchable, but equally forgettable."

This movie is well acted and is never boring, but it is puzzling. || ***Artistic, profound, amusing, tragic, haunting coming-of-age in the 70s***

A 13 year-old girl from a Catholic family in a Detroit suburb commits suicide during the late 70s and its effects are shown over the course of the next year in the lives of her four sisters (e.g. Kirsten Dunst), her parents (James Woods & Kathleen Turner) and the boys of the community. Josh Hartnett is on hand as the school stud who’s interested in Lux (Dunst).

""The Virgin Suicides"" (1999) was Sofia Coppola’s debut film based on the book by Jeffrey Eugenides; she would go on to great success with “Lost in Translation” (2003) and the underrated “Marie Antoinette” (2006). To be expected, Sofia’s style is similar to her father, as well as Peter Weir, but maybe more focused on feminine themes. The tone of the movie is artsy and deep, but not without a sense of humor. It’s haunting, mysterious, beautiful and impenetrable, reminiscent of Weir’s “Picnic at Hanging Rock” (1975). There’s also a great 70’s soundtrack featuring well-placed songs by The Hollies, Heart, Styx, Todd Rundgren and 10cc.

The subtext on parental legalism brings to mind “Footloose” (1984), but it’s clear that the blame can’t be placed solely at the feet of the parents, who are certainly overprotective but also clearly loving to a degree. Cecilia’s rash actions are the catalyst and the domino effect comes into play coupled with the oppression of stifling legalism and perhaps passive revenge. At the end of the day, though, it comes down to just a stupid decision by teenagers. Yet the movie’s about way more than suicide and its causes. It’s about coming-of-age, seeking identity & a voice, coming-of-death and the haunting reflections of those that remain.

The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in Toronto.

GRADE: A-/B+ || Set amidst 1970s Detroit suburbia, this follows the ultimately tragic lives of five sisters who live with their teacher father (James Woods) and rather possessive mother (Kathleen Turner). It's narrated by one of their neighbours, a youth whom - along with his friends - has a bit of a crush on the girls. Disaster strikes early on when ""Cecilia"" manages to impale herself on the garden fence and what now ensues follows the family's quirkily poignant and entertaining evolution from this event. Things eventually come to an head when the girls plead with their parents to be allowed to go to a school dance whereupon ""Lux"" (Kirsten Dunst) and her all-American boyfriend ""Trip"" (Josh Hartnett) do the deed! Arriving home late, and alone, this causes ructions within the family and drives the young girl off the rails with ghastly consequences. There's a lot of nuance here. The performances from Turner, Dunst and a rather under-stated one from an increasingly effective Woods all help build this to a conclusion that is sadly, in my view, all a bit rushed. The effects of the isolation and loneliness on the all-but-incarcerated girls is there for us to see, but not really to appreciate fully enough and I felt that a shame. There is also quite a potent aesthetic here - the visuals offer us a subtle reinforcement of stereotype, ageing, maturity, comedy and indifference and I could have done with some meat on the bones of the actual story, the film gets better after each viewing."

Jennifer 8 is written and directed by Bruce Robinson. It stars Andy Garcia, Uma Thurman, John Malkovich, Lance Henriksen, Kathy Baker and Graham Beckel. Music is by Christopher Young and cinematography by Conrad Hall.

The small town of Eureka and John Berlin (Garcia) is the new cop in the precinct. When a severed hand is found at the local dump it leads Berlin to believe a serial killer is at work. One who has a penchant for blind girls.

The problems quickly mounted up for Jennifer 8, it flopped big in America and went straight to home format release in the UK. Problems back stage got so bad that Bruce Robinson quit Hollywood and never made another film for 19 years! In spite of these facts, it’s not the monstrosity it was originally painted as back on its “limited” release.

It’s a frustrating film in many ways because it promises so much. There’s bags of moody atmospherics wrung out by Conrad Hall’s superb photography, where he filters most things via minimal lighting. Much of the play unfolds in ominous surroundings, where dialogue exchanges are either hushed or laced with harried fervour, and the writing is actually quite smart as it blends psycho thriller staples with strong characterisations that are in turn boosted by committed acting performances. Yet these things can’t compensate for the too long run time, a rushed ending and some awkward tonal shifts that often take you out of the required mood. The rushed ending is particularly galling, after asking the audience to stay with the pic for two hours, it’s not unreasonable to expect a good long and dramatic finale, sadly that’s not the case.

Fans of neo-noir type visuals have some interest here, as does anyone who likes the type of serial killer movies that dominated the late 80s and early 90s before Fincher’s Seven raised the bar. 6/10 || The revie written by John Card is totally trash. This is not a ""frustrating"" film in any way and doesn't have a ""rushed"" ending neither. The ending lasts something like 20 minutes. 
This movie is worth more than just 6 points. || Andy Garcia could never really be described as versatile, and he goes quite a way to prove it here in this rather unremarkable crime drama. He is ""Berlin"", a recently divorced LA cop who is just about burnt out. Luckily, his pal ""Freddy"" (Lance Henriksen) offers him a less stressful job in his rural force which he leaps at. Once there, though, he alights on a rather curious case that involved the murder of local blind girls. Despite considerable effort, the police could make little progress and the case had gone cold, but he risks putting noses out of joint as he tries to get to the bottom of things. His best ally soon turns out to be ""Helena"" (Uma Thurman) whose flatmate was the final - thus far - victim. The pair bond instantly but when an unexpected tragedy unfolds, ""Berlin"" finds himself the subject of an investigation and, bailed, the two and ""Margie"" (Kathy Baker) must discover the truth before... It's not a bad story, and the blind angle allows Bruce Robinson to develop a few more of the sensory perspectives to the usual serial killer drama - with Thurman quite engaging. The rest of the acting talent here is pretty weak, though, as is the writing - lots and lots of it. If it had lost maybe half an hour, the tightened narrative would probably have worked more efficiently - but at over two hours it is all just far too slow a burn, and what efforts are made to generate a sense of menace are undermined by a really bland score and some rather ordinary visuals. A television movie that passes the time, but more fodder than fun."

Kirsten Dunst is an interesting cast member, as is <em>'Prison Break'</em> alum Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. Fred Ward gives a solid showing, probably the standout away from/alongside Mabius.

It's a definite improvement on the unfortunately lousy <em>'The Crow: City of Angels'</em>. The story here felt more in line with the original (if still far adrift in terms of quality and style), with enough differences but also a few callbacks of sorts.

Description:
In this live-action prequel to the 1994 comedy hit, the Flintstones and the Rubbles go on a trip to Rock Vegas, where Wilma is pursued by playboy Chip Rockefeller.

Review:
The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is a straight to video prequel/sequel comedy directed by Brian Levant who also directed the first Flintstones film as well as the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Jingle All The Way. Unfortunately the original cast did not sign on for this sequel so it was recast and turned into a prequel and I have to say I'm a little angry at myself for not seeing it sooner. Aside from the terrible casting the movie itself makes for an interesting story for these beloved characters that equally matches up to the original. Do yourself a favor and watch this one first and then the original and relive some childhood memories. || _**A prequel to the first movie with a different cast and almost as good**_

While critics love to bash the two live-action versions of ""The Flintstones"" and the ratings at IMDb are surprisingly low, the first film was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because it's a great movie for what it is. The second one came out six years later in 2000 and features a different cast, which is appropriate since the story is a prequel, taking place when the four main characters are in their late teens or early twenties and romance blossoms between the couples.

Although Mark Addy as Fred isn't as good as John Goodman, he's a more-than-acceptable substitute and, besides, Fred is much younger here so it's fitting. Stephen Baldwin is even better (slightly) than Rick Moranis as Barney. Jane Krakowski is also better than Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, not to mention one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet. As for Wilma, Kristen Johnston isn't technically as good as Elizabeth Perkins because the latter had Wilma's 'look' to a ""T"" and Johnston is noticeably too tall, but she makes up for it with her goofy charisma that can't be beat. Lastly, who better to replace Elizabeth Taylor as Fred's stepmother than Joan Collins? 

Both Flintstones movies are easy prey to incessant panning because they're based on a 60's cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, do they work for what they are and the answer is a resounding ""yes""! Movies must be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve, not according to what they aren't. For instance, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is a goofy comedy and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original ""Apocalypse Now"" it's a throwaway flick, but how does it stack-up to other silly comedies? It's the same thing with both Flintstones movies – how do they stack up to other live-action versions of cartoons? Are they amusing? 

I always loved Gazoo and he's effectively brought to life in ""Viva Rock Vegas."" The sets and F/X are top-of-the line and hold up to this day. Being a prequel, it's natural to think that the producers lowered the budget, but this wasn't the case at all. The original cost $45 million while this one cost a whopping $83 million; but, while the first film raked in $360 million worldwide, this one only made $60 million.

Like the first movie, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.

The first two acts of ""Viva Rock Vegas"" are just as entertaining as the previous film, but there aren't as many laughs in the third act as the plot busily ties things up. Don't get me wrong, the third act is eventful and amusing, but there simply aren't as many laughs as the first two acts. Nevertheless, ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is entertaining from beginning to end as a live-action cinematic rendition of the cartoon and wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.

The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Parmount Ranch, Agoura, California, and Page, Arizona.

An FBI agent (Kyle MacLachlan) from Seattle teams-up with an LAPD detective (Michael Nouri) to apprehend an unstoppable menace in Los Angeles that seems to switch bodies(?).

“The Hidden” (1987) is a kinetic sci-fi action/thriller in the mold of “The Terminator” (1984), but not quite as exceptional. It’s captivating with a kinetic 80’s metal/rock/punk soundtrack featuring bands like Shok Paris, Concrete Blonde and The Truth. But, for me, the flick’s hampered by the one dimensional vibe of the gritty concrete jungle.  

Voluptuous Claudia Christian stands out on the female front as an exotic dancer who gets caught up in the chase.

Freshly graduated from college, a sultry Alabama debutante (Sherilyn Fenn) is sidetracked from her semi-arranged marriage in a couple of weeks by a hunky carnival worker (Richard Tyson). Louise Fletcher plays the unbending matriarch, Kristy McNichol a street-smart trucker and Burl Ives a seasoned sheriff.

This is a drama/romance that would fit into Southern Gothic. Unlike most of these films, “Two Moon Junction” (1988) curiously throws in softcore nudity and sex. If that turns you off, I suggest staying away. I think it’s the main reason people look down on this flick and write it off as “sexploitation trash” and “a romance novel put to film.” I wouldn’t know because I’ve never read one, although my wife encouraged me to read one once (because it had fantasy elements) and I couldn’t get past the first chapter; too much kissy-kissy.

If you can get past that or roll with it, this is an entertaining Southern Gothic with a worthy script and the social mindfood thereof (I’m not getting where people say it comes off as if it were written by a 10 year-old, not at all). There’s a hypnotic quality to some of the proceedings, like the haunting “Poison Ivy” (1992), but without the melancholy.  

Tyson as the roustabout looks like a more rugged version of Val Kilmer, albeit with darker, longer hair. Fenn is surely beautiful and shown tastefully (and unnecessarily) nude in the last act, but she’s actually outshined by McNichol in her physical prime. Seriously, Kristy is just stunning and worth the price of admission.

The script was well thought out and includes several gems, like the deep communication through the windows of the soul phenomenon and the dilapidated mansion that April (Fenn) and her friends used to hang out at when they were teens, calling it “our place.” Then there’s the sheriff, who’s in the pocket of the matriarch, and his respectful, but no-nonsense dealings with Perry (Tyson); and the latter’s love for his dog. Also, the commentary on the gulf between the Southern aristocracy and the “riffraff” is insightful. Should April mind that gulf and be well compensated or go with her heart? Either way, it’s a risk.

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles County, California. The producers do a pretty good job of trying to make Southern Cal look like Alabama, but you can tell in a few scenes.

It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imageries and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting.
All other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning. || They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.

Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel, actually overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny - with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10 || Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a real masterpiece of its genre. With its unique battle scenes, cinematography, acting and directing. It's a real must-watch.

It hits the nail on the head, the love, the empathy and the freedom of being young in a group of friends who are finding their way in the world through pure hedonism. The soundtrack is phenominal and I could real off quotes all day from the dialouge. ""Any jungle in Guy!!"". This is a must see for anyone who lived though this decade or anyone who didnt experience its true magic. || It commits to its schtick and does a great job at nailing it, to be fair.

I did like the opening portion of <em>'Human Traffic'</em> more than what followed it, though even so it's a fun time from beginning to conclusion. John Simm, Lorraine Pilkington, Shaun Parkes, Nicola Reynolds and Danny Dyer are entertaining and bounce off each other well. I did not know Mr. Andrew Clutterbuck was in this, was almost shocked when he first appeared - great to see him nevertheless!

Odd in a lot of ways, but basically all of which are positive. Fair play to all involved for sticking the landing, it could've been severely cringe otherwise. || Though the story is a bit old-hat, even for 1999, there are some really energised performances to enjoy in this story of angst and frustration amongst five twenty-something friends. It's really all about poor ""Jip"" (John Simm) who's obsessed with not being able to get it up! Is he just so stressed to function? His best mate ""Koop"" (Shaun Parkes) has no such problems with his bored, burger flipping, girlfriend ""Nina"" (Nicola Reynolds). Then there's the misunderstood and frustrated ""Moff"" (Danny Dyer) and finally ""Lulu"" (Lorraine Pilkington) who's hitherto seemed the more grown up of the bunch, with little interest in men and their foibles. It's a Friday afternoon and skint as they are, they are set for a boozy, drug-fuelled weekend in the clubs. It doesn't start well, which requires a bit of bravado from think-on-your-feet ""Jip"" but then they're off! For the next ninety minutes we take turns following each of them, and their peccadilloes, as the threads gradually knit towards a denouement that's a bit predicable but that's not the point. It's the joyride leading up to it that's entertaining, foul-mouthed and fresh. It's got an authenticity to it that Simm, especially, and Pilkington positively wallow in. They are just like the rest of us were at that age - a hormonal mess of anxieties and despair mixed with a life's too short mentality and these five carry that off well. It does have a slight serious side - and I'm sure the analysts could write a book about their behavioural issues, or about the difficulties of parenting - bit that's all subliminally delivered in a maelstrom of noise, music and excess. There's some pretty shocking overacting now and again, too - but on the whole it's a good laugh."

I'm losing it!

Mr. Mom is directed by Stan Dragoti and written by John Hughes. It stars Michael Keaton, Teri Garr and Martin Mull. Music is by Lee Holdridge and cinematography by Victor J. Kemper. Plot sees Keaton as Jack Butler, who after being laid off from work, is forced to become a house husband after his wife Caroline (Garr) lands a good job with Schooner Tuna - something he's really not cut out to do.

Ah, well, look, it's obviously very eighties, and thankfully society has moved on in leaps and bounds since this film was released. But good honest comedy is just that, honest, and for those looking for a good chuckle whilst admiring the talent of a pre-Batman Keaton, Mr. Mom is a bad mood lifter. Condensed into the 90 minute running time are enough gags and fun sequences to fill out a 12 episode sit-com, with a pre-teen-angst trail blazing John Hughes scripting it full of quotable lines. Lines which Keaton delivers with the comic timing not befitting someone just starting out in film.

The fun is mined from Jack being hopeless at basic household chores whilst badly tending the three young children at the same time. Enter scenes involving shopping, dropping the kids off at school, laundry, cooking and ironing. As his masculinity starts to wane, Jack starts too slob out and gets his kicks by watching day-time soap operas and playing cards with the neighbourhood women. This coincides with his wife Caroline (Garr adorable) advancing well at work, but paying a price for it by being away from the family home far too much. There's also the looming presence of Caroline's smarmy boss (Martin Mull delightfully sleazy) and the good time girl (Ann Jillian sexing it up) who has her eye on Jack for fun and frolics. Both of these are stereotypes, but they existed then as much as they exist now, with that, it's easy to cut Mr. Mom some slack.

Supporting slots fall to Christopher Lloyd (who would re-team with Keaton for the very funny ""The Dream Team"" in 1989), Jeffrey Tambor (""City Slickers""), Graham Jarvis (TV ""Starsky & Hutch/Cagney & Lacey"") and Miriam Flynn (""National Lampoon's Vacation""). The child actors put in pleasing turns, where they score funny points both visually and orally, and director Dragoti (""The Man With One Red Shoe"") directs in an unfussy natural way. Ultimately it's Keaton and Hughes' script that lifts it to better comedy heights, the latter of which also plays on some basic fears that arise in the real world. Yeah, it's not just about Jack's bumbling around the home, that John Hughes was a sharp fella you know. 7/10"

A thousand years in the future, Earth has been taken over by a towering alien race called Psychlos, who have enslaved humanity with the intent of stripping the land of all resources. Other humans hide in the wilderness, living a primitive life. However, one “man-animal” (Barry Pepper) spurs a movement to free the planet. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker play chief-security Psychlos.

Based on L. Ron Hubbard’s book from 1982, “Battlefield Earth” (2000) is post-apocalyptic sci-fi that mixes “Planet of the Apes” and “Logan’s Run” with a little “Terminator” and some “Star Wars” dogfighting in the last act. It is notorious as one of the worst movies ever made, at least those with a healthy budget. The nitpicking has been so out of hand that Roger Ebert even criticized the font chosen for the opening titles (rolling my eyes).

The truth is, it’s not close to being that bad. Unlike the similar “The Lost Future” (a low-budget flick from 2010), the pace is a little too frenzied, no doubt because the script tried to cram the first half of a 1000-page novel into a 2-hour film. Despite this, it’s not like the story’s unintelligible, although it needed to flesh-out the heroes further in order to make it more compelling. Some complain about the use of Dutch angles, but this is barely perceptible and, besides, they give the movie a unique vibe. Then there’s the cavil about the constant double wipes to change scenes. Seriously? Who cares? No one complains about the wipes in “Star Wars.”

Sure, Travolta takes a hammy approach to his Psychlo character, as do other Psychlo cast-members, but that’s part of the fun. You’re supposed to roll with it. There’s a glaring wink of amusement to the proceedings. So anyone who says the movie’s “unintentionally” funny is clueless.  

One of the biggest real problems is the absent of any significant female characters. There’s Sabine Karsenti as Chrissy, but her role isn’t that big and she’s underused. Meanwhile Kelly Preston has a long-tongued cameo as Psychlo Chirk, but that’s it (not counting peripherals). The remake of “Planet of the Apes” came out the next year and had enough sense to include Estella Warren in a fairly prominent role; the same thing with “The Lost Future” with Annabelle Wallis, not to mention Hannah Tointon and Eleanor Tomlinson.

To the film’s credit, a certain scene in the last act prefigures a (more) memorable scene in Abrams’ “Star Trek” nine years later. I’m not saying this is a great movie, it has its issues, but the over-criticism is unjustified and reminiscent of the ridiculous response to the well-done “Heaven’s Gate.” Perhaps due to the links to Sciencefictionology, the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued.

The movie runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations. Additional stuff was filmed California.

As would be tradition, the story at the core of On the Town isn't anything to sing from the roof tops, but it plays out as one of MGM's most memorable slices of froth. Propelled by talented stars and singers, it's a musical of comedic delights. 

Adapted from the successful stage production, charges of being dated and that not all the songs are great, is correct. The dated thing is not always a viable debating tool, but certain stereotype and sexist elements here will ring a little hollow with some folk. 

Yet if you can just run with it and accept the era of film making it comes from, then this is mostly a joyous and uplifting picture. So roll with the boys and girls, with the wonderful dances and the wonderful singing, for New York New York, A Wonderful Town. 8/10 || That old expression about things not being broken not needing fixing springs to mind with this. Messrs. Sinatra, Kelly (who co-directed) and Munshin don their naval uniforms for a 24 hour pass in the Big Apple. Once there, they fall for a pretty diverse trio of dames - Betty Garrett, Ann Miller and Vera-Allen and with the fabulous musical talents of Green/Comden and Bernstein at the helm, we have the perfect ingredients for a day no-one will ever forget. The plot is pretty straightforward, but the musical numbers notably ""New York, New York"", ""On the Town"" and ""I Can Cook Too"" alongside some perfectly choreographed dance sequences give this adaptation of the 1944 Broadway musical more than a splash of style and class. The whole thing is well paced, the characters (though hardly what you might call ""developed"") are fun and engaging - especially the really almost ""cute"" Frank Sinatra - as they (and we) enjoy their whirlwind romantic tour. On the downside, the story could do with being just a smidge more substantial and there are maybe just a little too many sound stage performances that do sterilise the charm just a little, but I'm splitting hairs - it's well worth a watch if you like the broadway musical at it's best."

The animation, twenty years on, is still admirable. The environments remain beautiful, the living creatures may not look quite as superb but are still nice in my opinion. The voice cast are understated yet suitable, much like everything else from the music to the plot.

D. B. Sweeney plays the lead role, portraying a character called Aladar. His voice isn't as strong as I'd want but he does a good job nevertheless. Alfre Woodard stands out slightly as Plio, I recognised her voice instantly having seen her years back on TV's <em>'Desperate Housewives'</em>.

Heftier voices and a more dramatic score would've taken this further in my estimations, though there's no doubting this is a film that has many elements to enjoy. || This is quite an enjoyable, if light-weight, Disney adventure clearly designed to capitalise on the Jurassic Park themes that drove all of us dino-mad in the 1990s! Here, a dinosaur egg ends up being hatched amidst a colony of lemurs. ""Aladar"" is an iguanodon, who settles with his new family until a giant meteorite hits the ocean and they must skedaddle inland before the tsunami hits. What now ensues is a fairly standard series of adventures as they all try to find a new home. The visual effects are great, and the characterisations are also quite fun. The story, though, is really pretty derivative and plays very much second fiddle to the innovative standard of the animation. Pity, as over time that animation becomes less remarkable, and so does the film. Now, some 20-odd years after, the film has little to make it stand out.

The movie starts of reasonably well being somewhat intelligent with a bit of Mission Impossible feel to it. It is actually almost a bit slow at times. However, for the second half of the movie it really degrades into a classical John Woo, over the top, action feast with all pretense of intelligence and any true Mission Impossible feel gone. John Woo is not the right person to make a Mission Impossible movie.

As with the first movie if it would not have been labelled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it a higher rating since it is a decent enough, mostly braindead though, Hollywood action movie. However, I have higher expectations from a movie labelled Mission Impossible.

Tom Cruise is quite okay as Ethan Hunt. Dougray Scott is okayish as the bad guy. Sometimes he projects the right big bad and mad bad-guy attitude but sometimes he is just silly and just as over the top as the action scenes. He is supposed to be a mastermind but he comes out as a thug a’ la a not so intelligent drug baron in many scenes.

The action scenes? Well, they are classical John Woo material. Fast paced with a lot of stunts and things that go boom. They are also, as expected, hugely over the top and unbelievable. They provide a enjoyable visual experience but, as I wrote above, they are not really what I would expect from a Mission Impossible movie.

The romance between Hunt and Nyah is the typical Hollywood, let’s throw in a sexy girl and some superficial attraction, which develops from get lost to I love you in the matter of a few hours of contact, between the lead character and the girl. Meh!

I get the impression that the people that have created these movies so far have not really watched a single full season of Mission Impossible. || The first underwhelmed me, but this one straight-up bored me. Again, of course seeing Hunt climb a mountain without a harness is impressive sure. And I even quite liked the idea behind the villain of the piece (though even that angle was woefully underdeveloped).

Even setting it in predominantly Australia was enough to grab my attention, and that's saying something cause I'm pretty biased when it comes to that. I hear tell that _Mission: Impossible II_ is the low point in the series, and that at least is encouraging, because if anything afterwards is much worse than this one, I don't know if I'll be able to make it through to Rogue Nation.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._ || After quite entertainign Mission Impossible I the second installment turned out ... terrible. As if the screenwriters didn't know how to fill the 2 hrs with action the overuse of heroic slow motion scenes is horrible. You almost might need a barf bag if you can't stand slo-mo every five seconds... for 15 seconds. I am amazed they did decide to push on with more M:I movies after this one, then again, these turned out much much better even if it would be hard to beat that lousy piece of crap of a movie."

Released in 2000, ""Shanghai Noon"" features Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (the Chinese spelling of John Wayne) who teams up with good bad-guy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). They're pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures.

It didn't dawn on me until the end that the title ""Shanghai Noon"" is a comical take on ""High Noon"" (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you're in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999's ""The Mummy."" It's not as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it's better than its sequels.

Chan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is amusing, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end. Of course, with Jackie Chan the action is great as well, but it goes a bit overboard towards the end, which is typical of Hollywood, as well as overlong.

The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, and the Forbidden City, Beijing.

A hinted spoiler follows.

Carnival Of Souls has thankfully found a whole new audience in the new millennium, the advent of cheap triple pack DVDs and a lush Criterion release have brought it firmly to the attention of Horror/Ghost fans who were not aware that the film even existed. That said, there is no doubting that many big name directors were fully aware of it, tho, for Carnival Of Souls has influenced such luminary genre masters from Romero to Carpenter, and from Hooper to Shyamalan, be it the low budget DIY ethic, or its now genre staple twist ending, it's a film (along with it's director Herk Harvey) that is referenced as much as it is copied.

The tag often used for the film is that it's an elongated Twilight Zone episode, and sure enough I think that is a perfect fit. Its whole structure feels like a part of that wonderful and amazing Rod Serling show, and for sure this story owes a doff of the cap to An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge (an Ambrose Bierce short that was reworked and used on Serling's show), but to merely suggest a retread of a previously used idea would be very unfair. Carnival Of Souls is full of eerie sequences that are dream like in quality yet goose pimply in effect. Scored at frequent intervals by a jangling organ shrill, the ghostly phantoms that plague poor Mary actually bring a shiver to the spine; while a surrealistic dance of the carnival is a stunning eerie highlight. It's a wonderfully brought together story that has one pondering uneasily from the get go, managing to jolt your senses adroitly with a very special ending.

With a small budget of only $30,000 and a cast of friends, Herk Harvey crafted one of the best independent horror sub-genre films ever made. Don't believe me? Then go ask Romero, Raimi or Hooper. 8/10 || _**Haunting early 60's movie, like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone**_

A young woman (Candace Hilligoss) survives a vehicle accident in Lawrence, Kansas, and then is troubled by a specter (director Herk Harvey) and other strange occurrences as she moves to the Great Salt Lake region for a gig as a church organist.

""Carnival of Souls"" (1962) is an eerie, moody cult flick shot in B&W, but not scary at all. It's similar in vibe to ""Night Tide"" (1961) with Dennis Hopper. The creepiest part is the girl's lecherous neighbor in Utah (Sidney Berger). 

Besides the haunting ambiance, what I like best about it is the portrayal of two intersecting dimensions: Someone in the spiritual dimension can't be seen or (for the most part) heard in the physical realm. While it's overrated and predictable, it's still an interesting ghostly period piece.

The movie runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, and was shot in Lawrence, Kansas, and Magna, Great Salt Lake & Salt Lake City, Utah.

GRADE: B-/B || When two groups of teenagers are racing their cars over a narrow bridge, an accident occurs and the car carrying the girls goes a-tumbling into the deep and muddy river below. It's during the extensive search process (a man with a bit of string with a weight tied to it) that ""Mary"" (Candice Hilligoss) emerges from the river, the sole survivor. Gradually, though, things start to become ambiguous - she is obsessed with a run down carnival nearby, is soon seeing apparitions and after a short while we all start to wonder if she is actually real or not! The acting from Hilligoss and from Art Ellison as the savvy preacher is quite compelling to watch (the dialogue much less so) and as the plot thickens, the drama builds nicely into quite a tense little horror story with an effective organ-based score to help raise the tension too. Watch it on a dark, wintery, night and it is a remarkably effective B-feature."

Also, I think, and this is just my own opinion, but the Subject matter and story line of this Bond film made it one of the hardest Bond Roles to play. || It’s good if you want to watch the same movie as previous Bonds.
 
So my plan is to watch the Bond movies in order from the first Bond movie to the last bond. I'm currently on “On Her Majesty's Secret Service”. One of the main things I noticed from Her Majesty's Secret Service is the fact that the new Bond doesn't seem to be as sexually assaulting as the previous bond ( Sean Connery). It did seem like the first Bond would like to force himself upon women which seemed a bit off, and was really off putting. For most of the previous Bond films this new Bond didn't seem as bad, but there was still a lot of this bond having his way with the women he wanted to have his way with. which I'm still not in total agreement with. 

I think the biggest problem I have with most of the Bond movies is really  that they all follow a very very specific formula. the formula itself seems to always be James Bond shows it up at some place. He assumes a new identity. He then starts snooping around. He finds the villain, has contact with the villain. The villain finds out who he is. They then put him in a room or put him in some place that easily escapable. Miraculously, James Bond figures out a way to get out of said room which no one decided to guard and no one decided to put any additional reinforcements on. specifically they put him in a room for the gondola cables. If I was a super villain I wouldn't put somebody in the room which houses the gears which are kind of the only way to get up to said Superfortress.
Well the movie is an overall bad. it's starting to really feel like I'm watching the same movie over and over again. which, if you like this same movie over and over again I could see how you would like this movie. However, I don't really like watching this same movie over and over and over again. || Even if we have all the time in the world, the world is not enough.

On Her Majesty's Secret Service is directed by Peter Hunt and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars George Lazenby, Diana Rigg, Telly Savalas, Ilse Steppat, Yuri Borienko and Gabriele Ferzetti. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Michael Reed.

Bond 6 and 007 is obsessed with locating SPECTRE supremo Ernst Stavro Blofeld. After rescuing beautiful Countess Tracy di Vincenzo from suicide, this brings Bond into contact with her father, Marc Ange Draco, who agrees to help Bond find Blofeld in exchange for 007 courting Tracy. Blofeld is located in the Switzerland Alps at Piz Gloria, where he is masterminding a fiendish plot involving biological extinction of food group species'. Bond will need to use all his wits to stop the plan from being executed, he also has big matters of the heart to contend to as well...

Connery gone, but not for good as it turned out, so into the tuxedo came George Lazenby, an Australian model with no previous acting experience of note. It would be Lazenby's only stint as 007, badly advised by those around him that Bond had no future in the upcoming 70s, his head swelling with ego by the day (something he readily admits and regrets), Lazenby announced he would only be doing the one James Bond film. The legacy of OHMSS is the most interesting in the whole Bond franchise, for where once it was reviled and wrongly accused of being a flop, it now, over 40 years later, is regarded as being one of the finest entries in the whole series. Yes it is still divisive, I have seen some fearful arguments about its worth, but generations of critics and film makers have come along to laud it as essential Bond and essential Fleming's Bond at that.

Everything about OHMSS is different to what Connery's Bond had become, the gadgets are gone and heaven forbid, Bond got a heart and fell in love. He was a man, with real aggression, real emotions and forced to use brain and brawn instead of mechanical trickery. Changes in the production department, too, wasn't just about Lazenby's appearance. Peter Hunt, previously the Bond film's editor, directed his one and only Bond film, and Michael Reed on cinematography also appears for the one and only time. New Bond, new era, but reviews were mixed and in spite of making a profit of over $73 million Worldwide, this was considerably down on previous films. The reviews didn't help, with much scorn poured on Lazenby for not being Connery, but really it's hard to imagine anyone coming in and not getting beat with that particular stick! Box office take wasn't helped by the film's length, at over 2 hours 10 minutes, this restricted the number of showings in theatres, something that should be greatly noted.

Away from Bond anyway, OHMSS is a stunning action thriller in its own right. From the opening beach side fist fight, where uppercuts lift men off their feet and drop kicks propel them backwards, to helicopter attacks, bobsleigh pursuits (resplendent with punches and flinging bodies), ski chases and a car chase in the middle of a stock car race: on ice! There's enough pulse pumping action here to fill out two Bond movies. But the Bond aspects are magnificent as well. Lazenby has wonderful physicality and throws a mean punch, he cuts a fine figure of a man and he's acting inexperience isn't a problem in the hands of the astute Hunt. Lazenby is matched by Rigg as Tracy, the best Bond girl of them all, she's no bimbo, she's tough (fighting off a guy with a broken bottle), smart yet vulnerable, funny and heart achingly beautiful, her interplay with Lazenby is brilliantly executed, so much so that when the devastating finale arrives it has extra poignancy. A scene that closes the film on a downbeat note and remains the most emotional scene ever put into a Bond movie.

Savalas finally gives us a villain who can compete with Bond on a physical level, making the fight between them an evenly matched and believable one. He lacks Pleasance's sinister fizzog, though the bald pate and Grecian looks marks Savalas out as an imposing foe as well. The Swiss Alps setting is gorgeous, with Reed capturing the scope magnificently, while some of his colour lensing in the interiors soothe the eyes considerably. Barry's score is one of his best, lush romantic strains accompany Tracy and James, operatic overtures dart in and out of the Swiss scenery and the James Bond theme is deftly woven into the action sequences. Louis Armstrong's beautiful ""We Have All The Time In The World"" features prominently, perfectly romantic and forever to be thought of as part of the Bond Universe. Finally it's the great writing that gives us the best sequence involving the trifecta of Bond, Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and M (Bernard Lee). 5 minutes of class that gives Moneypenny an acknowledged importance in the relationship between the two men in her life. It's just one of a number of truly excellent scenes in the greatest Bond film of them all. 10/10"

It's presented episodically as she encounters a goat-herder, squats with a pot-smoker for a few days, falls in love with an handsome Tunisian grape-picker and my own favourite - manages to get quite well oiled with a curmudgeonly old lady who simply needed to let her hair down. Each day brings her something new and the flashback style of storytelling allows us to reset a little between her adventures. Each time she, and we, feel maybe there is sense that hope isn't far away as she plays a game of Russian Roulette with her daily life. Some people are sympathetic, some downright hostile and it's all of these characteristics that contribute well to this punchy portrait of a strong woman who has no idea what she wants, nor what she doesn't want either. Does she clamour for peace, quiet, security? Does she thrive better on the unpredicable?

Roger Moore did more official James Bond films as secret agent 007 than any other actor. He started the role when he was almost 45 years-old and ended his 7-film stint at 57. His third Bond film was “The Spy Who Loved Me” released in 1977 and it’s one of the most entertaining movies in the series.

The plot revolves around 007 teaming up with female Russian agent XXX (yeah right) to prevent world-hating Karl Stromberg (Curd Jürgens) from starting World War III by stealing nuclear subs. Stromberg doesn't care if the world kills itself because he lives as a mad recluse on a crab-like submersible dream home called ""Atlantis."" The giant steel-toothed Jaws assists Stromberg along with the beautiful raven-haired Naomi.

The top item I demand in any Bond flick is exciting globe-trotting and, consequently, great locations. “The Spy Who Loved Me” delivers on this front in spades. Right out of the gate there’s a rousing ski chase that culminates in a spectacular jump from Baffin Island's Mt. Asgard (Canada), substituting for the Austrian Alps. It’s an incredible stunt and easily one of the best openings in the franchise. From there we get the Sahara desert, Cairo, the Nile River and the great pyramids of Giza, as well as the Italian Mediterranean island of Sardinia, Scotland (Royal Naval base) and the waters of the Bahamas. These are all fabulous locations to say the least.

Richard Kiel as the 7’2” Jaws is both intimidating and amusing. The on-going joke is that NOTHING can stop or kill him.

Barbara Bach is good as Agent XXX and certainly possesses an exotic beauty, similar to Britt Ekland from the previous movie, but watch her get blown out of the water by the stunning Caroline Munro when she’s introduced as Naomi. Many cite Ursula Andress' coming out of the water in a white bikini in “Dr. No” (1962) as the ultimate ‘Bond girl’ moment but Caroline's introduction here is a serious rival; it's, at least, the second best one. The only problem is that Caroline's role is too brief. Check her out in “The Golden Voyage of Sinbad” (1974) to see her in a more prominent part. Some editions of the DVD include an over 40-minute documentary that includes an interview with Ms. Munro. She was still beautiful over 25 years after the movie was released.

Another great aspect of “The Spy Who Loved Me” is that the fun, adventurous vibe and globe-trotting sequences give it an undeniable Indiana Jones feel, even though it was made four years before the first Indiana Jones flick. WATCH OUT for the great sequence where Bond's car morphs into a submarine as he attempts to flee Naomi in a helicopter.

Many compositions in Bond films are relatively timeless, like “For Your Eyes Only” from 1981, but the disco elements in the score for “The Spy Who Loved Me” are horribly dated. This doesn't bug me that much. I can live with it; others can't.

As for Roger Moore's take on Bond, I guess you either like him or you don't. I do. Regardless of his age Moore always looked great and was perfectly convincing as 007 throughout his run.

IMHO Moore's seven films are the most consistently entertaining. Yes, Sean Connery is great and his stint is generally more serious (albeit with the typical Bond cheese), but who can deny the color and vibrancy of the Moore films? All of his pictures are very entertaining and were hugely successful at the box office. Even the heavily maligned “Moonraker” (1979) and “A View to a Kill” (1985) are great. They may have more goofy or amusing elements, which are actually funny by the way, but they remain essentially serious stories; they rarely go overboard into the rut of parody or camp. Seriously, I weary of hearing all the complaints about Moore's stint in the series. All of his films are quality Bond adventures. There's not a dud in the bunch.

The movie runs 2 hours, 5 minutes.

GRADE: A- || Commander James Bond, recruited to the British Secret Service from the Royal Navy. License to kill and has done so on numerous occasions. 

The Spy Who Loved Me is directed by Lewis Gilbert and adapted to screenplay by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Roger Moore, Barbara Bach, Curt Jurgens, Richard Kiel and Walter Gotell. Music is scored by Marvin Hamlisch and cinematography by Claude Renoir.

Bond 10. Allied and Soviet nuclear submarines are mysteriously disappearing from the waters and causing friction between the nations. MI6 and the KGB have a notion that a third party is responsible and stirring up trouble for their own nefarious means. 007 is partnered with Soviet spy Major Anya Amasova (Agent XXX) and the pair are tasked with getting to the bottom of the plot before the crisis escalates.

During the whole run of the James Bond franchise there have been a few occasions when it was felt it had run out of steam. 1977 and on the back of the mediocre reception and by Bond standards the poor box office return of The Man with the Golden Gun, now was one such time. With producer Albert Broccoli striking out on his own, the stakes were high, but with a determined vision forming in his head and a near $14 million budget to work from courtesy of United Artists, Broccoli went big, and it worked magnificently. The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's best Bond film, not necessarily his best Bond performance, but as a movie it's near faultless, it gets all the main ingredients right. Gadgets and humour were previously uneasy accompaniments to James Bond as a man, but here they serve to enhance his persona, never taking away his tough bastard edge. The suspense and high drama is back, for the first time in a Roger Moore Bond film things are played right, we don't think we are watching an action comedy, but an action adventure movie, what little lines of humour are here are subtle, not overt and taking away from the dramatic thrust.

For production value it's one of the best. Brocoli instructed the great Ken Adam to go build the 007 Stage at Pinewood so as to achieve their vision for The Spy Who Loved Me. At the time it became the biggest sound stage in the world. With such space to work from, Adam excels himself to produce the interior of the Liparus Supertanker, the home for a brilliant battle in the final quarter. Vehicles feature prominently, the amphibious Lotus Esprit moved quickly into Bond folklore, rocket firing bikes and mini-subs, helicopter, speedboat, escape pod, wet-bike and on it goes. Then there's Stromberg's Atlantis home, a wonderfully War of the Worlds type design for the outer, an underwater aquarium for the inner. Glorious locations are key, also, Egypt, Sardinia, Scotland and the Bahamas are colourful treats courtesy of Renoir's photography. Underwater scenes also grabbing the attention with some conviction.

The film also features a great cast that are led by a handsome, and in great shape, Moore. Barbara Bach (Triple X) is not only one of the most beautiful Bond girls ever, she's expertly portraying a femme of substance, intelligent, brave and committed to the cause, she is very much an equal to Bond, and we like that. The accent may be a shaky, but it's forgivable when judging Bach's impact on the picture. Jurgens as Stromberg is a witty villain, but he oozes despotic badness, sitting there in his underwater lair deliciously planning to start a new underwater world. Kiel as Jaws, the man with metal teeth, he too moved into Bond folklore, a scary creation clinically realised by the hulking Kiel. Gotell as Gogol is a presence and Caroline Munro as Naomi is memorable, while Bernard Lee's M and Desmond Llewelyn's Q get wonderful scenes of worth. They forgot to give poor Moneypenney something to chew on, but in the main it comes over that the makers were reawakened to what made Bond films great in the first place. There's even a candidate for best title song as well, Nobody Does it Better, delivered so magically by Carly Simon. 

The grand vision paid off, handsomely. It raked in just over $185 million at the world box office, some $87 million more than The Man with the Golden Gun. Not bad considering it was up against a record breaking Star Wars. Critics and fans, too, were pleased. It's not perfect. It's ironic that director Lewis Gilbert returned for his second Bond assignment, because this does feel like a rehash of his first, You Only Live Twice, only bigger and better. Hamlisch underscores it at times and John Barry's absence is felt there. While if we are being particularly harsh? Then Stromberg could perhaps have been a more pro-active villain? He makes a telling mark, we know he's a mad dastard, but he only really sits around giving orders and pushing death dealing buttons. But small complaints that fail to stop this Bond from being one of the best. Hey, we even get an acknowledgement that Bond was once married, and the response from Bond is respectful to that dramatic part of his past. 9/10 || Not my favourite outing for ""James Bond"" this one, perhaps because the opening snow-scape scenes rely too heavily on green screen - maybe Roger Moore didn't like skiing, or just couldn't get insured - but in any case he certainly never left Pinewood for the first ten minutes here. It then leads into one of the more preposterous stories in which he must team up with the glamorous Soviet agent ""Amasova"" (Barbara Bach) to track down what has happened to two nuclear submarines that have vanished. It's got the usual travelogue elements - we go via Austria, to Egypt before the high seas where we encounter a sort of ecological megalomaniac in ""Stromberg"" (Curt Jürgens) who is trying to initiate global armageddon so he can live in his city under the sea. To help him achieve his goals, he has engaged the services of toothy strongman ""Jaws"" (Richard Kiel) who soon presents the couple with some perilous scenarios as they, of course, start to fall for each other. There is a distinct paucity of gadgets in this film, save for the submersible Lotus; the humour is a bit on the tacky side and I felt that the whole thing dragged a bit towards the end. Jürgens does just enough to get by but is hardly menacing; quite how Bach remains contained in her frock towards the end is astonishing and the denouement, though offering plenty of pyrotechnics, was rather rushed and a bit flat. It's OK, this film - but, sadly, nothing more than that."

Moonraker is a joy from beginning to end. Huge spectacle, stunning locations, lashings of humour, superb stunts, sexy ladies, a despicable and memorable villain, great special effects and of course, the legendary Sir Roger Moore as James Bond.

Elements of You Only Live Twice - spaceships swallowing spaceships - are expanded upon here and Moonraker fits right in with the classic silliness that the Bond franchise has always embraced.

It's a shame that the 2006 reboot threw it all away and chose to run away from being Bond films. || One of the best of the Moore era  

I steered clear of “Moonraker” (1979) for years because critics almost unanimously said it was awful. So when I finally sat down to view it I fully expecting a dog. Wrong! “Moonraker” is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and is one of the best of Roger Moore's 7-movie stint in the series.

The plot revolves around 007 investigating Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) after a space shuttle on loan to the British is stolen. James slowly discovers that Drax has a mad scheme to recreate a race of perfect human specimens. The giant Jaws (Richard Kiel) returns from “The Spy Who Loved Me” (1977) as Bond teams-up with the beautiful Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles). The story climaxes with a spectacular battle at Drax' space station.

Everything in “Moonraker” is over the top: The locations, the action, the villainous scheme, the humor, the seriousness, Jaws and the space finale. This works fabulously because Bond films were never meant to be deep, thought-provoking pieces of art, but rather grandiose pieces of thrilling eye candy with an amusing sense of the absurd.

One thing that I demand in any Bond adventure is great globe-trotting and spectacular locations. This is one of the reasons I consider “License to Kill” (1989) weak, but “Moonraker” delivers in spades! The film starts out with breathtaking scenes high above Napa Valley, California, as Bond engages in a thrilling sky-diving duel. From there we get France, Venice, Rio De Janeiro, the jungles of Brazil & Guatemala and the spectacular Iguazu Waterfalls, Argentina.

Lois Chiles is one of the more beautiful and competent Bond ""girls."" Of course her name, ""Dr. Goodhead,” is ludicrous in the tradition of Pussy Galore and Chew Mee. Meanwhile Drax is a formidable, serious nemesis contrasted by the cartoonish villainy of Jaws.

The film works on every level in entertaining the viewer but, depending on one's tastes, some people may have a cavil or two. For instance, many criticize the goofy humor associated with Jaws. The good thing is that it's actually funny and you'll likely bust out laughing a number of times. Regardless, the picture remains an essentially serious story, albeit totally outlandish, which is in keeping with the series, e.g. “Goldfinger” (1964) and “You Only Live Twice” (1967).

Others object to the notion of Bond in space. I don't get this beef. He's been all over the earth and in every ocean, why not an adventure in space for something new? Some have criticized that “Moonraker” was trying to go ""Star Wars,” but this makes no sense; “Moonraker” has nothing in common with ""Star Wars."" It would be like arguing that “Thunderball” (1965) ripped-off ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" because it has underwater scenes.

Something else I'd like to point out: One of the reasons I steered clear from “Moonraker” for so many years was because I thought most of the film took place in space, and space is not something I seek in a Bond flick, but this isn't the case. Bond doesn't go up in space until over an hour & a half into the story! Only like 23% of the film takes place in space. More importantly, the climax is actually interesting and exciting unlike the ending of, say, “The Spy Who Loved Me,” which isn’t as compelling.

Roger Moore has done more Bond films than any other actor (which is only matched by Sean Connery IF you include his unofficial 1983 entry “Never Say Never Again”). Roger started the role in 1972 when he was 44 and ended in 1985 at the age of 57 (!!). Regardless of his age he always looked great and perfectly convincing as 007; yes, even in “A View to a Kill” (1985). His movies contained more humor and action than the slightly-more-serious early 60's Bond films, which were fantastical and absurd in their own way (e.g. Oddball's killer hat, etc.), but Moore's stint isn't so different when you consider Connery's later films, like “You Only Live Twice” and, especially, “Diamonds are Forever” (1971).

Many prefer the Connery era, and I certainly appreciate those films, but I find the Moore period to be the most consistently entertaining in the series. Every one of his films was successful at the box office and “Moonraker” was the most successful Bond film until Pierce Brosnan's “Goldeneye” in 1995. There's not a dud in the bunch. They're colorful, vibrant and full of pizazz.

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes.

GRADE: A- || Now my geography isn't great, but I am not sure you can actually fly from the Yukon to the British coast in fifteen minutes! That's how this outing for Roger Moore begins, and it's symptomatic of the rather weak storyline and sloppy production that seems intent on getting ""James Bond"" to capitalise on ""Star Wars"" (1977) fever. Anyway, a space shuttle is stolen and ""007"" is sent to visit gazillionaire industrialist ""Drax"" (Michael Londsale) who lives in a genuinely imported French chateau in California. A dizzying experience introduces him to ""Dr. Goodhead"" (Lois Chiles) and pretty soon the pair, after a bit of a sticky start, are trying to find out what happened to the missing spaceship and to thwart an ingenious plan to replace the population of the planet with an Aryan-style perfect race. Everyone here just looks tired. Lonsdale tries hard to inject some sort of menace but the rest of it lumbers along in an episodic fashion with a couple of set-piece escapades that are frequently let down by poor visual effects (the dogs eating the steaks, or the gondola chase - where they have clearly just speeded up film...). John Barry and Hal David delivered another number for Shirley Bassey and, indeed, the score provides quite a bit of the humour with nods to ""Close Encounters"" (1977) and the ""Magnificent Seven"" (1960) but the rest of this is really mediocre. Usually there are a few scenarios in a ""Bond"" film where he implausibly survives almost certain death, but here he seems to constantly lurch from the frying pan to the frying pan time and time again - with the newly loved-up ""Jaws"" (Richard Kiel) really failing to inject much menace as we head into outer space for our colourful, but rather silly, denouement. The franchise is running out of steam, and needs a serious reboot."

Superior Bond film with Christopher Lee as an assassin who sets his sights on Sir Roger Moore. Big mistake!

A fast moving entry from Guy Hamilton that has lovely locations, incredible stunts - (The car flip has yet to be bettered)  sexy ladies, a great theme tune, the return of the hilarious Sheriff J W Pepper and of course the legendary Sir Roger Moore as James Bond.


If only the bland 2006 reboot were as entertaining. || “The plane, the plane”

Agent 007 (Roger Moore) learns that he’s on the hit list of the world's most expensive assassin, Scaramanga (Christopher Lee). Traveling from Beirut to Macau, China, to Bangkok, Thailand, he aims to confront the assassin while recovering sensitive solar cell equipment. Hervé Villechaize is on hand as Scaramanga’s little assistant, Nick Nack.

“The Man with the Golden Gun” (1974) was Moore’s second outing as Bond. He did 7 films for the franchise in 13 years from 1973-1985. Moore’s stint is my favorite run in the series with all seven films being kinetic, amusing, scenic and just all-around entertaining. There’s not one clunker in the bunch and they were all profitable at the box office, but this one kinda got lost between the cracks of “Live and Let Die” (1973) and “The Spy who Loved Me” (1977).

Director Guy Hamilton made three prior Bond films, “Live and Let Die,” “Diamonds are Forever” (1971) and “Goldfinger” (1964), and wanted 007 to be more rough around the edges in this movie, like he is in Ian Fleming’s book. As such, Moore's acting seems more ""tough” here than his other Bond entrees; for instance, the way he treats Andrea (Maud Adams) in the arm twisting scene. But Moore didn't like playing the character this way and toned it down for the rest of his installments.

There’s picturesque Asian globetrotting, with the Thailand islands being particularly scenic (standing in for “Red Chinese waters”). On the female front, there’s Agent Mary Goodnight played by Britt Ekland, who looks great in a floral bikini during the last reel. There’s also the aforementioned Adams as Andrea and a cameo by Chew Mee. Memorable moments include an entertaining martial arts academy sequence; the amusing return of redneck Sheriff JW Pepper (Clifton James), who’s vacationing in Bangkok with his wife; a great car-jumping stunt; and Scaramanga’s secret solar power plant operation.

The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes and was shot in Thailand (Phang Nga Bay and Bangkok) and Hong Kong/ Macau, with additional work done in England.

GRADE: B || You get as much pleasure out of killing as I do, so why don't you admit it? 

The Man with the Golden Gun is directed by Guy Hamilton and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz from the Ian Fleming novel. It stars Roger Moore, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland, Maud Adams, Herve Villechaize, Soon-Taik-Oh, Richard Loo and Clifton James. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore & Oswald Morris.

Bond 9 and 007 is distracted from his pursuit of the Solex Agitator when it appears he has been targeted for death by famous assassin Francisco Scaramanga.

This would be the last Bond movie to be produced by the partnership of Broccoli and Saltzman, the latter of which was the one to leave. Perhaps they fought about what direction Moore's Bond should be taking? Because The Man with the Golden Gun is not a fitting film for them to part on, their fall out most likely impacting on why this is a pretty unadventurous entry in the James Bond franchise. The film plays more as a slapstick comedy than an action adventure. The script is uninspired, with the characters of Mary Goodnight (Ekland) and Sheriff Pepper (James) reaching new lows for Bond allies, while some of the situations that arise are just bizarre and lazy. The latter statement of which applies big time to the weak finale.

However, even average Bond films have value somewhere in the mix. Here there's some grit in Moore's performance and Lee's Scaramanga is one of the series' most interesting villains. Maud Adams is given a good character to work from, her Andrea Anders is intriguing and very much a live wire in the plot, it's a good performance that would see Adams rewarded with the lead lady role in Octopussy (1983). Villechaize's Nick Nack, Scaramanga's right hand man/helper is a unique villain, though this is spoilt somewhat by a daft final confrontation with Bond. There's a brilliant car stunt performed by Bumps Willard, done in one take, it alone deserved to be in a better film.

Elsewhere. Barry is back on musical score duties, providing an Oriental tinted arrangement. Sadly Lulu's title theme song is instantly forgettable and lyrically feels like it was written in 5 minutes. Locations are sumptuous, with Macau, Hong Kong and Thailand put to great use by the team, and the gadgetry is kept to minimum which allows us to enjoy the one or two inventive modes of transport used within the piece. The box office was $98 million, a considerable take for sure but still some $63 million down on the previous Bond adventure. With critics and fans considering the film a let down, questions were again raised as to if Bond was loosing his appeal? With Saltzman, Hamilton and Mankiewicz bowing out of the franchise, would there be a turnaround in Bond's fortunes? Would Moore finally get a script and film to test him? 6.5/10"

Tom Friend is about to embark on a life changing expedition, his aim? To find the fabled creature known as the Yeti, or Abominable Snowman. Joining him on the trip is botanist John Rollason, whose scientific interest is totally at odds with Friend and his trapper companion, Ed Shelley. As the expedition moves deeper into the Himalayas, bad luck and differences of opinions dog the party, and as the confrontations draw closer it becomes apparent that the Yeti is not a dumb animal to be killed or captured.

Adapted by Nigel Kneale from his own BBC play, ""The Creature"", The Abominable Snowman is one of the finest early offerings from Hammer Studios. The long running (to this day) stories of a giant beast living up in the Himalayas is of course interesting stuff, much like Nesse up in her Loch, it seems their worth will never ever fade. Thankfully there is a ream of intelligence in this picture, forgoing out and out shocks in the name of horror, director Val Guest has treated Kneale's story with the utmost respect. This is more of a character story as regards men with different ideals on a supposed legend, we barely see the creature until the wonderful last quarter, we don't need to because there are other creatures on this expedition, it's very adroit and accomplished in its telling.

The cast do not let the material down, Hammer stalwart Peter Cushing takes the role of Rollason, Forrest Tucker (""Sands Of Iwo Jima"") is Friend, Robert Brown (""The Masque of the Red Death"") is Shelley and Maureen Connell is wonderful down in the village as Rollason's fraught wife, Helen. Now in this day and age we can get good digital transfers of old black and white classics, and here the Regalscope Widescreen brilliantly captures the snowy landscapes, firmly enhanced by Arthur Grant's gorgeous monochrome photography. So what you waiting for? The technical side is great, the story is of course excellent, all that remains to say is that the ending is perfect and seals the deal.

A British treasure. 8/10 || This was entertaining to watch, especially it being the first Hammer Horror filmed in black and white.

An adventurous expedition turns into a fight for survival, with a horrifying discovery. It's similar to The Thing and Mountains of Madness, but the difference being it is less gruesome than the other two. || Forrest Tucker was drafted in to bring a bit of box office to this actually quite atmospheric tale of an expedition to the heights of the Himalayas where he - ""Friend"" and scientist ""Rollason"" (Peter Cushing) encounter the mysticism of the locals and, well slightly more than they bargained for! Clearly nobody set foot outside the studio here, and the confetti sellers must have a field day; but Cushing was always quite good at sustaining these slightly eccentric boffin roles; the rather stilted Tucker does what's required with a rather listless script and Maureen Connell offers just a little more as the leading lady that is oft provided in these adventures.

Watching it now it seems oh so very formulaic, but it was rarely the norm back than for war films to always follow this brand of high end adventure staples. The makers take a bunch of men from the various social spectrum and thrust them together for an impossible mission. We have the stiff backed guys with moral reasoning at their core, the rough and tumble men, all face fuzz and machismo seeping from every pore, and a young baby faced youngster blossoming into a man by the day. 

They will be put through the mangler at regular intervals, faced with scenarios to test their metal, all while the group view each other with suspicions of motives and reasonings. Here the character sub-plots, their hang-ups and frets, do not bog down the fun or the excitement, they enhance the narrative. We also get two ladies entering the group (Irene Papas/Gia Scala), and they too add some meat into an already beefy stew. 

Action is a plenty, suspense equally so. While of course there's twists and turns to input some mystery and pot boiling character dynamics. Elsewhere, Tiomkin provides a robust Golden Globe Winning score, and Bill Warrington & Chris Greenham's special effects won the Academy Award in that department - they look at times a bit weak now, but who cares right? The array of screen work, matte paintings and miniatures blend superbly with the outdoor location photography, which points us to a time when film makers worked their socks off to create the magic up there on the screen. Oh and the scripted dialogue is just wonderful and beating an intelligent heart. 

One of the quintessential boy's own - men on a mission movies, The Guns of Navarone, still a treat over 55 years since it was first shown in theatres, and crucially, it's still influencing other film makers as well. 9/10"

RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 1989 and directed by David Schmoeller, ""Puppet Master"" (or “Puppetmaster”) takes place at a striking old hotel on the California coast where four psychics gather to meet a former colleague and his wife, the heir of the grand inn. However, their colleague has committed suicide and puppets animated by Egyptian sorcery are intent on killing them off one-by-one.

This was the first of a franchise that includes a dozen sequels (as of this writing), which is one more than the Friday the 13th franchise. While decidedly Grade B in quality, I liked the grand ol’ hotel setting, the cast, and the Ten Little Indians-like plot. Unfortunately, the first half hour feels lethargic and dull. 

From there, the film’s decent enough with quality puppet effects. Irene Miracle is stunning as a psychic biyatch and Kathryn O'Reilly & Robin Frates ain’t no slouches on the feminine front, but the filmmakers fumble the ball as far as taking advantage of these resources. Paul Le Mat is genial as the main male protagonist with frightful hair while Jimmie F. Skaggs is formidable as the colleague gone mad.     

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in California (Riverside, Pasadena, etc.). WRITERS: Charles Band, Kenneth J. Hall, Schmoeller and  J.S. Cardone. 

GRADE: C+ || _Puppet Master_ is the first of the Puppet Master series of movies.
It's not the best, so if this is the first Puppet Master movie you see I'd continue on with the series as the sequels are actually much better than the original.

In this movie, we are introduced to the Puppet Master himself, Toulon. We don't learn much about Toulon in this movie other than he created some living puppets and killed himself rather than being captured.

The bulk of the movie takes place years later when a group of new-age super friends (a psychic, a witch, a magician, etc.) go to a hotel where their other occult friend has recently died. 
It turns out he was after the secrets of Toulon and _something happened_. Puppet carnage ensues.

The Puppet Master movies get much better after this.
The latest as of this writing is ""Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich,"" which is done by a different studio and stars Thomas Lennon. 

All of the original Puppet Master movies are on a video streaming service by Full Moon Features, which produced them. || **A horrible film saved by five puppets and good stop-motion animation.**

I saw this film recently, following the advice of a friend, and I didn't have very high expectations: she herself had told me that it was a bad film, and I decided to confirm how bad it was. It brings us a story about living puppets that kill people... something we get tired of seeing in better movies.

The problem with the film is not the puppets. This worked very well in other films, it's a relatively recurrent type of premise in horror and I even liked its technical execution, quite good thanks to good ""stop-motion"" animators: the main problem is a stupid script, which seems to be making fun of with the public's intelligence: it all starts with the arrival of a group of five mediums at a decadent hotel. They were called by a man they already knew, who had married the young owner of the hotel and died in the meantime. It turns out that those mediums didn't like that man at all, and one of them has the bright idea of spending that night speaking ill of the deceased in front of the widow. Speaking ill of someone at the wake itself and in front of the mourners is perhaps the rudest thing that can be done in a situation like this.

The stupidity, of course, does not stop here: two of the alleged mediums are like two rabbits in heat and are only concerned with studying their own sexual performance, worthy, incidentally, of the best artists in adult cinema. The common concern of all of them is the possibility that that man, before dying, found the secret of an old toy master who committed suicide in the hotel decades before. Of course, the answer becomes obvious to us when we see all the dolls walking around the hotel in front of everyone's unsuspecting noses. And if screaming or asking for help would be the most reasonable and intelligent thing to do when a wooden doll, alive, decides to try to cut us into slices, then the characters in this film lose all sanity, because they are peacefully awaiting death. Sound stupid enough?

The cast is poor, based on actors from B movies and television. None of them deserves a special mention, they are all miserable and hams. Irene Miracle and William Hickey appear in the film, but for so little time that I don't even consider them part of the cast, but mere cameos. Those who really deserve praise here are the dolls. The stop-motion animation used was the best at the time, and it works really well here. The environment, the hotel's setting, was also reasonably recreated, and the film becomes more fun when the puppets appear and start walking around."

Add to those classic elements, a really strong cast that mixes new blood with those more experienced and we get a properly heart-rending iteration. The constantly feuding ""Montague"" and ""Capulet"" families dominate society in Verona. Despite this long standing animosity, the curious and charming young ""Romeo"" (Leonard Whiting) risks life and limb to attend the ""Capulet"" masked ball. It is there that he encounters the beauty that is ""Juliet"" (Olivia Hussey) and the two embark on a relationship that puts both themselves and their friends in great peril. Over the course of the next 2¼ hours, Franco Zeffirelli immerses us in the greatest love story in English literature, tempered with jealously and intolerance, petty vengeances and loads of humour as the youngsters struggle to comprehend the reason for this historic vendetta. Whiting has a freshness and exuberance as the young ""Romeo"" - his effort here makes it easy to see why ""Juliet"" would be drawn to his attractive boyishness. Miss Hussey, too, brings an innocence and optimism to her performance that, when the two share the screen, is really quite engaging to watch. To be honest, some of the supporting cast were a bit on the theatrical side - especially Robert Stephens' ""Prince"" and Michael York doesn't really shine in the crucial role of ""Tybalt"", but to compensate there are lively contributions from Pat Heywood as the nurse - always a fun character with this author; Milo O'Shea works well as ""Friar Laurence"" as does John McEnery as ""Mercutio"". It takes only a few liberties with the original script, and so the story flows along towards it's well known ending much as William Shakespeare might have imagined, which adds great richness to a dialogue that does require concentration, but is well worth the effort in the end. || **Another fine adaptation of the Bard's masterpiece.**

William Shakespeare is an author of all time. Everyone knows him, everyone considers him, even those who don't speak native English. It is a universal heritage, and “Romeo and Juliet” is his most important work. There is no end to the number of film adaptations: basically, “Romeo and Juliet” has been adapted to film for as long as cinema has existed. And it's hard to choose which one is the best, each one has its merits and demerits. I have some preferences, but I'm not going to lie, this adaptation deserves to be among the best.

It's pretty obvious that Franco Zeffirelli tried everything to be absolutely faithful to the material and give us something realistic and powerful. In addition to trying to give us realistic sets and costumes with credible Renaissance touches, he filmed in Italy, making the most of the cities and ancient squares of various cities. He was also not satisfied with the famous actors of the time and looked for teenage actors capable of incarnating, with strong realism, the two central characters of the plot. The cinematography was also meticulously handled by the director, with a meticulous eye and surgical cuts.

The result of all this remarkable work is plain to see: we are talking about a film released in 1968, when our parents were burning books in universities and shouting for revolution and free love, or fighting with guns in hand in some corner of Colonial Africa. The world seems to have turned a somersault in those fifty years, and yet the film is still impeccable, it looks magnificent, and it seems so fresh and new that it could almost be a current film. Nominated for four Oscars, it won two: Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design. Righteous.

Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey give us the greatest interpretations of their careers, still in their teens, which is remarkable on the one hand, and sad on the other, as it denotes that they were not able to, with that, really succeed in the world of cinema. . Michael York also deserves a round of applause for his magnificent performance as Tybalt, and I also really liked Bruce Robinson, John McEnery and Pat Heywood.

Unfortunately, it is not a film without flaws, most of which lie in the details that pass our attention. The first fault is, for me, the excessive light of some scenes, where the colors and the look of the film are strange due to the excessive light. Another problem has to do with the lack of ability to transform stage dialogues into cinema dialogues, that is, to transform the elaborate and theatrical lines that Shakespeare thought into something that would actually be feasible in the mouths of real characters. And I also didn't like that they cut the apothecary scene. Someone mentioned the nudity scene of the two main characters, and I can even find it understandable that this has offended some prudes, but it's a nudity that is understandable by the time the film was released... and honestly? Call me what you like, Olivia Hussey was quite beautiful, dressed or undressed."

And the not understanding satire or dark humor thing that plagues that generation.

Anyway, getting her and her besties to sit down and watch anything older than 4 years is an uphill battle... again a uniquely Millennial thing. This is odd to me since I was born after this came out, and, honestly, love a lot of movies even decades older than me.... it's the new ones I don't like.

So I begged, and I pleaded, and I finally got them to watch Blazing Saddles, on the basis that I actually forced my wife (at gun point, and knife point) to watch Young Frankenstein and she loved it.

Blazing Saddles lasted about 10 minutes before they got upset by the racism.

But they she and her best friend and her boyfriend sat it out anyway, and by the end of the movie they were throwing a fit about racism as if I sat them down to watch Birth of a Nation.

Mel Brooks somehow went way over their heads...

... I'm not exactly sure that has ever happened before... ever, in all the History of the World, I'm pretty sure that has never, ever, happened before.

So I found myself with an angry wife and two very angry friends all pretty much accusing me of being William Luther Pierce.

Still not sure what happened there. Something went horribly wrong. This movie kind of mocks racism doesn't it? it turns it into a joke so people can't take it seriously any longer and makes the viewer think that anyone who wears a white robe is an idiot. An absolute moron.

And yet their collective reaction kind of assumed the opposite.

So, anyway, I slept on the couch for a while as I slowly talked her down and explained that, no, in fact this movie was AGAINST racism. That Mel Brooks is far from a racist. That, in fact, it supports equality.

But I'm still very confused.

I still don't know how that happened. || I grew up watching the ""Friday Western"" each week on the television so am a bit steeped in the genre to which this takes an entertaining, and loving, swipe. ""Hedley Lamarr"" (Harvey Korman) is out to trash his own town so he can buy up the land cheaply for his railroad. What better way to drive folks away than to appoint an African-American sheriff? The shrewd ""Bart"" (Cleavon Little) knows full well that he has precisely no support from his community - not the sharpest tools in the box - so he signs up the mean ""Waco Kid"" (Gene Wilder) as his deputy. A gunslinger of ill-repute, he and his boss gradually convince the sheepish townsfolk that they can fight back against the scheming ""Lamarr"" and maybe even foil his not so cunning plan. My personal favourite scene has to be the wonderful imitation of Marlene Dietrich by Madeline Kahn singing ""I'm Tired"", but there are loads of other skits of everything from ""High Noon"" to ""Chisum"" with Slim Pickens and David Huddleston providing some genuine western credentials to the proceedings. Auteur Mel Brooks pops up once or twice, in differing guises, to add a bit of additional comedy to his already quite daft storyline that is respectful of cowboy movies but also quite potently critical of their stereotyping characters, their repetitive storylines and usually, their entirely predictable conclusions. This mixes all of that up with Little and Wilder gelling well, presenting us with a genuinely laugh out loud, occasionally slap-stick, critique of one hundred years of a theme of cinema that has probably not really evolved that much since 1874! || <em>'Blazing Saddles'</em> is fairly funny. The good intentions of this 1974 satire is clear to see, naturally it can come across as a bit on the nose at times but it does lead to some amusement. Cleavon Little & Gene Wilder give good performances; always nice to see the latter.

Harvey Korman is the one I probably found most amusing, for example the Hedy Lamarr running gag gave me a minor chuckle each time. In fact, that scene with him and Robert Ridgely (credit to him, also) is probably the one I'll remember most from this; that and the quicksand part.

Both of those aforementioned bits are at the beginning. It's certainly a film that I'd say starts stronger than it finishes. I don't mean that in a negative way, but if the run time was longer then it'll would've become an issue. The conclusion itself is bizarre, kinda a lacklustre end in truth.

Just like with when I watched <em>'Robin Hood: Men in Tights'</em> earlier this month, I can see the general appeal for this Mel Brooks flick. I enjoyed both movies, with this one a notch above that one in my opinion. The two are equally worth watching, all the same."

Falling in with two lovely sisters, Betty & Judy, the boys plan to put on a variety show with the girls to entice people back to the lodge. But misunderstandings and romantic leanings are not going to make this at all easy.

Enduring, perennial, simple and beguiling are all words fit to be associated with White Christmas. It's directed by Mr Reliable, Michael Curtiz, features songs from Irving Berlin and stars Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen & Dean Jagger. Filmed in Technicolor, it's also notable for being the first film to be shot in VistaVision (think wide-screen process). In truth the film is thinly plotted and doesn't remotely feature some of Berlin's best tunes, and I dare to be a touch more critical as the VistaVision is wasted on the studio led direction. Yet it's such a charming and heart warming film it feels churlish to let the negatives negate the over riding feeling of having been cheered after a viewing.

So although it's not the brilliance it perhaps should have been, it's ultimately a picture that still reels in new viewers every yuletide year, and that's something that is hard to argue with. So enjoy the title song and the likes of ""Sisters,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep"" & ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"". Marvel at the zippiness of Vera-Ellen's dancing whilst lapping up the side-kick goofiness provided by the always watchable Kaye. Be emotionally involved with Dean Jagger's heavy hearted General, and of course there's Crosby too, seemingly ageless, he croons and simultaneously manages to melt the ice in your drink as you snuggle up by the fire.

Delightful. 7/10 || I am not a fan of musicals, but if I am to watch one I prefer this type: where the story is told in dialogue, interrupted and built onto by the songs. The movies that are pure music — including dialogue, threaten to cause me to slide out of my chair onto the floor and stare at the ceiling.

The writing is a bit hokey and sometimes predictable, but overall it is entertaining and quite watchable. We wondered where they found room in the building for the huge set that was created, but rule number one here is to suspend your disbelief, and ignore niggling little questions such as: where are the parents of the general’s granddaughter?

So it was a pleasant enough watch. I saw a review that spoke of Danny Kaye’s bad acting, but really I thought he and everyone did just fine. The songs are all good, except for the title song, which is of course perfect. || Danny Kaye is much the more natural here as he (""Phil"") and successful partner ""Bob"" (Bing Crosby) hook up with the aspiring sister-act team of ""Betty"" (Rosemary Clooney) and ""Judy"" (Vera-Ellen). The latter pair have a gig at a remote Vermont inn, and so after some shenanigans on a train they all arrive to discover it is run by the gents' former wartime CO ""Gen. Waverly"" (Dean Jagger). Determined to come to the aid of this decent and proud man, they concoct a scheme to quite literally rally the troops! The gist of the plot is one of loyalty and integrity, but there is plenty of daft comedy interspersed to keep the whole thing from becoming too earnest or sentimental. The dance numbers are expertly choreographed and the musical numbers from Irving Berlin including the belters ""Sisters"" (with a little help from Gloria Wood) and ""Blue Skies"" keep the toes tapping too... It's a cheery, gentle romantic comedy that puts a smile on your face and reinforces any faith in the human spirit that might need topping up. I always found Crosby a little too slick on screen, but Kaye and Clooney are great and though perhaps just a shade too long, it's still an enjoyable seasonal romp, well worth a watch with some mulled wine and the odd chocolate Santa."

""For anybody of a given age or someone who is a real cinephile... You only need to hear... David Lynch. The first impression I had was tension, then I watched it again... it's nightmarish."" David M. Brown.

""It's one of those things that can only be described as a lucid dream come to life. It takes a certain caliber of person to actually put out work like that.  And it's not crazy.... It's Genius."" Sarah Peterson.

""Definitely a brain Burner. It was definitely the weirdest movie I've watched. I can't describe this movie in words... It's not of this earth. I want to go sit in a corner in a dark place and think. This is not a movie.... It's beyond a movie."" David Veerkamp  || We believe that films should ""make people happy"" (euphoria). No, we believe it should. Of course, there were thorny issues in getting there.
I used to say that ""movies are the art version of pornography"" if there was even a hint of sexuality, and in middle and high school I mainly watched ""erotic"" movies (""A Clockwork Orange"" being the first of these).
Looking back, I was a ""foolish spectator."" One day, however, a change came to me. I believe that an encounter with a movie can change your life, and the movie I encountered was ""Mulholland Drive,"" which turned my view of movies upside down, saying, ""I have never seen a movie like this.
Until then, to my surprise, I had never even heard of David Lynch (I'm embarrassed to say ‼︎).
From memory, between the ages of 12 and 13, I saw this surreal, showbiz-crazed entertainment at least a dozen times and was not only never bored, but drawn in. Isn't that amazing?
I mean, ""It was a 'monumental' movie in my life"" (my strongest experience in a movie theater was when I saw ""The Return of the King""). ......
So I had to see this film by a great filmmaker. In comparison, ""Lost Highway"" was an insignificant film.
Honestly, I don't know, but it seemed to be well received by the public. However, this is a common phenomenon.
A friend says, ""This movie is interesting,"" so I take his opinion and watch it, only to find that it is actually not that interesting.
Now it has become my ""rule"" and ""motto"" to ""choose my own movies.""
Even 'Blue Velvet,' which is considered Lynch's best film, was really bad."" What is so interesting about David Lynch?"" I am often asked. It is difficult to answer this question.
In fact, even if he had retired from the film industry after one film, ""Mulholland Drive,"" David Lynch would still be revered as the king of surrealist cinema, but my ""Lynch experience"" ends there. However, it was ""Eraserhead"" that started my ""Lynch experience"" back to the classics, and that is where it should have ended.
This creepy, nightmarish film, which even psychotic patients can't hold (and if Lynch portrays psychosis, he certainly sucks at it), was released in 1978 and although it didn't gain immediate popularity, it did gain a cult following by being shown in drive-in theaters and elsewhere.
""What is this creepy movie?""
I was astonished to learn that this movie was made in 1977. There were few ups and downs in the story and no visual beauty.
It was just a dusty, sandy factory area. An alien obsessed with the ""peculiar hairstyle"" of the main character, played by Jack Nance, gives birth to a deformed child and is sexually abused by his stepmother.
It is the story of Mary, the ""crazy fiancée"" who gave birth to the deformed baby and abandoned him, her sexual neighbors, and the puppies who suck chubby titties from the female dog. The chicken at the table runs like clockwork.
The ""deformed"" baby cries and we dissect it. The ""vomit"" comes down our throats, and it's painful to watch. Frankly, it made me sick. Was it my fault or the movie? Was it Jack Nance's fault?
By the way, please don't assume that ""Eraserhead"" is super difficult to understand. To me, Christopher Nolan's films are esoteric, but David Lynch's films are not so esoteric if you are in a position to ""watch"" them. The images may be boring because they embody a world that could happen to anyone (e.g., insanity or psychosis), but Lynch would not want to make it ""esoteric.""
Eraserhead is, in short, experimental science fiction (not breathtaking ""entertainment"") only in the guise of ""surrealism.""
It begins with two shots of ""Henry"" and a ""deformed child"" drifting through ""outer space,"" and eventually a creepy woman appears in ""high places"" and ""deep waters.""
The ""factory zone"" and ""outer space"" are connected until the creepy woman sings ""In Heaven."" The ""Alien Child"" is in ""intergalactic union"" with the man from ""The Distant Star"" and Henry Spencer. || Straight up: I don't like this movie. It is a grotesque, bizarre horror movie. There is no real plot. The only thing this movie will do is make you feel uncomfortable. It makes you feel like in a bizarre nightmare. And this it does really well. I give it 3 stars for the artistic creation that it is and the effect it can create on the audience.

Shot in 70mm film, watching the Bluray on a projector or a large-screen television offers one of the most visually stunning cinematic experiences around. There is no dialogue or voiceover, no characters, but the enormous amount of footage is presented here in a way that gives BARAKA a gripping dramatic arc, and it's a sequence that, on repeated viewings, increasingly seems the one logical way in which all this could have been edited.

With unquenchable anthropological curiosity, Fricke identifies commonalities that link us all. A Japanese mafioso's tattoos, for example, are followed immediately by a shot of the same on an indigenous resident of Papua New Guinea. But it's not only exotic tribalism. A shot of affluent Japanese schoolgirls looking at the camera is mirrored later by an almost identical shot of low-caste girls in Calcutta. Nonetheless, don't expect a mushy call for tolerance; Fricke's editing indeed makes a convincing case for appreciating differences, but there is nuance.

Fricke's occasional use of footage from churches, mosques, temples, etc. is less an advocacy for belief in religion than an extension of the commonalities he identifies. Human beings have an urge for contemplation as solace among the complicated and sometimes senseless world around them, and they draw on inner sources of mercy to go against the cruelty that people show to their fellow man. The consequences of a world cut adrift from calm and compassion are shown during a heartbreaking sequence that ranges from Auschwitz and the Cambodian killing fields to homeless across the globe and teenage prostitutes in a Bangkok nightclub.

The footage is accompanied by an array of musical pieces which help to set the mood for each series of shots: minimalist loops form the soundtrack for scenes of industrial production, we hear harsh bagpipes as the camera tours the burning oil fields of Kuwait, and Dead Can Dance's ""The Host of Seraphim"" plays during an indictment of poverty worldwide. Some of musicians involved are rather New-Agey and would never have a place in my music listening, but when integrated into the film they are remarkably effective. The 5.1 surround sound excellently balances cinematic effect and faithfulness to the scenes portrayed.

I've watched BARAKA many times now, each time discovering many new things and always being moved, whether to pity (Calcutta garbage-pickers) or wonder (the unreal glittering hall of Shiraz's Shahcheragh mausoleum). I would certainly rank it among my favourite films. Will you like it? That's hard to say. BARAKA is my go-to Bluray when friends and family want to try out my fancy home theatre setup with HD projector and surround sound, and while some of them have been just as stunned as I am, others don't really care. Apparently many people, even those with a well-rounded education, don't have much curiosity for things outside their own everyday experience, and so Fricke's survey of world cultures doesn't resonate with them.

(Note that while Fricke created a 2011 follow-up called SAMSARA, I would recommend staying away from it, as it is less focused and only repeats BARAKA to diminishing effect.)"

Frank Sinatra's ""Frankie"" is released from a stint in prison and heads straight back to the drug-infused melting pot from whence he came. Initially intent on staying clean, soon peer pressures and his struggle to survive, with his high-maintenance wife ""Zosh"" (Eleanor Parker) have him back at square one. It might just be that his salvation can come from his lover, the excellent Kim Novak (""Molly""), and from his drum kit? Sinatra proves he has some versatility as an actor here, and both Parker and Novak - alongside an un-nerving effort from Robert Strauss as his supplier ""Schwiefka"", makes this a far grittier, harder hitting drama than we might have expected. It shows us the relentlessness and hopelessness of his situation; also of the relative futility of the attempts at rehabilitation he went through in jail. It is too long, the first twenty minutes establish the characters, but at the expense of any decent pace - but once the ducks are in a row here, Otto Preminger elicits characterful performances from the cast that make this film quite realistic, and tough to watch at times. || Bit of a slow-moving picture, one that might've ended sooner, though I do class <em>'The Man with the Golden Arm'</em> as something rather quite good.

Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak keep events moving along with strong showings, Sinatra especially. Eleanor Parker is, though, the person onscreen that I appreciated most whilst watching, there's just something about her performance that puts her ahead of her co-stars; I'd even say she overacts in parts, yet it absolutely still worked for me.

The story does go round the houses a little, but even with that being the case it didn't actually affect my personal enjoyment all that much - it just totally could've been trimmed and we probably wouldn't have missed anything. Elsewhere, the score is excellent - especially the theme for when Frankie desires his habbits.

I'd have to be in the right mood to revisit this. Nonetheless, it do be a very good film from 1955 - ahead of its time, that's for sure."
36724.0,The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years,"An exploration of the heavy metal scene in Los Angeles, with particular emphasis on glam metal.

Released in 1988, “The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years” by Penelope Spheeris is a documentary covering the 80’s metal scene. The film includes footage & interviews of popular acts (KISS, Ozzy, Aerosmith, Megadeth, Alice Cooper, Poison), moderately successful bands (Faster Pussycat) and up-and-not-coming artists (London, Odin, Seduce). 

There are obviously staged parts, like the orange juice spill, Paul Stanley in a bed with three lingerie-clad women and the drunken pool sequence with Chris Holmes & his mother. These portions were included to amuse, but they're also informative, as far as the commentaries from the actual musicians involved in the 80's metal movement go.

The rest of the movie is footage of live interviews and concerts, mostly at clubs with emphasis on bands that frequented the L.A. strip. There's nothing fake about these parts. The film covers the 87/88 metal scene and the people thereof, their ideas, attitudes, lifestyles and fronts.

It’s interesting going back in time to see iconic musicians when they were younger, like Lemmy, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Dave Mustaine and Alice Cooper. It’s also nice to hear some quality obscure acts, like Detroit’s Seduce who were surprisingly heavy and aggressive when, by their looks and name, I was expecting conventional 80’s glam metal. Even Odin and London show that they were formidable and deserved greater success.   

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes.

The energy and spirit of these rebellious youths really comes across well, and the clever assertion from one of the interviewees that punk is simply another form of folk and protest music, albeit with different instruments and at a faster speed, rings true. Though I'm not privy to the Los Angeles scene (I'm from Windsor, Ontario, for crying out loud), it appears to be quite an accurate depiction, although it doesn't seem to grab hold, perhaps, of the underground movement. Seeing this, I look forward to the latter two parts of the trilogy, and only wish over the years that Spheeris had expanded her sights, and made documentaries of other, vital, forms of music in L.A., such as folk, hip-hop, rap, jazz, classical, experimental, even soundtrack work for films, since Hollywood is right nearby, and as someone already part of the filmmaking scene, she would have had access to some of the greats of our time."
938.0,For a Few Dollars More,"Two bounty hunters both pursue the brutal and sadistic bandit, El Indio, who has a large bounty on his head.","The man with no name is back... the man in black is waiting... a walking arsenal - he uncoils, strikes and kills!",Western,132,1965-12-18,it,8.018,4168,6.9655,"Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Gian Maria Volonté, Luigi Pistilli, Klaus Kinski",Sergio Leone,"bounty hunter, pot smoking, rural area, spaghetti western, right hand man, piano","I was worried about you - all alone, with so many problems to solve...

The middle part of Sergio Leone's dollars trilogy sandwich is a mighty hunk of meat and pasta. Plot has Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as bounty hunters who form a very uneasy alliance to bring down violent bandit El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè) and his gang.

As befitting Leone in this sub-genre, the pic positively oozes charisma and class. His compositions are as striking as the coolness he wrings out from his lead actors, the characterisations bristling with a calm grizzle factor that beguiles as the story jumps from violence to suspense, from humour to misery, with surprises is store as well. The screenplay adheres to some clichés of the Western formula, but never at a cost to suspense and mystery, such as with the finale that looks set to be formulaic, but joyfully brings its own identity whilst simultaneously adding extra layers to the protags and antag. The dialogue (Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni) pings with literacy, something which is a pleasant mercy in the Spaghetti Western world, while Morricone fills the key scenes with aural shards of atmospheric delight.

A great film in its own standalone right, but also a super precursor to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 9/10 || I'd rank it slightly below the original, but that's unimportant as <em>'For a Few Dollars More'</em> is still a lot of fun.

Clint Eastwood is tremendous again as the lead character, while Gian Maria Volonté reappears as a different character - usually I'm not a fan of actors playing different characters in a series, but I must make an exception here as Volonté is terrific; just as he is in the preceding 1964 film. One newcomer to the cast is Lee Van Cleef, who is brilliant too.

A story regarding bounty hunting was always going to be enjoyable, which is most definitely the case here. The aforementioned trio are massively entertaining. I particularly found the ending to be one of the best parts of this.

I was excited to check out <em>'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'</em> even prior to watching the first two films, given it's the one I knew most of beforehand, but its two predecessors really have wet the appetite and then some! || This is a waste of some wit.
Of the dollar trilogy, this one had some wit to it, but it's wasted. There's an ongoing weird counting that the bounty hunters perform, which finally makes sense in the end.
There's an interesting bit about the chimes, and drawing when the chime ends.
And we get a name for No Name.
But it's wasted on a movie that Leone made during what must have been the days when he really hated some brunette who scorned him. He spends most of the movie contriving so many ways to kill brunettes that he obviously is seeking a Nazi merit badge. He stopped worshiping Adolf and Eva soon after the dollar trilogy, though.
There's no way to get past his Nazi ideology in this movie, and it ruins the movie.
Not to mention the lack of credible characters and lack of credible motivation. Again, it's a case of everyone in the West is either a homicidal maniac or the first victims of homicidal maniacs, no exceptions.
The weakest part, and part that makes anyone with an IQ over 15 groan, is that Leone is not subtle about his message that the more of a homicidal maniac a man is, the more of a demigod he is, and more immortal he is. 
Only another demigod can kill a demigod, and only a homicidal maniac can be a demigod. It appears the only way to be a god is to be the biggest homicidal maniac.
If everyone was like this, there would be no one left to be like this.
A waste of wit, which is bad, because this is the only one of the Leone Westerns which made any attempt at wit."

Magnum Force is directed by Ted Post and collectively written by Harry and Rita Fink, John Milius and Michael Cimino. It stars Clint Eastwood, Hal Holbrook, Mitchell Ryan, David Soul, Felton Perry, Tim Matheson and Robert Urich. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by  Frank Stanley.
 
The second Dirty Harry movie finds Inspector Callahan on the trail of a vigilante group who are offing Frisco’s villains.
 
Following in the wake of ""Dirty Harry"" was never going to be easy, Don Siegel’s film was very much a trail blazer of sorts, giving the movie lovers of the world a different cop than that which was accustomed. So what to do with ""Magnum Force"" then, the inevitable sequel given ""Dirty Harry’s"" popularity? The makers come up with a great idea, have Harry confront a group of vigilantes who believe in his own kill crime ethics, only they take it to the extreme.
 
So begins a trail of blood for Harry to follow which leads him right where we the viewers pretty much knew he was going to end up. Ted Post is no Don Siegel, and although the action and all round testosterone feel that so marked out the ""Dirty Harry"" films is exciting and evident respectively, there’s periods where the film meanders. The instances that serve to add more complexity to Harry’s make-up is welcome, but aside from a jumping bean turn from Holbrook, the director can’t get much out of the rest of the cast, as shame since there’s a lot of up and coming talent and stalwarts in the mix.
 
Still, even with some minor and evident problems it’s a lively and entertaining sequel (the best of them actually), one that doesn’t shy away from pushing some buttons and baiting of critics who had disdain for the first film. The ending is a disappointment, though, but the journey is ultimately meaty and macho. 7.5/10 || The second movie on Dirty Harry's series is better than the first.

Harry's character gets some evolution and we start to see a bit of the human being and his private life behind that gun.

The directing is good, Eastwood makes a good performance and the plot and dialogues are slightly better than in the first.

The soundtrack is also something to remark in this one. || A strong follow-up to <em>'Dirty Harry'</em>.

I feel as positively about this as I do about that 1971 original. I don't think they set the world alight per se, but they are unquestionably entertaining and have a strong vibe about them. Clint Eastwood is terrific, while the support cast - though not on the aforementioned's level - are solid. Good story, well paced... I like it."

She doesn't exactly look the part, but she has has a voice to die for and suddenly - after a seriously ropey start - their act starts to track a little better. Are things finally on the up? Thus far the film showcases some classy numbers peppered with the odd pithy one-liner and just about enough style to get it by. Now we have our little triumvirate, though, the romantic clutter starts to get in the way; the standard dysfunctional family soap suds start to froth and I just found the whole thing started to drag. Pfeiffer is the star of the show, and her versions of ""More Than You Know"" and ""My Funny Valentine"" are impressive, but the joke had worn far too thin for me by this point and I'd lost interest. It's a grand looking film at it's best, but sadly Steve Kloves couldn't quite steer it away from the tedious and fractious sibling stuff that I found increasingly predictable and dull. || ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" is a directionless meander through the flawed lives of the central characters Jack and Frank and it is occasioned by their decision to freshen up their cheesy and jaded cocktail lounge act by introducing a sultry female singer. The film effortlessly captures the quiet desperation of the eternally small time careers of the Baker boys as they monotonously tour around a ceaseless succession of out of the way second rate venues. They are trapped in such places and like so many of us they have gradually convinced themselves they are doing well in a tough business which offers few rewards, but all they are really doing is lying to themselves that they are more than they are and will ever be because sometimes it is easier to live a lie instead of facing up to the truth and admitting life has passed you by."

I remember coming out the theatre after having seen Flatliners in 1990 and being really annoyed. The premise of the story is so superb and was ripe for a terrifying horror film, but Flatliners then, and now, is not terrifying, but that actually doesn't matter.

In 1990 some of the more bright young acting prospects were off making Memphis Belle, the other half that was made up of potential Brat Packers like Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, William Baldwin, Oliver Platt and Kevin Bacon, were joining director Joel Schumacher for this delve into life after death experiments.

How the heck did that happen?

So you know, there was a lot working for it despite it being Joel Schumacher in the 90s being Joel Schumacher in the 90s.

In 1954, several high schoolers in southeast Florida pursue sex while tangling with the owner of a sleazy nightclub in the Everglades and his sheriff brother.

""Porky's"" (1981) is iconic in early 80's cinema, but it's a half good/half bad piece for me. It's too unpleasantly sleazy with corny sex-related jokes and the sexually ""liberated"" tone doesn't fit the mid-50s. I can't believe Susan Clark lowered herself to play the prostitute Cherry Forever; likewise, Kim Cattrall gets stuck with a (supposedly funny) humiliating scene. Furthermore, the young actors are clearly in the 24-30 range, not high schoolers. It would've made more sense to make this about college juniors/seniors.

But there are some good parts, like the 50's southeast Florida setting, the coming-of-age element, a few attractive females and an honest attempt to flesh out these youths with conflicts and so forth.

Unfortunately, the raunchiness leaves the viewer feeling dirty. For a much more palatable movie of this ilk check out the excellent ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" which came out five months later.

A homicide, or a bad B-movie?

Not exactly what you would call an unknown horror comedy, but there is the distinct feeling that it should be better known. As its cult fan base will attest, this is blast of a movie, a homage to the ""B"" schlockers of lore. Directed by Fred Dekker, the premise sees some alien beings eject a flask of alien slugs down to earth, which lands at a fraternity campus, something which cause mayhem some years later when a frozen body is disturbed at the medical lab and the slugs are unleashed. Cue infestation that turns people into zombies!

The pic plays up to the clichés of fraternity based movies, with nerds and nudity on tap, all smothered in a gooey horror comedy sauce. One-liners are ripe, the characterisations also, the latter of which fronted by a glorious Tom Atkins as a hard drinking hard - boiled detective with issues and quips ready to be poured out. It's not genius film making, but given the low budget it deserves its cult status, because it never pauses for breath and it's very aware of what it wants to be - and crucially who its target audience is. 7/10 || Night of the Creeps is a fantastic movie to watch in many different situations: with friends, at a sleepover, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the day, and so many more. 

It's an easy to watch flick, and it contains the right balance of horror elements, gore, campiness, humor, and absurdity to make each viewing as enjoyable as the last. It's got a touch of body-stealing aliens, a touch of zombies, a touch of traditional serial killer, all mixed with all the fun that can come from being placed in a sorority house. 

Sure, it's not downright frightening, and it's not necessarily an utterly funny movie like a comedy, but the balance it strikes between the two is where the beauty shines through. || **_Entertaining sci-fi/horror “lost gem” from the mid-80s_**

During a frat initiation, two buds at a SoCal university (Jason Lively and Steve Marshall) inadvertently unleash something creepy that results in the walking dead. Tom Atkins plays the detective on the case while Jill Whitlow draws the attention of one of the boys. 
  
“Night of the Creeps” (1986) is sci-fi/horror with a wink of amusement that features bits from previous movies, like “The Blob” and zombie flicks, to forge its own unique concoction. The writing is creative, the characters are fleshed-out and the director has a good eye for women in a few quick spots (not talking ’bout nudity or sleaze). The detective especially is an interesting character while Whitlow’s voice is to die for.   

This would obviously influence “Slither,” which came out two decades later, but “Creeps” is the superior film, by far (there’s something distasteful & ugly about “Slither,” but that’s just me).

The movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot entirely in Los Angeles.

Los Angeles is imploding with mayhem as gang wars fill the streets, an under pressure police force try to restore order, but both parties have another foe to worry about, a Predator is in town, and he's about to up the ante.

Gone is Arnold Schwarzenegger, gone is John McTiernan, and gone is the jungle setting, so following in the foot steps of the ultimate beefcake movie that was Preadtor 1987 was an unenviable task it seems. Yet I personally feel that Predator 2 stands up to scrutiny as a fine entry into the sci-fi/action genre. Locating it among the urban decay of L.A. works real well, and pitting the Predator against a tough grizzled (but hardly giganticus beefcakeus) cop (Danny Glover) gives us a smart brains against brawn story. Also cutely is that director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim & John Thomas have actually got the Predator cleaning up the streets of L.A., in fact another two hours of Predator hunt and kill tactics and crime in L.A. would have been completely eradicated! There is plenty of bloody snotty gore to appease fans of that persuasion, and it's nice to report that the characters on show do actually impact as part of the story.

Voodoo magic man!

It has a fine cast that reads like a who's who of action films, Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Robert Davi (Die Hard), Gary Busey (Under Siege), Rubén Blades (Once Upon a Time in Mexico) & Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man), whilst Kevin Peter Hall dons the Predator suit and suitably kicks arse again. It's not genius, it's not even ground breaking, but Predator 2 is a fine and entertaining genre piece that sadly seems to forever be undervalued on internet forums.

Who's Next?  8/10 || When I was younger I always hated _Predator 2_. Rewatching it as an adult, I don't think it was fair how bad I thought it was. It's not that _Predator 2_ is crap, it's just that it's **so much worse** than the original (one of the 5 best movies ever made), that it comes across as such a massive disappointment. With fresh, or I guess more accurately, with more experienced eyes, I don't mind _Predator 2_ at all, there's actually a lot of stuff I like about it. It's still not a great movie to me, but I don't skip it when I'm doing a marathon like I would have once upon a time. It expands upon the Predator lore in some pretty cool ways, and the Jamaican Voodoo Posse inspired my Escher Necromunda gang, so I've wound up pretty 50/50 on the whole thing.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || So for the sequel, we swap an actual jungle for an urban one, and Arnie is replaced by Danny Glover. At least the baddie is the same - only this time, we immediately know what's going on and what to expect. Therein lies the problem: there is no suspense. A seriously B-list group of talent - Gary Busey (""Keyes"") and Adam Baldwin (""Garber"") amongst them, really help this descend quickly into a pit of mediocre special effects tinged with Glover's rather typical way of playing cop. It doesn't hang around, to be fair - there are plenty of combat scenes; and Sylvia Saunders (""Ruth"") looks like she could be lethal with a broom, but by the end, I was fairly sure I was in the visitor's camp because this just isn't very good."
865.0,The Running Man,"By 2017, the global economy has collapsed and U.S. society has become a totalitarian police state, censoring all cultural activity. The government pacifies the populace by broadcasting a number of game shows in which convicted criminals fight for their lives, including the gladiator-style The Running Man, hosted by the ruthless Damon Killian, where “runners” attempt to evade “stalkers” and certain death for a chance to be pardoned and set free.","It is the year 2019. ""The Running Man"" is a deadly game no one has ever survived. But Schwarzenegger has yet to play.","Action, Science Fiction, Thriller",101,1987-11-13,en,6.5,2491,5.0537,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Dawson, María Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Jim Brown",Paul Michael Glaser,"based on novel or book, dystopia, hunting human beings, game show, on the run, totalitarian, prison break, paranoid, dark future, wrongly accused, death game, not too distant future, fight for life, authoritarian, stalkers, alternate future, crowd mentality, dystopian future","I'm not into politics. I'm into survival.

The Running Man is directed by Paul Michael Glaser and adapted from the Stephen King (as Richard Bachman) story by Steven E. de Souza. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Conchita Alonso, Richard Dawson, Yaphet Kotto, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura, Erland van Lidth, Marvin J. McIntyre, Gus Rethwisch, Professor Toru Tanaka and Mick Fleetwood. Music is by Harold Faltermeyer and cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth.

It may be packed with cheese and is as nutty as a squirrel's sandwich, but this is one astutely entertaining futuristic slice of sci-fi pie. Schwarzenegger becomes a reluctant contestant in the most popular TV show of the time, The Running Man. It's a sadistic show where convicts are thrust into a zonal world and have to avoid an array of stalking killers. Cue lots of outrageous violence, equally outrageous costumes, and of course with Arnold in the lead there's plenty of dialogue zingers. The caustic observation of how television programmes have evolved is potently portentous, and it's all played out to an industrial 80s score from Faltermeyer.

It helps if you know what you are going to get from it, since it's a typical Schwarzenegger movie from the fruity chaotic popcorn era in the 80s. So with that in mind, for A.S. fans this is one to gorge on with glee - for others it may not have the charm offensive required to strike a chord.  7/10

Mixed notices then and now for John Carpenter's sci-fi love story - cum human warning parable, but the fact is is that if it touches you it's a touch that stays for ever. It's a lovely film headed up by Jeff Bridges' wonderful turn as the alien from outer space teaming up with Karen Allen for a road trip to a Nevada crater, where he will be picked up by his own species and taken home.

Taking on human form, that of Allen's deceased husband, much of the humour is derived from how the alien tries to adapt to a human lifestyle. The language, food, customs and romance, but always there is a serious thread running through the narrative. He was invited here by the contents of Voyager One, but now the suits want him for less than honourable research, so the pair, coming together as one after she is obviously in a state of kidnap worry, have to stay one step ahead of the authorities.

So there's suspense in the mix via the chase dynamics, as well as some beautiful sequences, one of which has animal lovers of the world punch the air with unbridled joy. The premise is of course flimsy, and cribbing bits from ET and Close Encounters did the film no favours under critical analysis, but the emotional whack is mightily strong, with the lead characters being so easy to root for. While Jack Nitzsche's synth based musical score is a sci-fi great, perfect.

A vastly under valued picture on Carpenter's CV, Starman would like to come and see us, if only we would give it the time. 8.5/10 || One of Jeff Bridges' better performances this one. He is an alien who arrives on Earth and assumes the physical shape of ""Hayden"". Thing is, he has recently died - so you can imagine how phased his recent widow ""Jenny"" (Karen Allen) is as he coerces her to drive him to Arizona where he can rendezvous with the others from his race. The crater left by his landing has attracted the attention of SETI - a government agency charged with looking for ET, and - of course - the more militaristic elements under the command of ""Fox"" (Richard Jaeckel). What now ensues is a road-movie with a difference as the two gradually start to bond whilst being pursued by the authorities. There is a gradually accumulating chemistry between Allen and Bridges, the latter offering a nuanced and gentle performance as if he were but a baby in a man's body lost in a strange and not particularly welcoming environment. It has some touching moments, a little humour and though the ending isn't really ever in doubt, the travels of this couple are demonstrated in a gently sentimental (but not sickly or melodramatic) fashion. It's a bit on the long side - we do take a little bit of time for the thing to get moving, but once it proves to be a well photographed, scored and entertaining character study from John Carpenter. Worth a watch, I'd say. || Look who directed it... and that raises a lot of questions doesn't it? I mean it's espically good and then you see it's john Carpenter doing a... a love story and a very moving and beautiful love story.

I guess the draft Carpenter got was extremely political... and he took all the politics out and focused on the love story, that was a great call, it was a great call in the 80s and it is great advice for today.

And it's good with Bridges doing a stellar job, and he really didn't learn how to act until the 90s.

I totally forgot about it, and then my wife and I saw it, hadn't seen it since the 80s and forgot how amazing it was. It stands the test of time, it's moving, it's beautiful, and it entertains... you can't ask for more."

After his best friend is burned and left for dead he decides enough is enough and thinks about retiring from the service, but whilst on a vacation with his wife and child things go decidedly bad and Max becomes an avenging force of fury with devastating affect.

When evaluating this film I feel it really needs to be put into perspective just how brilliant a job director George Miller did with next to no cash to work with, in fact Miller edited the film in his own bedroom just to emphasise the low-fi nature of the beast. The costumes are excellent, the cast are terrific, with Mel Gibson as Max particularly impressive, and here we have villains to truly fit the word villainous, but it's the stunts and chase sequences that makes this film a rich rewarding experience. The opening ten minutes alone are pure adrenalin pumping genius, but the film as a whole delivers a crash bang wallop punch that has often been imitated since its release, but rarely bettered, and although the heart of the film is a simple revenge story, it grabs your attention and delivers right to the corking finale, 8/10.

Footnote: Region 2 Users should note that the bargain bucket Mad Max Trilogy flip pack set still contains the foolishly dubbed version of this film, incredibly stupid move from the American distributors. || Though I had only seen the previous installment, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome', which I enjoyed whilst a great many people didn't, with the present sequel earning ten (!?) Oscar nominations, I wanted to catch up on things before seeing the new film at the Cineplex. I was very pleased with this early film in the post-apocalyptic movie category, and can see how and why both it and star Mel Gibson became so successful. Other than Kenneth Anger's experimental film, 'Scorpio Rising', I have never seen a work that so fetishes both cars and the ritual of dressing, either for driving or for war. It's very well directed and suspenseful for a first-timer in Miller, and I'm so glad he's still helming the films of the series 36 years later! All that one has to do to see How To and How Not To Continue a Fine Franchise is compare how both George Miller and George Lucas have done this century. It's sad that they were so short on funds that only Gibson could be fitted with real leather in the film--I think I can rightly assume that money isn't a problem anymore... || Who'd have thought we'd still be talking about a $350,000 film, 40 years after it was made?

It's post nuclear war Australia and the precious commodity is gasoline, all the varying degrees of survivors pursue it in anyway they can.

Director George Miller is here armed with considerably more cash than was available for the first cult hit offering in the series, and boy does it show as we get more destruction, even more outlandish stunts, and a fully realised apocalyptic vision of the future. It's incredible to note that there is no CGI here, this is pure raw stunt work, the film plays out as a standard good versus evil tale, but it's the realisation of the crash bang wallop sequences that lift it to being one of the most important sci-fi action movies of modern times.

The baddies are a seething mass of leather, masks, and mohawks, they scowl as they rape pillage and plunder anything in their path, they will stop at nothing to get the craved gasoline that is so important in this world.

So just strap yourself in and enjoy the ride given to you by a film that's still a benchmark for the genre. 9/10 || ***Fighting for fuel in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the Outback***

In the years after a global holocaust, an ex-lawman (Mel Gibson) in remote Australia befriends people at a refinery compound and helps them escape a band of ruthless punk bikers who want their resources. Bruce Spence plays the Gyro Captain while Vernon Wells is on hand as a subordinate leader of the bikers.

""The Road Warrior,” aka “Mad Max 2” (1981) shows a grim, bleak, brutal future, but it's too comic booky and sometimes goofy to truly disturb because it screams exaggeration. A truly disturbing movie debuted fifteen years earlier, “The Wild Angels” (1966), which is shocking because it’s realistic rather than cartoonish. But “The Wild Angels” was an outlaw biker drama whereas “Mad Max 2” is an action-packed adventure. There’s a lot of motorhead thrills if that trips your trigger. 

The movie’s an Australian production and avant-garde bordering on surrealism. The protagonist is aloof and laconic while the antagonists are bizarre, even psycho, which makes sense in that people would become a little mad in a desperate post-apocalyptic environment. It’s a strangely detached film about cartoonish people surviving in the wastelands of Australia, but the characters and images are often iconic; and there IS some human interest, like the Gyro Captain’s developing relationship with the cute blonde, the so-called Captain’s Girl (Arkie Whitley). Meanwhile Virginia Hey is striking as the Warrior Woman.

The film runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot in the Outback of New South Wales, Australia.

High production values and a compelling story line make this the best of the series. This one doesn't rely on basic car smashes for the duration and instead gives us a moving and more thoughtful adventure.

No campy men dressed for the _Blue Oyster_ bar in this one, thank goodness. _The Road Warrior_ (1981) is widely regarded as the best but I have to disagree. That film had a very one note narrative that verged on the bland and an overload of homoerotic imagery.

This is a beautiful looking and entertaining film that does not have the shoddy and amateur vibe of the first two. _Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome_ is the film that the first should have been.


- Charles Dance || Max Rockatansky and the Goonie feral gang.

Even allowing for my unabashed love of the first two films in the franchise, and sweeping away any sort of biased leanings I might of had for the character of Max, I just can't bring myself to rate at average this cartoonery waste of space that so nearly soils what had gone before it.

Gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character Mad Max Rockatansky, gone is the impacting feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world, and more crucially, gone is director George Miller's passion for the franchise. The dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film, it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third instalment. Sure the stunts are spot on (to be expected by now), and of course Miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before. Yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since ""The Road Warrior's"" crowning glory of the Petrol Tanker pursuit is replicated here, only he uses a train instead!!.

It's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s, but when viewing the three films together now, Thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. I give the film 3/10 purely for one real good Thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least. But this is the third time I have tried to like this film, and as glutton for punishment as I undoubtedly am, I wont be trying again, ever. || _**Bizarre comic book post-nuclear adventure in the Outback with Mel Gibson and Tina Turner**_

In post-apocalyptic Australia, Mad Max (Mel Gibson) travels to Bartertown in the Outback run by Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) & her associate The Collector (Frank Thring). Max accepts a deal to take out MasterBlaster, who runs the town’s methane production underground, but ends up exiled to the deadly desert where he meets… (watch the movie and see).   

“Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” (1985) is the third in George Miller’s franchise after “Mad Max” (1979) and “The Road Warrior” (1981). The fourth installment, “Fury Road,” didn’t surface until 2015 (meanwhile Miller has announced a fifth entry, “The Wasteland”). All of these films were rated R except “Beyond Thunderdome,” which turns off some devotees. I could care less since the amount of gore, violence, sex and cussing don’t determine the quality of a film, except maybe to teenagers.

Like the previous two films, “Beyond Thunderdome” combines the austere life-or-death situation with a cartoonish vibe, so it’s difficult to take it too seriously, as can be done with the first two Planet of the Apes flicks (1968 & 1971). This campy air always turned me off to these movies, but if you can accept it they can be enjoyed on their level of semi-believable fantasy. You just have to be willing to enter into their weird world.   
 
Most fans object to the kids in the desert angle, but this section only lasts 25 freakin’ minutes before tying back into what took place in the first act. Besides, Savannah (Helen Buday) is cute and has nice legs. The departure from a paradisal oasis in exchange for Bartertown seems nonsensical, but it’s figurative of leaving the utopia of youth to the ugly real world and challenges thereof.

The verbiage is odd, basic and guttural so don’t look for fascinating dialogues. Meanwhile the storytelling isn’t very compelling. Nevertheless, the movie’s iconic to the 80s and has its points of interest, like its all-around bizarreness, the desolate landscapes, the laconic hero and cutie Savannah, not to mention Turner and her songs (“We Don't Need Another Hero”).          

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in Australia.

O'Rourke carries that off really well - he injects a swarthiness and grit to his character who clearly isn't quite as hard as he would like people to think, and De Niro - though infrequently on screen - also manages to create that slight sense of malevolence as the penny begins to drop for all watching. It's a bit slow out of the gate, but it does build well to a denouement that is amongst the best in this extensive genre."

Historically we can call it a cult of personality, because, honestly, you are watching it strictly because of Gibson's personality and his sense of humor.

And mind you, this was before he did that thing... which he asked forgiveness for very publicly... and I personally don't see why people feel it's necessary to continue to beat a man after he made amends for a mistake.

Honestly, you're watching it and remembering it because it is a funny Gibson action comedy, and nothing more. Especially since he kind of outshines Hawn in the comedy department in this one, which is kind of shocking given that she can be pretty hysterical when she wants to. In this, however, I'm not sure she was really giving it her A game, or maybe she just sulked back to a co-star routine.

<em>'Gone in Sixty Seconds'</em> does produce some fun action, but I personally felt an extra notch of thrill was needed with this; especially as it lasts for 118 minutes. Some parts are very ploddy, a shortened run time would've worked wonders.

Nicolas Cage is amusing in this, his character Memphis is actually quite goofy. The cast around him are pretty good, with a whole host of familiar names/faces. Angelina Jolie appears as Sway, with Giovanni Ribisi (Kip) and Vinnie Jones (Sphinx) in there too. Christopher Eccleston, meanwhile, makes for a decent bad guy.

Gone in 60 Seconds is fun. Plain and simple. This entertaining, high-energy action romp is fueled by Nic Cage in his prime, gorgeous cars, an exceptional cast, and an unencumbered spirit that embraces the cheese. Gone in 60 Seconds immerses its viewers in a world of moral thieves with deep bonds and a strong code. As the movie progresses, discovering more about each character raises the stakes as the audience fears what could happen to these endearing bandits.

Especially noteworthy are the 3 films that he adapted from Shakespeare plays. After his most ambitious, **HAMLET**, he focused on more acting roles and didn't step behind the camera until he produced **LOVES LABOUR'S LOST**. It pains me to say that the resulting film is audacious and sometimes mind-numbingly awkward.  This review will personally serve me as I try to understand this effort.

This was the first film top be created under the new _SHAKESPEARE FILM COMPANY_.  It is likely obscure to most viewers as it survived only through two films, **LOVES LABOURS LOST** and the markedly better **AS YOU LIKE IT**. My guess is that the new film company was going to tackle more frequent Shakespeare stories that were already less popular and not as epic as **HAMLET** or **HENRY V**.  And many of those lesser known stories contain stuff that just doesn't translate well to modern audiences.  Maybe this new company can approach the stories with a more experimental approach?

**LOVES LABOUR'S LOST** is certainly experimental and the results are scattered.  Most obviously, Branagh took a 3 and a half hour play and trimmed it to an hour and a half, of which half an hour of it was pre-existing song standards.  It seems the objective was to call to mind the musicals of the golden age of Hollywood.  But the casting didn't require singing and dancing, so it often feels like we are being duped.

What remains of the stage play makes for some excellent fun.  Branagh knew what to leave in and what to excise. Nathan Lane and Adrian Lester join some of Branagh's frequent film collaborators.  They are right there, bringing some professionality to the beautiful but otherwise sufficient casting.  But the young Alicia Silverstone really shows her socks while trying to carry the important role of the visiting queen.

Some of the musical numbers work to a point, some make you long for the films they emulate, and a couple are downright creepy - like the erotic _FACE THE MUSIC AND DANCE_.  It tries to capture the sexy party environment of **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**, but fails.

I maintain that much of the story struggles come straight from Will Shakespeare himself... The largest example - the happy ending interrupted by news that the queens father has died so she has to postpone all of their new relationships for one year of mourning.  It seems a strange conceit, and Branagh tries to address it by have all 4 of his male stars go off to war, and they can all be reunited when the war has ended.  In my opinion this was just as weird a solution.

I remain an ardent Branagh film, but to date, this is his least re-watchable film."

Just men who follow orders.

Assault on Precinct 13 is written, directed, edited and musically scored by John Carpenter. It stars Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Martin West, Tony Burton, Charles Cyphers and Nancy Kyes. Cinematography is by Douglas Knapp.

If you are going to homage films that you love, or ones that influence you, then you have to get it right. Something John Carpenter most assuredly did with this, his first masterpiece. Plot and structure of film are simplicity extreme, but it's the execution that matters here, the cool veneer of the hero characters, the frightening relentlessness of the gang members who assault the soon to close down police station and the small number of inhabitants within. Interestingly it's actually Precinct 9, Division 13, but Carpenter was no doubt in a playful mood.

Carpenter builds the first half slowly, introducing key characters whilst deftly staging the events that will lead to the actual siege itself. This part of Los Angeles where the story is set is conspicuous by how empty and soulless it seems, even in daylight, which is where the terror actually begins. It's as if residents and locals just prefer to be off the streets at any time of day or night. 

The gang, like the folk inside the station, are multiracial, but unlike those inside the gang never speak. They move like silent assassins, no shouting or cussing, just a tidal wave of death, their guns adorned with silencers, which leads to a truly brilliant extended sequence as the gang begin to destroy the building silently! Meanwhile relationships are being formed by those under duress, convicts and police forced to battle side by side in the slightest hope of surviving the night.

There is no flab on show here, no pointless dialogue or scenes which could have been cut, it's a film that is very much to the point. The cast respond well to Carpenter's requirements, be it emotionally, physically or coolly, all while Carpenter's low tone synthesiser plays out its memorably eerie beats. It's a superb lesson in low budget film making from one of the masters of that art. His filmic star may have waned in his later life, but for a time in the 70s and 80s he shone bright, Assault On Precinct 13 was the ignition. 10/10"

It's the American ideal that any person born, regardless of circumstances, is in control of their destiny, and that with hard work, guile and determination, can make something of himself. Whether that was ever the case is questionable, but it seems more than ever that the people in power are in control of way more than we could ever suppose, or would ever want to know.

This was a nice smaller-scale film that, incredulously, Coppola was able to dish up in a run that is one of the finest a director would ever have, up there with Hitchcock's in the late 50's-early 60's, and Melville a decade later. It's definitely excellent work by Hackman (along with his Popeye Doyle in the pair of great 'French Connection' movies), and is up there with the greatest dissertations ever about the double-edged sword of surveillance, namely De Palma's 'Blow Out' and Antonioni's 'Blow-Up'.

As a human being, I only wish this film wasn't as important as it is. || ""The Conversation"" is a tense thriller that explores how paranoia can take over all aspects of everyday life once something disturbing is discovered. 

Paid to eavesdrop on two people in a public place, Harry Caul ( Gene Hackman ) records the conversation and after some work produces a tape with clarity for his client. However Harry is riddled with guilt from a previous job that led to the people involved being hurt and both a woman and child murdered. This leads him to question his actions and clearly the job he is doing.

 Despite colleagues, friends and suppliers of surveillance equipment looking up to Harry as one of the best in the business he clearly has lost his edge and his way. This is shown over a period of time through various actions. His flat is easily broken into by his landlord and his mail read. Harry is easily duped at a trade show by a competitor who bugs him with a pen and his girlfriend states ""once I saw you up by the staircase , hiding and watching for a whole hour"". Meanwhile despite his phone being supposedly unlisted both his landlord and his client have the number and to his surprise call him.

 After listening many times to the tapes of the conversation, Harry believes that the two involved fear they could be hurt or even killed for their actions. However a trick is a trick or job is a job ( according to his girlfriend/ escort ) but riddled with guilt he fails to deliver. Once again he shows his unprofessionalism by allowing the tapes to be stolen ( by his girlfriend/ escort )  As the film concludes it becomes clear that conversations can be misinterpreted and may not be as obvious as first thought. Harry's paranoia is compounded even more once he discovers the truth behind ""The Conversation,"" which results in a very satisfying ending. || Gene Hackman is superb here as ""Harry"" - a super-efficient surveillance expert who discovers in the line of duty that a couple he is monitoring might well be about to be murdered. It becomes clear that the couple - Cindy Williams & Frederic Forrest are having an affair but that is just the tip of the conspiratorial iceberg in this tautly scripted/directed effort from Francis Ford Coppola. It's a slow burn, at times it certainly does drag, but the subtleties with which the cat and mouse swap places, alongside some great supporting roles from John Cazale and Harrison Ford make it quite an enthralling watch - and certainly one of Hackman's best, most emotionally charged, performances."

Bill Paxton was something else. The Texan got his start about 40 years ago as a set dresser for New World Pictures before landing a bit part soon after in New World's cheap-o Crazy Mama. Paxton never looked back. His crooked smile was a welcome site in the 80s: Stripes, Weird Science, The Terminator, Commando, Near Dark and Aliens. Actors with his natural masculinity, dramatic and comic abilities were in desperate need in the 80s (and still today). He more than filled a need, he played roles that you couldn't imagine another actor doing. I don't think any supporting actor in an action film was as ever as good as Paxton in Aliens --going from cock-sure Marine to ""Game over man!"" defeatist is one of the funniest and honest parts in action movies. It made a great film even better by finally having someone be in full-on panic mode when things got very bad. 

Continuing into the 90s and beyond, Paxton alternated between big-budget blockbusters and small films, Paxton was always the most interesting thing on the screen no matter the role. 

In the film noir world, Paxton was actually in three films that are clearly in the film noir tent. And they're all outstanding. In 1998, he was top billed in the rural noir A Simple Plan. In 2001, he directed and starred in Frailty. Both of those are top heavy with fantastic performances and we'll no doubt cover them in future articles. 

But the one I wanted to highlight this week is One False Move. It's a crime film to be sure. But the story is driven along by people and feelings that motivate them. It was essentially the first lead role for Paxton and he knocks it out of the park. Instead of playing it straight, Paxton give a good-old-boy, off-kilter performance that fits perfectly with the telling of the story. 

Initially, Dale 'Hurricane' Dixon (Paxton) is seen through the eyes of big-city police as just a hick Arkansas cop trying to help the real police solve a crime. As the story unfolds his ego is crushed then his past comes back to haunt him. You can see the gears in his head turning in the simple man's head as things get more and more complicated. 

The film intercuts between two stories. One of the amusing Hurricane and the LAPD cops, and the other the criminals on the lam quickly becoming more and more paranoid and unhinged. The crooks are played with gusto by pony-tailed Billy Bob Thornton (also the co-writer) and Michael Beach. Cynda Williams plays Fantasia-- the beautiful black woman that ties all the stories together. 

The film was initially set to be a direct-to-video release but it turned out so well, it was sent to theaters to rave reviews. 


Roger Ebert wrote in 1992, 
""On the very short list of great movies about violent criminals, One False Move deserves a place of honor, beside such different kinds of films as In Cold Blood, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Badlands, The Executioner's Song and At Close Range. It is a great film.""

Watching it last week, it still holds up. It's great to see a film from that era not inspired by the Tarantino tsunami of sound and pop culture that influenced all crime films a few years after. It's a quiet rural noir with a sense of dread in the silence. Unlike other noirs of the era leaning heavily on camera gymnastics and venetian-blind shadows, it's shot (by director Carl Franklin) in a straightforward way making the grisly violence more terrifying when scenes end short -- sometimes right before violence. Deliberately slow paced, the film drinks in every moment.

The Fury is directed by Brian De Palma and adapted to screenplay from his own novel by John Farris. It stars Kirk Douglas, John Cassavetes, Carrie Snodgress, Charles Durning, Amy Irving, Fiona Lewis and Andrew Stevens. Music is by John Williams and cinematography by Richard H. Kline.

De Palma once again indulges in the strange world of psychic abilities and telekinetic powers, with mixed results. On one hand it features strong performances, some masterful techniques by De Palma, a superb score by Williams, and an ending fit to grace any horror film past or present. On the other it's exposition heavy, too draggy in the mid- section and much of the screenplay isn't narratively cohesive.

Tomorrow, they'll wrap a fish in it. 

Ace in the Hole is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-writes the screenplay with Lesser Samuels, Walter Newman and Victor Desny. It stars Kirk Douglas, Jan Sterling, Bob Arthur, Porter Hall and Richard Benedict. Music is by  Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by Charles Lang Jr.

Chuck Tatum (Douglas) is a one time big-city journalist who is now stuck working for an out of the way Albuquerque newspaper. When on his way to another mundane reporting job he happens upon the chance to exploit a story about a man trapped in a cave to rekindle his career and put him back in the big league. However, the situation quickly escalates into an out-of-control media circus... 

Inspired by the real life Floyd Collins disaster in 1925, Ace in the Hole finds Wilder on supreme acerbic and cynical form. Flopping upon release, nobody was quite ready for Wilder to paint an uncompromising portrait of the human spirit stinking to high heaven. It now holds up as one of the finest exponents of media machinations and the human fallibility that encompasses a thirst for tragedy.

Douglas leads the way with one of his finest and intensified performances, filling Chuck Tatum with a reprehensible attitude to media ladder climbing. When one witnesses the harrowing sequences as Tatum talks to the trapped Leo Minosa (Benedict tugs the heart strings), telling him it's going to be alright, we feel complicit in knowing just exactly what is going on up top. Leo adores his wife Lorraine (Sterling a splendidly subtle bitch perf hiding hollow turmoil), but she has wanted out for some time, but under Chatum's prompting she sticks around to make money on her husbands trapped suffering. 

Pretty soon this one store tin-pot town is booming, tills are ringing and the papers are selling big time, the coupling of Tatum and Lorraine is a match made in hell. Dialogue is in true noir fashion often sharp and biting, even with some of Wilder's customary humour deftly tucked away. As the exploitation of the situation reaches fever pitch, and the hypocrisy of the human condition is laid bare, ""Ace in the Hole"" proves itself to be a pitiless story that is a compelling journey for the viewers invested in the darker shades of what Wilder was fronting. A big flip-flop for a main character's behaviour at film's end seems a little out of place, given what has preceded it, but the ending is straight out of noirville and ensures the pic is a near masterpiece from a true master of his craft. 9/10"

Great story telling meets a first class acting performance in Lumet’s searing movie. Frank Serpico (Pacino), a legend to us mere mortals out on the street, but the most hated man on the NYPD, so much so he almost paid for his sense of what’s right and wrong with his life.

All the time we are also getting an insight into the man himself, his life and loves outside of work, with Lumet and Pacino making sure Frank is not painted as a saintly perfectionist, there is no halo above his head, he has flaws like everybody else. New York is expertly painted as a raw and grubby place, the hustle and bustle a nuisance, and the seamy underside where crims and dirty coppers dwell makes you feel like taking a shower. It proves to be a riveting character study and a thought provoking expose at the same time, while ultimately it proves to be a touching experience come the culmination of the drama.

Lonely Are The Brave is directed by David Miller and adapted for the screen by Dalton Trumbo from the novel ""The Brave Cowboy"" written by Edward Abbey. It stars Kirk Douglas, Gena Rowlands, Walter Matthau & George Kennedy. Cinematography is from Phillip H. Lathrop and Jerry Goldsmith scores the music in what was his first major studio work.

John (Jack) W. Burns is an old school cowboy who refuses to adapt to the new world he finds himself in. Modern technology is alien to him and he would rather perpetually roam with his horse Whiskey than ever contemplate getting in a car or a jet. Upon learning that his dear friend Paul (Michael Kane) is in jail, it's not long before Jack himself finds he's in jail after a barroom fight…..and then promptly sets about breaking Paul and himself out. Only Paul doesn't want to go, he wont jeopardise the family life waiting for him on the outside by becoming a fugitive. Jack escapes and heads for the hills on Whiskey, with the law, and all their modern technology, in hot pursuit.

Officially Douglas' favourite film in his long and varied career, Lonely Are The Brave is a wonderfully elegiac picture about a man out of his time. Boosted by impeccable lead performances, a great script and gorgeous black & white photography, it's hard to believe it was met with a lukewarm response upon its release. Set in 1950s New Mexico the film elegantly tells how the frontier is vanishing; to be replaced by progress and technology. Douglas' character, a wandering cowboy, is a symbol of nostalgia, where Trumbo's screenplay offers a cautionary observation about restriction of freedom and individuality. Themes close to home with the writer with the HUAC incidents still fresh in the memory. Lonely Are The Brave could quite easily now be subtitled the Punk Rock Western.

There's a number of scenes in the piece that leave indelible marks. A rip snorting fist fight between Jack and a one armed man is high powered and potent, the farewell scene between Jack and Paul's wife Jerry (Rowlands) is sexually charged and wrought with an impending finality. The whole pursuit as Jack and Whiskey scale the rocky hills, pursued by helicopter, car and a vengeful prison guard, is gripping and laced with emotion. While the finale, tho forewarned to us from early in the piece, is one of the most heart tugging moments in Western movie history. Director Miller doesn't have the CV that his work here suggests he should have; given the assured way he crafts this story. For he, along with all the others involved (must mention Goldsmith's evocative score too), has delivered a classy bit of cinema across the board. A pertinent piece about the changing world and the characters left behind in its wake. 9/10"

The tone is uncertain. A road movie, a tragic comedy with car pile ups that is based on true facts.

Lou Jean Sparrow Poplin (Goldie Hawn) takes her husband Clovis (William Atherton) out of a minimum security prison just weeks before his eventual release.

All to save their child who has been taken away and ready to put up for adoption. They kidnap a police officer which leads to them being pursued by the police and the media.

Goldie Hawn is spiky as Lou Jean but she is also stupidly impulsive.

A story that needed more work, Spielberg does make an accomplished film. || When ""Clovis"" (William Atherton) is incarcerated, his wife ""Lou Jean"" (Goldie Hawn) is facing losing their son to adoption. She's having none of this so decides to spring her husband from jail so they can go collect their bairn and head for Mexico. Things do not go to plan, though, and pretty quickly they are in an hijacked police-car being driven by ""Officer Slide"" (Michael Sacks). Needless to say, the police - under the shrewd ""Capt. Tanner"" (Ben Johnson) now up the ante and we are now looking at a chase that involves just about every police vehicle in the country! They are gradually digging themselves deeper with each mile they drive, but equally they begin to befriend their hostage and elicit a degree of sympathy from their pursuer as their predicament starts to tug at heart strings. It's a bit preposterous at times, and is certainly too long - but it does illustrate that Goldie Hawn has a skill - as an actress with a strong narrative to deliver, and as a woman who has expert comedy timing. There is humour here. It doesn't always work and at times is maybe just a little slapstick. It also does introduce and develop some depth to the characters - including Sacks and Johnson - which I found engaging as it trundled along. It's all based on a true story so not too much Steven Spielberg could do with the ending but the journey he takes us along is entertaining enough. || Quality!

<em>'The Sugarland Express'</em> is Steven Spielberg's first theatrical release as director, which is quite something given the movie seems like it was made by a seasoned vet. On a similar note, the look and feel of the film is absolutely outstanding; it has aged remarkably well visually, almost hard to believe it came out in 1974! I also really enjoyed the score, particularly Toots Thielemans on the harmonica, but that's no surprise - John Williams, duh!

As for plot, it is very entertaining. I like how silly everything plays out for the first chunk and the film knows it, but events gradually rise up a notch throughout the 110 minutes. The more serious conclusion would've felt quite sudden and out of place, though it is portrayed and paced perfectly. Cast-wise, Goldie Hawn, William Atherton and Michael Sacks are excellent, though Ben Johnson is probably the one I'd rate highest."

I can imagine that some people were disappointed if they were indeed expecting a real adventure movie. I remember being one of those people when I first saw this movie.

However, if you approach it seeing what it is, that is a comedy or at least an action-comedy, then it is actually a quite enjoyable movie. The entire movie is utterly ridiculous. The screaming, posturing Asian martial art champion parodies especially so.

Everything in this movie makes you laugh as long as you do not try to take the movie seriously. The action scenes are often absolutely hilarious. They are also quite well done and choreographed actually. The special effects are of course utterly outdated but they are good enough for this movie.

There is a story as well but it doesn’t really matter much. It is just there to tie the funny scenes together, especially the action scenes. Acting? Well, let’s just say that it matches the comic nature of the movie.

I actually just picked this movie as a trial experience in using Netflix (which finally came to France last Monday) on my PS3 for the first time and I did not want to start something were I would be pissed off if it turned out that it stopped working halfway through. I have to say that I had much more fun watching this movie this time than the first time I was watching it…and Netflix worked perfectly on my PS3. || _Big Trouble in Little China_ is not the movie it is marketed to be. But it is good. You wait the ten minutes it takes for the absurdity to kick in and then you ride the ridiculous ride until the closing credits.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || Ol' Jack always says... what the hell?

Out of 20th Century Fox, Big Trouble in Little China is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell, Kim Catrall, Dennis Dun, James Hong & Victor Wong. The adaptation is by W.D. Richter with the screenplay from Gary Goldman & David Z. Weinstein. Dean Cundey photographs and Alan Howarth doubles up with Carpenter for the musical score.

Truck driver Jack Burton (Russell) agrees to take his friend Wang Chi (Dun) to pick up his fiancée at the airport. Little does he know that he is about to get involved in a supernatural battle between good and evil beneath San Francisco's Chinatown district.

A box office failure upon its release, and known to be the moment when John Carpenter gave up on Hollywood, Big Trouble in Little China has gathered ""cult"" momentum over the years and shows up rather well these days. Blending Chinese mysticism with chop-schlocky adventure, Carpenter's movie is at once daft but also a ball of energetic fun - propelled by a handsome, but inept action hero. Carpenter had always wanted to tackle a martial arts movie, and here he gets to do it whilst laying on the comedy and playing with effects work as his movie mostly comes alive in a magical underworld of monsters, magicians and sexy green eyed women.

It's evident now that the film was ahead of its time, not from a technical viewpoint, but from the point it tried to Americanise chopsocky. This is some time before Chinese style wire-work and mythology became common to Hollywood, one has to believe that Tarantino was nodding approvingly around about this time. It's also worth noting that although this ""American"" movie has an American beefcake as its main protagonist, it's the Asian Americans who actually are the heroes of the piece, with Dun's sidekick the stand out hero as Russell's Burton bumbles his way from one sequence to the next. It was a bold move by Carpenter to structure the narrative this way, something that annoyed the executives at Fox and kept the paying public bemused. It's easy to see why the film failed, contrast it with the similarly themed Eddie Murphy movie, The Golden Child, from the same year, which was a box office success. There the public got what they wanted (or what they were used too), the standard American hero fluff where Murphy saves the day and gets the girl. 

Carpenter dared to be different and clearly had a lot of fun along the way, as evidently did his cast. It may have taken a decade of VHS and DVD releases to prove he was right, but right he was, Big Trouble in Little China is a damn fine popcorn movie. Russell plays it meat head style, with swagger in tow and tongue stuck in cheek, nicely toned physique for the girls to enjoy, and making vest wearing cool two years before Willis did in Die Hard. Cattrall is wonderfully alluring, red lips and green eyes shimmering bright in a world of colour; and boys do look out for her wet scene, it's wolf whistle time! Dun is likable and athletic, while Hong as Lo Pan gives the action/adventure genre a truly memorable villain. The film is briskly paced and not found wanting in the set piece department either. Not all the effects are high grade stuff, but in a film with such zestful comic book traditions at heart, it hardly matters one jot. With a great home format package doing it justice, Carpenter's movie is now, at long last, getting the appreciative audience it fully deserves. Amen to that. 8/10"
3133.0,Badlands,An impressionable teenage girl from a dead-end town and her older greaser boyfriend embark on a killing spree in the South Dakota badlands.,In 1959 a lot of people were killing time.

Badlands is written and directed by Terrence Malick. It stars Martin Sheen, Sissy Spacek, Ramon Bieri and Warren Oats. Music is by George Tipton and James Taylor and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto, Steven Larner and Brian Probyn.

Badlands seems to be adored by critics, often being coined as one of the best debuts ever made by a director. Maybe based loosely on the Starkweather-Fugate killing spree of 1958, though the makers have been at pains to ensure we know this is a case of all the characters and situations being fictional, Badlands does indeed have impressive strands. It's a gorgeous picture visually, the surreal feel that is sometimes garnered by Malick in the narrative gives the piece a haunted edge and Spacek and Sheen are very good given the characters they are asked to play.

However, Malick's commentary on amoral youth of 50s America, a corruption of innocence, alienation and etc, never has the depth, to my mind, to really be as special as so many say it is. Some argue the sketchy motives and reasonings involving Kit and Holly are deliberately thought provoking, I'd argue that devoid of psychological meat they are dull characters only livened by the actors' performances. Holly's narration is a clever device by Malick, serving to keep us interested since the structure of the film is repetitious, where being in the company of Kit and Holly becomes a chore. And lets not get onto credibility either...

I know I'm in the minority, but three times I have tried to grasp this supposed genius in Badlands, and I just don't see it. There's a myth and mysticism that has been attributed to it, even enhanced as the years have rolled by, but where there is undoubtedly beauty on the surface, down below there is no beast. 6/10"

Their officer humiliates them, and when they refuse to back down he corners them on deck and orders them shot. This proves the flashpoint for his crewmen who proceed to seize the ship and sail to Odessa where they turn the guns on the army headquarters in the city and the conflagration grows. Will others join them, or will the status quo be returned and their ship destroyed...? Historians have already told us the answers to most of the factual questions, so it's not really about what happens - it is the magnificently poignant and suspenseful fashion in which Eisenstein paces the film. Clearly he has an agenda, his depictions are not exactly even handed - particularly the soldiers in the town dealing with the civilian population, but that doesn't overwhelm the overall sentiment of the sailors rebelling for just reasons, for decent treatment and for a degree of respect that was certainly lacking from their officers. The production itself is superb, the camerawork has an intensity that makes you feel as if you are actually on the boat at times. I'm sure there are more analytical reviews of this film to be had - but I think it is just a wonderful example of a man at the top of his game making an exciting film that delivers entertainment and a bit of thought-provocation in equal measure, at the same time."

It's the perfect role for Jackson, lashings of cool and menace, on his bulky shoulders dose the film easily rest. Plot finds Shaft turning in his badge after the law proves useless to let racist murderer Walter Wade Junior (Christian Bale a sneering villain but awesome looking in a tux) out on the streets. Shaft vows to bring Wade to justice, by any means necessary. Though he also has other things on his plate, namely Latino drug lord Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright a riot) and some less than honourable police officers.

The screenplay is a little trite, but as an action movie, one with the coolness and sparky humour, it really hits the required spots of those just after such easy minded fare. The support cast is a roll call of sound performers with the likes of Vanessa Williams, Dan Hedaya and Toni Collette fronting up, while the awesome ebullience of Busta Rhymes is very infectious.

Isaac Hayes gloriously famous theme tune is still in place, pumped up by composer David Arnold, which ensures the feel of the original isn't lost, and Donald E. Thorin's photography is pin sharp and in turns gorgeous (night shots) and streetwise gritty. Shaft, the 2000 version, still bad-ass and sadly under appreciated. 7/10 || _**A black detective in Gotham desperately wants to nail a snooty racist murderer**_ 

The nephew of the original John Shaft is a detective in New York City (Samuel L. Jackson) where he tries to apprehend an arrogant racist killer (Christian Bale) by finding a key witness (Toni Collette) while dealing with a gang lord (Jeffrey Wright) and corrupt cops. Vanessa Williams is on hand as a helpful officer.

“Shaft” (2000) is a ‘hip’ crime thriller that resurrects the franchise 27 years after the original trilogy from 1971-1973 that featured Richard Roundtree in the title role (he returns here as the aged uncle). The cast and filmmaking are fine; the problem is the lame story with which they’re shackled. 

The key crime in the opening act is glaringly weak. Bale’s character is a snooty punk born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but I didn’t buy his rash, racist actions at the night club. It just didn’t ring true, especially since he seems to get along with black people just fine the rest of the movie. Likewise, Collette’s actions aren’t convincing as the doe-eyed bartender. Simply put, the scriptwriters tried too hard to concoct a racist whitey villain when subtly was in order.

If you can roll with that serious flaw, there are enough thrills to amuse, including Jackson as the bad axx protagonist and Wright’s entertaining drug lord. Plus it’s always good to see the charming Vanessa Williams. 

The film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in various areas of New York City, as well as nearby Newark.

<em>'Chicken Run'</em>, which I watched a crap tonne when I was little but not for a vast number of years now, is an impressive production given it came out in 2000. Despite a pretty simple feel to the film, it's a very well developed concept.

The, admittedly short, run time truly flies by. Of course everything looks, relatively, terrific, but I'm impressed by the pacing which is clean. As for the cast, Julia Sawalha is the definite standout - she's fantastic as Ginger. Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels, as rats Nick and Fetcher, are amusing. Mel Gibson (Rocky), though still decent, isn't actually that good in this.

A fun and interesting story! Definitely worth seeing if you haven't already. I'm intrigued to see where they go with the upcoming sequel."

Before they were legends, they were heroes. Before there was a nation, there was a fight for freedom.","Drama, History, War, Action",165,2000-06-28,en,7.178,4058,6.1653,"Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs, Chris Cooper",Roland Emmerich,"epic, daughter, mission, general, southern usa, loss of loved one, rebel, patriotism, insurgence, gore, south carolina, based on true story, sword fight, historical fiction, soldier, patriot, 18th century, american revolution, revolutionary war","Here's Mel to give the Brits an inaccurate historical thrashing, again... 

The Patriot is based around one Benjamin Martin, an ex-soldier, who now happily living as a family man finds himself thrust into conflict at the break of the American Revolution.

He loves the Brits does Mel Gibson, ""Gallipoli"", ""Braveheart"" and here with ""The Patriot"", see the pattern anyone? As with the aforementioned ""Gallipoli"" and ""Braveheart"", certain liberties have also been taken with events in ""The Patriot"" so as to glossy up for the eager Hollywood contingent. It's not my want to scribble about the facts of Benjamin Martin (Re: Francis Marion), or William Wallace for that matter, information as such is but a mere click away on the world wide web.

So casting aside the artistic licence factors, is ""The Patriot"" any good? Well nearly it is -- nearly. Gibson is fine, he shoulders the burden of the film with great gusto and no shortage of emotional depth. It's very easy to accept him as a staunch family man who transforms into a blood thirsty warrior. The problems, acting wise, lay away from Gibbo's central performance. Surrounded by caricature villains (though Jason Isaacs' Tavington is deliciously vile) and underwritten characters (Chris Cooper wasted and Joely Richardson is but a mere prop), Gibson has no choice but to hog the screen. So much so it ultimately turns into a one man star vehicle, which for a costume war epic isn't a great thing really.

Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"") directs and handles the battle sequences very well, there's lashings of blood as men line up to shoot and dismember one and other. While cannonball's whizz, bang and tear off body parts, it's grim, yet oddly rousing stuff. Not even the overtly flag waving and sloganeering on show can off set the impact of the well constructed battles. There is of course lots of tragedy to be found in the film, and these are some what surprisingly, tenderly handled by Emmerich, but mostly it's via an on song Gibson, who remains one of the few modern day male actors capable of believable grief. All of this is given a John Williams score that suitably flits between rousing and ethereal, and things are further boosted by the sumptuous photography from Caleb Deschanel.

There should have been more thought given to the racial (slaves) aspects in the conflict, and this coupled with the bad errors of under developed characters hurts ""The Patriot"" as a filmic exercise, not so as to stop it being entertaining, but more to stop it being a one man show. But as it is, thanks in the main to Gibson, and in spite of the overtly evident faults, it's an above average drama. 6/10"

You're a god damn sword boat captain, is there anything better in the world?"" 

Ordinarily I would write a review that is fair minded and as honest as I can call it, something that hopefully would interest the readers either side of the fence. But here with The Perfect Storm I just want to write why I love this particular picture, and what a most divisive picture it has turned out to be. I'm aware of the complaints about the movie, even the ones from the family of the real Captain Billy Tyne {played by Alpha Male regular George Clooney}, but as an entertaining spectacle with huge slices of emotional fortitude, The Perfect Storm will forever be hitting my spots. 

The character build up is just wonderful, people with things to prove, fractured and blossoming romances, loyalties on the line, grudges carried over from previous encounters, the lives of sea fishermen fully formed in the films first quarter. Then there is a sequence as George Clooney says the monologue that I have opened this review with, beautifully recited, but it's the emotion in Linda Greenlaw's face (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) as she watches and listens to him speak it, just wonderful. Then the boys go out to see, heading off into dangerous waters to hopefully make a killing in the fish market, tensions run high, accidents happen, heroes are born and rivalries quickly overturned, but the boys must go further if they are to corner the market, the Grand Banks are evil at this time of year. 

A three pronged hostile weather front is heading their way, they are, as Linda tells Billy on the radio, heading into the belly of the monster, and what a monster it is. Here the makers excel, director Wolfgang Petersen, his cinematographer John Seale and his S/E maestro John Frazier do literally put me right there in a amongst the waves and derringdo bravado. Then it's the final couple of reels, the emotional mangler, even a spiritual coda that is hated by so many can't make me dislike the film any less, and I'll wager right here and now that as funeral eulogies go, few if any have been delivered with as much heartbreaking emotion as the one read by Mastrantonio here. All of which is backed by a truly involving score by James Horner, shades of Braveheart's emotional swirls in there. 

It's a personal opinion you know, but The Perfect Storm is a magnificent film that I enjoy three times a year, every year, and nobody will ever be able to take that away from me. 

""There's no goodbyes Christina, only love,"" damn straight! 9/10 || I recently watched this for the second time, many years after my initial viewing. I confess I didn't always give it my full attention, not just because I had seen it once but also because the plot isn't very subtle, and careful viewing isn't necessary. The dialogue is realistic and well done, but the characters seem a bit stereotypical. You have the grizzled captain whose skills and luck seem to be in decline, a gentle giant with an ex-wife and a kid, a young man desperately in love, the newcomer ready to pick a fight with one of the above and a ladies man who I think was creole, but I am not sure.

So the plot bumps along and the special effects of huge waves and wind works to build suspense, only partly successfully. There are subplots also: the meteorologists with their eyes widening as the perfect storm develops, a yacht crew of three and the Coast Guard rescuers who try to save them, and a female ship captain who in real life wrote the book all this is based on.

The film is entertaining enough, in its undemanding way, but I can safely say I don’t expect to watch it for a third time. There were a few cliche moments and moments of melodrama. But it is watchable, especially if it is your first time."

Parodying much of 70s TV shows and movies, there are skits like the naughty Catholic High School Girls in Trouble promo reel, a blaxploitation parody, and the gem of the movie which is a kung-fu parody which takes up a good bit of the movie's running time.

Like any comedy skit anthology the skits are uneven. Some are winners, some are flops. In retrospect they are perhaps more interesting in looking back on the 70s in a parody format. But the kung-fu parody is truly on target in what it parodies and the centerpiece of the movie. Alone I would give the kung-fu parody an 8/10 rating. Unfortunately some of the other skits drag down the whole of the movie, but it is worth it just to see the kung-fu bit.

I give it 6/10

At least, the US Government think so and so they engage him to help out faking some evidence of murder for a man they are subsequently going to put into witness protection. Meantime, New York's finest ""McCarthy"" (Brian Dennehy) is investigating that very crime, but he can't quite get to grips with why his federal colleagues are being less than helpful. As the story develops, it becomes quite clear that none of this is on the level and there is blackmail, extortion and real-life murder on the cards and pretty swiftly our faker is having to use all his skills and wits to keep himself alive as he hasn't a clue whom to trust. The audience knows a little more about who is pulling the strings than he does, but that doesn't really matter as the whole thing sort of splutters from the far-fetched to the downright silly, especially towards the end when his handler ""Col. Mason"" (Mason Adams) shows his true colours. Brown fitted the bill in ""Breaker Morant"" (1980) but otherwise I never quite knew why, aside from his looks, Brown made it on the big screen at all. He has a glint in his eye, but his acting is about as papier-mâché as many of his props and he delivers the pedestrian dialogue just as statically. It's a fantasy adventure in all but name - just add a few bullets, a fake moustache or two and lots of rain.

14864.0,The Hot Spot,"Upon arriving to a small town, a drifter quickly gets into trouble with the local authorities — and the local women — after he robs a bank.",Safe is never sex.

The Hot Spot is directed by Dennis Hopper and adapted to screenplay from the Charles Williams novel, ""Hell Hath No Fury"", by Nona Tyson and Charles Williams. It stars Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, Jennifer Connelly, Charles Martin Smith and William Sadler. Music is by Jack Nitzsche and cinematography by Ueli Steiger.

Dennis Hopper loves film noir, he has been in some bona fide classic neo-noirs, whilst also turning his hand to directing that style of film making. The Hot Spot may not be a total success as such, but it is a superb effort that lovers of all things noir can feast upon. Story pitches Johnson as drifter Harry Madox, who lands in a Southern state town, bluffs his way into a car salesman job, plots a robbery, and then finds that two local ladies - of very different qualities - are about to change his life forever...

I found my level and I'm living it.

Hopper turns in a honest and faithful tribute to the first wave of film noir, but armed with the fact this was his era of film making relaxations, he gets to sex things up. Blending noir with erotic thriller conventions allows Hopper to pile on plenty of sizzle, which comes in the form of Madsen, who as Dolly Harshaw gives neo-noir one of its finest femme fatales. Overtly sexual and on the surface a ditz, an easy lay, it's only when this part of noirville shows its hand - in true old school fashion - does the character become memorable still further.

On the flip side is Connelly's more straight laced Gloria Harper, who Madox coverts, yet there's baggage there as well (is she virginal?), baggage which adds more potency and trickery to this smouldering hot spot hot-pot. The girls are great, but so is Johnson, he broods and has a raw masculinity most fitting for this type of role. It's a shame he didn't do more neo-noir because he has the tools for the trade. Hopper brings sweat, sweaty close ups and noirville fans, while the photography and musical accompaniments are superbly compliant to the required atmosphere.

The editing is a let down, so many scenes needed to have the linger factor, but it's not enough to kill this fine slice of noir pie. A sexy guy in over his head, devious machinations from both sexes, robbery, arson, deaths, ignorance and stupidity, The Hot Spot is far from being boring! The deliberate slow burn pacing has alienated the casual ""crime/erotic thriller"" film fan, but for those who love and know their noir, the fireplace cinders approach is a joy because the pay off delivers all that we hoped. 8/10 || **_An amoral drifter stuck between a naïve teen and an adulteress in Texas_** 

An unprincipled man in his mid-30s (Don Johnson) rolls into a small town in the greater Austin area wherein he uses his mojo to land a job as a used car salesman. The sultry wife of the owner (Virginia Madsen) shows interest while he has his eyes on a winsome lass at the dealership (Jennifer Connelly), not to mention a nearby bank. 

Directed by Dennis Hopper, ""The Hot Spot"" (1990) is Southern Gothic neo-noir based on Charles Williams’ 1953 book “Hell Hath No Fury” (aka “The Hot Spot”).  The original script handed out to the cast was by Mike Figgis, but Hopper changed it to Williams & Nona Tyson’s screenplay from 1962 three days before shooting started. I point this out because the entire first half of the flick lazily meanders.

Take the steamy Southern Gothic of Tennessee Williams, like “The Fugitive Kind” (1960), and mix it with the more modern approach of “Two Moon Junction” (1988) and that’s this movie. It has its points of interest, like the three stars, the sweltering heat of the Deep South, the Hamilton (natural) Pool and the defunct sawmill.

It’s like a Tarantino flick in the Deep South, just without the great dialogues. Meanwhile the blackmail subplot involving William Sadler is contrived and eye-rolling. Hopper originally wanted Mickey Rourke for the lead role and maybe that’s what got things off to a bad start. I should add that Johnson is certainly the king of cool here and I had zero problem with him in the role; Harry is just ignoble and therefore contemptible, although he has an impressive kick-axx side to him.

For something similar but superior, check out Michael Cimino’s underrated “Desperate Hours” (1990), which was released one week earlier.

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in the heart of Texas as follows: Taylor (bank robbery), which is northeast of Austin; Luling (old sawmill), which is south of Austin; and Dripping Springs (swimming scenes), which is west of Austin. The sand dune sequence in the opening was shot at Monahans Sandhills State Park, which is along I-20 midway between Pecos and Midway, about 25 miles from the border of New Mexico.

As the 1980s boom for martial artists becoming filmic action stars gathered apace, Chuck Norris carved his own spot upon the testosterone fuelled wave. Much like a lot of films of its ilk, Missing in Action is of course daft, violent, jingoistic but also crucially it's a whole bunch of fun. This naturally comes down to expectation levels for a production of this type, park the brain and enjoy the cheese and carnage. It's a bit disappointing to find that we don't get to see much of Norris' martial artistry, it' s more a case of gun play and standard fists and kicks taking the lead in this one. The story is hardly taxing and many scenes just serve to show some flesh and pecs, but with M. Emmet Walsh along for the ride as an ebullient side-kick, there's enough here for the undemanding action film fan to enjoy. 5/10 || Not an all too bad Rambo-esque copycat from the folks at Canon.

A preacher (Clint Eastwood) with a past to hide is chased by a lunatic gunman (George Kennedy) in northern Montana. He inadvertently teams-up with a young scalawag (Jeff Daniels) and they concoct a mad heist with a couple of the former’s old partners.

Written & directed by Michael Cimino, “Thunderbolt and Lightfoot” (1974) was the infamous director’s debut and pulsates with cinematic magic from beginning to end. You can tell Tarantino was heavily influenced by it because it smacks of his flicks twenty years before he rose to fame with “Pulp Fiction.” It is a combination gangster/road/car flick à la “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967), “Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry” (1974) and “Joyride” (1977).

Someone said that feminists might have a problem with the film because women are generally portrayed as sex objects and little more. Yet the average man isn't portrayed much more nobly; they're basically shallow, sex-obsessed, dishonest, purposeless, incompetent buffoons. So the criticism of the film goes both ways. 

It might help to understand the flick as picaresque wherein the protagonists are amiable rogues, bohemians, adventurers, rapscallions, which is what the root word ‘picaro’ means. These kinds of yarns include satire, comedy, sarcasm and acerbic social criticism with an episodic plot revolving around an often pointless quest. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966) is a good example. But this is superior to that overpraised Spaghetti Western because the picaros are more likable and interesting, not to mention it’s just all-around more entertaining, which is helped by the magnificent Montanan scenery.

Despite their shallow depictions, the movie scores pretty well in the feminine department with June Fairchild standing out as Gloria. Erica Hagen has a small part as a blonde waitress and Catherine Bach has a glorified cameo.

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot exclusively in the Great Falls extended region of northern Montana.

GRADE: A- || A hit-and-miss, if still probably good, 1974 film.

<em>'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot'</em> fails as a comedy but actually does work as a road trip/heist movie, even with a surprisingly sombre ending. To further the mixed bag feeling, I found the acting talent to be just that.

I'd say this is one of Clint Eastwood's weakest performances, though Jeff Bridges has a lot of fun and is the standout in his role. George Kennedy is closely behind him and ahead of Eastwood, in my opinion.

The film attempts a lot, I'm not convinced it all works, but I'd recommend it - the pacing is on point, so it doesn't drag. || ""Thunderbolt"" (Clint Eastwood) makes a living posing as a priest in backwater chapels when he is rumbled by a man who knows who he really is. By pure chance, he makes good his escape by climbing into the car of a passing motorist, whom he quickly nicknames ""Lightfoot"" (Jeff Bridges). This younger man is captivated by the excitement of his new best pal, and with the two of them actually getting on quite well they are soon treading a fine line between the legal and the not so! Meantime, hot on their trail is the menacing ""Leary"" (George Kennedy) and his goofy pal ""Eddie"" (Geoffrey Lewis). Why are they so persistent? Well it turns out that ""Thunderbolt"" had been part of an armed robbery that had netted half a million dollars. The cops had claimed the cash had been recovered, but a few folks know that isn't quite true and assumptions are being made about who betrayed whom! There's only one solution, and that's to reunite the original team and try to recover the cash - but even that comes with significant risk, especially for the young ""Lightfoot"" whose smart mouth has managed to irritate ""Leary"". It's violent, yes, but tempered with some really quite poignant moments as the men begin to form quite a robust relationship that sees the older start to care more for his enthusiastic and naive protégé, and there's also some fun to be had as they don some tights over their heads and add quite a bit of spice to a young pair's sex life. It does fall apart a little at the end, but even that is still quite touching as we watch certainly of one Eastwood's more characterful hard man roles, and one of Bridges and Kennedy's best too."

But, you know, that isn't always a bad thing. Look at what the movie is about, spies ala Nightmare on Elm Street, it doesn't really need to be a big budget film to be fun and watchable.

And it is fun and watchable. Dennis Quaid was the absolute best pick for the role, his personality (which is usually watchable) meshes well with the character, and the character he plays is written brilliantly for the role. The heroic and lovable slacker, but a slacker of near epic proportions that rises up to the situation. You couldn't cast better in 1984.

And then he's paired against Max Von Sydow who, in his lifetime, won far less awards than he was worth. He was one of the best actors to ever live and he's in a B science fiction movie. He's a guy that brings his A game to everything.

So out the door it has great casting going for it. But then, moving on from that, the plot is just fun, not at all too serious, it knows what sort of movie that it is, it knows it's budget and limitations, and it is presented with the appropriate seriousness and tongue-in-cheek to keep the audience engaged from start to finish.

It's not at all a perfect movie, but it is a fun movie, it is an entertaining movie. It doesn't have much to complain about (save for Nightmare on Elm St did it better) but it does have what it takes to keep you engaged, entertained, and at the end, satisfied. || **_Is murdering people in their dreams viable?_**

A young man with extraordinary psychic abilities (Dennis Quaid) is coerced into participating in experimental dream techniques by his former mentor (Max Von Sydow). While he flirts with the assistant (Kate Capshaw), a mysterious government official (Christopher Plummer) is interested in using the new technique as a political weapon. Eddie Albert plays the president while David Patrick Kelly is on hand as a psychic of dubious morality.

“Dreamscape” (1984) combines dream-oriented sci-fi with political thriller for an entertaining flick. Young Quaid makes for a good protagonist while Kate is alluring in her voluptuous way (and less annoying than in “Temple of Doom”). The concept of killing people in their dreams is fascinating and implemented in a realistic way compared to the contemporaneous “A Nightmare on Elm Street.”

While it borrows a little from “Scanners” from a few years prior, it’s unique enough and would influence future flicks like ""Nightwish,” “The Cell” and “Inception.”

Some people today criticize it as “dated” but, come on, it was made in friggin’ 1983.

The movie runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in several spots in California (Los Alamitos Racetrack, Union Station in Los Angeles, West Hollywood, Point Mugu, University of the Pacific in Stockton, Santa Clarita and Bronson Caves).

Law is handsome enough, Munro brings a bit of glamour, Baker hams up nicely as the baddie and Christian and Martin Shaw contribute a little bit of nautical humour and theatrical guffawing to the proceedings nicely, too. The real stars, as ever though, are the creations of Ray Harryhausen - not least the Centaur and the wonderful Kali with her sword dance.

Queen Latifah is another good addition but her character stops making sense when the Pajama party comes into the mix, she spends the first half talking about empowering black women just to in the end of it thinking that undressing black women for a party for the enjoyment of the males sounding like a good idea.

Jack Manfred is a struggling writer who is set up by his gambler father for a job dealing at a London casino. Catching inspiration from the seedy setting of his employment, Jack starts to write about his experiences. But although it makes for a good story, the reality is that his life is spiralling out of control.

Croupier is known for two main things outside of being a good and interesting film. Firstly is that it launched the career of Clive Owen, lifting him out of the TV mainstay league and into the Hollywood subconscious. Secondly is that it was largely ignored on release in its homeland of Britain, but after America took a liking to Mike Hodges tantalising tale, it scored a re-release and Owen and the film have not really looked back since.

Though not quite deserving of the sleeper gem reputation it has, Croupier none the less is a strong London based thriller set amongst the ducking and diving world of the all night casino. Led by an engaging Owen performance, the characters are meaty, with Hodges and his writer Paul Mayersburg creating a nice line in paranoiac mystery. There's a bit of an overdose of twisters in the final straight, but in the main Croupier comfortably holds the attention span for the 90 odd minutes run time. 7/10 || Such a shame. This is actually a decent film, but is ruined and turned into an unwatchable laughing stock by one simple thing.
The film's title, the main protagonist's job, is mispronounced throughout the entire film.
Unfortunately this is completely at odds with the image the film seeks to create, as well as being like fingernails down a blackboard to have to listen to for over an hour. If correct use of language doesn't matter to you, you'll probably like this film. || I’ll admit I had high hopes for _Croupier_—a cool, smart British film set in the gritty London of my late teenage years, a city I loved, but that’s since vanished. And to be fair, the plot is clever and hooked me early on. There’s a slick, noir-ish vibe that’s easy to settle into, and Clive Owen absolutely looks the part. But while the script has its flaws, it’s the direction that really lets the film down. The pacing drags, and there’s a cold, clinical detachment to everything, making it almost impossible to connect with any character. You’re kept at arm’s length, which drains the film of tension and emotional weight.


Owen ends up stuck in second gear—not entirely his fault. He’s far more compelling as the third-person narrator than he is on screen. And for a film supposedly steeped in risk, desire, and moral compromise, it’s shockingly unsexy. The female characters are flat and one-note, mostly there to pout, sulk, or stand around topless. The detour to the Oxfordshire party is a perfect example of the film’s missteps—pointless, tonally off, and best forgotten. Stylistically, it’s a full-on late ’90s time capsule—for better or worse—and hopefully, Owen’s hat, along with some of the film’s more outdated choices, stay locked inside it."

Willis is, as you'd expect, the best part of this, but I think Breslin does a grand job too.

Duel in the Sun is predominantly directed by King Vidor and is produced and written by David O. Selznick who adapts (with help from H.P. Garrett & Ben Hecht) from Niven Busch's novel. It stars Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Gregory Peck, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore; with a huge support cast list that contains the likes of Herbert Marshall, Walter Huston, Charles Bickford & Harry Carey. The plot centres around Pearl Chavez (Jones), a half Indian girl who is orphaned after her father kills her mother and her lover. Pearl is sent to live with an old sweetheart and friend of her fathers, Laura Belle McCanles (Gish), here she becomes involved in prejudice and forbidden love that turns the McCanles family inside out.

David O. Selznick had hoped to recreate, even surpass, the success he had had with Gone With the Wind 7 years previously, only in a Western setting. Plagued with controversy both on and off the screen, the film, in spite of poor reviews, was a box office hit. Tho it's believed that due to high production costs and a cash driven advertising campaign, that the film ultimately only broke about even. The controversy on the screen stemmed from the sexual nature of the story, something that earned the film its famous ""Lust In The Dust"" nickname. Yet were it not for the Hays Code censors and religious review boards, the film would have been far more controversial, out went rape and a downplaying of the overt sexuality that existed prior to the cuts. Off screen controversy came in the form Selznick's relationship with Jones, a coupling that would break up both their respective marriages. The role of Pearl was originally meant for Hedy Lamarr, and even Teresa Wright was lined up too, but both women fell pregnant. Thus Selznick got the chance to shoehorn in his love and push her to the forefront of the movie with almost tyrannical urgings. 8 directors, 3 writers, 3 cinematographers & 4 editors would ultimately be used (that we know of). While bad weather, strikes and illness to Jones would also plague production. It's a wonder the film got finished at all.

It's an odd film in many ways, but one that appears now to have been very harshly treated by the critics of the day. That's not to say it's a masterpiece of classic Oater cinema, because it's not. But if viewed as a fun Horse Opera with Selznick getting away with as much as he can, then it's not half bad at all. Certainly the cast seem to be playing it as a fun piece of work, especially the wonderful Huston as OTT minister man, The Sinkiller. So viewed without expectation of serious melodrama, Duel In The Sun delivers some fun entertainment. Granted not all of it is intentional; the ending for one is preposterous and mirthful when really it shouldn't be. But the fact remains that the film is entertaining. Action wise it scores well, with stand out scenes including Jones on a runaway horse, hundreds of mounted horsemen riding to defend grumpy Jackson McCanles' (Barrymore) land against railroad incursion, and Peck (playing a sexual rebel type) taming a sex crazed stallion (even the horse knows what is expected of it here!).

Then there's the vast scope of the Western vistas, that are in turn dripping with lurid Technicolor. The terms beautiful and sordid spring to mind, now that is surely two words that aptly apply to the film as a whole? For the best performances one needs to look into the support cast, where Bickford, the afore mentioned Huston, Gish and the always enjoyable Butterfly McQueen, all deliver stoic like performances. Jones is a touch miscast, saddled with being the epicentre of the film (and Selznick's attentions), she at least deserves credit for trying to make the so-so writing work. She certainly looks beautiful and in the more quiet moments for her character the good actress threatens to break out. Peck, in a role originally meant for John Wayne-who balked at the sexiness of the plot, gives it gusto supreme, but whilst acknowledging it being an unusual role for him-so thus a brave choice, he never once convinces as a sexual dynamo. Cotton gets the short straw in that the role is badly underwritten, which when one considers that the story is essentially a Cain & Abel based story; he deserved better. While Barrymore is solidly doing what he does best and his only failing here is to not be as good as his on screen wife. Musically, Dimitri Tiomkin provides a competent if unmemorable score.

Fun, sexy and with little snatches of daring in the plot, Duel In The Sun is better than some would have you believe. But maybe, just maybe, it needs to be viewed with a glint in the eye and the tongue firmly planted in cheek? 7/10 || The story here - a sort of Cain and Abel style topic that causes no end of pain for Jennifer Jones (""Pearl"") is gorgeous to look at, gritty and very well put together. It is also, however, far too long and for the most part devoid of much pace. Joseph Cotton (""Jesse"") and Gregory Peck (""Lewt"") are both the sons of ruthless senator ""McCanles"" (Lionel Barrymore) the former a decent, if rather weak sort of character, the latter much more of a lethal loose cannon - but both vie for the love of the beautiful, sultry ""Pearl"". When the railroad arrives, wanting to cross the old man's land, ""Jesse"" sides with them alienating his father and his brother, and so is soon isolated as the young woman vacillates between him and his much more visceral and enticing brother - now the story really begins to smoulder. There are also an engaging series of appearances from Lilian Gish as the boys' mother - a lady who lays the blame for her sons errancy squarely at the door of their father. A fine supporting cast offer richness to an already complicated human story - Herbert Marshall, Charles Bickford amongst them. At it's best the film is effective - challenging views on race, loyalty, sexism, it looks at the pioneering spirit of those who want to take their country forward and the reticence of those who are scared of anything new, or of altering the status quo - and the last ten minutes are pretty unique amongst the films of this genre. There is too much padding, which does allow us to inhale the grand cinematography, but does deflate the potency of the narrative just a bit too much, a bit too often. Still - a fine piece of cinema well worthy a big screen with a sound system that can immerse you in Dimitri Tiomkin's rousing score."
36657.0,X-Men,"Two mutants, Rogue and Wolverine, come to a private academy for their kind whose resident superhero team, the X-Men, must oppose a terrorist organization with similar powers.",Trust a few. Fear the rest.,"Adventure, Action, Science Fiction",104,2000-07-13,en,7.005,11661,0.5039,"Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, James Marsden",Bryan Singer,"superhero, mutant, based on comic, superhuman, appreciative","***“X-Men” laid the foundation for all the great Superhero flicks to come***  

I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.

The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and a small percentage of humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are old friends, take totally contrasting positions: Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with an attitude of superiority. Unfortunately, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.

Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality: ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).

""X-Men"" naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are introduced and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and nobly opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as adolescents Iceman and Pyro. Both groups of mutants meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor, which is the weakest part of the film, but not bad.

When ""X-Men"" debuted in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since ""Superman"" (1978) and ""Superman II"" (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the quality of many of those films.

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes with several interesting deleted scenes available.

GRADE: A- || X-Men is a milestone in cinema history. Without it being actually good and such a smash success, we wouldn't be enjoying the comic book movie world that rules the box office today.

The approach of X-Men was the right one. It told a relevant human story about prejudice, treating the source material respectfully and seriously. It's legacy may be greater than the actual movie, but X-Men is x-cellent! || Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

This is not a good ""comic book movie"", but as a stand alone story, it's decent if derivative.

Just pretend I did a whole rant about how this isn't like the comics, we're both better off this way.

There are a lot good points like balancing the characters and stars in a way that was lauded way more in Avengers later on because everyone liked those characters better and there was some definite ""oomph"" to the Avengers franchise that the X-Men franchise was missing from the start, but no one had done it right yet so it was unclear what we didn't know at the time.

Fox clearly put enough money into this on the basis of the cast paychecks alone, and there are several good visual effects throughout the movie.  Comic consistencies aside, they really shoehorned some of the things in and there character writing is clearly misdirected.

The writing has a good skeleton to it, but there are too many places where they wrote ""and something cool happens to distract the audience"".  X-Men is a drama story, and they carried that into the movie, but it would seem they were aiming to be an action movie with a deep plot and just landed inbetween.

The action is all between characters that (and I fully believed the actors did all they could) are limited to being awkward, goofy, stiff, or empty."
1788.0,Footloose,"When teenager Ren and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small town in the West, he's in for a real case of culture shock after discovering he's living in a place where music and dancing are illegal.",The music is on his side.,"Drama, Romance",107,1984-02-17,en,6.676,2110,4.088,"Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest, Chris Penn",Herbert Ross,"dancing, dance, dancer, volkswagen beetle, dance teacher, father daughter relationship, amused","""A time to mourn and a time to dance"" - Ecclesiastes 3:4 

RELEASED IN 1984 and directed by Herbert Ross, “Footloose” chronicles events in the small Western town of Bomont where dancing and loud music have been outlawed because of an accident that killed some kids years earlier. Preacher’s daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) rebels against the legalistic measures while taking liking to a new student from Chicago, Ren (Kevin Bacon), whom her father (John Lithgow) disapproves of because he perceives Ren as a “troublemaker” who wants to change the town laws against dancing.

Also on hand are Chris Penn as Ren's “country boy” pal, Willard, and Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend, Rusty. Penn's character is real fun and Sarah was a real cutie back in '84.

I stayed away from this film because of Roger Ebert's scathing review and the fact that I thought the story was about some big city fop moving to a small town and dancing on the tables of the local high school, etc. I was wrong (and so was Ebert). The protagonist, Ren, is no dandy; in fact, he can kick some arse if necessary. And you never see him dancing through the halls of the high school or whatever. He’s a professional-class gymnast and his dynamic solo work-out at the factory is simply a matter of blowing off steam, which is a form of healthy venting.

Although I stayed away from ""Footloose,” the film acquired a respectable following and this inspired me to finally view it. I now understand why it's so popular. ""Footloose"" has that cinematic magic that pulls you in and gives you a good time. This is just a really entertaining movie with an exceptional soundtrack of songs made for the move with no less than six top 40 hits, like the title track by Kenny Loggins and “Holding Out for a Hero” performed by Bonnie Tyler, plus a couple of other significant ditties, e.g. “Bang Your Head” by Quiet Riot.

Surprisingly, “Footloose” also has depth and is actually moving. We understand Rev. Shaw Moore's grief, but his rigid law-ism isn't doing his people or town any good. I like how Shaw isn't made out to be the clichéd villain. This is a good man thinking he's doing the right thing for his town, and in many ways he is, but the legalistic spirit he cops is sapping the life out of him, his family, his congregants and his town. Does he have the wisdom to see his error and re-route?

BOTTOM LINE: Footloose is easily the best of the Big Three 80's dance movies and actually made significantly more at the domestic box office than “Dirty Dancing” ($80 million compared to $65 million). It has heart, a great cast, a superb soundtrack, all-around entertainment and real-life mindfood. It's also based on a true story that occurred in Elmore City, Oklahoma. Actually, there were similar towns with the same laws throughout America (and maybe still are). 

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in areas 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City, on the eastern side of Utah Lake. WRITER: Dean Pitchford.

GRADE: A || It's still one of my favorites and I could hardly walk when it first came out.

And now it's legend, so writing a real review is almost needless. Just about everyone has seen it. It's still regarded as a classic.

So I suppose the best thing to say is that it's like the Karate Kid...only with dancing rather than martial arts.

Single mother and son move into a new town. Son is an outsider that gets in trouble with the local bully. Son starts dating the local bully's girlfriend. Son and bully fight and...resolution.

However, it goes a bit deeper in that it references several cases of high school kids actually taking on town ordinances against dancing.

And Kevin Bacon is the new kid in town, so he's like the Karate Kid, but he also serves in the Pat Morita role as instructor.

And the evil dojo is actually a church and the bad guy is actually a preacher and not a Karate trainer and has a very kind heart and cares a lot for his community. So the main villain isn't really evil he just has a different point of view, and unlike movies today, he is allowed to have a different point of view, to really be wrong in his beliefs, and still be portrayed as a kind and caring person.

So, it's like the Karate Kid only with actual depth and much better soundtrack. || ""Ren"" (Kevin Bacon) moves from the big city to a small town run by the rather puritanical preacher ""Moore"" (John Lithgow) only to find that dancing, singing - indeed just about every form of entertainment has been banished. He claims that is to protect them and their children from ungodly corrupting influences. The new boy is treated with enough circumspection before ""Ariel"" (Lori Singer) takes a shine to him, but once it's known that the daughter of the town bible-basher is having a romance with the disruptive influence, then battle lines are drawn. It's fair too say that ""Ren"" hasn't his problems to seek finding and keeping work and with the local lads who resent his cool, James Dean, style attitude. Things come to an head when he proposes at a town council meeting that the ban be lifted so that they can get a bit ""Footloose"". The drama here is as good as it's contemporaries like ""Flashdance"" (1983) and enjoyably builds on the craze that was probably started with and perpetuated by ""Fame"" (and it's ""Kids"") but the acting is all pretty mediocre, as the dialogue. It's essentially a film about a soundtrack - and there are plenty of songs here beginning with the title song then ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"" and Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"" amongst those complementing an underscore of AOR and some energetic dance moves from both Bacon and Singer. It was an huge film at the time and made many a reputation, but time has rather neutered that novelty and now it's a film I'd rather listen to than watch."

Claire and Norman Spencer's marriage starts to fall apart when she believes there is a ghost in the house. Things gather apace when Claire is convinced that the spirit is trying to tell her something. Something that could be too close to home for comfort.

Robert Zemeckis does Hitchcock? Well yes, the influence is obvious, unashamedly so. But the trouble with that, is having the maestro as a benchmark renders all other modern day attempts as folly. However, casting aside that gargantuan issue, What Lies Beneath is an effective creeper come thriller that boasts star credentials.

Directed by Zemeckis, formed from an idea by Steven Spielberg (from the story by Sarah Kernochan) and starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as the fragmenting Spencer's. That's a pretty tidy bunch from which to launch your movie. What follows is a mixture of genuine unease and mystery, red herrings and standard boo jump moments, all of which almost gets lost on a saggy middle section as Zemeckis plays Hitchcock one too many times and loses sight of the supernatural heart of the piece, not helped by Clark Gregg's meandering script I might add. None the less, the picture gets pulled around for the finale as the spooky combines with thriller to produce some quality edge of the seat stuff. But it's only then that you totally realise that the makers here have tried to cram too much in to one film. In eagerness to manipulate the audience for the fine ending (though you probably will have it worked out at the half way point) the film just ends up as being confused as to what it mostly wanted to be.

Pfeiffer is excellent and looks stunning and Ford gives it gusto when the script allows. Support comes from Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, Miranda Otto and James Remar. The house is suitably eerie with its waterside setting and Alan Silvestri's score is perfectly in tune with the creepy elements of the piece. It's a fine enough film in its own right, regardless of the Hitchcockian homages. It's just that it should have been a far better horror picture than it turned out to be. 7/10 || ***Ghostly happenings in northern Vermont with Ford & Pfeiffer***

A couple living on Lake Champlain (Harrison Ford & Michelle Pfeiffer) face the empty nest syndrome as the wife experiences increasingly spectral happenings. Diana Scarwid, James Remar and Miranda Otto have peripheral roles. 

""What Lies Beneath"" (2000) is a Hitchcockian drama/mystery with a bit o’ horror. It starts by borrowing from ""Rear Window"" (1954), but thankfully veers from there. At a little past the hour mark I was starting to get restless. The story was progressing too slowly with too many doors inexplicably opening. I suppose it didn’t help that Pfeiffer doesn’t trip my trigger, although she’s serviceable (I wouldn’t say I DON’T like her); and Harrison’s character seems unjustifiably gruff and impatient. 

However, the Upstate Vermont/ New York locations are fabulous and a mysterious mood is effectively established. The way things pan out is unexpected, unless you saw the trailer first, which outrageously spoils it. The concluding F/X sequence is beautiful in a ghostly way and satisfyingly brings closure. What didn’t make sense earlier is elucidated. At the end of the day, the movie’s underwhelming, but not altogether unworthy if you’re in the mode for a flick of this sort.    
  
The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont/New York (Burlington, D.A.R. State Park, Waterbury & Westport) with other stuff done in Southern Cal (Los Angeles, Playa Vista & Culver City).

Lee Thompson,"gold, marshal","How to succeed by failing big?

Mackenna's Gold is directed by J. Lee Thompson and adapted for the screen by Carl Foreman from a novel of the same name written by Henry Wilson Allen (AKA: Heck Allen, Henry Allen & Will Henry!), which in turn is loosely based on the legend of the Lost Adams Diggings. It stars Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Camilla Sparv, Julie Newmar, Ted Cassidy & Telly Savalas. It's photographed by Joseph MacDonald in Technicolor and Super Panavision, with a music score by Quincy Jones. 

It begins so well, the credits inform us that not only do we get Peck, Sharif and Newmar in lead roles, but that we also have in support a role call of quality thespians: Eli Wallach, Edward G. Robinson, Raymond Massey, Burgess Meredith, Lee J. Cobb, Keenan Wynn & Anthony Quayle. We are then treated to some gorgeous aerial photography of Monument Valley, a Vulture glides gracefully thru the air, and then, we hear the awful strains of ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" warbled like it belongs in a seventies porn movie by José Feliciano. It's there that the true marker for Mackenna's Gold is set. 

The idea and source for the plot is safe, Lawman Mackenna (Peck) has the knowledge of where the legendary Canyon of Gold is. A fabled place awash with gold but guarded religiously by the Apache. With the map safely tucked away in his brain, Peck is quickly captured by blood thirsty Mexican bandit, Colorado (Sharif), and his companions, one of which (Newmar playing Indian Hesh-Ke) has past history with Mackenna. But that's not all, pretty soon Mackenna's party are joined by a whole host of other gold seekers, all seemingly gripped with Gold Fever. So in fighting and suspicion ensues, and with the Cavalry in pursuit of Colorado and the Apache still to come, this is as dangerous as it gets. If only the film wasn't so choppy and flat. 

The film was originally a three hour epic, complete with intermission, but the budget probably all went on securing the cast and the producers don't seem able to deal with the task of making a big budget epic. Thus the film was cut to just over two hours; thank god for small mercies! Looking at the cast assembled it's obvious that this was a very ambitious project meant to keep the Western flag flying high and enthral the adventure seeking cinema goer. And you can see why such a quality cast signed on for the film, tho Peck was second choice after Clint Eastwood wisely chose to make Hang Em High instead. But what plays out is a series of clichés and absurdities that makes one unintentionally laugh. The effects are awful, I mean OK we don't expect back screen work to be high class, but here, with the actors half heartedly pretending it's real, it belies the fine work of MacDonald for the exteriors. 

The problems don't just stop with the effects, before we even get to the issues in the cast, there's Jones' dreadful score to try and ignore. It sounds like he thinks he's scoring a Keystone Cops Gold Rush type movie! Dimitri Tiomkin, along with Foreman, is on production duties (hmm), I'm sure he could have knocked up something better for this film in his sleep. Peck is actually OK, with that laconic way of his, he suits the tone of the narrative. Sharif is grossly miscast, while Sparv is simply woeful. Newmar raises the temperatures of audience and cast alike, which you sense was her only instruction, while the lauded support cast file in and out without time to impact on proceedings. All of which leads to a finale of ham, model work and predictability. Yet there's been just enough to make the undemanding stay to the end. We wonder if indeed there is a Canyon of Gold, and Peck is so likable we just want to see him win out and defy the baddies. 

Does it succeed by failing big? Well it is fun, but coming as it does from the makers of the Guns of Navarone, you have to believe that the end product is not the sort of entertainment they originally set out to craft. 3.5/10 || ***Entertaining, but comic booky 1969 Western with a superlative cast***  

""MacKenna's Gold"" (1969) deals with the insanity of ‘gold fever’ and builds-up a good amount of anticipation concerning the secret gold canyon. Does it exist or doesn’t it? Western expert Brian Garfield (author of ""Death Wish"") commented on ""MacKenna's Gold"" in his outstanding book ""Western Films"" thusly: ""it hasn't a single redeeming quality. It has got to be the most expensive star-studded two-hour ‘B’ movie ever made; a gargantuan dud of absolutely stunning dreadfulness.""

It hasn't a SINGLE redeeming quality? Okay, let me list a smattering: Outstanding cast, including Gregory Peck, Omar Sharif, Ted Cassidy, Julie Newmar, Telly Savalas, Carmilla Sparv and many more, albeit mostly cameos; one of the greatest Western scores of all time by Quincy Jones, which ranks up there with ""How the West Was Won,"" ""Rio Lobo,"" ""Duel at Diablo,"" ""Bandolero!"" ""Bonanza,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (to name a handful); a standout theme song, ""Old Turkey Buzzard,"" sung by Jose Feliciano, written by Jones; and magnificent locations (Utah, Arizona, Rogue River Oregon) & cinematography.

Plus, although the story has an undeniable comic booky vibe (which explains why Garfield referred to it as a ""B"" movie), it is played out in a completely serious manner. And pretty much holds your attention while creating much anticipation regarding the legendary canyon.

Gregory Peck, who plays Marshal MacKenna, and Carmilla Sparv are definitely the ""good guys."" The film was made at a time (the late 60s) when characters in Westerns tended to be unlikable or amoral (e.g. ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Macho Callahan""), and this movie has its fill as well, but it's nice to have some quality protagonists.

Omar Sharif plays the head Mexican bandit ""Colorado"" excellently. It's sort of an atypical role for him, but he performs with such gusto it seems he was born to play the part. Ted Cassidy, well-known as ""Lurch"" on TV's The Addam's Family, plays the intimidating, laconic Indian warrior Hachita. He superbly fits the character (regardless of whether or not he has AmerIndian blood running through his veins). Julie Newmar is likewise great as a CRAZY squaw. Red-blooded males will be interested to know that she has a nude swimming scene.

Quincy Jones' opening score and the theme song ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" are so stirring (especially combined with the magnificent Southwest photography) that sometimes I'll just play the beginning of the film, which runs a full 6-8 minutes (!). I've heard some complain that ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" is corny. But, speaking as someone who’s never been much of a fan of County/Western music, ""Old Turkey Buzzard"" is just a potent composition, regardless of the musical genre. It effectively comments on man's temporal nature and the insane & contagious condition of gold fever.

While ""MacKenna's Gold"" certainly lacks the gritty realism of, say, the contemporaneous ""The Wild Bunch,"" it is indeed a serious film despite some undeniable cartoonish aspects. One could also probably nitpick about the not-quite-successful F/X miniature sequences, but that's not important; what is important is the film's entertainment value. At the end of the day ""MacKenna's Gold"" entertains.

The movie runs 2 hours, 8 minutes.

Though largely suppressed by the overwhelming military force, the Boers did have success with guerrilla tactics that resulted in the pretty brutal skirmishes described here. A court martial has been constituted to investigate the activities of three Australian solders and to basically scapegoat them. Only the legal skills of the inexperienced lawyer ""Maj. Thomas"" (Jack Thompson) can hope to prevent the three from going to the gallows. What soon becomes clear is that the soldiers lead by ""Morant"" (Edward Woodward) were certainly no saints, and that the ghastliness of this war is writ pretty largely, but what it also identifies is the complicity of their otherwise ""civilised"" officers. It's got a solid cast, the dialogue is gritty and plausible, the cinematography presents us with the grand scale of the South African countryside and of the often rather subsistence existence of farmers and soldiers alike, and as the momentum builds, Australian director Bruce Beresford manages to sustain a fair degree of interest in the future of the accused and take quite a swipe at the colonial mentalities that prevailed at the time (and not just the British ones) too. Well worth a watch. || An all time great war movie/court room drama

""Breaker Morant"" is one of those movies I had placed on a ""Really should see this movie one of these days"" list. Well, in some ways I'm sorry I waited so long to see this masterpiece and in other ways, the current world situation with ""The war on terror"" has made this movie even more relevant and topical.

The plot of this movie is based on real events that occurred during the Boer War, in South Africa. Three Australian soldiers (well, during the course of this war, Australia had become a nation) are courts martial for the killing of some South African fighters and a South African priest. The colonials are fighting for Britain against the Boers, and concerned that Germany (or what would later become Germany) would enter the war on the side of the Boers, Britain seeks to contain things and perhaps prevent German involvement by trying the three Australian colonials.

Here is a movie which made a list of the greatest war movies of all time (http://www.historynet.com/movies/11719756.html). In my opinion this movie should have topped the poll, or ranked even higher than the 91st position it got, out of 100. In fact, I think that this movie is also one of the all time great court room dramas as well (the movie has many court scenes and occasionally gives a magnificent insight into war and the conditions on the ground). Script-wise, this film is a towering achievement. So many insights into the bigger picture occurring through understated dialogue.

Made before the current ""War on terror"", it perhaps unintentionally makes complex our response to that. In other words, this is not a film that panders to liberalism or conservatism. Times have changed, and this movie challenges us, in a way that it perhaps didn't foresee or intend, as a consequence of the event of September 11, 2001, in the USA.

Superb performances all around from an All Star Australian cast. Poignant, funny, enlightening and intellectually stimulating. This is the movie that blows away the notion that I had that Australian movies are poorly scripted and acted.

An all time great movie. Nominated for an Oscar. Should have won many.

Perfect.

He is about as much use as that wrong calibre stuff they had in the Crimea, but he determines that his best plan for a swift exit back to his equally up-herself cousin “Sonja” (Diane Keaton) is to assassinate the Frenchman and end the war in one stroke.

Fans of Tolstoy and/or Dostoevsky will see plenty of similarities, parodies even, of their more earnest tales of revolution, grand philosophising and unrequited love and for much of the time these references are only very thinly veiled, if at all! It is also an out-and-out comedy with more than an few shades of the bawdiness of a “Carry On” movie peppered with a few double-entendres and the humour comes thick and fast amongst all the fake blood and fabulous examples of the costumiers art.

A handsome restaurateur in upscale Manhattan is also a notorious womanizer (Richard Gere). When he is wowed by a too-young woman (Winona Ryder), will she become the catalyst to positive change despite her secret?   

“Autumn in New York” (2000) is a romance that mixes “Love Story” (1970) with a little “Pretty Woman” (1990). It has a lot of good in it, especially the Fall cinematography of the better parts of the Big Apple, as well as the characters played by Elaine Stritch and JK Simmons, not to mention Vera Farmiga. The ""human lie detector"" scene is great too. 

Unfortunately, there’s zero build-up to consummation and Gere’s character is depicted in an outrageously negative light despite his good-looking charisma. I’m talking the first 40 minutes of the movie. Why would anyone with a brain want to waste their precious time on such a person?

I suppose you could view it as a character study and the power of love to change an attractive-but-loathsome person but, if that’s the case, explain what contemptibly happens at the Halloween party. Still, it's a bold scene that captures the viewer unaware and should be respected for that. No one can say it's an imitation of ""Love Story"" from 30 years earlier. Also, the close with Vera’s character is notable in a heartwarming way. There’s hope for ANYONE, if they’re humble and penitent.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan.

6282.0,Coyote Ugly,"Graced with a velvet voice, 21-year-old Violet Sanford heads to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a songwriter only to find her aspirations sidelined by the accolades and notoriety she receives at her ""day"" job as a barmaid at Coyote Ugly. The ""Coyotes"" as they are affectionately called tantalize customers and the media alike with their outrageous antics, making Coyote Ugly the watering hole for guys on the prowl.","Tonight, they're calling the shots.","Comedy, Drama, Music, Romance",100,2000-07-30,en,6.3,2144,3.8247,"Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, Bridget Moynahan, Tyra Banks, Izabella Miko","David McNally, Gina Wendkos",beautiful woman,"I managed to see this movie on it's first day of screening in New York, back in 2000, just before I went back to Europe.

'Coyote Ugly' is a nice romantic comedy, perfectly fit for the generation who didn't grow up with 'Flashdance', Saturday Night Fever etc.

Piper Perado plays the young aspiring song-writer who wants to get a major record-deal, write songs and then safely watch others perform her music. But then there's this little snag, called reality. Although the story is not very surprising it is solid and consistent told. We understand why she ends up on the bar dancing (no spoiler here). And at the same time we understand why her father is disappointed. A fine part played by John Goodman. At times their relationship reminded me of the one Madonna and Danny Aiello had in the 'Father Don't Preach' music-video. Father reluctantly sees his daughter grow up. And she only wants him to be proud of her.

After I saw the trailer on television I immediately went to the REAL Coyote Ugly Saloon on 1st Avenue on which this film was based (unless there's another one, of course). The real bar is not nearly as flashy as it's celluloid counterpart. But they DO hose down annoying customers with beer and there IS dancing on the bar. However by the female customers, rather than the waitresses. But they do get fresh with you if you happen to order something they don't serve. (anything besides beer and Jack Daniels) And they do drink shots with the costumers. Funny detail is that in the movie is explained why they don't get drunk.

I know, I know, we already have Flashdance. (Also from Bruckheimer) but I don't mind if this type of story is being updated now and then, right? Although the soundtrack could sound a bit more contemporary. || **An excuse to make a film full of women swaying seductively without a hint of softcore.**

What can we say about a romantic film, with light touches of comedy, that spends most of its time showing us very attractive women in tight, short clothes, and bouncing around sensually in an atmosphere of mockery and debauchery worthy of a university graduation party? A lot of things. What leaves us no doubt? It is a film made with an openly and openly heterosexual audience in mind. Released in 2000, I don't know if the film would be possible today without being immediately accused of sexism and giving a stereotypical and sexualized image of women.

Let's start by talking about the good things. One of them, perhaps the best, is the extraordinary soundtrack, which compiles excellent songs into one of the best non-original soundtracks of the decade: “The Right Kind of Wrong” and “Can't Fight the Moonlight” are so good that the entire we know them. The music is so important here that, in a sense, it is more of a music video than a film: the protagonist is an aspiring songwriter who tries to make it in the music market without much success, but who discovers that she sings well and becomes one of the main attractions. of a nightclub.

The scenarios are convincing enough for us to believe them, especially if it is known that there really is a bar of this type in New York (in fact, it seems that others in the same franchise have already opened). Even so, there is so much exaggeration at parties that it is, in my eyes, difficult to believe in a certified and legal commercial space. Minimally decent editing, but sometimes lax, and cinematography that relies too heavily on red tones complete, on a less positive note, the more technical aspects of this film.

In addition to the good songs, we have the beauty of the cast, with young and slender actresses, who make up for their inexperience with fantastic bodies and good dancing skills: Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, Tyra Banks, Izabella Miko, Bridget Moynahan and Adam Garcia. It's a shame that physical beauty doesn't translate into talent: as the cast wasn't chosen based on the actors' abilities, none of them offer an inspired performance. They are a bunch of complete scoundrels and the film, at this point, is very weak. In the interest of justice, it is imperative to save the renowned John Goodman, the only good actor here, who shows us what it is like to act in a character full of grace and quite comical.

All of these, however, are mere stumbling blocks on the long road of a production that could, even so, be frankly good if it told us a good story. It is in the script and the story told that the film falls to the ground like an aspiring model who breaks both heels while parading. When watching the film, I asked myself over and over again where the hell the script was, because all that, that whole trip to the city, to a future in show business, is so absolutely cliché and has already been repeated so much that it is unacceptable. There is no substance. Then, all that sugary romance, without any chemistry, without any logic... it's too stupid, with stupid and unacceptably poorly written dialogues. || COYOTE UGLY IS AWESOME"

I had no idea what this movie was really but there was nothing else on last night and I also noticed that it was directed by Paul Verhoeven which have directed quite a few movies that I really liked so I decided to give it a try. As it turned out, this is another movie that is somewhat above the usual standard for movies given on SyFy.

It has a rating on 27% on Rotten Tomatoes which is just bullshit. But then, the so called “professional critics” used by the Rotten Tomatoes are dimwits who trash every movie that is not “intellectual” enough for their self-imagined refined tastes. I do not know why they continue to use these clowns for their official rating system instead of the real audience? On IMDb it holds a 5.6 out of 10 rating which is more realistic. I was hesitating between 7 and 6. In the end I gave it a 6 because, as I said in the title, it is a quite okay movie but not a fantastic one.

The story of the movie is a fairly standard one. Scientist experiments on himself, experiment goes wrong, scientist goes mad, hack hack, chop chop, scientist dies, happy ending for the remaining survivors. Thus the movie pretty much relies on its special effects which are indeed quite good. The various invisible effects, not to mention the scenes where Caine is partially visible due to smoke or water effects, are quite enjoyable to watch. 

Kevin Bacon is making quite a performance as a very disagreeable fanatic scientist. He is doing a remarkably good job of it even when he is covered by a latex mask which of course is quite a feat being deprived of any facial expressions. The rest of the cast was fairly standard Hollywood fare, that is, fairly bland.

On the whole I found the movie quite enjoyable. It was perhaps a bit slow at the beginning and Cain’s show of megalomaniacal attitudes was indeed becoming a bit tiresome after a while. As I said, his roles was a very disagreeable one. Once he became invisible things started to become more interesting although it took a wee time for things to speed up even then.

It was certainly not a wasted movie evening and the movie is worth at least 6 out of 10 stars. || It's amazing what you can do... when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror any more.

It was the film that convinced director Paul Verhoeven to leave Hollywood and take a break from film making. His reasoning being that any Hollywood director could have made Hollow Man, a big effects led movie that made a lot of cash at the box office. It's this that is the main problem with the picture, it lacks some of the director's bite and satirical savagery, even the souped up sex (natural or deviant) that often comes with his productions. Yet devoid of expectations of a Verhoeven masterpiece, and the crushing realisation that it basically wastes its potential and plays out as a haunted house stalk movie - it's a good enough energetic popcorner.

It quickly becomes obvious that we are entering special effects extravaganza, the opening credits are dynamite, sci-fi sexy, then the opening gambit sequence literally grabs us - and a rodent - by the throat. From here on in we are treated to grade ""A"" effects and some genius ways of exposing ""the invisible"" Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) to us and the prey he soon comes to hunt. Unfortunately the whole cast performances are a much of a muchness, and playing a roll call of sci-fi stereotypes. All involved here have done much better work in their sleep, but they put the bums on theatre seats and ultimately this works as one of those movies designed to thrill and awe the senses - but sadly not the brain. 6.5/10 || Some pretty impressive effects for the era, and a pretty cool (if not original) core concept, but what's most intriguing about _Hollow Man_ is the hero's journey, or more accurately, the absence of it. The inverse of it. I don't feel like it's fair to even say that it's a villain's journey. Assuredly, by the end of the movie, it is very clear who our villain is, but given that he starts out such a dick anyway, the intriguing thing is not so much that he necessarily changes, but the idea that his character is maybe just ""revealed"". To become the type of prick he always could have been, if only had the power to be so. The thing is, he starts this movie a pretty archetypal protagonist. His role is seen almost identically across any number of movies for decades before _Hollow Man_ was released, and one that we honestly still see today. And this archetype is almost always beloved! ""Sure he's a bit cheeky, but that's why he's such a great character"". It's very confronting to think about what this archetype is so close to being, and I think maybe that's kind of the point of this whole thing.

The story, dialogue and characters are nonsense from start to finish - indeed, it could be a contender for the ""Plan 9"" award for the worst sci-i ever made. The ending is diabolical, but not in any sort of devilish way, and the visual effects cannot help but raise a smile. Absolutely awful, but I bet you stick it out.... || This isn't a good movie, but ""Keep your G-String on"" is the greatest line in Movie History. || **_Late 50's horror schlock that's actually effective (in some ways)_**

A modern-day American Dr. Frankenstein wannabe (Jason Evers) tries to find an attractive body for his fiancé (Virginia Leith) after she is decapitated in a car accident. While her head is on life-support the mad doctor searches the dives for the right body and ultimately focuses his attentions on a model with a disfigured face (Adele Lamont). Leslie Daniel plays the doctor's assistant while Eddie Carmel plays the mysterious thing dwelling in a locked room.

This was shot in B&W in 1959, but not released until 1962 due to its lurid and lewd excesses. 

It's easy to sneer in bemused contempt at old low-budget horror movies like this after the advent of blockbusters in the late 70s (e.g. ""Star Wars""), but – believe it or not – they were relevant at one time. If you can ignore obvious plot holes and the cheap production values there's quite a bit to enjoy, which isn't to say that this is a good movie, just that it's entertaining in many ways and even unexpectedly horrific.

Yes, it's basically a Frankenstein rip-off, but the ""Jan in the pan"" element offers an intriguing angle with the idea of a head transplant. The first successful organ transplant was a kidney transplant in 1954 and the second was in 1962, so this was still a novel idea when the film was made in '59 and released in '62. Amazingly, head transplants were already being done with animals in the 50s and are only now surfacing as a legitimate possibility with humans (although I'm sure it's already been attempted by real-life Frankensteins).

Surprisingly, the movie scores high marks on the female front with Adele Lamont standing out as a petite model. In the European version of the movie she appears topless in the photog sequence. In 2013 Timeless Media released the movie on DVD with a supplemental section that shows this scene, which is only like 80 seconds. Virginia Leith is effective as Jan in the pan who understandably goes more psycho as the story progresses. The idea that she develops telepathy and communicates with the being in the closet is an interesting addition.

Lastly, there are a few surprisingly horrific or gory scenes that are still somewhat disturbing to this day. Jan's demonical laughing in the midst of fiery perdition is effective, plus the irony of who the real monster is and isn't. Unfortunately, the story lags at certain points and is overly-talky here and there. I suppose it should've been cut by at least ten minutes, but even these sequences have their charm.

The uncut version, which I saw, runs 83 minutes. The film was shot in Tarrytown, New York, which is 30 miles north of Manhattan on the east side of the Hudson River.

A small, struggling Wild West Show consisting of several misfits travels through Montana & Idaho wherein they stumble upon a haughty heiress (Sondra Locke) whom the honest owner (Clint Eastwood) hires as his assistant in the show. 

""Bronco Billy"" (1980) is an Eastwood dramedy in the manner of “Every Which Way But Loose” (1978), but with maybe less goofiness in the side characters. While not as successful at the box office, it’s every bit as good in its likable, low-key amusing way. The movie’s about redemption and pursuing your dreams, persevering through challenges and acquiring spiritual (true) family.

The movie scores pretty well on the female front with Locke, Tessa Richarde (Mitzi Fritts) and 
Cha Cha Sandoval-McMahon, aka Tanya Russell 	(Doris Duke).

There’s an interesting sequence involving Billy acquiescing to the posturing Sheriff where you have to read between the lines.  It was a matter of stroking the Sheriff's ego and letting him believe what he wanted to believe in order to achieve what Billy wanted. Let the cop have his dreamworld, Billy seems to think. This principle is taught in the now-ancient (but still relevant) hit book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"": Human beings in general, and especially authority figures, WANT to feel important and respected; it's a basic human desire. When pulled over, too many people needlessly argue with the officer and treat him/her with disrespect, which inevitably lands them an expensive ticket or worse. A little bit of humility & respect (reasonable kowtowing) saves a lot of unnecessary hassles and helps acquire what you want. Sometimes it's wise to eat humble pie; the gains are worth it.

The film runs 1 hour, 56 minutes, and was shot in the Boise, Idaho, area, but also Ontario, Oregon.

GRADE: A- || A fairly triumphant circus flick.

<em>'Bronco Billy'</em> is enjoyably paced and features good onscreen talent, as we see Clint Eastwood continuing his work with many familiar faces from his other films - including Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis and Bill McKinney; shame about the ill-fitting casting of Dan Vadis and Sierra Pecheur, mind.

Naturally it isn't the perfect film, given the aforementioned and the nosedive of Locke's character from being strong-minded to being a cliché dainty love interest, but it succeeds in making its story gain a bit of feeling. It also feels a tiny bit of a different role for Eastwood, given his character is quite caring - as opposed to the usual self-indulged roles, which he does very well of course.

It kinda gives me <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/toby-tyler/"" rel=""nofollow"">Toby Tyler</a>'</em> vibes, though this 1980 production is most definitely better than that average 1960 Disney release."

And in this case it's plot turns and mystery that it's lacking. The story itself is honestly pretty boring. And I don't fault anyone that objects to that.

Brian G. Hutton followed the considerable success he had had with 1968's Where Eagles Dare, with this, another men on a mission movie - only this one is very much a different animal. Hutton directs and Troy Kennedy-Martin writes the screenplay, it stars Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland and Don Rickles. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography is by Gabriel Figueroa.

When it comes to light that there is a considerable stash of Nazi gold waiting to be plundered behind enemy lines in occupied France, a group of maverick U.S. soldiers set off on a deadly mission to locate and gain...

Woof Woof!

Utterly wonderful. Kelly's Heroes mixes together war movie action staples with black comedy gold, the greed and insanity of war having its cheek poked by a sharp and bloody tongue. The script is clever, often very funny, often poignant and poised, and it's this that lets a great cast have a ball. You have the straight laced delivery of Eastwood playing against Savalas' macho rage, and Rickles' jumping- bean turn jostling with Sutherland's pre-hippy malarkey. Character names range from the likes of Oddball, Crapgame, Big Joe, Little Joe and Cowboy, a rogue group of soldiers deciding they want to grab something for themselves.

Up yours, baby!

The journey to find the gold is of course far from straight forward, with Hutton constructing some white hot action scenes. And it's here where it often gets forgotten that Kelly's Heroes does not forget the blood shed during war. People do die, it's not all fun and frolics, and Hutton knows his way around great suspense passages. Witness the brilliant minefield sequence and the ticking clock finale where we are never sure if any of the men will achieve their goal. So laugh while you ponder, then? Absolutely. Kelly's Heroes is caper and chaos, beef and brawn, but always cunning and crafty as well. 9/10
 || **_Amusing all-star WW2 dramedy/action flick with Eastwood and Savalas_**

Clint Eastwood stars as the title character who convinces Sgt. Big Joe (Telly Savalas), his platoon, and a free-spirited Sherman tank commander (Donald Sutherland) to spend their three-day leave on a gold heist at a French village 30 miles behind enemy lines. The events take place 12 weeks after the Normandy invasion.

""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970) was obviously inspired by ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" from four years earlier. Carroll O'Connor even plays the same basic role, a general who mistakes the misdeeds of Allied soldiers as brave, selfless combat; and arrives on the scene to commend them.

The picture uncannily combines zany comedy with serious war action and is highlighted by the fun, eccentric theme song ""Burning Bridges"" by The Mike Curb Congregation. Of course the all-star cast is great with Sutherland standing out as Oddball. People complain that Oddball was anachronistic since he was a late-60's hippie type, but his crew resembled Gypsies and, besides, there are laid-back free-spirited types in every generation.

While the film is overall superior to ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" it's inferior in that it lacks a female cast member in the form of the jaw-dropping Giovanna Ralli. Actually, the flick was slated to have a female role, but it was cut from the script prior to shooting. The stunning Ingrid Pitt was cast, as she worked with Eastwood two years earlier in ""Where Eagles Dare."" Ingrid was virtually climbing on board the plane bound for the set in Yugoslavia when word came that her part was cut. The fools.

The film is a little overlong at 2 hours, 24 minutes, and perhaps should've been cut by about 15-20 minutes, but the compelling last hour makes up for any flabbiness. The movie was shot in the Istrian village of Vizinada in Croatia (street scenes); Obrenovac, Serbia (Bridge over the Kolubara River); Beocin, Serbia (scenes with the general); and the coast of Slovenia (south of Trieste, Italy). 

GRADE: B+ || I think this is probably my favourite outing for Telly Savalas on the big screen as he decides to join his eponymous lieutenant (Clint Eastwood) on a perilous journey across enemy lines. With shells going off everywhere, their platoon captures a Nazi officer who reveals that there is a bank in rural France that is home to gold - $16 millions worth of gold. How can they get it, though? Well that's where the inventive ""Kelly"" drafts in the help of quartermaster-cum-scrounger ""Crapgame"" (Don Rickles); the aptly named and eccentric tank commander ""Oddball"" (Donald Sutherland) and leaving the captain's yacht to the mercies of the bombs, this disparate bunch start their journey. It proves surprisingly straightforward to make progress - a progress that causes some chagrin for ""Gen. Colt"" (Carroll O'Connor) who thinks that they are a collection of courageous soldiers worthy of medals galore - and of whom he is soon in hot pursuit without a clue as to their less than patriotic intent. Upon arrival at the town, the heroes discover there are well-armed Tiger tanks there, and the building that is supposed to hold the gold is well defended. How to destroy the tanks, get the gold and not reduce the entire village to rubble is now the order of the day... Eastwood holds this adventure together well, but it's really an ensemble effort with the entertaining Sutherland and Savalas working well with Troy Kennedy Martin's lively characterisations and script. Director Brian Hutton also keeps the pace moving well with plenty of action, the odd tin of (pink) paint and an exciting stand off at the denouement. Can they get away with it?

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || **An honest, committed and well-made low-budget film that delivers what it promises and doesn't leave us dissatisfied.**

I just saw this movie, which is currently considered a cult classic and an example of what you want from a low-budget movie. In fact, I understand the motivations of those who say this: the film is not good, it is not one of those films that I feel I will want to review a lot, however it is effective and gives us what it promises, in an honest way.

The script also has its originality, although it is scarce and only sustains a feature film thanks to the ability of the director, the ""newbie"" Stan Winston, to stretch it, albeit at the expense of a slower pace, which he tried to take advantage of to create Suspense: Set in an isolated rural area, the film is an insane revenge story, in which a man decides to turn to an evil witch after having his young son killed in an accident by a group of unconscious teenagers.

The actors are, for me, illustrious strangers. However, I really liked the performance of Lance Henrikssen, who is the only actor here to maintain a dramatic posture, to have charisma and to develop a more professional and mature work. In addition to giving life to the anguished father, he also gave life and body to the monster, who is the true protagonist of this film. The film also has several other actors, most of them quite young and with little experience.

On a technical level, I would like to highlight, first of all, the painstaking and time-consuming work of characterizing Henrikssen whenever he brought the monster to life. I can only imagine all the time spent each time the actor had to masquerade like that, and that disguise was excellent in itself, truly frightening and detailed. The filming work and cinematography seemed to be regular, the sets were well executed and the visual, special and sound effects are well done, especially considering the reduced budget of the production. The soundtrack also proved to be effective, albeit forgettable."

It does move along quickly enough, but the whole thing has a rather comic book feel to it. The writing is poor, the themes repeat themselves once too often and there is little chemistry from anyone on screen as the adventures rather lamely bumble along accompanied by a medicare AOR-style soundtrack. To be fair, it looks like Gibson is having some fun and it's always nice to see Burt Kwouk demonstrating just how little versatility he had as an actor - always looking perplexed, but otherwise all this is missing is Charlie Sheen. || I have a special love for this film, if for no other reason that the bulk of my college experience was spent on the cold war, the alphabet soup of PBSUCCESS, MKULTRA, JMWAVE, PAPERCLIP, COLDFEET, MKOFTEN, The Phoenix Program, ARTICHOKE, and my favorite (just because of how bad it sounds) Midnight Climax.

So a comedy about Air America was absolutely priceless. And, given that I am not one of those history nuts that cares about historical accuracy I can still sit back and enjoy something like this. I mean, honestly, so long as it's not a complete and total re-write... Hollywood can take it's liberties and edit what happened for drama, because, really, it just means that now people have heard of Air America.

And, honestly, when you choose to study the Cold War, people tend to think you're a conspiracy nut when you mention things like this, PBSUCCESS, Russians assassinating people with radiation poisoning and umbrella guns...

... So when something like this comes along, it's like yes... now people won't think I'm as crazy as Alex Jones.

And, you know, it features a song from the Seeds (and any real punk fan is going to drool over that) along with one of the better, if down played, soundtracks from the Vietnam Era. So it certainly has the music win.

And it's Gibson kind of hamming it up and doing a slightly saner version of his Lethal Weapon self... if oddly pacifistic. And RDJR, fresh out of rehab, proving to the world that he is actually capable of being a great actor when he is sober.

What you have is kind of an action movie without a lot of violence, set in the middle of a war zone, and based off of one of our intelligence black eyes in a way that doesn't take it too seriously, isn't heavy-handed or pretentious, masks any preachiness in a fun story, and really gets the point across without having to be Alan Alda at his worst.

Plus, it's a movie about skullduggery that doesn't resort to the Mission:Impossible/James Bond high action tropes. So, in a way, it's kind of a spy movie done right and... turned into a comedy."

The movie offers all the elements featured in the average slasher formula... and then some. We have the campsite, the oblivious adults, the group of stereotyped kids, the mysterious killer lurking around the place, an opening flashback showing a horrible tragedy and a lot of dead bodies piling up. 

In ""Sleepaway Camp"", the story begins with a family that is struck by a horrible accident, in which the father and one of the children die. Little Angela, the sole survivor of the gruesome event, is sent to live with her bizarre aunt Martha and her protective and loving (albeit cranky) cousin, Ricky, who is about her age. 

Many years later, we see Angela and Ricky as teenagers, heading up to a campsite during the summer, much to the girl's dismay, whose (almost pathological) shyness makes it really difficult for her to socialize. As soon as they arrive, Angela becomes the target of all the cruel jokes and pranks one could imagine, which is something that doesn't sit too well with her hotheaded cousin, Ricky. As one may be able to assume, the mean adults and kids begin to suffer and die one by one, at the hands of a mysterious figure that lurks around the place (well, that's original). Could the small and frail Angela have something to do with all this? Is her cousin, Ricky, more protective than it appears to be? While the owner of the campsite tries to find out what the heck is going on (while endangering the kids, of course), the meanies continue to suffer gruesome deaths, until a final revelation leaves everyone shocked beyond belief. Yes, Angela was the one who murdered everyone, except... Angela is actually Peter, who was forced to live as a girl, because her Aunt Martha didn't want another boy in the family. Yikes!

Yes, the plot twist is genius and it left me completely stunned when I first saw this movie as a teenager, so I won't play down the final revelation because it was, in fact, one of the most iconic endings in a horror flick and for a good reason. Now, another reason why I found ""Sleepaway Camp"" to be so disturbing is because it provides a subtext in which the youngsters are hopeless victims in a world ran by miserable adults. Most of the adults in this movie appear to be sick, lascivious, greedy and even plain evil, always taking advantage of children and teenagers in order to achieve personal satisfaction or gains. The kids are seen as objects used by these corrupt and perverted adults, who are only interested in their own satisfaction. Intentionally or not, Robert Hiltzik, who both wrote and directed the film, gives us a really dark take on reality, by showing the way adults relate to children and teenagers, since the adult characters combined are probably more terrifying than the deranged individual behind the killings. As a matter of fact, this aspect of the film is somewhat depressing, as it is closer to reality than one would think and probably not something one expects to see in a slasher flick that, presumably, doesn't intend to give a message. This aspect of the story is plain sickening and it's one of the main reasons why ""Sleepaway Camp"" sort of stayed with me over the years and I find it so revolting. First of all, we have Aunt Martha (played by Desiree Gould), a woman who forces a young boy, who has recently lost his family, to change gender, just because... she already has a boy in the family and doesn't want another one! That's right, my friends, crazy Aunt Martha didn't hesitate to ruin a child's life, just because she thought it would be fun to have a girl in the family (perfectly normal, huh?). 
Then, we have Artie, the cook... ugh, this is perhaps one of the most disgusting supporting characters I have seen in a horror flick. Artie is a perverted man, presumably in his thirties, who lusts after kids and who doesn't even bother hiding his sickening proclivities among his peers. As a matter of fact, as soon as the kids arrive to the campsite, god-awful Artie reveals how he wants to get his hands on the poor and helpless kids and, when one of his co-workers try to talk some sense into him, by explaining him that the kids are too young to even understand about sex, Artie claims that “There is no such thing as being too young"". As if this wasn't disgusting enough, this revelation doesn't cause any outrage among the other adults who work at the campsite, who, as a matter of fact, laugh at what Artie says. As it is foreshadowed by Artie himself, he later tries to take advantage of our poor innocent Angela and when he is caught in the act before anything happens, he threatens Ricky. Of course, none of this would have been possible if it wasn't for the complicity of his co-workers who remain silent and even find him humorous. 
Another character that is nominated in the category of ""Rotten adults who deserve to be eaten alive by pigeons"" is Mel (played by Mike Kellin), the owner of the campsite. Mel is a greedy old bastard who, even though he soon realizes that the kids are in danger because there's a killer on the lose, refuses to send them home, because he doesn't want to lose money. This results in the death of many more kids, obviously (bullies, yes, but they didn't deserve such a gruesome fate, that's for sure). Of course, Mel not only gets people killed as a result of his own greediness; he also beats up a teenage boy, simply because he assumes that he is behind all the killings. Oh, he also smokes cigars next to the kids (but it was the 80s, so that may not be entirely his fault). Last, but not least, we have Meg... okay, Meg appears to be around 18, so she doesn't qualify as an adult entirely, but she's, in fact, one of the camp counselors, who abuses her so-called power to bully our poor Angie (oh, and she also sleeps with Mel, the previously mentioned greedy old bastard... yikes!). 

So, yes, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a disturbing film, but the way I see it, Angela is one of the many elements that contribute to make it this way. In the end, one could argue that Angela is, to a certain extent, a victim as well (don't crap your pants, I'm not justifying her actions!).

Of course, this is a slasher from the 80s that was filmed with a very limited budget, so, even though the film mostly manages to stay on the ""serious"" side, the unintended hilarity finds a way to make an entrance. The campiness (no pun intended, but I love it, anyway) mostly comes from the over the top acting that, from time to time, feels more like a John Waters flick, rather than a serious horror flick. Besides this, some of the characters are so ridiculous and bizarre that, even during a serious and disturbing film, I found myself laughing. The scene where old Mel finds his teenage sweetheart's dead body is comedy gold... seriously, I dare you not to laugh at this ridiculous acting.

Over the last years, ""Sleepaway Camp"" has gotten some negative attention from certain people who accused the script of being trans-phobic, because it depicts an allegedly transgender individual as deranged, which is something that I strongly disagree with. First of all, Angela is not transsexual, because she is actually forced to live as a girl by her crazy aunt Martha, and it is not established that Peter ever showed signs of being a transgender child, so we could actually argue if Angela should be called Peter and treated as a male, instead. But, assuming for a second that Angela was, in fact, a male-to-female transgender individual, and her gender wasn't arbitrarily imposed by her aunt... why should we assume that her sexual condition had anything to do with the fact that she ended up being a deranged killer? Why can't we simply assume that she turns out to be a killer as a result of a very traumatic childhood and the fact that she was bullied during her entire life? 

Controversy aside, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a film that became a cult classic for valid reasons and gave us one of the most memorable endings. || ***Adolescents at a summer camp in upstate New York… with a killer on the loose***

On the surface “Sleepaway Camp” (1983) is a clone of the first two “Friday the 13th” movies (1980/1981) mixed with elements of “Meatballs” (1979), but with more edge. Like the first “Friday the 13th,” the killer is a mystery until the end. Like “Meatballs,” the youths at the camp are adolescents, including pubescents. Kids of this ilk didn’t manifest in the Friday the 13th franchise until Part VI (1986) and, even then, they weren’t the focus.

Unfortunately, the production values are subpar compared to the above films. If you take out the cussing and slayings, this is of the TV movie variety; and I’m being nice. There’s also some overt camp (no pun intended), like Ricky’s mother. 

Still, you can’t beat the early 80’s ambiance and the styles are amusing, especially the short shorts worn by guys. Unlike most of the “Friday” flicks or “The Burning” (1981), the killer doesn’t wear a mask; and “Sleepaway Camp” gets extra points for a shockingly perverse revelation at the climax. There are several other gems, like Judy’s full black mane (Karen Fields), Meg’s curious attraction to the older curmudgeonly camp owner and Paul DeAngelo’s impressive fitness & laughable shorts. 

The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes; and was shot in in Argyle, New York, near Summit Lake at a camp formerly named Camp Algonquin.

GRADE: B-/C+ || USA | November 18th, 1983 | ★★★½

Sleepaway Camp is an American independent horror movie from filmmaker, Robert Hiltzik. Who wrote, directed, and produced the film. It introduces a very young Felissa Rose as Angela Baker. Alongside local actors Jonathan Tiersten, Karen Fields, and Christopher Collet. We even have a rare appearance from Robert Earl Jones, brother to James Earl Jones. And this movie marked the final film role for Mike Kellin as he would die of lung cancer in August of ‘83. It was released to US theaters on November 18th, 1983 and became a surprise hit.

Angela Baker and her cousin Ricky attend summer camp at Camp Arawak. Ricky had been coming for a while, but this was Angela's first time. Needless to say, it doesn't go very well. The camp is full of creeps, assholes and jerk-bags. And someone is running around trying to kill them all! This really doesn't help things for young Angela who just wants to be left alone.

Today we are looking at an iconic horror movie, Sleepaway Camp. A film that definitely made a mark and has an ending scene that will be burned into your memory for years to come. It's quintessential, in that it captures the time in style and fashion. It encompasses that summer camp feeling better than a lot of the other flicks in the same setting. Hell, it captures camp better than most Friday the 13th movies that are set at Camp Crystal Lake. This isn't afraid to go places other films fear to tread. It explores all sorts of themes from gender-roles to child molestation, while simultaneously injecting some entertaining camp comedy. The characters are all exaggerations with long strokes of realism. The dialogue can be hokey at some points but realistic at others. The fighting and bickering between campers is great. I’ve always felt that kids cursing really hit a stride during the mid-seventies through the eighties. And the language in this movie is on another level. I am all on-board for it.

Sleepaway Camp is an original and well-crafted slasher. Everyone that dies is very unlikeable and deserves what they get. The pedophile cook was my favorite. He's a real piece of shit that gets his comeuppance in such a satisfying fashion. And it's true that the ending is a finale that you will never forget. Believe that. Sleepaway Camp isn't going to be for everyone. It's going to be highly offensive to just about any parent or puritan. However, it has a lot of great qualities that make the film stand out far ahead of the competition. It fits into horror marathons perfectly and is a usual fixture during Halloween parties. And if you like this movie already then I would suggest Wet Hot American Summer and Friday the 13th. Both are classics from two different genres. Both fit around this movie perfectly."

A little girl with awe-inspiring abilities is raised by her aunt, Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger), because her mother is a drug addict (Angela Bettis). The latter hooks up with a weird cult, led by the arrogant Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), who wants the child for dubious purposes.

Released in 2000, ""Bless the Child"" is a thriller/horror that comes across as an inverted ""The Omen"" with elements of ""End of Days."" It has the same plot as the contemporaneous ""The Calling,"" but is more sensical.

It's no low-budget production as it cost $40 million to make and was directed by Chuck Russell, who's known for a few fairly significant movies, like ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors,"" the remake of ""The Blob"" and 1994's highly successful ""The Mask."" Despite this, ""Bless the Child"" comes across as a Lifetime movie with a higher budget, which explains the film's mediocre ratings.

While I understand this criticism I was able to enter into the world of the characters and enjoy the movie. It's not technically as good as ""The Omen"" (and some would say that it's sacrilege to even compare them), but I personally prefer ""Bless the Child"" simply because I like the story, characters and themes better, despite the film's limitations.

Concerning the cast, Kim Basinger was past her physical prime, but she still looks good and she's a likable and compassionate protagonist. Jimmy Smits co-stars as the detective on the case and he's effective, as always. Petite Christina Ricci shines in a small role as a runaway who tries to help Maggie. They're all good, but it's Rufus Sewell who's most memorable as the leader of a cult that mixes elements of LaVeyian Satanism with Sciencefictionology.

The CGI is a mixed bag, some of the effects are pretty good while some are just serviceable, but you have to consider the age of the movie. Regardless, special effects are just icing on the cake; it's the story and characters that count and this is where ""Bless the Child"" is solid—nothing great or exceptionally good, but solid.

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in Toronto, Burlington and Sarnia, Ontario with 2nd unit shots of the Big Apple.

A child psychologist who’s adept with an innovative procedure (Jennifer Lopez) agrees to help FBI agents (Vince Vaughn and Jake Weber) by entering the mind of a comatose serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) in order to find clues to where his latest kidnap victim is held captive. Will they find her in time? 

""The Cell"" (2000) is a psychological crime drama/thriller that combines “The Silence of the Lambs” (1991) with “The Matrix” (1999) and the style of Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dracula” (1992); meanwhile the sordid elements recall “The General’s Daughter” (1999). Although the plot seems convoluted, the film is actually easy to follow and it’s a veritable feast for the eyes. 

The best ‘feast’ is Jennifer in her prime. Also on the female front is Catherine Sutherland as one of the victims. The only thing that takes down my rating is the early scene showing how the sick phukk gets his jollies with female corpses. Who wants to see that? How about just hinting at it or describing it verbally?

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot mostly in Southern Cal, e.g. San Diego (neurosciences facility), Los Angeles (hospital), Bakersfield (the silos), Taft & Pomona; as well as the Namib Desert (mind scenes with the boy).

This time he teams up again with ""Ed"" (George Kennedy) and ""Nordberg"" (OJ Simpson) to try to thwart the ambitions of big business in the energy sector. To protect their control over domestic power consumption, these moguls arrange for the kidnapping of a scientist - ""Dr. Mainheimer"" (Richard Griffiths). He is about to publish a far reaching report extolling the viability of solar power as a cheap and available source of electricity for everyone. Things is, though, it's not just a simple kidnap - they plan to substitute this learned man with a fraud who will ensure they retain their monopolies for years to come. Can the ""Police Squad"" get their act together in time...? It all gets a little more precarious when we discover that ""Jane"" (Priscilla Presley) is the assistant to the professor - and renewing his association with her after a while sets Drebin into many a comedy tailspin. As with the first film, the humour is quick-fire, contemporary and often more Laurel & Hardy than, well, Laurel & Hardy. Griffiths was a good comedy actor, his facial expressions and his sheer size were attributes he new well how to exploit to elicit a laugh. There is loads of on screen chemistry too to enjoy here, and it's not even ninety minutes so there's not enough time to get bored by the rather formulaic plot. That last point is what drags it down. It is difficult to reinvent the wheel, and to be honest very little effort appears to have gone into making this sufficiently different from the first outing. It's just too similar, with too many punchlines you can see from space. Still, it does what it says on the tin - and it does raise a smile - just not a guffaw. || **A sequel that closely follows the initial film, although it may not be as strong.**

After a predictable success with the first film, the sequel was already predictable and the public flocked to see a new dose of madness, with Leslie Nielsen in great form. When watching this film forty years after its commercial debut, it is not difficult to recognize some merit: the film has aged very well and continues to be entertaining today.

I recognize that the style of humor in this film will not be to everyone's liking, as it is solidly based on “slapstick” and double meanings with a strong sexual connotation, however it is frankly more elegant and intelligent than many modern comedies of our day. The dialogues are quite idiotic, to be nice, but that also has its joke. Leslie Nielsen is the big star, and much of the film's quality is based on her participation and the inspired way in which she interprets her clumsy character. In fact, the rest of the cast doesn't interest us at all: they are there because they simply have to be. Okay, we can consider that Priscilla Presley took some extra care in the way she acted and has good enough material for the actress to work on her character successfully. Richard Griffiths also deserves positive marks, being another exceptional addition to a fairly bland supporting cast.

The film's weakest point turns out to be the script: the story, created to support the film and serve as a skeleton for the avalanche of jokes created for it, is so weak that it is almost unnoticeable. After the first half of the film, I found it very difficult to remember why it all started. I really felt like the story didn't count, just the jokes and funny dialogues. This is a problem, compared to the first film, where the story told, however insane it was, was stronger and better written. The film also has good production values, including the sets, costumes and visual, special and makeup effects. || Not as good as the first time, but <em>'The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear'</em> still delivers entertainment.

Leslie Nielsen remains brilliant as Lieutenant Frank Drebin, such a fun character to see him play. George Kennedy and Priscilla Presley do well, while Richard Griffiths and, slightly less so, Robert Goulet are positive newcomers. I will say that I don't think the comedy is as strong in this one, the gags in particular seem a little more in your face with additional winks and nudges.

The dialogue is pithy and entertaining - if at times a little puerile, and both Nielsen and Presley have great timing as this calamitous series of scenarios build to a suitably daft conclusion with an on-form Montalban. Along the way the score and the script manage to parody quite a few other films and that raises a smile too. At times, the humour is a little close to the politically correct bone - smutty, even - so I doubt very much it would ever be made nowadays - but, of it's time, it's actually quite enjoyable. || **Another interesting comedy with Leslie Nielsen.**

This film is one of those comedies that established the humor of Leslie Nielsen, an actor who would become one of the most relevant in North American comedy in the 80s and 90s. His comic vein may not be to everyone's liking, with the quick succession of jokes and the very recurrent choice of nonsense or “slapstick” humor. However, we have to accept the fact that the film works and achieves the intended effect: to entertain us.

The script is overall very weak and focuses on the threat to the life of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who is traveling to the USA on an official visit. It was strange to see the queen go to a baseball match, which the real monarch would never have done because it is not an activity that serves the interests of international diplomacy. It's nonsense at work. Even stranger was seeing an authentic “axis of evil” (which included at the same table the African dictators Idi Amin and Muhammar Gaddafi, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the fanatical Iranian theocrat Ayatollah Khomeini and Mr. Gorbachev, last head of the Soviet Union) decide that the most appropriate way to teach Americans a lesson was to kill the British queen. On the other hand, this round table says a lot about what was thought of each of these international leaders at this time, included in a comprehensive group of “terrorists” without any reflection on it.

In the midst of all this succession of insanity and idiocy, it is really Nielsem who stands out and deserves applause for, once again, securing a solid leading role and asserting himself as a master in this style of comedy, someone who manages, in some mysterious way, make it less vulgar and cheap. Of course, most of the jokes are weak or tire us out due to non-stop sexual allusions. However, the actor manages to overcome this and show value."

Mankiewicz,"operation, spain, widow, hunger, lie, turtle, post, dysfunctional family, mental institution, memory, hospital, psychiatrist, doctor patient relationship, lobotomy, brain surgery, gay theme","Talk is never cheap when sourced from Tennessee Williams.

Millionairess, Violet Venable is obsessed with her now dead son, Sebastian. Sebastian met his untimely end whilst on vacation with his cousin Catharine, an end that has sent Catharine almost to the edge of insanity. Violet, very concerned about Catharine and her hurtful ramblings, enlists brain surgeon Dr. Cukrowicz to see if he will perform a lobotomy on the poor girl, but as Cukrowicz digs deeper, motives and facts come crashing together to reveal something far more worrying.

As one expects from a Tennessee Williams adaptation, this picture is very talky, perhaps borderline annoyingly so? Yet it has to be said that for those willing to invest the time with it, the pay off is well worth the wait. Suddenly Last Summer is an odd mix of campy melodrama and Gothic horror leanings, a mix that personally doesn't quite hit all the intended spots. It could have been so different, though, for if Gore Vidal and Joseph Mankiewicz had been given free rein back in this day of code restrictions, well the picture would surely have been close to masterpiece status. This adaptation only gives us little snippets on which to feed, we are aware of the homosexuality of the departed Sebastian, and other hints that come our way include incest, sadism and dubious class issues, but ultimately such strong material is never fully formed.

Elizabeth Taylor owns the picture as Catharine, sultry with heaving bosom, she does an excellent line in borderline nut case, all woe is me martyrdom and her final scenes are what pays the viewer off for their patience. Katharine Hepburn plays Violet and manages to chew the scenery and spit it out, it's an elegant performance but you really want more than we actually get! Montgomery Clift is the good doctor, not one of his better performances because he isn't asked to expand the character, just say his lines right, look baleful from time to time and play off Taylor's lead, job done really.

It's a recommended film to a degree, certainly one that simmers with an almost oppressive feel, but if the film is one to revisit often? Well that's up for debate and dependent on the viewer's inclination towards dialogue driven films. 7/10 || Howard Hawks defined a good film as “three good scenes and no bad ones.” Suddenly, Last Summer has four very good scenes dominated by one of the two great great actresses who play the leads – or, in one instance, both.

These are long scenes but never boring, and we are at all times bolted to our seats, our eyes glued to the screen; Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor give different, even contrasting performances – the one as a crazy, rich, old lady who feigns sanity, the other as a traumatized yet sane young woman who is “classified as violent” –, but the result is in either case nothing short of magnetic : we can’t stop looking at Taylor, and we dare not look away from Hepburn (after all of her scenes had been shot, Hepburn reportedly spat in the faces of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz and producer Sam Spiegel).

We are drawn toward, and gravitate around, the two of them – not unlike the other characters (as few as one and as many as the rest of the main cast in any given scene), who are little more than bystanders, the actors who portray them VIP audience members fortunate enough to watch a pair of masters of the craft from up-close.

Actually, there is one other presence looming large over the proceedings – that of Sebastian Venable, Hepburn’s only son and Taylor’s cousin, whose implied homosexuality Hepburn hopes to cover up by having Taylor lobotomized by Montgomery Clift’s neurosurgeon.

As he died before the events of the film, Sebastian is oft-mentioned but never seen other than in glimpses while Taylor flashbacks to the titular last summer. This is not a bad scene, but a good scene with some bad in it; it’s not a full-on flashback with a voice-over narration as much as it is a monologue with visual aids that are unnecessary – for one thing, they are absent from Tennessee Williams’s stage play, and here they detract from the performance; the actress playing the role, whoever it may be, should be able – and Liz most certainly was – to create the imagery with her own language, both verbal and facial.

Moreover, there are a couple of background details in the flashbacks that don’t make any sense; for example, a skeleton that becomes an old woman in the next shot – something like this is meant to be a part the character’s recollection of past events, but she herself takes no notice of it, and the people listening to her have no possible way of knowing it’s there at all; the question, then, is why, indeed, is it there? Is Mankiewicz trying to tell us something about her subconscious mind? (and if so, what exactly?). Or was he the one subconsciously – and, thank God, unsuccessfully – trying to sabotage the film? I know I wouldn’t put it past a Mankiewicz."
3110.0,Shane,"A weary gunfighter attempts to settle down with a homestead family, but a smouldering settler and rancher conflict forces him to act.",The greatest story of the West ever filmed!,"Drama, Western",118,1953-04-23,en,7.4,640,6.7987,"Alan Ladd, Jean Arthur, Van Heflin, Brandon De Wilde, Jack Palance",George Stevens,"friendship, showdown, based on novel or book, gun, harassment, settler, fistfight, little boy, gunfight, homesteader, intimidation, homestead, cattle ranch, gunfighter, cattleman, starting over, newcomer, adult child friendship, land rights","A man has to be what he is Joey, can't break the mould.

Shane is a weary gunslinger, one day he happens upon a homesteader family and begins to do chores for them, he finds an inner peace that he long thought was behind him. Sadly his peace is short lived because a strong arm cattle baron is determined to drive all the small farmer families off their land, and Shane finds himself drawn into the escalating conflict.

Taken from Jack Schaefer's popular novel, Shane holds up today as one of the most popular revered Westerns because it has mass appeal to the watching public. The main plot strand may be of a simple good versus evil type scenario, but it's the surrounding veins that enthuse the films heart with maximum results. The story plays out through the eyes of a young boy, Joey Starrett, he worships Shane for the guns he can sling, whilst simultaneously not recognising his own father for the honest hard working man that he is, this of course is not lost on the mother of the piece. The family axis then comes to the fore as Shane quickly becomes aware of his moral fortitude, and this gives us a fascinating inner picture to run alongside the outer evil cattle baron versus farmers story. Within this warm family environment Shane hopes to find redemption, but sometimes a man has to do what a mans got to do, and this leads us to the films crowning glory.

Alan Ladd is Shane, wonderfully attired and playing the character with just about the right blend of gusto and tenderness, perhaps dangerously close to stiffening up at times, Ladd however nails it and gives the Western genre one of its ever lasting icons. Van Heflin, Jean Arthu, and Brandon de Wilde play the Starrett family, all of whom come out with much credit, whilst Jack Palance leaves a lasting impression as the dark knight deadly hired gun, Wilson. Brutal yet sweet, and seeping positive morality into the bargain, Shane is a film for the whole family to enjoy, oozing fine work from all involved, it is a smashing and permanently engaging film. Sometimes when one revisits the film it feels like it is the prototype Western, all the genre characters are so vividly evident, but it's a testament to director George Stevens and his crew that Shane holds up to the iconic status it has garnered. Loyal Griggs won the best colour cinematography award at the 1953 Oscars, within three minutes of the opening credits he well and truly deserved it, as good an opening sequence as genre fans like me could wish for, and of course the rest of the fabulous Big Bear Lake location in California is sumptuously filmed.

Both as a technical piece of work and as a shrewd story of some standing, Shane deserves every bit of praise that has come its way over the years, oh yes!. 9/10 || I first watched this movie decades ago, probably when I was I’m my teens, and possibly when I was spending some summer vacation time with my grandparents, who seemingly were always watching western shows. I read my first Zane Grey western, Riders of the Purple Sage, in that old house.

I am not a student of film history, but I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that this 50s era movie came to be a template of sorts for westerns. Our hero is by no means an anti-hero like Eastward’s Man with No Name, but he does plays things close to the vest early on in his attempt to leave his past behind.

The plot is basic and rather predictable, but if it was an trendsetter as I just alluded, then maybe it set some of the western movie cliches that emerge. It is quite watchable and well-made, though perhaps not quite on the same level in my mind as a film like High Noon, which steadily builds up suspense through the townspeople refusing to help the hero, while this film doesn’t aim for suspense as much as it relies upon action: elaborate fistfights and gunplay. (Though it has tension only we viewers are aware of with its implied romantic extra-marital tension."

Are you seeing that right? 10 out of 10 stars?

Yeah, this movie isn't any good...technically it's horrible, some of the acting his horrible, the plot really stinks, there is a lot that really sucks about this movie...

BUT, it entertains. And my policy here is that so long as I can be entertained by a movie, it accomplished its goal.

In 2018 retrospect, it's great because there are no politics behind the ""girl"" part of the title. It doesn't tell you ""like this or you are a Nazi,"" but it was 1984 so...it's really not going to tell you that.

And Helen Slater usually seems a little flat. She has rare instances where she actually shines, but she wouldn't be my first choice for a superhero.

However, that being said, she DOES pull of ""heroic"" very well, so as flat as she may be, she did do a good job at being imposing when she needed to be and that helps you suspend your disbelief enough to actually get into the film.

And it's hard to get into. There is enough low budget cheese to be a kick. There is enough just awfulness to enjoy the film for what it was. And that is never a bad thing. It can make for fun entertainment even if it makes for a bad film.

Really what this film suffers from is an overdose of the early 80s. And really what makes this movie so much fun is an overdose of the the early 80s.

You get a Footloose, Karate Kid feel for everything about the film. Too early to be totally Regan Era but not to early to be seriously Middle-America meets emerging New Wave culture and it makes for a great clash. It makes for entertainment, even if it is bad entertainment.

So, you won't think this is a great film. But it will entertain you. It's worth watching, but not if you have to pay for it, that is not unless you get a wave of nostalgia wash over you. || <em>'Supergirl'</em> is a second straight dud from this franchise, though I'd honestly say it's ever so slightly more interesting than the preceding <em>'Superman III'</em>; it at least tries to tell a coherant story around its main character, which can't exactly be said for the aforementioned.

Helen Slater is decent as Supergirl, any complaints with the character lie with how she is written rather than how she is portrayed by Slater. The best part of this movie, for me, is actually Faye Dunaway. Selena isn't necessarily a plus, though I think Dunaway's performance held potential.

Peter O'Toole has a small part to play, nice to have an actor like him involved - on a similar note, it's a shame Christopher Reeve turned down a cameo, not that you could blame him of course. All in all, this is a disappointing movie. A shorter run time might've helped, fwiw."

This opens up a whole can of worms that not only brings the Toros into conflict with the Clovers, but also means that they must come up with an original routine if they are to win the American championship honestly.

Spirited picture about cheer leading? Well yes it is, it's witty, smart and ever so amiable. Tho the film loses some of its sharpness in the final quarter (a brave ending would have made all the difference), Bring It On clearly touches on race and class issues whilst bringing to the fore the competitiveness of cheerleader teams. The usual formula's of bitching and back stabbing are naturally in here, and of course no film of this type would be complete without some strand of treacle plot love, but the mix is fine and the exuberance of the routines is hugely enjoyable cinema. Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union and Jesse Bradford fill out the cast and all offer something in the way of watch ability.

It could have been so much better for sure, but Bring It On is very entertaining film about a subject that until this picture came out (subsequent sequels would follow) was hardly tackled with this sort of vigour and intelligence before. 7/10 || I only watched this movie cause I have a crush on Eliza Dushku.

If “Highlander 2” was a complete disgrace and “Highlander 3” somehow tried to give us some compensation, this movie makes it look worse and more worn out. However, a TV series had been made that had little or nothing to do with the original film. What this movie came to try to do is to bring together the best of both worlds, but it failed completely.

The problems start at the bottom, that is, in the miserably written script and without ideas that can truly be considered good or intelligent. At no time did I feel that the story of this film was interesting or captivating enough to justify the effort of seeing it. From the development it makes, we must assume that the action takes place after what we saw in the original film, which doesn't make much sense if we remember that this film ends in the victory of Connor, the last and only Immortal. The film has lots of plot holes and moments where logic and coherence take a vacation and disappear. The dialogues are poor, poorly finished and annoying. Historical flashbacks don't always work.

The cast counts, for the last time, with the honorable participation of Christopher Lambert, now a mature actor. So mature it sounds dangerously old for the role he plays. Despite this, the actor does what he can with what little he has. Adrian Paul also doesn't let us down and gives a good performance, considering the filthy and regrettable quality of the material written for this film. Bruce Payne sounds histrionic and unconvincing, but he does what he has to do. The rest of the actors don't really have anything really good worth mentioning in detail.

Victim of a very low budget, the film appears for what it is: a very cheap and undercooked production, which tastes bad and looks even worse than it tastes. An excuse for an action movie with swords and frantic duels amid a series of abandoned or deserted industrial sites. The cinematography, sets and costumes are what we would expect to find, but the visual effects and CGI are poor, amateurish and really inexcusable in a 2000s full-length film. It's a disgraceful film."

""Nurse Betty"" (2000) is part dramedy, part road movie, part crime drama, part romcom and part black comedy. While it's rarely laugh-out loud, it's pretty consistently amusing. What throws it off is that it's such an eccentric mixture viewers don't know how to take it, especially with a fairly radical scalping sequence (and I don't mean scalping tickets). It helps, though, when you grasp that the movie's about Betty and Charlie and their romantic idealism of people they've never met.

At the end of the day this is an offbeat Tarantino-esque flick that's half-good and half-meh. The ""meh"" reaction is mostly due to its curiosities. Thankfully, it has depth and plays better on repeat viewings.

The movie runs about one hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles; Durango, Colorado; Grand Canyon, Arizona; and Rome, Italy (closing scene).

Two low-life criminals (Ryan Phillippe & Benicio Del Toro) kidnap a pregnant surrogate (Juliette Lewis) of a rich couple who, unknowingly, has ties to the mob.

""The Way of the Gun"" (2000) is an offbeat flick in the tradition of ""Pulp Fiction"" written & directed by a proven screenwriter and featuring a quality cast, which includes James Caan. It's touted as a ""modern Western"" with two protagonists patterned after Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (their names in the film are the last names of Butch & Sundance).

It starts out as a black comedy with cussing every other word, but then morphs into a serious crime drama with flashes of gunplay. The score is notable.

Two issues hinder the film: (1) A plot that becomes convoluted and therefore increasingly unbelievable, and (2) unlikable characters, except for maybe the surrogate. Concerning the second issue, I understand the concept of antiheroes, but even antiheroes require some redeemable or universally human qualities to make the audience root for them or care about them. Wolverine and Clint Eastwood's Western characters, like Josey Wales, are good examples, as are the antiheroes in films like ""Runaway Train"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" two cinematic masterpieces.

These two points naturally create disinterest and tempt the viewer to tune out. The first time I watched it I gave up by the 90-minute mark with a half hour to go, I could care less about the characters, their story or how it turned out, even though I tried. 

On my second viewing, I decided to pay closer attention and stick with the movie till the end. I'm glad I did because this is a well-written examination of crime & violence and the fools involved. An attempt is made to flesh-out all the main characters and I'm talking no less than nine people, each of whom are a piece of the interlocking puzzle, often with their own agenda. 

While it's no where near great like the seminal ""Pulp Fiction,"" it has style and glimmerings of depth. If you can get past the convoluted story and unlikable characters, it certainly has its points of interest, like well-scripted dialogues and Del Toro's towering performance, not to mention Taye Diggs's interesting heavy.

The film was shot in Utah in the Salt Lake City area.

For some reason, James Spader plays the former and Keanu Reeves the latter, when it’s obvious to anyone familiar with both actors’ careers that it should be the other way around.

Miscasting aside, Reeves sleepwalks through his role as if it were a contractual obligation – which it apparently was; if you believe his story, someone forged his signature on the contract. I’m going to go ahead and take that with a grain of salt; on the other hand, at least Reeves, unlike Spader, has an excuse, far-fetched though it may be.

Then again, it’s not like anyone involved in the making of this movie made an actual effort. Director Joe Charbanic and writers David Elliot and Clay Ayers adopt a lather-rinse-repeat approach toward the material. First thing in the morning, Reeves sends Spader a picture of a woman and gives him till nine o’clock that night to find her before he kills her. The following day they wake up and do it all over again.

The first time lacks suspense because it's too early in the game and we know Spader isn't going to catch Reeves so easily and quickly; moreover, the film is so formulaic and derivative (with shades of Reservoir Dogs and Blow-up, to name but a couple of examples) there is little hope of its throwing us a curve at any point.

786.0,Almost Famous,"In 1973, 15-year-old William Miller's unabashed love of music and aspiration to become a rock journalist lands him an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to interview and tour with the up-and-coming band, Stillwater.",Experience it. Enjoy it. Just don't fall for it.,"Drama, Music",124,2000-09-15,en,7.504,2886,4.1233,"Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, Patrick Fugit",Cameron Crowe,"hotel room, concert, rock 'n' roll, stewardess, drug addiction, san diego, california, overdose, groupie, music journalist, heavy metal, based on true story, swimming pool, coming of age, promiscuity, on the road, domineering mother, reconciliation, semi autobiographical, innocence lost, bus trip, aspiring writer, mischievous, cautionary, teenager, amused, celebratory, comforting, frustrated, cleveland, ohio","Hopes, Dreams & Nightmares.

Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's paean to rock music, of bands and songs, of journalism and promotion, of sex & drugs. Drawing from experience and stories passed on, Crowe tells the tale of a young teenage boy aspiring to be a music journalist in the 1970s. Finding himself backstage with the rock group Stillwater, William Miller (Patrick Fugit) embarks on a road journey with the band that's awash with egos, groupies, perils and pleasures, all of which change his life forever.

Lets go find something real!

The most striking thing about it is that it's not overtly funny or sensationalistic, it's a production that's full of love, real love, for the subject matters to hand, and it's very often a moving experience to be part of. Narratively speaking, Crowe takes his time, steadily building characters and backdrop essentials, it works a treat as we become immersed in all the major players within the music circle, while also feeling the concerns of those on the outside of the rock group circle. Which of course gives us the great rewards come the final third of film when all matters come to a head. Crowe and his design team also work some magic for period flavours, capturing the early 70s vibe with awareness of clothing, food and drink and transport. Nothing ever seems false, which is remarkable in this era of product placements and shameless plugging. 

50 bucks and a case of beer! 

Another one of Crowe's strengths is how he garners great performances from his actors. There's no big stars here, no Tom or Renée, but Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Kate Hudson and Fugit, who respond to their director with sincere and believable performances, no caricatures or ham sarnies here, no way. While outskirt performances from Frances McDormand (brilliant as William's fretful mother), Anna Paquin, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the legendary Lester Bangs) and Fairuza Balk, consistently hit the hi-hat. The music of course rocks, from metal and progers, to folkers and bubblegum, to some punk godfathery, these sounds feature on the soundtrack and kick the decade into orbit - while the Stillwater scenes are effective and the use of Elton John's Tiny Dancer will land in your heart and stay there.

Cameron Crowe has created a smashingly memorable film that will stand the tests of time. Two cuts are available, where both the theatrical and director's cuts are sure fire things (the latter Bootleg Cut my personal favourite). This is a music based film to sit with the best of them, God Bless Rock N Roll and God Bless Cameron Crowe, for he could have easily embellished and over egged his rock pudding, instead he kept it real. 9/10 || With the new 4K release, decided to watch the Director's Cut (Untitled) version for the first time having seen the theatrical version a couple of times over the years (last time was several years ago, however). Anyway, still a great movie even for someone who isn't exactly steeped into rock and roll music. Features a wonderful ensemble cast with solid performances all around (Hudson and Crudup were standouts) and the original music, alongside the classics, were great. **4.5/5** || _**Misadventures while touring America with an up-and-coming band in the early 70s**_

A 15 year-old aspiring rock journalist (Patrick Fugit) gets a gig by Rolling Stone to tour America with the rising group Stillwater in 1973. He develops a relationship with a winsome groupie of the band (Kate Hudson) while learning the group dynamics behind the music, such as the rivalry between the guitarist and lead singer (Billy Crudup and Jason Lee).
 
""Almost Famous"" (2000) was written/directed by Cameron Crowe, known for movies like “Jerry McGuire” (1996) and “Say Anything” (1989). It’s a behind-the-scenes rock-oriented flick in the mold of “The Rose” (1979), “Oh, God! You Devil” (1984), “Rock Star” (2001) and “The Perfect Age of Rock ‘n’ Roll” (2009).
 
The story is semi-biographical, inspired by Crowe’s experiences writing for Rolling Stone at 15 and touring with the Allman Brothers at 16. The amusing plane sequence was drawn from a real-life situation with The Who; and the guitarist of the band, Russell, is based on Glenn Frey of Eagles.

I had heard the critical gushing, but wasn’t sure if I was going to like it for much of the first half, yet it won me over with the second half. The aforementioned plane sequence is a highlight. For a more serious, darker take on similar material see the obscure “The Perfect Age of Rock ‘n’ Roll,” which I favor over this one.

The notable cast also includes Frances McDormand as the boy’s conservative mother, Zooey Deschanel as his sis and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a wise rock journalist. Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin and Bijou Phillips are also on hand as groupies. While Anna’s role is small, she stands out on the feminine front, along with star Kate.

The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in California, Arizona and Manhattan (Gramercy Park Hotel and Central Park).

This here was a pretty surprising entry. One of the things it does well is that it really features a lot of suspenseful work at times as this makes a hard time of determining if what's being seen is real or just being shot for the movie. It plays the movie-within-a-movie trick to nice effect, since it features enough to make hard to distinguish one from the other including it's wonderful opening sequence that takes a while before realizing after the fact it's been faked, a sequence where the assembled cast watch the dailies only for a strange cut-shot to play where one of the cast is viciously stalked and killed is screened where all but one thinking it to be shot for the film but the other positive that it's real and a later scene where a murder done during the recording of a scream-test loud enough to drown out the victim's own being great scenes. Even going away from that formula, there’s some rather fun stalking here from the bathroom chase featuring the woman trying to escape from the killer out into the alleyway or a thrilling chase through the recording studio and out into the surrounding countryside and pool while an attack at a carnival ride hidden by the darkness and fog comes off rather nice as well. The final confrontation in the movie-set graveyard setting is just fun, being creepy, exciting and all-around a blast with the true revelation and the different twists featured throughout make for a nice time here. The last big feature here is a really nice and healthy mix amongst the kills, which along with the mask worn are the film's rather good parts. This one here only has a few flaws to it. The main one here is that the main explanation for the killing has a lot of ways for how to interpret it, and it feels just too clumsy and unrealistic to be considered as believable. The fact that the violence is toned down from anything that it should have, since, for all the creativity displayed in the kills, it isn't very bloody and with a couple of kills that could've been in here. These are the same thing that really should've fixed by taking more of those and making them more bloody. It would've taken out a mild flaw in the film rather simply. The last flaw in here is the film's maddening ability to switch between the film shoot and the real world. It's fun at times, but there's also the fact that the film tries to be clever with changing around the two and it gets a little harder to defend the longer they go on. These here are the film's flaws.

Based on real events in 1971, where T.C. Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.

As is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.

That this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.

The cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Ethan Suplee, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood and a pre-fame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. While two important female family roles are nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" particularly potent and uplifting. 

Though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?), so hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10 || Denzel Washington leads the team on a charge until the final whistle in Remember the Titans, a grand and inspirational football film. This Walt Disney classic is a primitive display of adversity and courage. The amount of chemistry from the then-segregated gridiron warriors was remarkable and helped propel this film as a truly great and heartfelt sports movie for every generation to experience. 5/5 || OK, well, reading through the bad reviews there are some grudges here based on, well, how the other teams were depicted because 1971 wasn't long enough for some of the people that played them to pass on their mortal coils.

I can relate to that. I grew up countryfied and have tasted the salt of playing against a school that was three or four times our size, schools that could afford to cherry-pick who played. Schools where the defense could rest when the offense was on the field...apparently T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.

I can sympathize with some of the negative reviews here...because, honestly, if they made a movie like this about Woodstock, I'd give it 1 star out of principal. Seriously, no, we might be hicks, but we rotate from linebacker to offensive tackle. When you faced off against schools that had an actual student body, you knew you were going to lose, the only question was how hard were you going to make their victory. Sounds like T.C. Williams was one of those giant schools.

OK, rant done.

I caught this on TNT and the music drew me in right away. Hear a good song it catches your ear and drags you in.

And this has the acting to back it up. It's very... nice seeing Washington NOT playing the smart-cop role or a variation there of. He can act, he can act well, and this is one of the movies where he's not playing the same role over and over again. So, when he comes out of that shell and gets a gig playing a role he doesn't always play... it's kind of a treat isn't it?

Of course the highlight was really Hayden Panettiere, not because she was absolutely adorable in the film (which she was), but more because she did a great job of turning a little girl into that parent, on the sidelines, that thinks he's Ditka, so she was not only adorable but hysterical.

The Hippie, Ryan Gosling?, was another little gem, not because he did a particularly good job acting, though it was fair enough. No, he stood out because anyone that's payed football knew someone like him. It gave it a bit of an authentic feel.

The only real downside was that, by 1971, schools were integrated and been for a while. It kind of lost that authenticity when they went that route. But, you know what, who cares, it was entertaining enough despite that.

It was a solid football movie.

And for all the 1 star reviews, particularly those written by people from the smaller schools that had to go up against the Titans... I feel for you. I remember being in that situation and I'd be bitter too if the giant school had a movie made about them that suggested they were in anyway the under-dog."

The acting is nothing special, though I did like both Clare Higgins and Ashley Laurence, not to mention Doug Bradley in the role of “Lead Cenobite”, who would later be called Pinhead. Kind fascinating that character was accidentally propelled into being a horror icon as he was only a minor part of the film, though based on his design and overall look, not hard to see why he resonated with horror fans.

Hellraiser, written and directed by Clive Barker based on his novella, isn’t a favorite of mine, as mentioned I lean more toward the more reality based slasher (like Halloween and F13) than the supernatural variety, but still found this to be entertaining as a whole. **3.75/5**"

It is really nothing more than a tour through the diseased imagination of Clive Barker - it is hard to believe somebody out there actually thought this was a good basis for a film instead of seeking out some description of psychiatric treatment for the poor soul - and its major handicap is that the special effects just aren't up to the challenge of supporting his thoroughly twisted and uniquely original vision. There  is also a desperately heavy reliance on copious amounts of blood and gore just for the hell of it and when you add in the fact that sadly a good portion of it is also totally forgettable what you're left with is nothing more than a modest gore fest of desperately limited impact."

Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is produced and directed by Irwin Allen out of 20th Century Fox. The story was written by Irwin Allen and Charles Bennett and it stars Walter Pidgeon, Robert Sterling, Joan Fontaine, Barbara Eden, Michael Ansara, and Peter Lorre. The theme song was sung by Frankie Avalon, who also appears in the film. Winton Hoch is the cinematographer and the score is a joint collaboration by Paul Sawtell & Bert Shefter. It's a CinemaScope/De Luxe presentation.

Admiral Harriman Nelson (Pidgeon) is commander of his new, state of the art nuclear submarine, The Seaview, which is on diving trials in the Arctic Ocean. When the sub surfaces the crew find the sky is burning, it seems that a meteor shower had occurred and a piece has fractured the Van Allen Radiation Belt causing it to catch fire, the result of which is a world-threatening increase in heat all across the Earth. Nelson proposes to the U.N. to detonate a Polaris nuclear missile in the belt to hopefully send it on a reverse spin into outer space. However, his idea is shot down at the meeting and he decides to take matters into his own hands. Setting off for the calculated launching point in the Marianas Trench, the crew of The Seaview must tackle terrors of the deep, pursuing hostile submarines and severe in fighting as the crew start to come apart under pressure.

To those of us who were reared on pre Star Wars sci-fi it's hard to grasp the complaints of the modern audience about old time genre movies and the effects that reside within. Before George Lucas took sci-fi and cinema watching to a different level involving pacey action every other frame, explosions a plenty and money inspired effects: our tastes were happily catered for by solid stories, character development and the odd bit of inspired for its time effects. Enter Irwin Allen's ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" which boasts all those latter points mentioned.

That the film was turned into a television series that ran for 5 seasons (64-68) is arguably the biggest legacy. For at the time of its release the critics gave it a very mixed response, and yet the public made it a hit. Made for roughly $2 million it comfortably made $7 million at the box office to justify Allen's faith in the movie. Watching it now as an adult it has lost none of the charm it had for me as a child. Only differences now are that I can sensibly think about such things as the science involved, observe a cheeky pro-nuclear stance in the Cold War era, and of course admire the form of Barbara Eden in a way I wouldn't have done as a spotty faced kid!.

It's now also a film, thanks to the advent of home entertainment technology, that looks and sounds great. There's plenty of De Luxe colour eye candy visuals, some vintage effects and good quality underwater photography. The production design holds up well, while The Seaview itself, with its on board aquarium and unique eight-window bow view port, remains an indelible piece of sci-fi folklore. The acting isn't called on to be much, but they all deliver professional turns, while Avalon's title song is a catchy piece of harmony. All that and you also get Peter Lorre brooding and taking a shark for a walk!.

Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is directed by Charles Barton and written by Robert Lees, Frederic Rinaldo and John Grant. It stars Bud Abbott, Lou Costello, Lon Chaney Junior, Bela Lugosi, Glenn Strange, Lenore Aubert and Jane Randolph. Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Charles Van Enger.

It's well documented come 1948 that Abbott and Costello were becoming victims of changing times and filmic ideas. Coupled with the one time success of the Universal classic monster movies having seemingly had their day, someone at the merged Universal-International head office decided to pit the comic duo with the creature feature legends. Thus a film franchise was born and it helped reignite Bud and Lou's career.

Making the Universal monsters a viable theatre draw once again, this first teaming set a high standard that wasn't to be matched with the following ""meet the monsters"" series. It's a near hilarious spoof of the classic 1930s/40s horrors, where it finds Bud and Lou as hapless transport porters involved with the revival of Dracula and the Frankenstein monster. 

The usual comedy staples of the comedy duo are adhered to, which is nicely countered by the monsters themselves mostly playing it straight. With the added bonus of having Lugosi once again donning the Count Dracula cape, the nostalgic value for classic horror buffs is enormous. It's of course wonderfully energetic and daft, but still not a scene is wasted. 

With smart gags - both visually and orally - and a finale of great entertainment worth, this is very much a pic to embrace for a pick me up purpose. 8/10"

A medical and science crew board a submarine and are miniaturised and injected into an important foreign scientist's  body.

Also on a clock of one hour before they return to normal size, they have to also contend with the fact there may be a saboteur on board. This be a fantastical voyage indeed...

The crews voyage through the body's bloodstream and beyond is brought to life by the use of some splendidly inventive special effects, something which marks Fantastic Voyage out as one of the more visually appealing genre pictures of the time (winning Oscars for Best Colour Art Direction and for Best Visual Effects).

Based on the novel written by Otto Klement and Jay Lewis Bixby, the story is both imaginative and totally fascinating from a biology viewpoint, which is something that helps offsets the somewhat staid performances from the cast. However, are we really watching this for thespian delights? No of course not. We want director Richard Fleischer to take us on a perilous journey through the human body, and maybe just give us some suspense into the bargain. That is achieved wholesale, and while the the ending is a little too rushed for comfort, this remains a silly but wonderful filmic experience. 7.5/10 || I remember I really liked this movie when I was a teenager, along with the novel by Isaac Asimov that was based on the screenplay. (I never read the original story they based the screenplay on.) It was adventurous fun. I don’t recall if I was titillated by the presence on the cast of Raquel Welch, though they showed great restraint in having her covered up most of the time by the special submarine suit.

I wasn’t as impressed or entertained watching it this time around. I thought there were a couple of plot holes and, needless to say, the special effects weren’t up to the standards we are used to after all these years. But I would still recommend it if you are interested in early science fiction films or if you are watching with children, for it is certainly suitable for all audiences."

The movie plays on the fear of the unknown creature. Deep in the Amazon Rainforest, there might be some kind of ancient, half-fish-half-man horror that sets out to kill all humans who come into its territory. Maybe it even wants to steal away the women to continue living. That's a scary thought, in and of itself.

When you add that to the movie's best quality, the score, it makes for some truly chilling, truly tense scenes. The whole film is well done, especially for 1954. The set design is fully believable, and the acting is solid all around. Julie Adams specifically does a great job. Even gill-man's costume was relatively well done, especially for the time. || We didn't come here to fight monsters, we're not equipped for it.

Out of Universal Pictures, Creature from the Black Lagoon is directed by Jack Arnold, and stars Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, and Whit Bissell. The eponymous creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning for the underwater scenes. The cinematography is by William E. Snyder and the score is composed by a trio of men, Henry Mancini, Hans J. Salter & Herman Stein. The story sees a scientific expedition at the top end of the Amazon encounter a Devonian Period amphibious creature. As the creature starts to defend its turf by attacking members of the expedition, in fighting begins to take a hold as the men argue about the best course of action to take. Should it be killed, or should it be captured for scientific research? Either way they need to act fast as the creature has taken a fancy to Kay, the sole female member of the expedition group.

One of the better creature features that surfaced in the 1950s, Creature from the Black Lagoon was one of the film's made as part of the 3D craze that filtered out of Hollywood in 53 & 54. However, unlike many of those film's that were made in the format over those two years, this one has rightly managed to break away from its gimmicky beginnings to become regarded as a genre classic. There are many reasons why it is still well regarded and taken in appreciatively by newcomers.

The story of course is nothing new, the old ""beauty & the beast"" theme can be traced back to the daddy himself, ""King Kong"". But much like Kong, Arnold's movie thrives within the endearing story by getting the audience to sympathise with the titular creature. He is after all only defending his territory, he was happy wallowing down in the depths, remaining undiscovered for many a moon. That he is fascinated by the considerable beauty of Kay Lawrence (Adams sexy and gorgeous), is no crime either. The amount of sympathy garnered for ""Gill-Man"" is helped enormously by the illogical actions of the humans; who in turn go diving and swimming where legend has it men get eaten! This coupled with their bickering about pro science or trophy hunting makes it easy to side with the amphibious one.

It also helps that the film is pretty brisk and only runs for 80 minutes, there's no sags or pointless filler. Too many similar film's of its ilk labour until the monster shows up and all hell then breaks loose. But under Arnold's (It Came From Outer Space/The Incredible Shrinking Man) astute direction, atmosphere and unease is built up by ominous talk and sightings of the Black Lagoon-and only initial glimpses of the creature's scaly webbed claw; accompanied by the attention grabbing theme music. And when the creature finally reveals itself it doesn't disappoint for its an impressive creation. A half-man/half-fish creature covered in scales, resplendent with gills and with cold, dark featureless eyes. It also has great characteristics with a distinctive swimming style in the water, and a lumbering Frankenstein thing going on when on the land. A definitive monster that would be merchandised for ever after.

There's also technical accomplishments away from the creature itself, notably with the memorable underwater photography by Snyder, who uses a portable camera to flow with the swimming sequences, while his shadow and light work down in the depths is memorably mood enhancing. The three tiered score is also one of the best to feature in a ""B"" movie schlocker, three different composers, three different emotional strands; nice. Then there's of course the definitive sequence, the sexy underwater flirting as ""Gill-Man"" swims below the shapely form of Kay, beguiled by her, it's love at first sight. He's not the only one beguiled, we all are, as was Steven Spileberg, who would homage the more dramatic part of the sequence in his opening for Jaws 21 years later. Whilst last but not least it should be mentioned that there are little asides to ecological issues in the piece, something Arnold was want to do. Two sequels would follow, Arnold would return for ""Revenge Of The Creature"" in 1955 and then the John Sherwood directed ""The Creature Walks Among Us"" would round off the trilogy in 1956.

It's the original that still holds up today. 8/10 || <em>'Creature from the Black Lagoon'</em> is an entertaining flick from 1954.

For a film made so long ago, it really does age nicely. Sure some of the ways used to bring the creature to life look a little dorky in patches, but for the most part I felt the required creepiness - especially via the creature's face. It has the feel of a very well made production, which is little surprise given it's a Universal production of course. I also like how it has a sense of knowledge to it, who knows if it all adds up but it sounds the part at least.

I enjoyed the cast, they all work well together onscreen. Richard Carlson, Julie Adams and Richard Denning are naturally the standouts, though I also found Nestor Paiva to be decent. Interesting to note that two people played the Gillman, with Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning underwater.

The start of a trilogy, I'm keen to check out the two sequels."

There's a snow storm blowing ferociously, a man trundles towards a signpost that reads Iping. He enters a hostelry called The Lions Head, the patrons of the bar fall silent for the man is bound in bandages. He tells, not asks, the landlady; ""I want a room with a fire"". This man is Dr. Jack Griffin, soon to wreak havoc and be known as The Invisible Man.

One of the leading lights of the Universal Monster collection of films that terrified and enthralled audiences back in the day. Directed by genre master James Whale, The Invisible Man is a slick fusion of dark humour, berserker science and genuine evil. Quite a feat for a film released in 1933, even more so when one samples the effects used in the piece. Effects that are still today holding up so well they put to shame some of the toy like expensive tricks used by the modern wave of film makers. John P. Fulton take a bow sir.

After Boris Karloff had turned down the chance to play the good doctor gone crazy, on account of the role calling for voice work throughout the film only, except a snippet at the finale, so Whale turned to Claude Rains. Small in stature but silky in voice, Rains clearly sensed an opportunity to launch himself into Hollywood. It may well be, with Whale's expert guidance of course, that he owes his whole career to that 30 second appearance of his face at the end of the film? As was his want, Whale filled out the support cast with odd ball eccentrics that are acted adroitly by the British & Irish thespians. Una O'Connor, Forrester Harvey, Edward E. Clive and Henry Travers are memorable. While American Gloria Stuart as the power insane Griffin's love interest is radiant with what little she has to do. 

Based on the now famous story written by H.G. Wells, Whale and R. C. Sheriff's (writer) version remains the definitive Invisible Man adaptation. There's some changes such as the time it is set, and Griffin is not the lunatic he is in the film, which is something that Wells was not too pleased about in spite of liking the film as a whole, but it's still very tight to the source. Sequels, TV series and other modern day adaptations would follow it, but none are as shrewd or as chilling as Whale's daddy is. 9/10 || We all know that necessity is the mother of invention, but there is another saying in Spanish that roughly translates to ‘sloth/laziness is the mother of all vices’ (the closest English equivalent I can think of is ‘idle hands are the devil’s playground’). I would say that the link between invention and laziness is largely computer-generated; that’s why a near-100 year-old movie such as The Invisible Man looks better than any modern CGI extravaganza, and it does so because it’s all there – even when it isn’t.

Jorge Luis Borges once wrote about all the trouble that H.G. Wells’s Invisible Man has to go to (wigs, dark glasses, fake noses and beards, etc.) so that people can’t see that they can’t see him. Director James Whale went to similar great lengths to make sure we can see that there is someone we can’t see, and the sheer mechanical ingenuity devoted to making the titular character a tangible physical presence reminds me of the biblical admonition that “ye shall know them by their fruits”; Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains) certainly puts the phrase ‘conspicuous by his absence’ in an entirely different perspective.

The flawlessness of the whole enterprise is made even more impressive when we consider that it was achieved with wires that had to be kept out of the shot because the technology to digitally delete them obviously didn’t exist yet. Other optical effects, involving the Invisible Man himself as opposed to his interactions with other people and objects, are less convincing, and at the same time aren’t – that is to say, any less convincing than today’s green screens, motion capture, and other assorted VFX.

The other major factor that sells the film is Rains’s performance. He evidently can’t emote (we only see his face until the very last shot, and even then in the stillness of death), but he more than makes up for that, first with body language – a category wherein I feel compelled to include the sight of Griffin’s (as Borges might say) autonomous pants skipping down a country road –, and later with his disembodied voice, which he contorts to fully convey the extent of the character’s madness. || **_Becoming invisible and… mad_**

A wandering chemist in a snowstorm makes it to the town of Iping in southern England where he seeks to finish important tests in his room at an Inn, but the rural people find him too curious to ignore and soon discover that he’s… invisible! 

“The Invisible Man” (1933) was based HG Wells’ 1897 novel, just moving the events to the early 1930s. It surprisingly holds up for succinct cinematic entertainment. The first half is more interesting than the second, however, as the latter focuses on how the authorities can apprehend the unseen criminal.

It led to four sequels between 1940-1944 and an Abbott and Costello flick in 1951, as well as a financially successful remake in 2020.

It runs 1 hour, 11 minutes, and was shot at Universal Studios, which is just west of the Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles.

The original script was written as a parody, but that was changed when production began and it was shot as a serious slasher. Perhaps this explains why I busted out laughing on at least four occasions. The amusing pizza-eating scene and the refrigerator sequence are good examples. Despite this, “The Slumber Party Massacre” (1981) IS a serious slasher flick featuring the ‘driller killer’ and it’s pretty well-done. The problem is, there’s an unimaginative bluntness to the proceedings and the final act isn’t all that compelling (I found my mind wandering a couple of times).

The female cast is decent, but not quite as good as in the Friday the 13th movies. Diane (Gina Smika Hunter, aka Gina Mari) is arguably the best, followed by the black chick.      

The movie is short & sweet at 77 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles with the neighborhood sequences filmed in Venice.

Courtney (Crystal Bernard) is a survivor of the first film and is now in an all-girl rock band in high school in Los Angeles. On a weekend getaway, they venture to a condo outside of town to practice & party with a few invited guys. Unfortunately Courtney is haunted by the past, suffering post-traumatic neurosis marked by a rockabilly driller killer in her nightmares.

“Slumber Party Massacre II” (1987) improves upon the unimaginative bluntness of the first film (1982) with a superior cast of females, highlighted by winsome Bernard and blonde Heidi Kozak as Sally. Juliette Cummins is also on hand as redhead Sheila, who previously appeared in “Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning” (1985) and “Psycho III” (1986).

The film clicks with kinetic mojo and is almost ingenious in the way it dares to sneer at horror conventions for the first two-thirds. Instead, it focuses on establishing the quality characters, the fun antics of their outing and Courtney’s bloody nightmares, the latter of which borrows from “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984). 

Like “Friday the 13th Part V,” the movie emphasizes the lingering negative aftereffects of an episode with a mad killer. The driller killer from Courtney’s nightmares is curiously part rockabilly greaser and part mid-80’s metal maniac; naturally a little reminiscent of the rock star killer from “Trick or Treat” (1986), Sammi Curr, but less dead serious and more comical.

I suppose some of the editing in the suspenseful last act could be chalked up to amateurish filmmaking (e.g. when the girl falls from the ledge), but perhaps it better reflects what’s really happening. I’d say more but I don’t want to give away spoilers. Let’s just say 2 + 2 = 4. This original element was borrowed by later flicks.

""Slumber Party Massacre III"" (1990) starts out promising, but becomes routine by the midpoint and never recovers, which isn’t helped by increasing tastelessness. While it’s arguably on par with the first film from 1981 (which I slightly prefer), it lacks the impressive creativity of 1987’s part II, which had pizzazz. A marginally more effective slasher with the same plot is the contemporaneous ""Sorority House Massacre II.”

Protagonist Keely Christian (Jackie) stands out in the female cast and looks sublime on the beach, followed by Lulu Wilson (Juliette). Meanwhile winsome Devon Jenkin is featured in a small part as Sarah.

“Sorority House Massacre” (1986) combines the plot of ""Halloween"" (psycho killer escapes asylum and goes after his little sister) with the sorority house setting of ""The House on Sorority Row"" (1983) and ""Black Christmas” (1974). But the production values are subpar by comparison, sparking some to call it the worst 80's slasher film. 

It’s true that the movie starts shaky with filmmaking akin to an old soap opera, but it builds some suspense in the second half. And there are a few gems, like when Beth's sorta-date (the short, dark-haired guy) says, ""I just like being with you."" This shows that the writer actually put in some effort despite the Grade B (or Grade C) production values. The fact that there’s no camp and everything plays out deadly seriously is a plus.

""Sorority House Massacre II"" (1990) is less amateurish compared to the first film and adds camp & sexploitation, but only in the sense of female attractiveness and tame nudity, not sex. Speaking of which, this flick is a celebration of the beauty of women masquerading as a slasher.

Some might argue that it degrades women, and I can understand this perspective since some of the protagonists die in the typical slasher manner, but the movie is stressing that they have to rise to the challenge in a life-or-death situation if they want to survive, which smacks of the proverbial girl power.

While the story is overly one-note to be very compelling everything builds to an effective last act. It’s an entertaining spooky ‘B’ flick for Halloween that walks the balance beam between too serious and too goofy.

The director is the prolific Jim Wynorski, a student of Roger Corman known for myriad ‘B’ flicks of varied genres, some surprisingly good (“Gargoyle” from 2004), some bad (“Camel Spiders”) and some amusing schlock (“The Hills Have Thighs”).

The effective no-name female cast features: Gail Harris (Linda), Stacia Zhivago (Kimberly), Barbii (Suzanne), Bridget Carney (Candy), Savannah aka Shannon Wilsey (Satana), Dana Bentley (Janey), 
Melissa Moore (Jessica) and Toni Naples aka Karen Chorak (Sgt. Shawlee). Needless to say, if softcore female nudity offends you, I suggest skipping this.

The film runs 1 hour, 17 minutes, and was shot in Venice, Los Angeles (interiors of house) and
2200 S Harvard Blvd, Los Angeles (exteriors).

GRADE: B-/C+ || Which one was this? I can't really remember. I do, however, know it was the movie where they hire a lot of women and require them all to take their clothes off.

I recall a shower scene in there somewhere.

And then I remember the women running around screaming in undies that are really only worn in the bedroom.

Was there a plot? Not really, it was just an excuse for nudity and undies.

But, you already knew all of that when you sat down to watch this. Because, honestly in film making, they aren't really trying to pass it off as anything other than an excuse to film young naked breasts and you don't really get anything but that.

So, why are you reading this? You know exactly what this movie is about. You knew that before you even clicked on this review.

But, at least the review is as honest as the movie.

If you are expecting more than that, there is something seriously wrong with you."

A male nurse from Chicago (Ben Stiller) wants to pop the question to his girlfriend (Teri Polo), but first has to visit Long Island and meet the parents (Robert De Niro & Blythe Danner).

“Meet the Parents” (2001) is a good romantic comedy with Stiller effective as the every-man in a challenging mundane situation that most guys can relate to. The first half involves droll humor as Greg awkwardly meets his potential parents-in-law and suspects that the father doesn’t like him. Yet this is just a set-up for the wild mishaps of the second half as Murphy’s Law goes into effect.

Teri looks great while Nicole DeHuff is on hand as the sister. Elsewhere, an iconic actor of the period shows up in the second half, but I don’t want to give it away as it’s a welcome surprise (it shouldn’t be too hard to figure out seeing as how this is a Ben Stiller comedy).

The sequel “Meet the Fockers” came out four years later and it’s lousy by comparison with distasteful non-humor consisting mostly of juvenile jokes about sex from senior citizens. It was an embarrassment to the iconic actors.

The movie runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot mostly on Long Island at Old Brookville and nearby Oyster Bay.

GRADE: B+ || The time has come for ""Greg"" (Ben Stiller) to meet the parents of his girlfriend ""Pam"" (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her, indeed he even buys a ring - but when the airline makes him check in his bag, then lose the thing and a baby throws up over his shirt he might be forgiven for thinking he'd be better of staying at home. Nope, he perseveres and meets her folks - ""Jack"" (Robert De Niro) and ""Dina"" (Blythe Danner) and now his troubles really do begin. Rather than just the usual charming family repartee, ""Greg"" finds himself under a microscope of penetrative inquisition from his would-be in-law, and it gradually emerges that he has maybe held back on a few truths with ""Pam"" and he does (or doesn't) like cats. He's also a male nurse called ""Focker"" - further facts which don't really helps his cause, either. As the weekend progresses, ""Greg"" lurches from the frying pan to the fire, trashes a sentimental urn, get's stitched up by her brother ""Denny"" (Jon Abrahams) and I think if it'd been me, I'd have abandoned ship however much I might have loved the woman. Danner always manages to impose herself gently in comedy, her facial expressions and demeanour adding an approving or disapproving look that speaks volumes, and here she works well with De Niro whose controlling behaviour is really the source of much of the humour here. It's not laugh out loud funny, and there's far too much dialogue, but when De Niro is at his most controllingly mischievous, then this is worth a watch. Who doesn't like a bit of Peter, Paul & Mary too?"

Get Carter, not just one of the finest exponents of British neo-noir, but one of the greatest British films ever, period. Michael Caine stars as Jack Carter, a tough no nonsense operator in the London underworld who returns to his home town of Newcastle Upon Tyne when his brother turns up dead. 

Directed and adapted to screenplay by Mike Hodges from Ted Lewis' novel ""Jack's Return Home"", Get Carter is a bleakly atmospheric masterwork that takes the period setting of the time and blends harsh realism with film noir sensibilities and filters it through an uncut prism of doom.

Jack Carter as created by Caine and Hodges is the quintessential film noir anti-hero. He smokes French cigarettes and reads Raymond Chandler, there is no hiding the respect and homages to classical noir pulsing away as Jack goes on his not so merry way. He's a vengeful angel of death, but sexy as hell with it, he even has humorous pearls of wisdom to spout, delivered with relish by Caine who is at his snake eyed best.

In a strange quirk of the narrative, Jack is home but he's a fish out of water, he's a suited and booted Cockney lad moving amongst the flotsam and jetsam of North Eastern society. It's a crumbling landscape of terraced houses and coal yards, of seedy clubs and bed and breakfast establishments where, as Jack wryly observes, the beds have seen untold action.

Jack Carter is a hard bastard, borderline psychotic once his mind has tuned into the frequency that plays to him the tunes of mistrust, of double-dealings, liars and thieves, of pornographers and gangsters who thrive on gaining wealth while the society around them falls into a depression. It's Fog on the Tyne for sure here. Yet Jack is not devoid of heartfelt emotion, his family ties are strong, and there is a point in the film when Jack sheds a tear, it is then when we all know that all bets are off and there will be no coming back from this particular abyss.

Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky strip it all back for maximum impact, so much so you can smell the salt of the murky sea, feel your lungs filling up with chimney smoke, the whiff of working class sweat is all around, and all the time Roy Budd's contemporary musical score jingles and jangles over proceedings like a dance of death waiting to reach its operatic conclusion. And with Caine backed up by a roll call of super working class character actors, Get Carter just gets better as each decade of film making passes.

Like its antagonist/protagonist (yes, Jack is both, a deliberate contradiction) it's a film as hard as nails, where home format releases should be delivered through your letterboxes in a metal case. No lover of film noir can have an excuse to have not seen it yet. Funny, sexy, brutal and not without a ticking time bomb of emotional fortitude as well, Get Carter is the ""A"" Bomb in Grey Street. 10/10 || Michael Caine is ""Jack Carter"" - a gangster who heads from London to Newcastle in England's north east to bury his brother ""Frank"". On the face of it, he was killed in a car accident after taking a dram or two too many. Thing is, though, ""Carter"" knows that his brother was no whisky drinker - and so smells a rat. Soon he is embroiled again in the local gangland antics in which he grew up, and on the trail of the truth and the perpetrators. To be honest, I don't think this is Caine's finest work - he is distinctly wooden for much of it; even when naked pointing a shotgun at two men (George Sewell and Tony Beckley) who caught him in flagrante delicto with Rosemarie Dunham's ""Edna"". That said, though, Mike Hodges captures well the gritty and threatening environment in which the story is set; the pace builds well and the story - though, frankly rather thin - concludes with an ending that I found entirely fitting, if a little strung out. Perhaps time has just neutered the impetus of this film? I can see why it might be considered cult, and Caine does have charisma in spades - but here there just isn't enough of a plot, nor strength in the supporting cast (which features one, pretty erotic, scene with Britt Ekland over a telephone which hardly merits a share of top billing) to lift this from a noir mediocrity. That said, the film is worth a watch. It depicts a North East England that was pretty much at the nadir of it's economic existence and with a criminal fraternity that traded in just about every commodity including children - but somehow much of that potency is just lacking now."

One soldier just wanted to be human.,"Drama, War",101,2000-10-06,en,6.615,576,1.3761,"Colin Farrell, Matthew Davis, Clifton Collins Jr., Tom Guiry, Shea Whigham","Joel Schumacher, Ross Klavan, Michael McGruther","1970s, louisiana, kansas, usa, guitar player, awol, target practice, exhaustion, military discharge, stockade","Just because you wear those sergeant's stripes doesn't mean you ain't gonna die.

Tigerland was the name of a U.S. Army training camp located at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Tagged as the second worst part of the Earth, it was a recreation of the Vietnamese jungle and was used to prepare American soldiers for the hellish terrain they were soon to be fighting in. 

Directed by Joel Schumacher, Tigerland stars Colin Farrell as Private Roland Bozz, a reluctant recruit to the war effort who upsets his superiors by having a canny knack for exploiting loop holes in the rule book. However, it's evident that Bozz has leadership qualities, but can the officers convince him he is born to lead? 

By the time of Tigerland's release, the Vietnam movie had apparently run its course. The announcement that Joel Schumacher was to delve into the conflict for his next movie was met with less than enthusiastic responses. This was after all the director who had not too long prior reduced the once darkly watchable Batman franchise to comedy campy ham overdrive. Alarm bells were further starting to go off when it was revealed that it was to be a short low budget shoot of 28 days, with a cast of unknowns and filmed in grainy 16 millimetre. Yet two things were forgotten by his many detractors. One was that Schumacher had showed himself capable of guiding a young vibrant cast to high levels of watch-ability (The Lost Boys), and two, that he had made Falling Down in the early 90s, thus tricky and darker edged material was not beyond him. 

Tigerland is a fine film, there is no actual conflict to observe other than the interactions between Bozz, his fellow squadies and his superiors. This is more boot camp drama than a film about military engagements. But the impact is much the same as our group of young men prepare for a fate that doesn't exactly have favourable odds; their respective reasons for being there in the first place containing varying degrees of bravado or disbelief. To which, much to his initial bemusement, Bozz simultaneously becomes a beacon of hope to many and a figure for revilement. The out-shot of this is that Tigerland winds up an expertly crafted movie, one that is propelled by great acting and one that quietly sneaks up on you and cloaks you in sadness. 

Schumacher is not the sole reason for why the film works so well though, he had some quality help. Ross Klavan and Michael McGruther's screenplay rises above the character clichés that exist in every army training camp based movie. Helped enormously by Klavan drawing on his real life experiences in the army, Tigerland doesn't hurtle towards its climax (a climax that is understated and poignant), it takes its time, characters are formed and with the then unknown Farrell on stupendously bewitching form, it's as engaging as a Vietnam film gets. This in spite of the grim look of the piece as Matthew Libatique's cinematography strips away vibrant colours and uses murky greys and greens to put the viewer right in there with them at boot camp. The look, the feel and the story all pull together nicely, making Tigerland fit to be mentioned in the same breath as those popular Vietnam movies from the previous decades. 8/10"

What to say about Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream that hasn't been said already? Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.

Arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. Standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and Snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by Clint Mansell's haunting musical composition. All told it's an assault on all the senses and terrifying with it, boosted no end by Aronofsky getting top performances from his cast of actors. Love it or hate it, it's a film that simply can't be ignored, unsparing cinema produced by a most gifted director. 9/10 || Only my second viewing of this, last time probably was when it came out on DVD, and not one I'll re-watch anytime soon, but still a great drama featuring incredible performances, most notably Ellen Burstyn who was worthy of her Oscar nomination. Has some darkly wild moments and a swing in tones, guess giving viewers insights into the highs and lows of heroine use. Not entertaining in so much as fascinating film worth it for some of the visuals and acting. **4.5/5** || I've never been so afraid of a refrigerator."

Oscar-nominated Allen is good as the feisty, intelligent, senator but the rest of this is all rather lacklustre and frequently overly contrived, with plenty of dramatic events designed to enhance the plot rather then create any sense of plausibility. Against the backdrop of the Clinton impeachment trial, the film had a certain resonance and it certainly does not show the constitutional processes, nor the male-dominated American establishment's approach to women, in a good light, but the older it gets, the less that causal impact it has and is now little better than a run-of-the-mill political drama that struggles to distinguish itself."

An overworked gynecologist (Richard Gere) in Dallas faces problems with an assortment of women beyond his practice. His NFL cheerleader daughter is getting married (Kate Hudson), but his younger daughter (Tara Reid) drops the ball on her sister. Worse, his wife (Farrah Fawcett) has to be placed in a mental institution, so he turns to a golf pro for succor (Helen Hunt). Meanwhile, his sister-in-law is an alcoholic (Laura Dern) and his office manager's feelings are dubious (Shelly Long). Liv Tyler is also on hand.

Helmed by Robert Altman, ""Dr. T & the Women"" (2002) is an ensemble dramedy with some romance. It has a horrible reputation, but it's actually not bad as long as you're in the mood for a drama with amusing touches. It's far from great, yet it's certainly not bad. Gere is likable in the title role and bends over backwards to help all the women in his life. The women are likable too, although many of the peripheral ones are somewhat annoying.

I find the criticism that the film is ""misogynistic"" funny in light of the fact that the screenplay was written by a woman, Anne Rapp. Others argue that the story's pointless and the ending is unbelievable. While the latter point is true, this IS a dramedy/satire and not everything is SUPPOSED to be strictly realistic. As to the former criticism, just enjoy the ride and reflect on the plot and subplots. You may not agree with its points, and they may be elusive, but it's not pointless.

While I like the film and it contains scores of beautiful women, I'm only giving it a marginal ""thumbs up"" because they could've done better on this front considering the wealth of resources they had to work with, not to mention the opening credits sequence is noticeably overlong and dull. Interestingly, the ending graphically details the birth of a baby, a male.

The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in the Dallas area.

The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is directed by Lewis Milestone and stars Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, Lizabeth Scott and Kirk Douglas (in his film debut). Robert Rossen and Robert Riskin adapt from the short story ""Love Lies Bleeding"" by playwright John Patrick (using the pseudonym Jack Patrick). It's produced by Hal B. Wallis, the film is scored by Miklos Rozsa, photographed by Victor Milner, the art design is by Hans Dreier and the costumes come courtesy of multi Oscar winner Edith Head.

Quite a cast, and quite a line up in the back room too, the credits also feature Robert Aldrich & Blake Edwards, taking to four the number of future directors involved in the film. The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is a dark, often perverse melodramatic film noir picture. Heavily reliant on dialogue and unappealing characters, the film revels in the cruel streak that pulses right through the running time.

Stanwyck (on wickedly chilling form) plays Martha Ivers, the center piece of an explosive trio that also comprises the two men who possibly spied her clubbing her wealthy aunt to death when they were children. After watching another man hang for the murder, Martha inherited the family fortune and has grown into a tycoon type and now holds control over Iverstown. Married to one of the witnesses (Douglas playing weak willed Walter O'Neil), she finds her world knocked out of line when Sam (Heflin superb), the other potential child witness, resurfaces. Now the guilt ridden waters have been stirred...

It's a gripping pot boiler that is tightly directed by Milestone, all the more better for the director choosing to craft the noir elements around the smouldering romantic plot lines. The setting is also classic noir, Iverstown is an on the surface all American peaceful town in nowhereville, but bubbling under the smiley surface is dark political deeds and even darker secrets. Rozsa scores it perfectly, at times jaunty to give the sense of all is well in this Americana, then quick tonal shifts grab the ears as the shadows form around the dislikable characters. Supporting actress Lizabeth Scott is appealing in one of her better roles, while Judith Anderson makes a massive impact in her short stint as the wicked Aunt.

Perhaps a touch too long at just under two hours? This none the less is a highly recommended picture for both the story and the technical nous provided by those that made it. 8/10 || Barbara Stanwyck aways could draw people into her characterisations and end up engendering support and sympathy - however deserving her character was. She excels again here as ""Martha Ivers""; a wealthy women trapped in a pretty loveless marriage with débutant Kirk Douglas - a rather pathetic man who has a career built on the coat tails of his powerful wife. When their childhood friend ""Sam"" (Van Heflin) reappears in their lives they are all reminded of the incident from their childhood that explained just how she came into all of of her money - and arrived at her choice of husband - in the first place. Lizabeth Scott appears now and again as Heflin's rather pathetic ex-con girlfriend who quickly realises that there is still a flame burning elsewhere and there's little room for her in this rapidly toxifying mix. The slow pace of the film detracts somewhat from a really cute, complex story and the music also drags it along in the melodramatic mud a bit, too: but the scenes with Douglas and Stanwyck present a wonderful cocktail of resentment, love and hate. The last 15 minutes focus it all well and keep us hanging on, not quite certain of what's going to happen next..."

<em>'The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'</em> is another Disney package film. It's probably one of the better ones to be fair, though still fails to truly entertain. The first story featuring Mr. Toad is fairly enjoyable, while the one with Ichabod starts off solidly but by its end I found myself less interested.

Bing Crosby and Basil Rathbone do well as narrators, while the animation is more than passable. Again, like 1948's <em>'So Dear to My Heart'</em> from Disney, it's nothing to hate on but I wouldn't class it as anything other than average though.

/copied directly from my Letterboxd review\ || Basil Rathbone starts this double feature off with his engaging narration of a very much shortened version of ""The Wind in the Willows"". ""Toad"" is a bit of an adventurer. Indeed, he might even be the world's first faddist! Running amok the countryside with his new equine friend ""Cyril"" pulling a great yellow wagon, he is causing no end of stress for his friends ""Angus MacBadger"", ""Ratty"" and ""Moley"". Finally , they apprehend him and confine him to his room - but nope, that's no good. He shimmies down from his window and is soon in the possession of a shiny new motor car. How did he get it? Well that's soon a matter for the law and things are going to ge even messier for the friends and he is imprisoned and they have to get to the bottom of a dastardly plot involving some weasels and Toad Hall itself. Then, we morph seamlessly onto the equally mellifluous tones of Bing Crosby who takes us through a not so enjoyable interpretation of ""Sleepy Hollow"". We follow the almost vulture-like ""Ichabod Crane"" as he arrives in the village as the school teacher and who then sets about wooing local heiress ""Katriona"" - much to the chagrin of local beefcake ""Bron"". ""Crane"" seems to have the upper hand at every turn until the younger man hits on a idea to, quite literally, resurrect a creature from the depths of the graveyard to finally remove this obstacle from his path to true love (and a decent sized fortune too). The animations are old style Disney with plenty of vivid colours and, certainly for ""Toad, characterful animations. The second story features just a little too much music - our renowned crooner manages at least two songs, and the characterisations rely much more on their physical attributes and less on their ""acting"" if you will. It's still an enjoyable hour that showcases two enduring stories well, and it's not just for the children either."

The fact that it was chosen by the kids of today in what would have been just as unlikely a setting for this film as the North of England speaks volumes as to it's effect on challenging and breaking the stereotypical moulds that the British working class in the early 1980s was steeped in. The sylph-like ""Billy"" (the hugely engaging Jamie Bell) goes to boxing class each week but is soon more preoccupied by the adjacent dancing class of the no-nonsense ""Mrs. Wilkinson"" (Julie Walters) who gradually lets him join in. He's a bit scared that his dad (Gary Lewis) and his wayward brother ""Tony"" (Jamie Draven) will find out so it has to all be a bit clandestine.

Walters and Bell and Bell and Lewis work well together here; allowing the story to emerge naturally and energetically and as feel-good films go, this takes some beating. It's the ultimate ""anyone can do"" film that resonates as well now as it did then - only, maybe, the soundtrack needs a bit of updating!

After watching this film I just remembered the quote from 'Sullivan's Travels' which says 'film's the greatest educational medium the world has ever known'. Indeed, cinema's for entertainment as well acts as a message deliverer. This was an inspirational movie, and everybody must see it. I know I'm a bit late to see it, better late than never, right? I'm really glad for having it at the right time because 15 years ago I did not have this blog to write about it.

OK, the name of the movie represents the theme of the story. No matter its a developed or developing country, society needs something like the idea this movie talks about. Carrying a good social message, the movie slightly lags behind the too much on the emotions, especially the end part. There won't be a problem if you like melodrama. Other than that, I feel the conclusion was smart and strong, a better solution which would appeal for certain group rather alternate finale.

The film was based on the novel of the same name, crafted by a fine director with the wonderful cast. Haley Joel Osment had a great career as a child-star, you should check some of his films if you love children's movies including this title on the top of that list. As a middle aged actor, Helen Hunt's one of the last best performances before turning into a senior artist. It's not a usual role for Kevin Spacey, but he nailed it with the good dialogues. Especially his talk about the topic 'child abuse' was a great thing from the movie. Overall, the actors get more credit for the first- class acts as the script demanded for their respective roles.

> What did you ever do to change the world. 

A movie about a man who achieved in science gets the Oscar, not that real man. A movie about a man escapes from the war prison camp and slavery gets the award, and again none of those real persons. But a movie with the original, intelligent, inspiring, specially designed for a movie was not even a contender of the Oscars. Of course, it was transformed from a book, though there are/were no real people behind these great characters, all are imagined/created for the book and the movie. I never understood the American Academy Awards.

By now you would know that I hate critics badly if you are a regular reader of my blog. Once again they failed to recognise how great the morality of the story is, rather they have concentrated to criticise the writing and the technical aspect of the film. Although, it was not a box office flop or earned beyond, but got a lot of praise from the families. It's a wonderful family drama, but still too far from being a masterpiece. Intelligent enough one to get motivated towards the social issues. Being practical in the real world is a concern as it is risky, depending on the situation and the person, just like this movie's ending. Rare to find a movie like this, you must check it out.

It made me instantly want to see ALL of Ulmer's films--as well as a lot more of Ann Savage. A priceless find for the adventurous cinephile. || Sleazy Nightmare!

Playing out as some kind of fate accompanied nightmare, Detour demands repeat viewings since the running time is so short it leaves you hankering for more come the end. We follow the protagonist Al Roberts on the road, and watch (with accompanied narration) a sequence of events that see him in the middle of nowhere at a diner fearing for his future.

Devilishly dark in tone, the film relies on a fine underplayed performance from Tom Neal as Roberts, and a gloriously annoying harpy femme fatale turn from Ann Savage as Vera. The film was made for next to nothing in only one week, and the whole film screams out as a low budget movie shot with a sleazy tint and less than stellar tech credits. Yet money can't buy this type of atmospheric misery, where the vagaries of fate play their brutal film noir hands.

Upon release, it was just a poverty row ""B"" picture, and it passed by almost quietly. Unsurprisingly a few years later ""French"" cineastes picked up on it and as the years rolled by it has garnered critical reappraisals. So much so the likes of Scorsese and The Coen Brothers cottoned on and gleefully let the influence wash over them. Director was one Edgar G. Ulmer (""The Black Cat"", ""Bluebeard"", ""Strange Illusion"", ""Ruthless""), and here he shows himself the master of low budgetary nous and devilish story telling. 9/10 || I think that in order to get anything from this film noir, you have to accept from the outset that the acting is pretty poor. An implausibly weak Tom Neal, a downright irritating Ann Savage & an especially wooden Claudia Drake make this something you might win a perseverance award for, for sticking with. Tom Neal is driving across the USA when he makes a decision he soon regrets - picking up a rude, gobby woman (Ann Savage) on the highway who proceeds to rob, bully & blackmail him. Accidentally, she comes a cropper and (aside from a general feeling of thank the Lord from the audience) his relief is palpable. The route to his predicament is relayed via his somewhat pathetic retrospective narrative and her relentless onslaughts and they both combine to really grate after a while (say 20 minutes). It has little to redeem it, I'm afraid - neither the photography nor the script inject much pace and/or menace - it's just a tiresome tirade."

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **_Entertaining horror flick about a haunting witch that's been dead for over two centuries_**

Released in 2000 and directed by Joe Berlinger, ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" begins amidst the hysteria of the found-footage of the first film. People from around the world curious about the Blair witch phenomenon overrun Burkittsville, Maryland, wherein an entrepreneurial dude named Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) leads a 'Blair Witch Hunt' tour involving four clients, a Wiccan, a Goth girl and an academic couple. After camping at the ruins of the home of an executed murderous hermit (who was evidently possessed by the spirit of the witch in the 1940s) the group has a rude awakening when they can't remember what happened the night before. They go to Jeff's nearby pad—a curious factory-turned-house—to review the video tapes for answers and discover something horribly macabre.

Atmospherically, ""Book of Shadows"" is quite effective as a haunting ghost/witch flick and the writing is actually smart—the entire play on hysteria, delusion & perception is quite clever. The screenplay was written by director Berlinger, who's best known for the great ""Paradise Lost"" trilogy of documentaries about the ""West Memphis three,"" youthful outcasts accused of a hideous 1993 triple murder in Arkansas based on dubious evidence (and who were finally released in 2011). Anyway, ""Book of Shadows"" starts satirically and amusing, but gets increasing serious and sinister. The acting is good too, with Kim Director's powerhouse performance as the Goth girl standing out. Erica Leerhsen is also a highlight as the Wiccan babe with several alluring scenes, but they coulda done more with her.

The reason so many people call this flick ""the worst movie ever made"" (Why sure!) is obviously because it's a knee-jerk reaction to it being a sequel to the mega-popular ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999), which was an altogether different kind of movie, being a found-footage flick, not to mention the herd-mentality of an over-critical feeding-frenzy. Since I'm not a fan of found-footage films—seeing as how they're about as entertaining as watching home movies for an hour and a half—I find ""Book of Shadows"" far more interesting than the first film.

There's a secret message in the movie that you can discover in (***SPOILER ALERT***): the FIRE, the GRASS, the factory WINDOW, the GRAVESTONE and the RUG, which all-together spells: ""Seek me no further or..."". This combined with reversing Tristen's backward words in the last act reveal the secret of 'ESREVER': ""Seek me no further or... the children will again walk free,"" meaning: the Blair witch would loose the spirits of the murdered children to torment the invaders of her domain. (***END SPOILER***)

As for the complaints of there being no Book of Shadows, it's simply not true. The character Jeff is a movie enthusiast with ambitions of being a filmmaker and ""Book of Shadows"" is the name of one of the scripts he put together and intends to shoot. So it's not something totally out of nowhere that Artisan dubiously added to the title, as most people think. Yes, they added it, but it had relevance to the movie. Furthermore, the actual 'Book of Shadows' is a Wiccan spell book and is figuratively used in the movie in that the group obviously falls under the spell of the Blair Witch after entering her diabolical terrain.

The film features a creative score by Carter Burwell and a rockin' soundtrack with quality cuts by the likes of Marilyn Manson (""Disposable Teens""), Godhead (""The Reckoning"") and many more.

After Berlinger finished his version of the movie the studio complained that there weren't enough conventional horror elements and so additional scenes were shot & edited into the picture. What else is new? It has been thus throughout cinematic history. For me, the added scenes beef-up what might've otherwise been too low-key for a horror flick. True, this route was taken with the first film, but ""Book of Shadows"" is the antithesis of that movie, and it's the better for it IMHO.

""Book of Shadows"" is a dense horror flick and therefore worthy of repeat viewings for gems to mine. (One aid in helping to understand the picture is Jeff's statement at the camp: ""Film lies; video tells the truth""). Unfortunately, this is evidently too much for some dullards. Yes, it's a slow-build with meandering aspects, but the movie's laden with subtext and the climax is pretty horrific, even while it's somewhat predictable. You never see the witch, but her nefarious presence is palpable nevertheless and the ambiance fittingly oozes Gothic. As for the doofuses who argue that the pic has too little to do with the first one, nothing could be further from the truth. Lastly, Jeff's factory-turned-house is almost iconic; a great location for a ghostly horror flick.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Maryland.

Adapting classic television series into a feature film was becoming a common trend in the early part of this century. But maintaining the aesthetic appeal of its source material is often blurred with the requirement of targeting mass mainstream audiences. Would viewers of the original Charlie’s Angels watch a film continuation? Most likely not. So the legendary (and I use that adjective lightly...) McG decided to go full Hollywood, embracing action spy thrillers that came before, and produced one of the campiest guilty pleasures of all time. 

Can I describe the plot? Absolutely not. It’s thinner that Diaz’ lip fillers and needless botox. Three “Angels” who privately work for a millionaire are assigned a task in investigating technology giant Red Star. Stuff happens, a predictable plot twist unravels and the booming soundtrack of The Prodigy and Fat Boy Slim illuminate my ears. 

Let me start by saying I love Charlie’s Angels. I love it! It’s a film I hold very close to my heart, and a crucial element to my childhood. Probably a reasoning for my raging homosexuality, let’s be honest. I mean Barrymore, Diaz and Liu kicking a “creepy thin man” repeatedly wearing tight leather costumes in ‘Matrix’-stylised slow motion whilst working together as a cohesive unit of female empowerment!? Just lay me to rest, now! Give me a slice of that angel cake and let me never lose that heavenly flavour. 

Yet, the amateur critic inside me just cannot classify this film as “good”. Why? Well, because it’s not. And it’s that ever-growing conflict between biased favouritism and legitimate critiquing that has me torn inside. Firstly, the plot is a mess. To the point where the story is a secondary product to the action set pieces and humorous dance sequences. When talented actors, such as Rockwell, are crucial aspects to this afterthought, it unfortunately wastes their efforts. The frantic editing prevents a natural flow of events, including the extravagant action, that anchors these angels. They are unable to spread their wings and fly.

A dire shame considering the undeniable chemistry between the lead actresses, each harnessing a unique personality that allows their characters to connect as a team. Diaz is the ditzy dance queen, shaking her tush on Soul Train. Barrymore is the rebellious punk, sticking her middle finger up to everyone. Liu is the intellectual well-mannered lady, riding horses and piloting space rockets. They each add enough humour to come together seamlessly. Essentially, I live for them. The dialogue is cheesy and contagious, if ridiculously vacuous in subject matter. And the constant use of the same songs, namely “Heaven” and “Smack My B**** Up!”, lacked variety. Despite my internal love for The Prodigy and Fat Boy Slim. 

As far as guilty pleasures go, Charlie’s Angels is up there for me. It’s poorly directed and woefully written, but I cannot deny my adoration for this campy beast. Unfortunately it doesn’t surpass the ultimate guilty pleasure ‘Lara Croft: Tomb Raider’, even after all these years... || Not the greatest fighters in this besides Lucy Liu. I really only liked the movie cause it was funny, and of course their sexy. That's pretty much it. || ""Sabrina"" (Kate Duncan) was always my favourite when I was growing up, so I was really disappointed that they didn't recast her character from amongst these three ladies who had a go at resurrecting the bad-ass antics at the ""Townsend Detective Agency"". At least ""Charlie"" (John Forsythe) added a bit of continuity, but otherwise this really is a pale imitation of the television series. ""Natalie"" (Cameron Diaz), ""Dylan"" (Drew Barrymore) and ""Alex"" (Lucy Liu) pick up the mantle and guided by ""Bosley"" (Bill Murray) find themselves embroiled in the world of corporate espionage and high-tech larceny. It's the geeky ""Eric"" (Sam Rothwell) who has asked them to investigate the nefarious activities of his rival ""Roger"" (Tim Curry) after his unique voice recognition software has been pinched. It's only after they make some progress that they return to a wrecked house and realise that this is perhaps a cunning distraction from the criminal's real objective: ""Charlie"" himself! Of course, they want to rally round him but how? They couldn't pick him out of an ID parade. As things hot up, the ladies have to use all of their wits, guile and a fair degree of ninja skills to get to the bottom of the scheming before their boss becomes more chum than ""Charlie"". As a throw way adventure film this works fine. The writing is largely irrelevant and the focus is entirely on the gymnastic activities of three women who are quite clearly enjoying themselves and, of course, there's the always to be relied upon ham that is Tim Curry. Murray is wasted here, though, and Rockwell only really does enough as his character is all too predictably padded out. There are an array of familiar telly faces to chivvy it along and it's got spawn of a sequel written all over it. You'll probably never remember it, but if it serves to get you to fish out some of the 1970s television series then that might be it's only lasting legacy - they were much more fun."

Their relationship starts out on the rocks, but fate ultimately conspires to bring the men together into a setting of mutual respect, triumph and honor.",History is made by those who break the rules.,Drama,129,2000-09-13,en,7.496,2368,4.4655,"Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Charlize Theron, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Hal Holbrook",George Tillman Jr.,"diving, u.s. navy","Men of honor what a film it is in my top 10 films || Men of Honor is one of those films that hits hard with its message, yet somehow got a mixed reception from critics who called it too conventional. But honestly, what’s wrong with a movie sticking to a classic, inspiring formula when it’s done right? The story of Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., is all about perseverance, dignity, and refusing to let others define your worth. Robert De Niro, as the tough and unpredictable Master Chief Billy Sunday, brings an intensity that elevates every scene he's in. Their dynamic is what makes the movie so gripping, showing how respect is earned through resilience and action, not just words.

The script carries some powerful lines, but the standout moment for me is when Carl confidently fires back, ""You're damn right I am!"" That single line encapsulates everything the movie stands for. It’s not just about race or breaking barriers, but about proving to yourself and the world that you belong where you’ve worked hard to be. The cinematography and production keep things grounded, never feeling overly dramatic, which makes the emotional beats hit even harder. The pacing might feel a bit slow in places, but it gives enough breathing room for the character arcs to feel earned rather than rushed.

Overall, Men of Honor is an inspiring watch, especially if you appreciate stories about overcoming adversity without unnecessary fluff or exaggeration. Gooding Jr. delivers one of his best performances, and De Niro balances toughness with subtle layers of respect and mentorship. It’s a movie that deserved more credit than it got and remains a solid reminder of how persistence and belief in yourself can break down any obstacle."
8870.0,Red Planet,"Astronauts search for solutions to save a dying Earth by searching on Mars, only to have the mission go terribly awry.",Not a sound. Not a warning. Not a chance.

At least it's good for something.

The second of the Mars based box office bombs released in 2000, Red Planet is maybe - just maybe - worth a revisit by some who were irritated by it back on first viewing. Once knowing that this is not going to be some action packed alien movie, that it's a survivalist drama that tips its hat to 1950s sci-fi schlock, that cares about its characters, then there's a decent popcorner experience to be had here. 

This is not to say it's a genius entry in the sci-fi pantheon, because it's not, the same problems still exist; Terence Stamp is woefully under used (seriously they could have got any low paid character actor to play his role), some things either don't make sense or are left unanswered, and of course it still drags in the middle as the boys chatter away on Mars whilst Carrie Anne-Moss is up at base station fretting and suffering erectus nippleus.

Yet there's fun to be had here, some nutty science marries up with nice photography and splendid set design, and the makers know what sort of picture they want to make. Where Mission to Mars sunk under the weight of its own pretensions - trying to go all elegiac and important, Red Planet nudges and winks and asks you along for the ride. So get on board and take it for what it is, a pretentious free zone with good human drama at the core. 6.5/10 || _Red Planet_ has so much going on, and it doesn't have control of any of it. Not a single actor fits their character, except possibly Carrie-Ann Moss, who spends basically the entire runtime too benched to really count as a character in 99% of the story anyway.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Red Planet had the potential to be a gripping sci-fi survival film, but it falls short due to weak writing and lackluster execution. The plot follows a team of astronauts sent to Mars for a critical mission, but the movie struggles to maintain tension or make the stakes feel real. The directing is serviceable but uninspired, never really leaning into the survival elements or making the action feel urgent. Visually, the cinematography does a decent job of capturing Mars' desolate landscape, though the CGI, while better than expected, feels underwhelming for its time. The film misses opportunities to create a more immersive or visually striking atmosphere.

The acting is mostly passable, with a few performances standing out more than others, but the script does the cast no favors. Dialogue is stiff, and character interactions often feel unnatural or rushed. The story also takes some questionable leaps in logic, which make it hard to stay invested. The AI element, a key part of the plot, is handled in a way that feels inconsistent. The score doesn't add much to the experience, and the dramatic moments often lack weight, partially due to the uninspired music choices. Overall, Red Planet had a solid premise but failed to execute it in a way that makes it worth revisiting"

The recent complete-James-Bond-on-blu boxed set that was released has been my ONLY time seeing Sean Connery's last 'official' outing as 007 not edited for television and full screen, so it's basically my first-time REALLY seeing it. Decent. Even at his worst, horribly toupeed, and albatrossed with a script that's simply OUCH, it still oozes and smashes from the fact Connery's still the best Bond ever. || _**The series gets silly as James Bond goes to Las Vegas**_

Agent 007 (Sean Connery) is sent to Las Vegas to uncover a smuggling ring and suspects Blofeld (Charles Gray) is masterminding the nefarious operation; meanwhile a gay duo of assassins threatens the investigation. Jill St. John plays a smuggling contact while Lana Wood is on hand as a casino opportunist. 

""Diamonds are Forever"" (1971) marks Connery’s return to the series after four years absence and missing out on the previous movie featuring George Lazenby. This one’s entertaining throughout, but it introduced a silly, cartoonish element more glaring than anything up to this point. Then there’s the fact that the storyline is almost impossible to follow unlike the previous installments which were easy to grasp, like “Dr. No,” “Goldfinger,” “Thunderball” and “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” You just have to kick back and enjoy the madness of it all. 

Beautiful Lana Wood stands out on the female front, but her role is too brief (her apparel too, lol). Meanwhile Jill St. John is lots of fun, not to mention alluring.

Needless to say, Vegas makes for a great setting for a James Bond flick. There are neon lights, highrise hotels, casinos, swimming pools, deserts, circuses, showgirls, tourists and thrills galore.

The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Las Vegas & the Nevada desert; Netherlands; Pinewood Studios near London; Palm Springs, Ca (Willard Whyte's Desert House); French Riviera, France (pre-credits sequence); and the Pacific Ocean.

GRADE: B- || MOST of the bad reviews on a lot of the Connery era 007 movies are... political. They don't like classic 60s 007 because of contemporary Woke six decades later politics.

But.... this one just sucks. And, keep in mind, I say this with Connery being my favorite 007 and 4 out of his 5 (6 should NOT be counted) outings are my favorite 007 films.

However, this is Connery playing a goofy Roger Moore era 007 and that doesn't work. This is Connery in a film that had all the coming Moore tropes. And that doesn't work.

Had Diamonds are Forever been a Roger Moore 007, it wouldn't have been that bad. This was Moore's Bond film... only it had Connery in it, so it just didn't work."

Michael Caine is outstanding as Colonel Steiner, an untamed German paratroop commander, who's covert mission is to go to Britain and kidnap Winston Churchill whilst on a retreat. The Germans are helped by Irishman Liam Devlin, played by Donald Sutherland, who essentially paves the way for their operation at a coastal hamlet (shot in Cornwall and Berkshire, England). Jenny Agutter plays Devlin's near-jailbait romantic interest in the quaint village, while Larry Hagman and Treat Williams play American officers, the former foolishly gung-ho. Robert Duvall and Donald Pleasence are also on hand as Nazi officers.

As you can see from the plot, this is an unconventional WW2 picture. It doesn't feature the typical major battles or stereotypical characters and situations of most war flicks. Both Caine and Sutherland shine in their roles, especially Caine as the fearless Steiner. Memorable moments abound.

The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes, but feels shorter.

GRADE: B+/A- || Following an animated staff meeting with Hitler, there's a suggestion put forward that the Nazis try to kidnap Winston Churchill. Spymaster Admiral Canaris (Anthony Quayle) thinks it's a dangerous idea, but Himmler (Donald Pleasence) wants it investigated. To that end, the admiral recruits ""Radl"" (Robert Duvall) to find a man who might be able to lead a team to get the job done. We've already met ""Col. Steiner"" (Michael Caine) and know he's a bit of a maverick, so ""Radl"" does a deal with him that will accomplish the task and save ""Steiner"" from a lively firing squad. It seems the Prime Minister is soon to visit a quiet country manor house near the Norfolk coast so this is their chance. The soldiers adopt the identity of British soldiers and work with the nearby villagers whilst laying the groundworks for their plot. A chance accident, though, reveals their identity to the villagers and things turn decidedly dangerous. Can the villagers find a way to warn the outside world? Caine does fine with this drama, and Donald Sutherland also delivers quite well as the IRA man who will do just about anything to see the British lose the war, but the rest of the cast rather underwhelm - especially the rather soporific ""Molly"" (Jenny Agutter) and curiously cast Jean Marsh. Quayle, Duvall and Pleasence barely feature at all and the denouement, though not quite what we were expecting, still can't quite enliven this rather over-scripted and far-fetched story. It's watchable enough, though, Caine sees to that - but just not quite the sum of it's parts."

Yet viewing it now on its own chaotic sci-fi terms, it's a surprisingly brisk and enjoyable picture.

Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, it's a futuristic collage of outrageous set-pieces and thought provoking thematics. Plot has Arnie as an ex-fighter pilot who discovers he has been illegally cloned, and thus he embarks on a mission of carnage and high paced machismo in a bid to get his identity back whilst exposing the evil corporation at the core of such nastiness. So, two Arnie's for the price of one then!

It's not a plot that would hold up under close scrutiny, but then is that what we go into a Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie for? Quite. With some nifty surprises, kinetic action and an ending of some considerable chilling substance, The 6th Day is classic popcorn munching fodder. No it's not in the top tier of Arnie movies, and no it's hardly shaking the foundations of sci-fi cinema, but sometimes comfort food sci-fi has its own rewards for an undemanding occasion. 6.5/10 || _The 6th Day_ is a **great** title for a movie about man-made lifeforms.

The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville.

The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs. Moving forward, the live-action films, 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, are based on the cartoon and offer a fresh take on the story with Glenn Close's portrayal of Cruella Deville being particularly outstanding.

Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go. || If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

What a movie! This is one of the most underrated films out there, and it was unfairly compared to The Sixth Sense at the time the former was released. These are two very different movies, but both of them have a lot of twists, which was what brought fame to Shyamalan's films, especially The Sixth Sense.

Unbreakable follows that same methodology. It has a lot of twists throughout the runtime, and they are quite diverse: some are very technical twists, related to our point of view of a particular scene that, as it progresses, we always find ourselves tricked (these ones, most people either don't catch them or just don't care ... For me, it's proof of brilliant writing); the others are the prominent plot twists, where something unpredictable happens to the overall story.

This movie has all of that and much more. The story itself is incredibly captivating since the main plot holds a lot of mystery and suspense, but these only work as well as they did thanks to Shyamalan, both director and screenwriter. His very unconventional way of storytelling and the anxiety that he's able to convey to some fantastic scenes, elevate the film while delivering a perfect narrative. It's even more mind-blowing the fact that this movie still makes so much sense and it didn't lose its replay value after 17 years!

In fact, I bet it would be a striking success nowadays, where the superhero genre is over-saturated. Each year, we get more and more movies following the excessively used genre's formula that makes almost every blockbuster an instant box office hit. Unbreakable is nowhere near that formula, and I genuinely think that any fan of comic-book films must watch this one so everyone can understand what a ""grounded superhero movie"" actually means. M. Night Shyamalan wrote a story that everyone can appreciate, without all of those big CGI fights and overwhelming visual effects. Comic-book fan or not, Unbreakable is the closest to what reality would be if superheroes really existed.

Regarding the cast, Bruce Willis probably has his career-best dramatic performance in this film. He's terrific as David and I can feel all of the emotions which he wants to transmit to the screen. Samuel L. Jackson brilliantly plays Elijah, who has a real-life disease which SLJ portrayed beautifully and respectfully. The supporting cast is also worth praising since both Robin Wright (Audrey Dunn) and Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn) play magnificent roles as the wife and son of David, respectively.

Everyone helped Shyamalan direct exquisite dialogue sequences that extended for minutes without end. The editing and production of this movie are unbelievable ... and it was filmed in 2000! There are so many long, one-take scenes that explain in just a few minutes, everything you need to know about a character or a specific place or event ... Even a full action sequence is filmed in just one-take (the stunt work is also pretty efficient)! The soundtrack is so important, especially in the last act where everything comes to a conclusion. It's inspirational and even epic, I dare calling it. It's just perfect! Throughout the runtime, you can barely notice it due to how subtle it is. However, when it is needed to deliver a new layer of feelings, it always raises the moment.

As discussed above, this is a M. Night Shyamalan film, so a very powerful twist right at the end needs to happen ... and it does. It gives the audience an unpredictable perspective about the whole story. I risk myself in saying that it isn't exactly necessary, but the truth is that it makes sense and it does bring the movie to a whole other level, so very, very well done! Finally, I just wish that this film had been released now. It is so much different than what we are used to watching and experiencing, that I dare to say it is one of the best movies inside this genre.

Once again, Shyamalan shows the audience why was he becoming one of the most popular directors/screenwriters and proves that his rather unconventional storytelling, unpredictable twists and excellent direction are skills to praise more often. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson have great chemistry, but the former has his career-best dramatic performance.

There is room, gradually, for a little romance but for the most part this is a quickly paced adventure that builds well on some beautiful cinematography with a solid story underpinned by some magical mythology and plenty of swordplay. Unlike many of the genre, the combat scenes are naturally choreographed and do not drag on interminably and repetitively. This has a more characterful narrative that involves us in the mystery, the vendetta - even the slowly simmering love story. For my money, this is easily the best film as yet made by Ang Lee and is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can find one."
11849.0,Dungeons & Dragons,"The Empire of Izmer is a divided land: elite magicians called “mages” rule while lowly commoners are powerless.

RELEASED IN 2000 and directed by Courtney Solomon, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).  
 
The first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that it’s not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of “Star Wars” (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you’d have a good idea of what “Dungeons & Dragons” has to offer. 

This was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel “Wrath of the Dragon God” (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but it’s decidedly TV fantasy fare.

The film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.                                 

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic (Kutná Hora and Prague). WRITERS: Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright.  

GRADE: C || I saw this at the time it was released in 2000, and I couldn't quite fathom how Oscar winning Jeremy Irons (""Profion"") ever found his way onto the screen for this nonsense. The whole thing centres around his megalomaniacal desire to depose the Empress (a shockingly wooden Thora Birch) and seize her sceptre that controls the white dragons. She's having none of that, so he must now seek out the red ""Rod of Savina"" via his menacing henchman ""Damodar"" (Bruce Payne) for that controls the red ones. Meantime petty thieves ""Ridley"" (Justin Whalin) and his pal ""Snails"" (Marlon Wayans) manage to get embroiled in the plot after a visit to the House of Magic goes a bit awry. The scene is now set for some silly, set-piece escapades with some basic special effects, a daft cameo from Richard O'Brien (reappraising his ""Adventure Game"" performance) and, well you get the drift. It's poor, this - but I didn't hate it. There is a bit of fun being had, Whalin is easy enough on the eye and the whole thing has it's tongue so firmly planted in it's cheek that it is hard to actually dislike it - especially at the end when Iron hits super-ham mode and the dragons all take flight. Sure, the dialogue is daft but somehow that just didn't matter. Despite myself, I quite enjoyed this...."

I had high hopes for this film after seeing the thrilling opening sequence in Monument Valley, Utah; but, alas, it was not to be.

THE STORY: A famous female climber gets stuck in an ice cave with two others near the top of K2, the second highest mountain on Earth. Her brother, who has sworn off climbing because of his father's climbing death, has no choice but to assemble a team to rescue the trio.

WHAT WORKS: As already mentioned, the opening sequence is excellent, the locations are great (the New Zealand Alps), the story pretty much keeps your attention (until the absurdities really mount up -- pun intended) and both Robin Tunney & Izabella Scorupco are deliciously beautiful.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the story continues the believability decreases severely. In fact, the crisis/suspense/action sequences are so EXTREME and strung so close together (especially as the movie proceeds) they tend to make you bust out laughing -- the very OPPOSITE reaction the creators wanted. By the very end the ridiculous overkill made me lose interest in whatever story was supposed to be there.

FINAL ANALYSIS: I was hoping for something unexpectedly great like ""The Edge,"" but ended up with a fun but ultimately shallow time-waster. For comparison, ""Cliffhanger"" is ""Apocalypse Now"" next to ""Vertical Limit.""

Russell Crowe would of course come to be better known elsewhere (filmicly) in this year, but what of his other release in 2000? Proof of Life is a blender, a picture that is in part thriller, part romance, part drama and part observation on a very real life problem - that of kidnapping for ransom. So many genres to tackle means that invariably Taylor Hackford's film feels over stuffed, pushing the running time to two hours and fifteen minutes, it is this that hurts it. A shame because if trimmed of the pointless filler and drawn out sequences then there is a very efficient (ok, maybe routine is a better word here) and well acted piece on show. The drama and tension (sexual and perilous threat) is all building towards the action packed finale, which, while well mounted, doesn't seem an adequate pay off for the number of extended chatty scenes we have had to tolerate to get there.

To be fair to Roger Donaldson, he has managed to come pretty close - and do far better than the 1962 iteration - with this well cast telling of a story of mutiny and brutality. It's told by way of a retrospective as Lord Hood (Lord Olivier) conducts an investigation into what happened aboard the ill-fated ship. Anthony Hopkins is the disciplinarian Lt. Bligh in charge of the glorified freighter ""HMS Bounty"" which is charged with heading to Tahiti to secure breadfruit trees that can be used to feed the slaves by the colonies in the West Indies. His second-in-command is the no-nonsense but eminently more fair Fletcher Christian (a competent effort from Mel Gibson) and as our journey progresses, the film takes it's time to develop the gradually building toxicity of that relationship as the former man treats the crew with scant humanity. After a great many trials and tribulations, their relationship is all but shot when they arrive at their destination and we know that the writing is on the wall for Bligh. Unlike the other ""Bounty"" films, this one spends a bit more time presenting the epic and perilous open-boat journey undertaken by the dispossessed - the high seas, the cannibals, the shortages - and Hopkins holds that together really well. This man may have been an inhumane individual, but he was no mean sailor too.

Planes, Trains and Automobiles is written, produced and directed by John Hughes. It stars Steve Martin and John Candy. Music is by Ira Newborn and cinematography by Donald Peterman.

Marketing man Neal Page (Martin) is in a last ditch dash to get from New York to Chicago in time for the family Thanksgiving dinner. Unfortunately obstacles halt his every advancement, the biggest of which is the man who fate has decreed is his companion for the trip; Del Griffith (Candy), a larger than life shower ring salesman whose outlook on life is considerably different to Neal's.

If you haven't seen it yet? Then what is your excuse? You owe it to yourself to let this wonderful film into your life. John Hughes pitches two of America's then biggest comedy stars together and puts them on a trip where everything that can go wrong, does! Cue chaos with the methods of transport in the title. Yet as funny as the mishaps are, and they are, with a number of events being things many of us can associate with, they would be nothing without the expert characterisations. Both as performed by a never better Martin and Candy, but also as written by Hughes.

Neal Page is anal retentive, snobbish and cynicism in a suit, Del Griffith appears oafish, over talkative and comes bedecked in cheapo winter wear. As time, options and sanity start to ebb away, desperation takes a hold and a surprising co-dependency starts to form. Something that beautifully sets us up for a finale that is as touching as it is genuinely surprising. It has mature comedy characterisations for the grown ups and chaotic actions for the younger crowd. Perfect and it should be prescribed at least once a year for a pick me up. 9/10 || Entertaining 1987 flick from John Hughes.

<em>'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'</em> is an enjoyable watch, pure and simple. The pairing of Steve Martin and John Candy is a great one, with both holding their own and bringing a lot of humour to events. Away from those two, you also have interesting bit part roles for Kevin Bacon and Michael McKean.

The plot is one that could've got repetitive, but the film keeps it interesting for the whole 93 minutes. I will say, not that it's an all that noteworthy thing, that it has more (overly?) dramatic moments than I was anticipating, especially at the end. I was expecting a flat-out comedy, but the additional heart fits in well enough.

It's a film 100% worth watching, if only for the humour of the two leads; there are some funny gags in there."

""The Living Daylights"" was the first of two James Bond films featuring Timothy Dalton as 007. It's a solid Bond flick, but rarely cited when the best films of the franchise are discussed. The ""problem"" isn't Dalton because he makes a fine James Bond and was what the series needed in 1987 (when the film was released). Although the Roger Moore era (1973-1985) is my favorite stretch of the franchise, mainly because they're so all-around entertaining, Roger was just too old in 1987 to continue in the role (he was 60 years-old). Plus I think everyone was craving a more serious Bond by 1987 and Dalton delivers the goods.

There’s a lot of good in ""The Living Daylights."" It features a great opening sequence involving skydiving at the Rock of Gibraltar followed by a Jeep-going-down-the-mountain segment. The events switch to Bratislava, Slovakia (but shot in Vienna, Austria) where everything slows down to dramatic intrigue. A short while later there's a cool winter chase episode with Bond and his romantic interest (Maryam d'Abo) in a car with skis (also shot in Austria).

The action-packed last act takes place in Afghanistan (but shot in Morocco and the Mojave Desert). This part of the movie increases in suspense as James and his babe try to get out of the country on a cargo plane, and the film still doesn't end at that point. This climax features three or four excellent suspense scenes and some funny quips as well.

Unfortunately, the film is weak in the area of women. D'Abo is decent in a doe-eyed, winsome way, but her presence is never really capitalized on; she looks good in slacks though. Other than her, there are only brief flashes of women with no one particularly standing out, except maybe a blonde in white shorts.

The cast also includes Joe Don Baker, Jeroen Krabbé, John Rhys-Davies and Andreas Wisniewski, mostly villains or possible villains.

BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Living Daylights"" is not a highlight of the series, it's still a worthwhile Bond flick with the usual staples, albeit shaky in the female department. Aside from Timothy Dalton, who makes a refreshing Bond, the opening and ending sequences are the best parts.

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes.

GRADE: B- || Great entry into the series and wonderful debut for Dalton who was charming, and for me far and away better than any of Roger Moore's movies (though found some of his to be entertaining enough). Not all that fond of this theme song but still catchy enough I suppose. Also features some great aerial stuntwork. **3.75/5** || So Roger Moore has handed the baton of Ian Fleming's ""007"" to Timothy Dalton and this first outing is not at all bad. The story is, perhaps, not the best but this is still an action packed adventure with loads of pyrotechnics and daft gadgets that really does move along swiftly for over two hours. ""Bond"" is assigned to aid would-be defector ""Gen. Koskov"" (Jeroen Krabbé) from Berlin, along the way encountering the lethal cellist ""Kara"" (Maryam d'Abo). A bit of fun with the no-nonsense Julie T. Wallace, a Harrier jump jet and and soon-to-be-trashed English stately home set a scene for the ensuing narrative that mixes perilous international espionage with glamour and plenty of entertainment. Blonde baddie Andreas Wisniewski must have done wonders for the sales of 501s, hammily megalomanic arms dealer Joe Don Baker likewise for the sale of toy soldiers and Desmond Llewelyn continues to provide our hero with plenty of imaginatively designed toys to help him escape from certain death! Art Malik is maybe not the most convincing as an Afghan freedom fighter, and I missed Lois Maxwell's few scenes as the love-struck ""Moneypenny"", but otherwise this is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of good-humoured and pacily directed cold war bravado. It does look better on a big screen - some of the cinematography, especially the aerial photography - lends itself well to a bigger screen and a bit of A-ha at the beginning sets it all off nicely. Not the best of the franchise, but it augers well for this new incarnation."

I saw this film by mere chance. Later, I was surprised to see how well regarded and highly rated it is. It is based on “Transformers”, an animated series for children and teenagers that was quite successful in the 80s and 90s, but which I have to confess I never saw. Recently, Marvel invested millions in live-action films and revived this universe. I haven't seen them in full yet, but this is where I get to know the characters better. What did I expect from this movie? A bit of easy entertainment, assuming the movie would at least do the work of better introducing the characters and story. That's not what I found.

In fact, this is an “inward-facing” film, that is, it is aimed almost exclusively at an audience that already knows the animated series and the characters. Therefore, there are no explanations or introductions, anyone who wants to understand something should go and see the series. Three points down, I thought: I don't feel obligated to watch the series to understand the movie, I can just watch something else and send this movie to the trash can, where it belongs.

Despite everything, I saw the film, and after reading a little about the animated series on the Internet, I understood that the film kills a lot of characters that, until then, were central to the plot, and that the film was released between two seasons, introducing characters who would play a relevant role later. Not being an expert, I wonder to what extent the film was not a kind of publicity move, either for the new season or for the merchandising that is usually associated with this type of television material.

I won't waste my time describing the script, which involves a giant robot that devours planets and the war between the Decepticons and the Autobots, robotic races of alien origin that fight each other. What I can say is that, in addition to being an uninteresting film that will not captivate those who don't know the series, it has a very confusing and far-fetched plot.

The graphics and animations have that kind of quality you find in a lot of animated material from the late 80's, and it made me think about possible influences of Japanese and Korean ""anime"" on American production. Moreover, just a word to salute the effort that Orson Welles must have made to give voice to one of the creatures, at a stage when he was practically at death's door. The distinguished actor would die days after having recorded the material that was used in this film."

It is only when a scheme that involves that latter man's airline employer is front and centre on planet ""Gekko"" that the young man starts to realise what's happening and with the help of Briton ""Sir Larry Wildman"" (a rather too plausible Terence Stamp) changes course a little. It has a very effective supporting cast; the writing and direction from Oliver Stone is quickly paced and well focussed and the story itself shows the rat race in as true a cinematic rendition as I have ever seen. Sure, the shoulder pads and costumes have dated since 1987, but the principles of a dog-eat-dog world are just as worthy of exposure now as they were then. || <em>'Wall Street'</em> makes for an interesting watch, anything to do with the titular financial market is total gobbledygook to me but even I was fairly hooked throughout. The performances of Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen are top notch, so no surprise it turns out to be very good.

I would say that the pacing is not the best, it probably overstays its welcome a bit, though to be honest that's the only thing I have to list under negatives and it's not even a big one. The relatively more energetic ending does do a fair bit to quell any serious run time issues."

Snatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience.

Some rough and tough Romany types join in the fun, headed by a purposely illegible Brad Pitt, while Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro and Rade Serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat to the crooks and gangster stew. The British cement holding the building up comes in the twin forms of Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, with Vinnie Jones once again turning up to frighten the masses. Everything from bare knuckle fighting to bumbled robberies - to dog fighting and shifty arcade empires - are here, with Ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off of the screen. 

As with ""Lock-Stock"", the beauty is in the way violence and humour are deftly blended. Scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny, a pearl of dialogue is never far away from a perilous situation. The comic tone is more close to the knuckle here, Ritchie having fun toying with ethnic and machismo stereotypes, while he brings his bag of visual tricks before it got boring. The narrative is deliciously complex, but much credit to Ritchie for the way he pulls all the threads neatly together in a whirl of scene splicing and cocky literary assuredness.

So it's ""Lock-Stock 2"" then! No bad thing if you happen to be a fan of that sort of wide boy malarkey. If you don't like it? Then jog on sunshine. 8/10 || Peak cinema. I absolutely love this movie, this is a fast-paced, filled with jokes and charismatic characters rollercoaster that's definetely worth watching"

<em>'The Emperor’s New Groove'</em> doesn't, in my opinion, feature a great plot, amazing music or incredible animation. All of that is all fine, though it's the humour that makes this film tick. It isn't belly laugh worthy but from start-to-finish I was amused by the funny nature of it.

The premise is very silly, which works in its favour, with a load of things that don't quite add up, it even references that itself in the third act. That just adds to the fun, they know it's a mindless 78 minutes and make it work.

The reason it comes out so well is thanks to David Spade and John Goodman. Spade is terrific as Kuzco, bringing the perfect wit to the self-serving emperor. Goodman is the overall star though, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the role of Pacha. Patrick Warburton is also decent as Kronk.

It all makes for chilled out viewing, you'll have a good time if you just sit back and enjoy it - as I did."
12509.0,Pollock,"In August of 1949, Life Magazine ran a banner headline that begged the question: ""Jackson Pollock: Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?"" The film is a look back into the life of an extraordinary man, a man who has fittingly been called ""an artist dedicated to concealment, a celebrity who nobody knew."" As he struggled with self-doubt, engaging in a lonely tug-of-war between needing to express himself and wanting to shut the world out, Pollock began a downward spiral.",A true portrait of life and art.,"Drama, History",132,2000-09-06,en,6.7,325,1.1366,"Ed Harris, Marcia Gay Harden, Tom Bower, Jennifer Connelly, Bud Cort",Ed Harris,"painting, artist, success, painter, biography, relationship problems, alcoholism, falling in love, expressionism, 1940s, art exhibition, jackson pollock","_**Downer biography starts weak, but becomes, um, artistic… and moving**_ 

Abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock (Ed Harris) is a struggling artist in New York City in the early 40s when he meets his future wife Lee Krasner, a fellow artist (Marcia Gay Harden). They move to the far end of Long Island where he finally catches a break, but alcoholism threatens his life. Jennifer Connelly shows up in the last act. 

“Pollock” (2000) is an honest biography covering the final fifteen years of the artist’s life from 1941-1956. It was a long-term passion for director/star Ed Harris to bring to the screen. 

The film starts weak with Pollock being portrayed as a troubled artistic weirdo. While I have no doubt that this is true-to-life, the opening act fails to capture the attention of the viewer. What’s worse, there’s an unintentionally amusing scene reminiscent of the Seinfeld episode ""The Visa"" where Jerry pretends to be morose and disturbed, which unexpectedly turns on George’s Asian girlfriend. This “meh” opening is probably why the film failed at the box office.   

Thankfully, the story perks up when the couple moves to a remote area on Long Island. At one point a journalist asks Pollock how he knows when he’s finished with a painting. He insightfully responds, “How do you know when you're finished making love?” This showed that Jackson loved his work and equated creating art to making love. He was a troubled soul, very much so, but painting was his escape, his bliss. It was Pollock’s area of genius and, indeed, his peculiar art is stunning and somehow aesthetically pleasing. I was so moved I wept.

Unfortunately, alcohol was his downfall.

If you don’t mind downer biographies of artists, like “The Doors” (1991) and “Big Sur” (2013), check this one out. There are inspiring moments amidst the melancholy.   

The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in New York City and East Hampton, Long Island. ADDITIONAL CAST: Jeffrey Tambor, Bud Cork, Val Kilmer and John Heard.
