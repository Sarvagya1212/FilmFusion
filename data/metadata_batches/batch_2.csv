Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman. It stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross and Strother Martin. A Panavision/De Luxe production with music by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Conrad Hall.

Not exactly a hit with the critics of the time, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had no such problems at the box office or with longevity of popularity. It is still today one of the few Western films that none Western fans enjoy immensely. Much of this can be attributed to the wonderful buddy buddy chemistry between Newman and Redford, and of course the general blending of ragamuffin drama with cheeky chappy comedy.

The casting as finished was not exactly set in stone, Newman was always in but was originally going to play the part of Sundance. McQueen was pencilled in for Cassidy, as was Lemmon while Beatty was mooted as well, but eventually a chance was taken on Redford and Newman switched to the role of Cassidy. On such things can a movie be made or broken, as it turned out it was the ace in the pack as infamously legendary characters were brought vividly to life.

Only based on the basic real life facts of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang led by Butch Cassidy, the film follows the simple formula of two lovable rogue entrepreneurs being chased by a Pinkerton posse whilst robbing their way to a new life in Bolivia. A gorgeous sepia opening sets the standard for the visual treats to follow, with over a quarter of the film being an extended chase sequence through the landscapes. As Hill and Goldman (Academy Award Best Story/Screenplay) provide the tension in the sequences, Conrad Hall (Academy Award Best Cinematography) brings clarity of beauty that's blended with dust strewn sweat.

The music by Burt Bacharach (Academy Award Best Music) has not always gone down well with critics and fans alike, especially the pivotal ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" (song by country singer B.J. Thomas). But in the context of the scenes, and the changing of the West (even the Western movie in fact), the music mostly works. Yes, ""Raindrops"" is a touch corny in essence, but the accompanying sequences as the bicycle replaces the horse for a major metaphor - and the warmth of the Etta Place (Ross a little bland) and Cassidy friendship is born out - it's hardly a film killer. In fact it's a daring move by the makers.

Hugely influential on Westerns that would follow and spawning further tales of the exploits of Butch and Sundance, Hill's movie has well and truly earned its much loved reputation. With the constant by-play between Redford and Newman always engaging (who are those guys?), a number of iconic scenes firmly ensconced in movie folklore, and technical smarts to cherish, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid never takes its foot of the pedal or its grip on your heart. Because as the freeze frame sepia ending passes muster as a blaze of glory, it's indeed true that Hill, Hall, Goldman, Newman and Redford have made a true Western classic. 9/10
 || I found this movie to be entertaining and intelligent, sticking surprisingly close to real events a lot of the time. Robert Redford and Paul Newman have a good chemistry together, as they will illustrate again in The Sting.

This was one of if not the most popular movie the year it came out. Apparently s9me viewers feel it can’t decide whether it is a western or a comedy, but as an author who writes novels that cross genres a bit, I do not mind seeing it in films.

The scenery is grand and the old time photography that is featured at times is a neat addition. The ending is one place where it varies from what we know of the facts, but it remains just true enough to be okay, as it adds excitement to the scene. It is one of those trademark endings. || This is what you might call ""lightly likable"".
It's a comic Western about the two famous outlaws of the Hole in the Wall gang.
I saw it at the Louisville cinema when it came out, and I wasn't thrilled, but I wasn't totally averse to it.
I remember when the scene where Sundance (Redford) looks like he is going to rape the gorgeous school teacher (Katherine Ross) telling her to undress at gunpoint, and she does so, and then when you think it will be violent, she asks him what the H.. took him so long. I remember it because while I thought it was corny, one hot girl in the theater started laughing and commenting on how funny it was. I thought it was ordinary, but some people really ate this stuff up.
Butch (Newman) is the thinker, and Sundance is the muscle. Like I say, the comedy is of the lightly likable sort. I'm not sure it will be appreciated that much over time, but who knows?"

<em>'When Harry Met Sally…'</em> is one of those films that I've heard a tonne about but without finding out anything tangible about the plot, the only thing in that regard that I knew was the Katz's Delicatessen location - not even the full scene, just the famous quote (out of context) from Estelle Reiner. Of course as a romcom drama you know mostly what you're gonna get, but this does have more to it in fairness; big fan of the time jumps, e.g.

Billy Crystal is great value throughout, amusing and even touching at moments. Same goes for Meg Ryan, naturally, who I know of only by name; I never remember her face for some odd reason. Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, meanwhile, make for strong supports to the two leads. || Were it not for the now legendary scene in the diner - and, for me, the lovely follow-up from the observing woman at the next table to the waitress, this would just be another quickly-paced, run-of-the-mill, romantic comedy that's exceedingly heavy on the dialogue. It's all about the evolution of the relationship between ""Harry"" (Billy Crystal) and ""Sally"" (Meg Ryan). They've been friends since God was a boy, but always preferred to date other people. Now clearly, as we progress through this feast of relationship mishaps, that isn't really working and they come back to their perennial question. Would them having sex ruin a beautiful friendship? The story is set across quite an extended timeframe, and that allows Rob Reiner to reset the episodic nature of the comedy and introduce new partners for us to appreciate, like and loathe as the punchline to the story becomes as obvious as the sun in the sky. The writing is witty and pithy at times, yes, but there's just way too much of it and even though there's a semblance of chemistry between Ryan and Crystal on screen, I just found the whole thing just a bit too obvious. It's not a bad watch, and I know I'm very much in the minority of opinion here, but this is really only a standard vehicle for two averagely talented stars, one of whom can ""yes, yes, yes..."" with the best of them."

As the story now gradually unfolds, we discover that ""Travis"" has a son who lives with ""Walt"" but we are unsure as to just what has led him to his current, absent-minded, predicament. Unwilling to fly, the two take the long road trip back getting to know each other and slowly building a renewed sense of trust before he is to be re-introduced to the son (Hunter Carson) he hasn't seen for four years and who requires some answers of his own. The last half hour brings the threads together neatly, if a little conveniently, allowing a few brief appearances from Nastassja Kinski that brings the story of ""Travis"" and his trauma full circle. To be honest, I found the actual plot rather weak, indeed the story isn't up to much at all really - it's the performance from HDS that is measured and engaging. His flawed character gradually comes out of his self-induced shell as it seems he is learning about himself almost at the same pace as we are - and that makes the film compelling for the most part. It's a story that takes it's time, and watching it I found it did take me a few minutes to get myself into a suitably low gear to appreciate it. It's isn't a plod, or a slow watch - it is a nuanced, occasionally amusing, search for identity - oh, and for a field in Paris, Texas! || **A film full of qualities, but which will not please the general public.**

There are films that are made for commercial audiences and others that are clearly made to please specialized critics and film theorists. Although this film was present on the commercial circuit, the truth is that Wim Wenders directed this film for critics and film festival audiences, and this explains why critics love it and why the general public hardly knows this work. . About me? To be quite honest, I didn't particularly like the film, and it's not the kind of film I like to watch or watch with pleasure. However, I am the first to recognize that it is a work full of artistic and technical qualities, and that it deserves a close look by any student and fan of the seventh art.

The plot revolves around a man who spent four years wandering through desert areas of Texas due to a huge psychological shock. We don't know what he suffered, but it is obvious that he is not well when he is finally rescued by his brother, and he spends a long time without saying a word, just trying to resume his march to nowhere. As the plot develops, we understand the emotional void he feels and desperately seeks to fill. The reunion with his son, whom he hadn't seen for years, will mark the beginning of a journey of inner healing, of reuniting with himself and the hurts of his past. The idea of family, the crisis of moral and social values, the role of men and women in marriage and the absence of feelings are themes that the film, very discreetly, addresses throughout the story it tells us.

Anyone who wants to see this film should prepare themselves for a long, very visual experience: the film is a grueling two and a half hours long and the action is quite slow. Wenders, who even thought about becoming a painter, likes to work very carefully on the visual and pictorial side of his films, and the slow action allows him, in this specific case, to explore to the maximum the visual beauty of desert scenes or urban landscapes. of Texas, where the action is concentrated. Do I need to say that the choice of sets and filming locations was one of the aspects that I liked most? Thanks to a good cinematography job, each one looks even more beautiful, wild and rude. Harmonizing perfectly with all this, the soundtrack, on guitar, plays a little with the Wild West and with the melodies that we usually associate with the Western style.

In addition to a very well done and solid plot, and good visual and technical values, the film also features the extraordinary work of Harry Dean Stanton. The actor has never been one of those stars that draws crowds, but he has quality and gives us here, probably, the best work of his film career. He is solid and impactful enough to capture our full attention with a minimum of words and facial expressions, and he doesn't say a word or change his facial expression during the first half hour of the film. The film also has excellent contributions from Dean Stockwell and Nastassja Kinski, and even young Hunter Carson does a well-done job. However, the stage is all Stanton's. || I discovered Paris, Texas through Letterboxd's Top 250 Films with Most Fans, having never heard of it before. The 8.1 IMDB rating caught my attention, so I decided to give this acclaimed film a shot.

What Worked

The film starts genuinely intriguing. Travis's complete silence in the opening act was captivating - Harry Dean Stanton delivers a convincing portrayal of someone emotionally hollowed out by four years of isolation. His emotionless face perfectly captures that shell-shocked quality. I was particularly drawn to the early domestic scenes, like when Travis starts polishing boots at his brother's house, and there were hints of tension when Walt's wife seemed a bit too flirty with him. I thought something compelling might materialize from that dynamic.

The cinematography deserves praise - watching those American Southwest landscapes in Blu-ray quality was genuinely beautiful. The visuals really pop, and Ry Cooder's guitar score effectively establishes that southwestern mood with its twangy, atmospheric sound.

Where It Lost Me

The momentum completely died when Travis tried to pick up Hunter from school. Up until that point, I was invested in the mystery: what happened during those four missing years? Unfortunately, the film abandons this intriguing setup in favor of a more conventional family reunion story that felt pedestrian.

The famous peep show booth scene between Travis and Jane left me cold. While Jane showed some emotional range as the conversation progressed, Travis remained frustratingly robotic - it felt like he was reading from a script rather than having a genuine emotional breakthrough. The scene dragged without delivering the psychological depth it clearly aimed for. It's nowhere near the caliber of something like the psychologist scenes in Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story

Final Verdict

Paris, Texas suffers from prioritizing mood and atmosphere over compelling storytelling. While I typically don't mind slower-paced films, this one felt too empty, too ""nothing happening for 2.5 hours."" The runtime could definitely be trimmed, though I understand some scenes were meant to develop character relationships.

If I could change one thing, I'd focus more on the mystery of Travis's disappearance rather than his quest to reunite his fractured family. The beginning promised something more psychologically complex than what we ultimately got.

The film might resonate with viewers from another era or those who prefer European art cinema's contemplative approach, but for modern audiences seeking more substantial plotting, it's hard to recommend. A solid 6/10 - not bad, but certainly not deserving of its lofty reputation."

Have you ever tried to do something extremely complicated and ambitious and failed because of the enormity of what you were trying to do? I bet that even those to whom this has never happened will be able to name some examples: Pharaonic public works that went wrong or never came to fruition in full, private projects and companies that failed because of their own mistakes. There will be no shortage of examples, and I think we can add this film to that list, since the main flaw stems from the ambitions of its creator.

Wim Wenders is one of the great German directors of our time and no one can deny him this merit, not even those who don't really appreciate his style, or who criticize him (with some propriety) for having transformed, in recent years, into that kind of director that he criticized at the beginning of his career. However, what he wanted to do in this film was a task far beyond his capabilities and ingenuity. An epic lasting more than twenty hours that was condensed into a summary of three and a half hours and, years later, partially restored in the form of the “director's version”, lasting almost six hours. I made the mistake of trying to see precisely the latter, believing that I was seeing the version closest to the creator's vision. However, what he gives us is so uninteresting and so confusing that I wasted my time.

The story begins with the threat of an Indian nuclear satellite, which will crash to earth, and then introduces Claire, a young woman who seems to be looking for a direction in her life in the midst of a futile existence. After a car accident in which she meets two bank robbers, she agrees to take the stolen money to Paris, in exchange for a percentage. In the midst of this, she helps a mysterious man who appears to be fleeing from a murderer and who steals some of her money. Committed to recovering him, she follows him around the world and ends up hiring a private detective.

As I believe you can already understand from this summary, the plot is not devoid of good ideas and had potential. With the characters always on the move, traveling the world, the film is not monotonous and has some potential for light comedy (although Wenders' humor is completely German, and we know what that means). However, the film gets lost in constant twists and turns that go nowhere. Circulating from one country to another, the plot wastes hours of our lives in a story without substance or content. Wenders doesn't spare us and gives us long scenes where the characters drive cars, walk or make phone calls. He looks like a five-year-old kid who starts telling his parents the most complicated story just to ask for a toy he saw in a store. This is what ruins the film and makes it unbearable. Oh, and of course, the issue of the falling satellite ends up completely forgotten in all this.

The production values are quite good considering it's a European film and the millions from the Hollywood machine are absent from the equation. Wenders managed to create some somewhat futuristic elements such as public telephones with video calling or police motorcycles with a bold and bizarre appearance. The urban settings seem hostile, with all sorts of trash and graffiti. The cinematography is magnificent, and the director makes the most of it, as is usual in the films he makes, but on the other hand, the soundtrack is virtually inaudible and does not add any quality to the final work.

Solveig Dammartin was a good choice for the main character. She is elegant, and gives her character a special charm throughout the film. Unfortunately, she can't do miracles with the material given to her. Sam Neill also makes the most of the occasion in the best way he can, but the film is far from being one of the best of his career, and the same can be said of William Hurt. Both are committed, and the work of this trio of actors ends up being the most redeeming value that the film has to present to us. Unfortunately, they are stuck with the incoming material, which completely kills their efforts."

Special Edition.

I love it, I really do. OK! So it's basically a monster on the loose piece, but the setting at a sci-fi prison colony - complete with nutty religious shards - makes for a thrillingly atmospheric ride. Of course if this was merely a stand alone film, where there was no Alien and Aliens previously, I feel sure the special edition cut would be thought of differently. 

A roll call of Brit thesps line up for some tension filled entertainment as director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson provide a look that is both beautiful and scary. The metallic nightmare of chambers and cold concrete fused together for some hellish stalk and paranoia. Industrial Punk? Steam Punk? Cyber Punk? Fincher Punk? Hey man, we gotta give it a name! And of course there's Siggy Weaver front and center, the reassuring presence among the murderers, rapists and child molesters. 

I could live without the attempt at a transcendent finale, but in extended form this has much to light your fires. It also showed that Fincher would be a director to watch - imagine if had he been left alone to craft his own vision? His subsequent career and standing makes a mockery of the studio execs involved in the making of Alien³. 8/10
 || **Superior in every department to the basic shoot em up, Aliens,** 

Alien 3 returns the franchise to its artistic horror roots established by Ridley Scott. No more Disney kids, happy endings and machine gun wielding irritants.

This movie is a beautifully bleak experience and is the true sequel to Alien (1979). Performances are excellent all round - especially Charles Dance as prison doctor, Clemens, and, of course, Sigourney Weaver - who gives us her best performance as the downtrodden Ripley.

A masterwork by David Fincher that restores the horror and dignity to the series. Thank goodness for Alien 3!

A newlywed couple moves into a shoreline house on Long Island with their three little kids. The house was the scene of a mass killing a year earlier but the parents (James Brolin & Margot Kidder) didn’t think it mattered and, besides, it enabled them to purchase the homestead at a much reduced price. Then strange things start happening.  

""The Amityville Horror"" (1979) was arguably the best haunted house movie up to that point in time and was hugely successful at the box office, inspiring a gazillion sequels, remakes and documentaries. There are similarities to ""The Shining"" (1980): Both movies were based on books published in 1977, but the film version of ""The Amityville Horror"" was released a year prior to “The Shining” and was based on the supposedly true story of what happened to the Lutz family whereas Stephen King’s novel was purely fictional.

The 2005 remake with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George deviates even further from the book and is a brisker, more modern version of the story. Yet this classic version still works as a moody and mysterious drama with horrific touches. Unlike the remake, the movie takes its time to establish and develop the characters and I appreciated this; for instance, Mr. Lutz's employee (Michael Sacks) and his spiritually curious girlfriend (Helen Shaver), as well as the two priests (Rod Steiger and Don Stroud).

Gene Siskel criticized it on the grounds that it wasn’t enjoyable. Seriously? Since when are horror flicks supposed to be enjoyable? This is a realistic drama with some creepy paranormal things thrown on top, based on an allegedly true account. I don’t think the filmmakers were shooting for “enjoyable.” That said, underneath the darkness the picture has a good, warm heart.

Was the actual Lutz’s account true or not? They seemed to have experienced some troubling things at the house during their month-long stay and passed a Polygraph by two top polygraph experts but, assuming their story wasn’t concocted for profit (which many believe was the case), the events were certainly amped-up for the book & movie for the purpose of an entertaining tale. By the way, the large Dutch Colonial house still stands in Amityville, albeit the exterior was remodeled and hence the two distinctive windows appear standard.

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes and was mostly shot in New Jersey as follows: Toms River (house), Point Pleasant (church), Georgian Court University in Lakewood (meeting with the hooded priest), Ocean County and Scotch Plains; as well as indoor scenes done at MGM Studios in Culver City, California; plus some shots done in Long Island, Connecticut and Glendale, California.

A widowed therapist (Martin Sheen) moves back to New York City to find himself assisting the NYPD in a series of slayings linked to a Caribbean Voodoo-like cult. Things get worse when he discovers they want his son for a human sacrifice.  Helen Shaver plays his landlord and possible romantic interest.

“The Believers” (1987) is an adult-oriented crime drama that gets increasingly horrific. The plot and tone are akin to “Wolfen” (1981), albeit with the brujería cult replacing the super-wolves. It’s leagues superior to the similar “The Serpent and the Rainbow” (1988).

The diabolic angle makes for some ugliness (e.g. death due to electric shock, suicides, grisly sacrifices, snakes and creepy arachnids), but there are rays of light as well. Sheen is outstanding as the protagonist while Shaver offers her wares to the table. The shocking spider sequence was later ripped off by ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"" (2005).

Great fun, Fred Walton, Frank Mancuso Jr. and Danilo Bach tap cheekily into the 1980s obsession with slasher films, and produce a self aware horror movie of mighty dark comedy proportions. Quite often when film makers try to laugh as they bite the hand that feeds them they fall flat on their faces, not so here. Ok! It’s hardly genius film making but the makers instil their picture with interesting killings, twists and turns, and even an audacious narrative that would only be appreciated some years later. Horror movie conventions are adhered to with tongue stuck in bloody cheek, none more so than with an ending that will infuriate some, but conversely will bring on the chortles in others. 7/10 || Fun horror movie that is on the predictable side but I still found it pretty entertaining. The ensemble cast was alright with the most well known face, at now, is of course Thomas F. Wilson (Biff). Not sure how high up this is amongst the holiday horror movies, but I liked it. **3.75/5** || _**April Fools slasher**_

Ten youths about to graduate college celebrate at a remote island mansion in the Great Northwest, soon to be inherited by one them (Deborah Foreman). Unfortunately, they start getting hacked one-by-one. Who’s the killer?        

""April Fool’s Day"" (1986) is a slasher/horror in the cabin-in-the-woods mold; it’s just that the ‘cabin’ in this case is a magnificent mansion. The presence of Amy Steel, who played Ginny in “Friday the 13th Part II” (1981), brings to mind that series but, besides Amy, the female cast isn’t as notable, although it’s okay. You might remember Deborah Foreman from “Valley Girl” (1983) and “Real Genius” (1985). 

On the other side of the gender spectrum, Ken Olandt is a Kevin Bacon lookalike while Clayton Rohner is reminiscent of Val Kilmer.

Regrettably, the pacing is off and so not enough suspense is worked up. Any “Friday the 13th” flick is all-around more entertaining, not to mention “Slumber Party Massacre II” (1987), which has similarities. But “April Fool’s Day” gets points for the outstanding location and something revolutionary that happens, which I can’t give away.  
  
The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot at St John estate, Victoria, British Columbia, with additional studio stuff done in Los Angeles. It was rebooted or reimagined (not remade) in 2008.

571.0,The Birds,Thousands of birds flock into a seaside town and terrorize the residents in a series of deadly attacks.,"...and remember, the next scream you hear may be your own!","Horror, Thriller",120,1963-03-28,en,7.52,4230,3.8203,"Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette, Veronica Cartwright",Alfred Hitchcock,"pet shop, seclusion, playground, fireplace, seagull, bird attack, socialite, based on short story, practical joke, schoolteacher, lovebird, shopkeeper, unsolved mystery, schoolhouse, frightened","Birds of a different feather do indeed flock together.  

The Birds is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screenplay by Evan Hunter from the story of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier. It stars Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, Veronica Cartwright and Ethel Griffies. Cinematography is by Robert Burks and editing by George Tomasini.

Mother's love? Better to be ditched or loved?

When animals attack! The only outright horror movie that Alfred Hitchcock ever directed, The Birds sees the great man get the utmost terror from something so amiable in our lives - Birds! Modern day critics can hark on about it being dated all they like, it still doesn't detract from what a frenzied experience ""The Birds"" can still be - let alone what it did for cinema goers in 1963! Admittedly upon small screen ventures too much is missed or under enhanced, which is a crying shame.

But it isn't dark Annie! It's a full moon.

Plotting is simple in trajectory terms. Hip socialite Melanie Daniels (Hedren) has a friendly vocal joust in a pet shop with handsome Mitch Brenner (Taylor), the result of which sees Melanie, on a mischievous whim, buy a couple of lovebirds and set off for Mitch's weekend retreat out in Bodega Bay to deliver them as a show of devilish womanhood. Upon arrival in Bodega Bay, though, Melanie seems to be the spark for the birds in the area to start attacking humans, and pretty soon the attacks escalate and intensify...

Hitchcock and Hunter offer up no reasons or answers for what occurs in Bodega Bay (to keep it murky we learn late on via radio that other towns become affected), and famously the ending is open ended as well, forcing the audience to unravel ideas themselves. There's no musical score in the film, thus Hitchcock gets the terror and tension out of editing, bird effects and unholy sounds. The pacing is also a key area, it's a good hour before things go decidedly nasty, the wait keeps the viewer on edge, we seriously get to know the principal characters (the actors worked well by Hitch) and then the terror is unleashed. Perfect.

Hitchcock's skill at staging a memorable scene is well evident here. The climbing frame that sees one crow arrive, cutaway as Melanie smokes on a bench, back to the frame and now it's four crows, cutaway, back, and five crows – eight – then a ""murder of crows"". The birds first attack at the birthday party, the telephone kiosk, gas station mayhem, the birds swooping into view above the school roof and the POV viewpoint as we join a bird hovering above a town under siege, all great scenes, as is the crowning glory that is the eerie silence that accompanies the edge of your seat finale.

Motifs are plentiful, from Mothers to sexuality, from broken crockery - to glass - to abandonment fears, Hitch has fun, especially with the human interactions, or lack of in certain scenes. It's a film that cries out for analysis, such is the director's want, in turn it's a riveting horror picture and a crafty enigma. It sounded daft as a basic idea for a film, and some must have thought Hitchcock had missed the boat of the creature feature boom of the 50s. Yet ""The Birds"" stands tall and proud as a damn fine piece of film from a true maestro of his craft, one of his last true classics and still today, over 50 years after its release, the film provokes theory discussion and visual terror in equal measure. 9/10 || Certainly has some creepy imagery and the acting was mostly passable, and I guess it works as a B-movie horror-thriller, but I never really found the birds all that terrifying. Probably the lower end of the Hitchcock movies I've seen. **3.25/5** || Terrific horror film! Terrific film! But my impression is that The Birds is not really about the birds. To me this movie is all about the characters, their stories and finding something they didn't expect to find in each others. They felt real to me, they evolved and changed alongside their relationship with each others. In the end, even though they are going through hell, they managed to find some closure."

Some teens (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) witness a strange Jell-O-like substance horrifically assault some people in a Pennsylvania town, but the police have a hard time believing their story.       

Despite its datedness, “The Blob” (1958) is worth checking out as a window into small town America in 1957 (when it was shot) plus the fact that it was Steve McQueen’s debut starring role, not to mention the movie is genuinely scary in a quaint 50’s way. My only criticism is that Steve is clearly an adult male and not a teenager or youngster. He was 27 during shooting, but looked at least 30. 

Larry Hagman did a sequel fourteen years later called “Beware! the Blob” (aka “Son of Blob”) after his rise to TV stardom with I Dream of Jeannie and before his return to popularity as J.R. in Dallas. It throws in quirky comedic bits amidst the serious horror and it is interesting to compare the two movies because of the social changes brought about by the radical events of the 60s. The sequel is an entertaining window into the counterculture of that time (specifically 1971 when the film was shot) and how the hippies or semi-hippies gelled with those of traditional culture. To me, it wasn’t a big deal as there’s always a “generation gap” between young and old in every decade, which can be observed even in the original film.

A quality remake of the original movie came out in 1988 and, like “Beware! The Blob,” walked the balance beam between utter horror and amusing non-horror. It had a bigger budget compared to Hagman’s film, but the addition of a subplot revealing the creature's origins as decidedly earth-centric took away from the Blob's otherworldly and creepy ambiance. Still, it’s a worthwhile reimagining.   

The movie runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot entirely in southeast Pennsylvania in areas west of Philadelphia (Phoenixville, Downingtown, Valley Forge, Royersford & Chester Springs).

GRADE: A-/B+ || The campy theme over the strange title sequence may make you think it will be a very campy horror film that doesn't take itself seriously, you would be half right, but you'd also be half wrong. It is campy, but it takes its self seriously most of the time.

Everytime I watch it it gets a few laughs and giggles out of me, I've been watching it since I was five and I recently watched it for the 7th time.

Dr. MacFarlane and John Gray share a murky past, but just what is this hold that the lurching Gray has over the eminent Doctor?. Based on a Robert Louis Stevenson short story, The Body Snatcher contains tight direction from Mr Versatile, Robert Wise - all the classy Gothicism one comes to expect from producer Val Lewton - and a stunningly effective performance from Boris Karloff. The piece neatly puts itself out as a kind of sequel to the infamous story of Burke & Hare, where here our main protagonists are clouded over by a link to the dastardly duo who purloined cadavers for cash in the 1820s.

What stands out with this picture is the wonderful pacing, nothing is rushed to try and jolt fear into the viewer, it's sedate and framed in a marvellous Gothic texture by the makers. The core story line is of course one of great distaste, but this is a medical quandary in the name of research that makes for a thought provoking narrative. We are put into a position very early on where we so want to see a young girl cured of her ills, and thus this axis of the film is neatly surrounded by the lurking horror that begins to unfold. You have to suggest that this is great writing from Stevenson, Lewton & MacDonald.

Boris Karloff is Gray, a large shuffling man who is the body snatcher of the title, he be a smirking and well spoken Gent, which really shouldn't be scary, and yet Karloff manages to chill the blood in every scene that he is in. Henry Daniell is MacFarlane, a very emotive performance as the character is twisted by his pursuit of medical achievements whilst having Gray's looming presence constantly hovering over him. Rounding out the cast with thespian effect is Russell Wade as protégé in waiting, Donald Fettes, Bela Lugosi (a classic horror fans dream comes real in one great sequence with Karloff) as Joseph, and Edith Atwater as loyal love interest Meg Camden.

However, the actors all play second fiddle to the makers' work here. Gloomy cobbled streets come shining to the fore, Gray's hovel like abode is cloaked in dark shadows with the odd flicker of fire light, while the stone surrounds come across as monolithic structures. Some great sequences as well, a particular one uses the characters' shadows to tell the story under the watchful gaze of Gray's cat, and then the final reel, which is mood personified and perfectly puts closure on this fine piece of fevered Gothic work. Highly recommended. 8/10"

Some brief nudity and a HOT scene with Winona as she runs though the garden in her PJ's. Not only do I gave Bram Stoker's Dracula 5 stars, BUT I rate it in my Top 10 all-time. MUST SEE! || The script is an unevenly good adaptation of the novel. It resolves better Dracula's aims and motivations through the love story.  Also, it provides a more understandable glue to join the 4 men chasing Dracula from a XXth century point of view and removes unimportant characters having a more ""round"" story.

However, due to some changes certain parts are now incoherent since they were not properly adapted to the other changes. In addition, other parts are totally impossible to follow due to the amount of details only commented quickly along the movie.

Costumes and general artistic work is superb but it drives the movie to some extreme stravaganza that, in the case of the actors' performances make some parts of the movie completely overacted.

In any case, I think this is an iconic movie worth watching more than once. || Although it certainly won't make you easily forget earlier interpretations of the seminal horrific character by Max Schreck, Bela Lugosi, Sir Christopher Lee or Klaus Kinski, Gary Oldman definitely finds a way under your skin.

This is a cracking tale of science fiction, horror and even romance as the monster ends up endowed with far more ""humanity"" than either scientist. Una O'Connor and Elsa Lanchester are both great too, though feature sparingly. The special effects stand better scrutiny than many a sci-film being made twenty years later and the cannibalised classical musical score brings tension, joy, love and despair a-plenty to compensate for, admittedly a rather stilted script. Easily amongst the best ""Frankenstein"" films ever made in my book. || **_Dr. Frankenstein and his former mentor try to create a mate for the monster_**

The monster (Karloff) survives the windmill burning of the previous film and wanders the countryside of Bavaria while Doctor Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) approaches Baron Frankenstein (Colin Clive) with the idea of collaborating to create a mate for the monster, which presumably will domesticate him. 

This Universal classic from 1935 was one of the first sequels to a mainstream film and arguably started the concept of a movie franchise or, at least, a cinematic trilogy: The 1931 movie, this sequel, and the follow-up “Son of Frankenstein” (1939) all feature Boris Karloff as the monster along with other overlapping actors and characters. It has a story arc and comes to a clear ending in the third flick. 

Valerie Hobson is a highlight on the female front as Elizabeth Frankenstein (replacing Mae Clarke from the first film). Meanwhile Elsa Lanchester plays the dual role of Mary Shelley and the titular character at the end.

The prologue presents a glaring issue since Mary conveys this sequel to Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley not long after the success of “Frankenstein,” which was published in 1818. Since the film obviously contains fashions & technology of the early 1930s mixed with elements of the 1800s (which the director described as an “alternate universe”), Mary would have to be predicting what it would be like in the distant future, at least 1899 (which is the tomb’s date on a recently deceased woman in the story).

This is one of those rare occasions where the sequel is better. It’s marked by increased camp (but not overkill), the monster’s memorable friendship with a blind man in the forest, and the fact that he learns to speak in a monosyllabic fashion (which Karloff objected to). It’s an iconic addition to the Frankenstein story, a Gothic horror tragedy highlighted by unforgettable renditions of the monster and his “bride.”

The B&W movie runs 1 hour, 15 minutes, and was shot entirely in the studio at Universal Studios in Greater Los Angeles.

Martin Scorsese’s Cape Fear tells the story of a brutal rapist who waited for so long just to be able to avenge his wrath towards Attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for he believed that Bowden could have done much better in defending for his case. This film is well-told with so many suspense elements through some shocking events throughout the film. 

Cape Fear is one of the examples of film whose remake, in some ways, considered outwits the original one produced in 1962 starred Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. This is quite understandable remembering the remake was filmed many years later, with sufficient advancements in technology and financial supports. In Cape Fear, De Niro managed to portray the chilling Max Cady successfully. He had a best-laid plan to avenge his disappointments/hatred towards Bowden by studying laws in prison just to be able to find the flaws that in the end shall leave him untouchable by the law. 

Sometimes it’s amazing to understand how an actor/actress willing to go through for the sake of a role. Robert De Niro paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look suitably bad for the role of Max Cady whereas right after filming, he paid $20,000 to have them fixed.  De Niro migh have been spectacular in portraying Cady but we also have to consider how remarkable and superb were Peck and Mitchum. || **A really very good movie, and proof that there are remakes that are really worth it for their quality and good execution.**

I've just seen this movie (which I've actually seen on television, but without paying enough attention to a movie I want to write something about) and once again I was very impressed. The truth is that, without wanting to legitimize the practice, which is often taken to exaggeration, there are remakes that manage to justify themselves, not only for the quality they demonstrate, but also for the gift, not to mention, of drawing the public's attention to the older movies. I can give my personal example: it was the contact with some remakes that made me know that there were older films and go looking for them to be able to see them.

This film maintains, without significant changes, the story told in the older film, which dates from 1962 and was starred by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum: very briefly, it is the story of a lawyer who finds himself persecuted and threatened, with his wife and daughter, by a spiteful ex-con who blames him for many years of incarceration. Of course, there are things that change between the two films, and this film has the advantage of not giving us a simple story where a terribly bad man wants to harm a very nice man. Bowden, the lawyer, is a man with a past full of mistakes (much like many of us) who hasn't always been good at his job and his role as a husband and father, and we see that, and the way character is called upon to face the consequences. The sexual theme, which the original film attenuates a lot (due to the restrictions imposed on cinema at the time), is also more pronounced here, transforming Max Cady into an almost perfect pervert.

In addition to the nuances that make the film denser and with a more complex story, we can count on an excellent cast where Robert De Niro steals all the attention, thanks to a powerful, convincing and genuinely menacing interpretation. This film is worth seeing just to savor the actor's performance. Nick Nolte played attorney Sam Bowden, a man who desperately seeks to protect his family. The actor is good and does a good job. Much less interesting, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis play the lawyer's wife and daughter in an ambiguous and sometimes very unpleasant way: Lange can still reasonably extricate herself from the challenge she has, but Lewis has turned her character into a kind of teenage nymphet who sees Cady as a terrifying sexual temptation rather than having the discernment and intelligence necessary to at least realize the risk her entire family is running. Also a reminder of the cameos of honor by Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam, three actors who were pivotal in the original film. Incidentally, this film would end up being the last in the life of Peck, who died shortly after.

Martin Scorsese made this film as a means to an end, that is, a way to get the studio to invest in another film he wanted to make. Anyway, and for whatever reason, it was a good bet by the director. The film deserves our attention and is full of merits. The filming work and cinematography are excellent, the sets and costumes too, with an emphasis, of course, on the scenes on the Bowden houseboat. The effects were also well done, although not particularly extraordinary. The central score of this film is the same as its older counterpart, composed by Bernard Herrmann, one of the best and best conceived by the composer, and which is already part of the collective memory. || ""Cady"" (Robert De Niro) is released from jail after serving eighteen years for rape. He alights on the doorstep of his erstwhile defending counsel ""Bowden"" (Nick Nolte) with his cigar and his red sports car and generally starts intimidating the man and his family. Why? Well it turns out that the lawyer had buried some evidence during the trial that may have cast doubt on the voracity of the evidence given by the victim - and so now, ""Cady"" has revenge in mind. Now I loved the 1962 version of this film - Robert Mitchum is superb - and so I was always a bit sceptical about this remake. No, this honestly isn't a patch on that version, but that's as much to do with it being in colour and with it featuring the really poorly cast Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange. De Niro thrives in his element as the manipulative and genuinely odious character whilst Martin Scorsese allows the tension to increase, the sense of desperation and control to blossom and for a genuine sense of peril to develop. Hats can also go off for a strong effort from Juliette Lewis as the daughter ""Danni"" - a naive young girl whom ""Cady"" soon has in his sights. The setting for the denouement is as good as cinema can offer - an houseboat and a rainstorm - and as remakes go, this is not bad at all."

""Cat People"" came out in 1982 and is a modern take on the classic 1942 film. Nastassja Kinski and Malcolm McDowell are siblings cursed to become were-panthers if sexually aroused. The only way they can become human again is to kill a fellow human. The idea is absurd and fantastical, but ""Cat People"" takes the subject absolutely seriously. John Heard plays a zoo manager who falls in love with Kinski’s character, while Annette O'Toole plays the third person in the romantic triangle.

The movie’s engrossing and has style & pizazz. For instance, the flashback scenes of the ancient panther tribe doing rituals in an orange desert are surreal and captivating; the accompanying atmospheric music by Giorgio Moroder adds to the mood nicely, along with David Bowie’s theme song. While both are decidedly 80’s, they fit the flick and are somehow timeless.

Both Kinski and McDowell are properly cat-like. McDowell, as usual, has a weird and diabolic air about him. John Heard is fine as the protagonist and redhead O'Toole is simply gorgeous. Speaking of which, Kinski is indeed quite attractive, as observed in the scene of her fishing with Heard in hot pants and wader boots, but O'Toole steals Kinski’s thunder a bit, particularly in the pool sequence.

This is a great flick for showcasing the New Orleans area and the Sothern Gothic ambiance thereof. Keep in mind that it’s definitely a horror flick and so can be pretty brutal at times. On a related note, if nudity offends you then you might want to skip it as many of the characters are shown totally nude or near nude.

The film runs just shy of 2 hours and was shot in the New Orleans area with some stuff done in the Los Angeles region (e.g. studio work and the panther tree sequence).

11349.0,Cape Fear,"Sam Bowden witnesses a rape committed by Max Cady and testifies against him.

Lee Thompson,"small town, psychopath, poison, ex-detainee, boat, film noir, lawyer, killing a dog, listening to the radio, aggressive, intense, threat to family, family terrorized","Max Cady isn't a man who makes idle threats.

Max Cady is fresh out of prison and down in Florida looking for someone in particular. That person is lawyer Sam Bowden, the man who Cady holds responsible for his years of incarceration. Once Bowden realises that Cady is out for revenge, and that his family are in serious danger, he turns to the police for help, but unable to get help from them, he goes outside of the law, and all parties are heading for the foreboding place known as Cape Fear. 

Brilliant villainy, unnerving story and suspense pouring from every frame, Cape Fear is an abject lesson in how to produce a quality thriller that's borderline horror. Based on a novel called ""The Executioners"" written by John D. MacDonald, the piece is bolstered by some perfect casting decisions and by having a director able to pace with precision, thus it stands tall and proud as a highlight in a tough old genre. Robert Mitchum is Cady, a big hulking man with an immoral face, he terrifies purely by his undaunted objectives, with Mitchum clearly revelling in such a role. As Bowden we have Gregory Peck, playing it right as the uptight and stiff lawyer forced to find toughness from within. Backed up by excellent cameos from Martin Balsam, Telly Savalas and Polly Bergen, Cape Fear also features one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores, a complete and utter nerve shredder with psychotic strings and brooding brass, it hangs in the ears long after the film has finished. 

What lifts this above many of its thriller peers is that the dialogue is firmly accentuated by the character portrayals, watch as Cady calmly digresses about how he learnt the law in prison, or how he seeps with deviant sexual aggression when confronting the Bowden women, it's badness personified and literally a force of evil, so much so that the breaking of an egg is metaphorically a portent of pain unbound. Director J. Lee Thompson's career shows him to have been a steady if unspectacular director at times, but he directs this with no amount of zip and he deftly reins it in for a stifling last quarter at the Cape Fear bayou (his interview on the disc releases is full of love and insights). Along with his cinematographer, Sam Leavitt, Thompson expertly uses shadow and light to consistently keep the feeling of dread looming as much of a hostile presence as Bobby Mitchum is throughout the play. 

By the time the finale reveals the denouement, it's hoped that you are as living on your nerves as this particular viewer always is when viewing this clinically sharp piece of thriller cinema. 9/10 || **A good thriller with a lot of suspense and tension, which deserved to be reviewed and re-fished for new audiences.**

There are films that are unfairly forgotten after the release of their respective contemporary remakes, and I have no doubt that this one can be included in that list. It was a film produced and starred by Gregory Peck, one of the movie stars of the 60s, and it has a great cast and a good script, with elements that remind us a little of the aesthetics of “noir” or some Hitchcock films. Unfortunately, most people have only seen the 1991 remake, which we'll talk about in due course. Perhaps this is, partly, due to the film's huge financial failure, which would dictate the end of Peck's production company.

The script is very good and is based on a novel called “The Executioners”. It tells the story of a lawyer, Sam Bowden, who lives in a coastal region of Georgia or North Florida, who begins to be harassed and pursued, in a discreet but threatening way, by Max Cady, an ex-convict who, eight years earlier, was convicted thanks to Bowden's testimony, earning him a visceral hatred that he now intends to satisfy with revenge. At Cady's insistence, who does nothing more than show up wherever Bowden and his family choose to roam, the Police cannot act beyond close surveillance. However, he knows that it is only a matter of time before something really happens.

The script is very good, but I confess that I found some flaws. I don't know the laws of the USA, but in my country, it is possible for the laws to force two people away if one of them feels consistently intimidated or threatened by the mere presence or proximity of the other. Of course, the premise that this is not possible under American law ends up allowing the film to reach the conclusion it has, with the final confrontation of the two men. In any case, the film works and is effective in creating suspense and giving us a real sense of tension and threat.

Skillfully directed by J. Lee Thompson, the film stars Gregory Peck, who does a very good job, albeit not particularly remarkable, and is well assisted by Polly Bergen and Lori Martin. In fact, it's the great performance of Robert Mitchum, who brought us the villain, that enchants us and steals our attention. He is naturally menacing, with his seemingly peaceful presence always sounding tense and deceptive. The film has some good supporting actors, such as Telly Savalas and Martin Balsam.

Technically, it's not a pretentious or overpriced film. The cinematography is not particularly remarkable, but it makes the most of what it has and gives us some very well-executed close-ups, as well as some scenes with lighting and style that show the influence of ""noir"" and Alfred Hitchcock. The highlight is undoubtedly the visual and sound effects and the excellent and iconic soundtrack, composed by Bernard Herrmann, and later reused for the remake film."

Back when the Chicago Theater had still been a movie house, Carrie was the first film that my family and I had gone out on our weekly ""Movie Date Night"" to see. Good times. Gooood times. Carrie is an undisputed horror masterpiece. I still...get chills. || Sissy Spacek is really good in this as the socially inept, psychologically tortured, girl living in the shadow of her overbearingly Christian mother, with few friends and some remarkable telekinetic powers. What ensues is a complex, at times convoluted, angst-ridden horror film that sees the best and worst of human nature - of all ages - depicted, as thoughtless pranks and humiliation become the order of the day with some chilling consequences. Piper Laurie is superb as the zealot mother, as is John Travolta as the odious ""Billy"" and the combination of Brian de Palma and Stephen King make for a compelling, multi-layered critique on many different aspects of intimidation, bullying as well as adding some genuinely scary moments too! || Brian De Palma's Carrie (1976) remains an iconic adaptation of Stephen King's novel, blending psychological horror with deeply human themes of alienation and vengeance. The film’s portrayal of high school life, social cruelty, and supernatural terror is deeply affecting, resonating with audiences even decades later.

From its infamous opening locker room scene to the chaotic prom climax, De Palma's direction demonstrates a masterful control of mood and pacing. The visual style, characterized by long takes, slow motion, and the daring use of split-screen during the prom sequence, creates a cinematic experience that is both intimate and expansive. These techniques pull viewers into Carrie’s inner world while amplifying the horror of her ultimate revenge.

The production itself is a marvel for its time, achieving a balance between the surreal and the real. The careful choreography of the prom scene, where chaos is unleashed in a ballet of destruction, reflects De Palma’s meticulous eye for detail and his ability to innovate under pressure. It’s worth noting that some of the film's most memorable sequences, like the split-screen prom massacre, arose out of budgetary constraints—proving De Palma's ability to turn limitations into creative triumphs.

The performances elevate the material further, with Sissy Spacek's portrayal of Carrie standing out as both vulnerable and haunting. The supporting cast effectively embodies the oppressive social dynamics of high school, creating a believable and suffocating environment for the protagonist.

Understanding De Palma’s personal history adds another layer to the film’s intensity. His exposure to the visceral realities of his father’s work as a surgeon shaped his comfort with the graphic and the grotesque, evident in the film’s bloody moments. Additionally, De Palma's own experience trailing his father to uncover an affair—an event he later described as formative—infuses his work with themes of voyeurism, psychological tension, and human frailty. These personal elements lend Carrie a raw authenticity that transcends its horror genre trappings.

Despite the controversy surrounding its explicit content, Carrie avoids gratuity in favor of storytelling. De Palma’s bold choices underscore the film’s central themes rather than overshadow them, making it as much a character study as a tale of terror. The film's success helped cement his reputation as a provocative yet deeply skilled filmmaker, unafraid to explore the darker corners of human experience.

Revisiting Carrie highlights why it remains a classic. Its blend of compelling performances, innovative cinematography, and psychological depth sets it apart not only from other adaptations of King’s novel but also from modern horror films attempting similar themes. De Palma’s ability to channel his personal experiences into his art gives Carrie an emotional resonance and cinematic flair that continues to captivate audiences."

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || If you were ever to be able to commit your imagination to film when you read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" then I expect you would struggle to come up with anything more vivid than this. What is most striking is the wonderful detail as poor old estate agent ""Hutter"" is despatched to the home of ""Count Orlok"" (Max Schreck) to negotiate the acquisition of an isolated house for him. Once he arrives at the castle, we are subsumed in the eeriness and wickedness as it becomes clear that ""Orlok"" is an epitome of evil. Our story follows the travels of the ""Count"" from his castle to his new home - wreaking plague and havoc as he goes - until he arrives in the town inhabited by ""Ellen"" (a superbly vulnerable yet strong Greta Schröder) - the wife of the estate agent who is hot on their heals. ""Ellen"" has an inkling as to how to kill their nemesis, but that would involve the ultimate sacrifice. Now I have a few slight niggles with it - the inter-titles in a gothic script are, frequently, very difficult to read and that does interrupt the narrative; the editing is just a little too brutal at times and I found the score oppressive - even on the more joyous, or optimistic, scenes it seemed just a bit too overpowering than is necessary, but these are trifles when compared to the beautiful photography. Schreck is magnificent in the title role, exuding menace and malevolence, Gustav von Wangenheim (""Hutter"") conveys the sense of desperation and terror in a truly evocative manner and it all adds up to a taut horror film the likes of which you'll never see in any subsequent treatment of this story."

When the dream becomes a reality for one of the kids, and the worst happens, Nancy Thompson risks all to bring the bogeyman into the open.

Stupendous horror movie, one that not even the ream of sequels, spin- offs and cartoons could ever diminish. Wes Craven creates a film of utter terror, unleashing one of the genres most famous monsters on the unsuspecting film loving public, with Robert Englund as the hideous Fred Krueger having the time of his life slashing away and delivering oral venom. 

A number of scenes and sequences are staggeringly memorable, in the process shifting into horror movie folklore. The youthful cast are sensibly written (Craven's screenplay that took inspiration from a true story he read about Cambodian refugees literally dying of nightmares!), they are not dumb these kids, just vulnerable, but led by Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) there may be hope of some survivors?

The blurry line between dreams and reality gets a bloody make-over here, creating biblical snoots in the process. In short, essential horror movie for those inclined. 9/10 || 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Gregory Peck wins over Liev Schreiber, but then Peck is the better actor.

Lee Remick is far more believable than Julia Stiles who doesn't seem to convey the same earnest fear and suspicion.

David Thewlis is a good actor, but in bit parts he always seems to phone it in and David Warner was just the more believable photographer.

I mean, the 1976 The Omen is dated, but that's not a bad thing and in this case you get the sense that they were doing something fresh and really trying to frighten you...and they did.

By comparison the remake is paint by numbers and offers nothing new.

1976 is, hands down the more frightening, more dramatic, and more suspenseful film. Compared to 2006. 1976 is believable. || OK, so at times this is a bit far-fetched, even for a horror movie, but I reckon it is still my favourite from the genre made in the 1970s. From a rather murky start in a Roman hospital, we see Gregory Peck and wife Lee Remmick head to London where he is to be US Ambassador - along with their new baby son ""Damien"" (cue the squeaking violins). Not long after their arrival, their nanny commits suicide - rather gruesomely, as it happens - facilitating the arrival of ""Mrs. Baylock"" (a rather menacing Billie Whitelaw). As the boy ages, and fuelled by some rather ghastly prophesies by Patrick Troughton's ""Father Brennan"", Peck slowly concludes that there is something a little dodgy about him. Thing is, can he thwart the evil contained within the youngster? Richard Donner does well to build and to sustain a sense of peril from pretty much the outset of this film - aided, ably, by a Jerry Goldsmith score that uses maniacal choral vocals and strings to keep you behind the sofa. Peck isn't at his best, and some of the scenes - especially in the graveyard with the Baskervillian hounds - do stretch the imagination, but for the most part it seizes your attention and keeps it. I have to admit to being disappointed by the ending - just why did the police have to give chase?"

Blood and Wine is directed by Bob Rafelson and Rafelson co-writes the screenplay with Nick Villiers and Alison Cross. It stars Jack Nicholson, Stephen Dorff, Jennifer Lopez, Judy Davis and Michael Caine. Music is by Michal Lorenc and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.

A failed father and husband enlists an oily accomplice to enact the theft of a precious necklace. But when his wife and son get involved in the shady dealings, things quickly spiral out of control.

Bob Rafelson once again turns to his muse, Nicholson, to bring about another venture down the neo-noir lane. Unfortunately, just like the ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" remake and ""Black Widow"", this also flatters to deceive.

Nothing wrong with the acting or story as such, Nicholson and Caine bounce off each other with scummy character glee, while Lopez and Dorff offer up some sexy sizzle in the supporting slots. In true noir fashion the pic is ripe with unlikable characters, while the vagaries of noirville fate comes into play. Yet as it plays out more as a character study than anything edgy or thrilling, it ends up being like a fine wine that has been corked.

Katrin Cartridge (""Dodo"") and Adrian Rawlins (""Dr. Richardson"") contribute well in support as this story of a loving, immature and caring character plumbs the depths before an ending that rather summed up for me the cruelty - and implausibility - of the story.

What it also takes is an unflinching swipe at is the supposedly charitable nature of a local ""wee-free"" clergy whose behaviour towards her at the denouement is little short of disgraceful.

Well perhaps, but here they were the wrong kind of miracles! The film is intensively shot, the photography creative and imaginative and it all has an intimacy to it that is largely down to an excellent Watson and a illustration of a small island mentality that is almost claustrophobic but entirely enthralling testament to this director's skilful ability to provoke thought! || **An ugly film on all levels that insults our intelligence.**

For me, cinema is an art that tells good stories, whether fictional, true or a mix of fiction and real facts. It has a clear social role, often makes people think or raises difficult questions. However, there are directors who seem to live off controversy, that is, they try to use cinema to shock or impress, attracting attention for the worst and most selfish reasons. Lars von Trier is like that: he loves a good controversy and doesn't mind about criticism, as long as they talk about him. And that's why I don't like him and I don't consider him a good director. It's not enough to have talent, you need to know how to use it.

As in many other films by this director, sex is the epicenter of this film: the script begins by introducing us to an incredibly naive and submissive woman, who lives in a kind of narrow-minded religious community in the North of Scotland. Anyone who likes to criticize Catholics for allegedly being followers of a conservatism that has no place today should get to know this Protestant religious community, where I, a conservative Catholic, would feel like I was in Iran or Afghanistan. It is clear that the director, a confessed atheist, wanted to show his horror towards religious dogmatics in general. It was a way to “caricature” religion and express a personal opinion.

This young woman, whose innocence is so absolute that she would probably believe she could get pregnant just by sitting on a chair previously used by a man, marries a modern foreigner who works on an oil rig. And she discovers sex. And she loves sex, and gives herself to love. All this is beautiful until the day he suffers a serious accident. As he could lose his reproductive capacity, he asks her to meet and “relieve” herself with other men. Naturally, she is horrified, and he convinces her that this will help him heal. And against any rational logic, she believes, and becomes the biggest libertine in Scotland.

We have to agree on one thing: this film proves that even the stupidest story wins awards at Cannes, and that there is an audience capable of consuming the most complete idiocy that a film can present to them. In addition to ridiculing religion in a way that is offensive to any believer, I believe, the film does not care about the rationality and logic of the decisions made by the characters. If I cut myself with a knife, of course I'm going to try to make sure it doesn't happen again because it's dangerous, but what the film proposes is that I do the opposite and intentionally cut myself, believing that I'm curing a loved one's cancer by doing so. This is so stupid that it doesn't deserve qualification. Von Trier, in an act of absolute intellectual arrogance, insults our intelligence. I don't even need to talk about the clumsy and distorted way in which the film approaches love and the most genuine human feelings.

Technically, it's a cheap film. Cheaper than the worst indie films. We don't have a production worthy of the name, the cinematography is horrible, the filming is so amateurish that even I could do better. The rhythm is heavy, slow, like a mournful funeral. Stellan Skarsgard, an actor I respect, lends some renown to the film and shows talent, but his character deserves contempt. In an extraordinary dramatic effort, Emily Watson deserves praise for her commitment, but it is perhaps this actress' most forgettable film. || ** A Movie That Doesn’t Just Move You, It Breaks You **

not just a film—it’s a raw, transcendent piece of art that pierces straight through the heart. From the hauntingly beautiful cinematography to Lars von Trier’s uncompromising direction, every frame of this movie is crafted with such emotional intensity that it becomes an unforgettable experience.

Emily Watson delivers one of the most powerful performances I’ve ever seen, embodying Bess’s innocence, devotion, and suffering with heartbreaking authenticity. Her portrayal is so visceral that it’s impossible not to be moved to tears. The supporting cast is equally phenomenal, adding layers of depth to this harrowing yet deeply spiritual story.

The film’s themes of love, sacrifice, and faith are explored with unflinching honesty, leaving the viewer in a state of awe long after the credits roll. The unconventional structure, the grainy visuals, and the melancholic soundtrack all contribute to its unique, almost hypnotic power.

Breaking the Waves is perfect in every way—a cinematic triumph that challenges, devastates, and uplifts all at once. It’s a film that doesn’t just tell a story; it etches itself into your soul. This is a movie I will carry with me forever, a true testament to the power of cinema as art."

Released in 1996 and directed by Jonathan Frakes, ""Star Trek: First Contact"" features The Next Generation characters taking on the Borg, a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic organisms functioning as drones in a hive-mind called the Collective. In order to escape imminent destruction by the Federation, a Borg mini-ship flees back in time to 2063 to prevent the renowned Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) from accomplishing the initial warp drive and the subsequent first contact with an alien race, which later paved the way for the Federation of Planets. Alfre Woodard has a key role as a colleague of Cochrane.

The Borg are an excellent villain and one of the greatest contributions of The Next Generation TV series, along with all its elaboration on Klingon culture. Here the Borg are augmented by the introduction of a Queen (Alice Krige), which some feel detracted from the impersonal and eerie race while others think enhanced them. It makes no difference to me personally, but it fits the parallel of a queen bee in a honey bee colony. Besides, why wouldn’t there be a central intelligence?

There are some gems to mine from the proceedings, like Cochrane's revelation of his carnal motivations for developing warp drive and Picard's hell-bent desire to annihilate the Borg. Speaking of Picard, Patrick Stewart carries the film with his unique star power, which is very different from Shatner, but just as effective.

Interestingly, The Next Generation TV series never developed a prominent triumvirate like Kirk/Spock/McCoy, but rather a dyad, Picard and Data. Whereas this duo was core to the previous TNG film, ""Generations"" (1994) and the last one, ""Nemesis"" (2002), it's not as evident here until the last act when Picard attempts to rescue the charismatic android, but that's only because they get separated early on and Data ends up hanging out with the Borg Queen. By the way, Picard's self-sacrificial desire to save Data reveals a weakness in the script: After the Enterprise is set to self-destruct, Picard only has 15 MINUTES to rescue Data and escape the ship, but Picard is shown having a meaningful discussion with Lily (Woodard). _Why sure!_ 

Another gem of the film is the revelation of the alien race at the end, which prompts a ""Wow"" reaction to fans of Star Trek (although erudite Trekkers undoubtedly knew what was coming).

There are other flaws, like the jarring, contrived excuse for going back in time and the questionable fiery confrontation between Picard and Lily. I say ""questionable"" because something about the sequence renders it somewhat shaky; it may be the acting, the writing or some combination, but they needed to work out the kinks. Still, that scene has some good aspects, like Picard's line: ""The line must be drawn HERE!"" and the build-up to it.

While I favor 1994's ""Generations"" to ""First Contact"" because of the fascinating story elements, e.g. the Nexus, and the potent subtext (see my review), and even marginally prefer the underrated ""Nemesis"" (2002), this doesn't take away from the fact that ""First Contact"" is a quality installment in the series, which gets better with repeat viewings despite its weaknesses.

The movie runs almost 111 minutes and was shot in the studio with location shooting at Angeles National Forest and Green Valley, Arizona (substituting for Montana).

GRADE: B || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend (at least for dedicated ""Star Trek"" fans).

My favorites aspects of all of ""Star Trek"" are The Borg, and the artificial entities like Data.  This movie potentially ruins both of them, depending on who you ask.  Also, time travel is the worst.

I would have been much happier if we hadn't bothered with time travel as that creates a lot of other questions about why The Borg haven't utilized it before if they had such technology.

The investigation of humanity in The Borg and Data are pretty interesting though, seeing Data find what it is to FEEL is a great, but seeing The Borg personified into a single entity to which one can converse is odd, at best.

Seeing the Enterprise defend against Borg assault was fun, but none of the ""First Contact"" stuff was compelling at all. || Really solid and suspense-filled Star Trek film. Seen this one once before and still holds up along with the visual effects which were decent for its time. This is also the first complete TNG feature and unlike Generations, did feel like a movie rather than two-part episode. 4.0/5"

A difficult choice.,Drama,135,1996-08-30,en,7.544,817,2.5145,"Billy Bob Thornton, Dwight Yoakam, J. T. Walsh, John Ritter, Lucas Black",Billy Bob Thornton,"arkansas, repair shop, southern, death threat, religious art, father figure, intellectual disability","***When a murderer is the likable protagonist, mmm-hmm***

A simple, slow, seemingly pensive man (Billy Bob Thornton) is released from a mental hospital in central Arkansas after 30 years and gets a job fixing lawnmowers. He makes friends with a boy & his mother (Natalie Canerday) and they let him live in their garage, but the mother’s abusive boyfriend presents a problem (Dwight Yoakam). John Ritter is on hand as the mother’s gay best friend. 

""Sling Blade"" (1996) is a small town drama with a memorable central character (if I didn’t know beforehand that Thornton played the role, I wouldn’t have recognized him). The characters and their situations smack of real life while the unhurried story is interesting enough. There are well-done moments of meditation and revelation, as well as touching ones.

It’s a tad overlong, however, and the politically correct glorification of Vaughan (Ritter) is eye-rolling. Karl (Thornton) observes that “The Bible says two men ought not lay together. But I don't reckon the Good Lord would send anybody like you to Hades.” Yet his opining doesn’t mean much since he candidly acknowledges elsewhere that he doesn’t understand a lot of the Scriptures, not to mention his foolish predilection for murder to solve mundane problems. He should stick to fixing lawnmowers and eating them French fried potaters, mmm-hmm.

The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in Benton & nearby Haskell, Arkansas, which are about 20-30 minutes southwest of Little Rock.

GRADE: B- || **A film full of challenges, to which Billy Bob Thornton, in his greatest work, responded categorically.**

I didn't really know what I was going to find when I decided to watch this film, and I'm happy about that: it's a really good, convincing and moving story, which doesn't try to escape the harsh reality of things to create unbelievable heroes. And it is probably the most solid and significant work of Billy Bob Thornton's career. In fact, he not only plays the main role, but is also responsible for the script and direction. It is a labor of love, of total and absolute commitment, which makes this film a ""Magnum Opus"", even though Thornton has done other works that are equally notable and full of talent.

In this story, we follow a seemingly kind and harmless man who has lived his entire life in a mental institution where he was imprisoned as a child, after killing his mother and her boyfriend. Now, he is a mature man, but he doesn't know anything about the outside world, he has no connections of any sort with anyone (he has a father, but there is no emotional bond between them) and he has a serious mental disability. However, doctors consider him well enough to return to a normal life. When he leaves, he returns to his homeland, where he meets a boy who is roughly the same age as he was when he was institutionalized. The friendship between the two leads him to meet his mother, a young woman who has a complicated relationship with a man with a violent nature. And despite her limitations, he quickly realizes that this man could be dangerous to his new friends.

The whole story revolves around values that are very dear to us: friendship, kindness and altruism. It's not a completely unpredictable film, but it works very well and presents a deeply credible story. After all, you only need to open a newspaper to see dozens of situations of domestic violence and dating abuse that end badly. It is a subject that deserves deep social reflection: in a world where possessive relationships are increasingly observed, it is essential to understand that love only makes sense if it is based on trust, understanding and mutual acceptance. The film also challenges us to rethink our prejudices about mentally disabled people: they have feelings and emotional needs, just like us. After all, being mentally ill does not mean that you are a psychopath or sociopath.

Technically, the film presents us with excellent cinematography, in addition to a wise choice of filming locations and a careful design of the costumes and sets in Rural America. If the film is not very clear as to the geographical location where the action takes place, filming took place mostly in Arkansas, and it seems appropriate to place the fictional story somewhere between this state and its neighbor, Missouri. The well-modeled rhythm does not cause drowsiness or wear out the audience.

As I already said, it is Billy Bob Thornton who deserves the most praise for his work in the general work, and particularly as an actor. Playing dramatic roles as mentally disabled people is always challenging: there is a permanent risk of transforming the character into a caricature worthy of condemnation and offensive to people. Thornton manages to be authentic, credible in his interpretation, and reaps the fruits of this magnificent work. In addition to him, Dwight Yoakam also deserves an applause for a challenging and difficult job, in which he did wonderfully well."
7863.0,Shine,"Pianist David Helfgott, driven by his father and teachers, has a breakdown. Years later he returns to the piano, to popular if not critical acclaim.",A true story of the mystery of music and the miracle of love,Drama,105,1996-08-15,en,7.379,671,1.29,"Geoffrey Rush, Noah Taylor, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Lynn Redgrave, Googie Withers",Scott Hicks,"australia, letter, child prodigy, biography, jumping, pianist, concert hall, breakdown, piano","**Perhaps one of the most striking films in the work of Geoffrey Rush, and one of the toughest and most sincere portrayals of brilliance that cinema has seen to date.**

Even though I'm a pretty serious music lover, and I've always loved classical music, I didn't know David Helfgott until I saw this film. The musical universe is full of prodigies who reveal talent since childhood. Mozart is perhaps the most famous example of this. However, it is one of those subjects that I feel we tend to overestimate, because you can also find prodigious children in other areas of knowledge, including the Human Sciences. It is, however, curious that we have so few examples of musical geniuses with solid and successful careers. Most pianists and musical performers, no matter how talented they are, depend more on their self-discipline and intensive training than on their basic talent.

Helfgott, according to this film, had a difficult childhood, at the hands of an overbearing father, who basically pushed him towards a music career, realizing his talent. The problem is that the situation demanded a lot from the young genius, causing him to develop schizophrenia and several other mental problems. With serious speech problems (he stutters and talks compulsively), he is also incapable of maintaining a conventional relationship with the people around him. Of course, in the long run, we'll see how he gets around the difficulties and achieves consecration.

Helfgott is played by several actors, but it is Geoffrey Rush who shines in the role. The actor was able, in this film, to cross the doors of international cinema thanks to one of the most complete and immersive portrayals of genius in cinema. Appearing on stage when the film is already halfway through, he dominates the entire work, imposing himself, demanding our attention, deserving applause. Even if the film no longer had any reason to merit – it does! – seeing the performance of this British actor would always be more than enough reason to justify a trip to the cinema. However, he is not alone: the film also gives us an excellent interpretation of Armin Mueller-Stahl in the role of the father, demanding and domineering. Noah Taylor, who gives life to the character of Helfgott in his youth, also leaves us with a job well done and of value.

The script and direction also deserve a note of praise. Scott Hicks, who performs both tasks, has managed to create a film that is deeply dramatic, intense, capable of moving and making us think, without making the mistake of making it overly melodramatic or presenting things that are too dark and pessimistic. The film is deeply emotional, it even has several intense, almost painful scenes, but it is never a heavy film. In addition, the film makes a very clever use of cinematography and the soundtrack to lighten or thicken the entire environment in which the action takes place. In addition to the pieces by Rachmaninoff – a piano genius, but who finds equivalents in composers such as Chopin, Scriabin or Liszt, author of the naive but terribly demanding “La Campanella”, for me the most difficult solo piano – the film has a vast repertoire of classical pieces skillfully inserted into the soundtrack. It's worth seeing how they are used in the film."

The dialogue is sometimes quite pithy, and Tom Bower is fine as ""Marvin"" (the janitor who gets roped in too). It does lack menace, maybe Willis' style of characterisation is just a bit too laid back; the smile and the glint - but it's still an end to end action thriller with plenty of pyrotechnics and near misses to fill a couple of hours in a world of mindless cinema.

A colossal, mysterious space cloud called V'ger travels across the galaxy and threatens Earth, annihilating interlopers along the way ; the origins of V'ger are revealed at the end. 

""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" (1979) addresses some of the deepest questions of life:  Is this all there is? Why are we here? Does love exist since it cannot be proved via pure logic? Who is the Creator? The core message is the intrinsic need to seek one's Creator and reconcile in order to attain a (necessary) higher level of consciousness. Those found the film boring simply failed to penetrate beyond the surface.

Like the Star Trek episodes ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" and ""Metamorphosis,"" “The Motion Picture"" (TMP) is a mature, cerebral sci-fi story with very little action. Most kids and young adults won't like it or grasp it. It's depth is evidenced by the emotional wallop experienced when Spock grasps Kirk's hand in Sickbay, truly revealing emotion despite his conflicting desire to attain a consciousness of pure logic; or later when Spock weeps for V'ger and comments on its personal dilemma, which perfectly coincides with Spock's own search for fulfillment: ""As I was when I came aboard, so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough... Each of us at some time in our lives turns to someone — a father, a brother, a God — and asks, 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers.""

Another powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).

My conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments: ""My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did."" In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained ; put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and relish the movie magic.

Let me add that TMP was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit, a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" (1986), TMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films with the whole original cast (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that TMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films ""Alien"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" both released the same year.

I should add that, although this film is an ""Grade A"" picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of ""The Cage"" than ""The Doomsday Machine.” 

TMP is the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Actually, TMP is leagues better IMHO. ""2001"" lacks characters to care about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences. TMP, by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.

Say what you will, but ""The Motion Picture"" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series — a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH.

The movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes.

GRADE: A || BORING.

I mean, it opens great. The first few minutes sort of give you the impression that this movie is going to be epic...

... and then the rest of it is best spent looking at your phone, cleaning your finger nails, watching linoleum curl, defrosting your freezer...

... finding anything else you can do as it plays in the background just to keep you form dying of Boredom.

And I say this as a Star Trek fan. || To be fair, this film does pick up quite plausibly from the television series. The characterisations are roughly the same, if somewhat older - and that does help give it some cohesion; but the opening scene goes on interminably. The premiss is stretched to breaking point and riddled with metaphors and pseudo-philosophical clichés; and there is precious little action. Persis Khambatta who plays ""Ilia"" - the conduit between the all powerful alien power and our gang of intrepid adventurers - is almost robotic and sterile; as is the general plot of the film. It seems lost between an adventure film and one with a deeper message to convey; as such it delivers well on neither front. Luckily, there were more, better, films to follow - but this one is best forgotten."

This is the last ensemble outing for the whole crew and it's a great bit of action adventure in the spirit of ""Wrath of Khan"" (1982). A fitting finale for their last voyage together. || I mean, there are better Star Trek movies, but this was 1991 and the Berlin Wall fell and the Klingons were the metaphor for the USSR (despite what the current everything is political writers of Picard say, despite their attempts to invert it) and spray cans destroyed to O-Zone layer...

... and so do moons.

So.... this fit PERFECTLY into 1991. PERFECTLY, and good science fiction is always a commentary on politics, culture, religion, something contemporary that needs to be poked at and examined.

And that is EXACTLY what VI does, and it does it to the letter. It examines the old cold warriors in a new time of peace."

This is my favorite Star Trek movie. The whole film bubbles with humour and the music score is fantastic. I love the bookend _'Row, row, row your boat'_ sequences. An emotional and funny film - my favourite goosebumps moment being when Kirk says 'I've always known...I'll die alone"". Brings tears to my eyes that part - it really does.

You'll have to excuse me, I'm getting emotional thinking about it. It's trendy to give this film a bad review and I am more than happy to be honest and open about ny admiration for this film.

If anything, Star Trek VI is the weakest Trek movie - a plodding episode of Columbo in space.


_Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_ is a rousing and fun 
movie.




- Ian Beale || _**At the end of the day, it entertains**_

This 1989 entry in the Star Trek film series was an earnest and noble effort by William Shatner, who directed and plotted the film, to tackle a subject that only he and Star Trek would dare attempt. Unfortunately it's become law in Trekdom to pick apart this film as a turkey of astronomical proportions; consequently a sort of bandwagon phenomenon has developed amongst the cookie-cutter fundamentalist Trekkers who have somehow failed to evolve to the level of independent thought. (They're no doubt still mad at Shatner for telling them to ""get a life""). In fact, it's become such a cliché to hate ""Star Trek V"" that it has become the ""Spock's Brain"" of the feature films.

I disagree. While ""The Final Frontier"" certainly has its share of flaws -- the story goes over the edge into the realm of goofy camp at times and some argue that the F/X are possibly the least of the feature films -- it remains an entertaining picture. Besides, Star Trek was never about great special effects (disregarding the triumphant ""The Motion Picture""). It's about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of exploration; this is what ""The Final Frontier"" is all about and it scores high marks in this regard.

No other Trek film showcases the character interplay of the Kirk/Spock/McCoy troika to the level of intimacy shown in ""The Final Frontier,"" and only ""The Voyage Home"" exceeds the joyful energy of the characters displayed here. As far as the spirit of exploration goes, ""Star Trek V"" surpasses all other Trek adventures; after all, no exploration is greater than the quest for ultimate reality and the Creator of all. It touches on many important themes: personal pain, healing, faith, family, love, fanaticism, the desire to know ultimate reality, God, false beliefs, loyalty, repentance and forgiveness. Name another film in the series that addresses so many weighty topics and yet remains entertaining.

The film was actually doomed with critics and Trekker fundamentalists the moment it was disclosed that Shatner would direct it; the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued. It would have been better received if Shatner had directed the film anonymously and if it were released after ""Star Trek III."" As it was, it came out on the heels of ""Star Trek IV,"" arguably the pinnacle of the feature films. If ""The Wrath of Khan"" had come out after The Voyage Home it would have been deemed a mediocre affair.

The bottom line is that ""Star Trek V"" is a solid and extremely original Trek outing, equal parts amusing, thought-provoking, wonder-inducing and heart-warming; it possesses a wealth of quality scenes and has an interesting assortment of colorful characters who unite together for the ultimate discovery. 

Its best character is Sybok, played excellently by Laurence Luckinbill. Sybok isn't really a villain at all, but rather a rebel Vulcan who rejects Stoicism and develops a compulsion to heal people and find ultimate knowledge. His mistake is allowing this compulsion to assume the creature beyond the Great Barrier is God, which it obviously isn't. Of course the film would have been more successful if the studio hadn't repeatedly cut the budget the closer the it came to completion, thus robbing Shatner (and us) of his original vision. As it is, the climax is serviceable, but also missing something.

Regardless, ""The Final Frontier"" is an entertaining Trek romp, if nothing else. Thankfully it offers much more. Personally, I'd view it in any day before ""The Wrath of Khan."" By all means, watch it again for the first time.

The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes.

GRADE: B || I know, I know, I know, please don't hate me. Please.

But, this came out in '89, my parents were busy, they dropped Heath and I off at the theater and didn't come in with us, and, yeah, that happened a lot growing up, but this was the FIRST STAR TREK MOVIE I GOT TO SEE BY MYSELF.

And, really, it sort of became MY Star Trek movie. Not the ones I shared with my father, but MY Star Trek.

And now when I watch it, yeah, I realize how bad it is, but it sort of has that landmark feeling of being my own Star Trek film... so I can't give it the horrible rating it deserves.

But... yeah, I know it sucks."

Compared to the first movie and all the slow scenes for the visuals and nostalgia, this movie blew that one out of the water! We loved how it actually focused on the plot! Also, the CGI and effects were outstanding, having updated the transporter effect and the phaser effects! Along with the new effect for going to warp!! Also, to top off the plot, the dialog was excellent!

Kirk gets personal.

It is what it is folks, it's a good honest Star Trek story, it beats a real emotive heart and although some may decry the lack of blistering space battles, or end of the universe peril scenarios, it's an essential film for dealing with the protagonists we know and love.

Into the mix here we have our favourite alien enemies The Klingons (led by the oddly cast Christopher Lloyd), Spock's father, Sarek, who adds grace to the story, and crucially Kirk gets an emotional kicker. While elsewhere hardcore fans get a big surprise with the beloved Enterprise.

It's of course merely a set up for the next (and delightfully great) instalment of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, but on its own terms this stands up as one of the better character pieces in the series. Due in no small part to having Leonard Nimoy directing it because he shows care and thought about a subject he obviously knows quite a bit about. 7/10 || I kind of feel that this gets a lot more hate than it deserves... because it follows Kahn and because it rewrites an emotional death.

I know, I know, I love Spock too, but, really, should have left him dead. That was part of the emotional roller coaster of II.

But, they didn't and that does sort of cheapen Kahn a bit.

However, it's really not a bad entry on it's own. It's a solid film. It just followed the greatest of the bunch and pales in comparison. || Picking up closely from the second film, this sees our crew of adventurers defy their superiors and steal the Enterprise in an attempt to rescue ""Spock"" from the Genesis planet. This is probably the best of the films for both DeForest Kelley and James Doohan as they both have some more of the play than normal; Christopher Lloyd is on fine form as the Klingon commander ""Kruge"" and there is plenty of phaser action to keep us all entertained. Not quite as well put together as the ""Wrath of Khan"" but it continues to develop the characters in an entertaining fashion."

Well, it turns out that the probe is pretty fluent in humpback whale-song but we have long since hunted them into extinction. What's required now is some legerdemain and a bit of time travel to go get some from back in 20th century California.

It touches on the ecology issues in a humorous but pointed manner and all round delivers an enjoyable 2 hours of entertainment."
11967.0,Young Guns,"A group of young gunmen, led by Billy the Kid, become deputies to avenge the murder of the rancher who became their benefactor.

But there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip.

Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler.

Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder.

It ain't easy having pals.

Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way.

Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing.

Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10 || ""Young Guns"" has wonderfully authentic production values and costumes which really brings this rugged period to life on the screen. It did seem as though the western was permanently out of fashion with mainstream audiences a couple of years before this film was released and perhaps it might never again return to the prominence it had once enjoyed, but then along came this entry in the genre and the fresh faced young talent involved each have key roles and this fact alone undoubtedly guaranteed plenty of equally fresh faced young audiences would watch. However, this film is also worthwhile for some other reasons as well. The western has always been a consistently popular genre and after watching this film you can immediately understand why. The story is a strong one and best of all the film as a whole is also incredibly well paced and intelligent and informative and these are elements you seldom encounter these days."

Warner Bros was quick to begin production on a sequel to Batman (1989) after its colossal success literally saved the studio from bankruptcy. This time Tim Burton was given complete creative control over the entire film, and it shows. Batman Returns cranked up the campy weirdness that the studio had restrained in the first Batman. This film focuses on Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman over Batman, making Michael Keaton feel like the supporting cast to Pfeiffer and DeVito. As disappointing as that may sound, Pfeiffer took this over-the-top campy Catwoman and delivered a truly iconic performance, and DeVito performed much the same in his role. I appreciated Batman Returns avoiding the comic book movie trope of putting the entire world or whole sitting at stake. Instead, the story concentrates on corrupt businessmen and politicians avoiding giant sky beams. The climax risks a more significant part of the city, but it's still more localized than most comic book films. Batman Returns has its flaws, but the Christmas setting, the return of Michael Keaton to his career-defining role, and Pfeiffer and DeVito's incredible acting overcome the severe campiness and lack of Batman, resulting in a decent entry in the Dark Knight's 90s franchise. || The only other great batman movie.

A man eating shark is terrorising the holiday island of Amity. Police chief Martin Brody, shark hunter Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper set sail in the hope of killing the great white monster.

Jaws is responsible for many things, it's responsible for propelling director Steven Spielberg's career into the stratosphere, it was responsible for a downturn in the package holiday trade, and it was responsible for shaping the summer blockbuster release practice's. There are many other things which one doesn't need to bore you with, it's just true to say that Jaws is firmly ensconced in movie history, if one hasn't seen it then one surely knows about it, it is, even today, part of popular culture.

But is it any good? Is it worthy of a long standing reputation as one of the greatest monster movies of all time? Hell yes it is, one or two easily overlooked flaws aside, it busted the box office (world wide) and tapped into a primal fear that resides in the majority of mankind, the unseen that resides in the sea.

Jaws sets out its marker right from the start with a truly shocking and attention grabbing opening sequence, from then on in Spielberg (learning from Hitchcock for sure) tweaks the tension to have the audience living on their nerves, even as character building (by way of Brody's family arc) sedates the pace, we just know that it's all relative to an extension of fear and terror that is around the next corner. After the first victims' remains are found, Brody glances out at the ocean, Spielberg perfectly framing the shot to say so much about what we are about to be witness' to. Jolts and shocks pop up from time to time to help build the unease, whilst Spielberg makes the audience wait before we even see what it is that so coldly and efficiently destroys man. Then it's the claustrophobic switch as our brave protagonists are out at sea on Quint's boat, unaware that the giant menace is now hunting them, eyes as black as death itself.

So many great scenes linger for all time in the memory, the entrance of Quint is a hum dinger, a mournful widow reducing Brody to a stunned realism, the Indianappolis monologue, the bigger boat! Just some of the reasons why I personally love cinema so much. The score from John Williams is as effective as any for the genre and Robert Hoyt's sound team's work furthers the unfolding dread. The cast are superb and uniformly excellent, managing to cast aside technical problems (and genuine resentments at times) to portray this story with verve and a genuine depth of feeling. Yet Roy Scheider (Brody), Robert Shaw (Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper) were far from from original choices, Charlton Heston was wanted for the role of Brody, Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were both mooted for Quint, and John Voight was Spielberg's preferred choice for Hooper. Whilst Jaws author (and co screen writer here) Peter Benchley was heading for the top by asking for Newman, Redford and McQueen!! Imagine that!

Still it all turned out well in the end because Jaws stands the test of time as one of the best films of its type. No amount of complaining about continuity and a rough looking mechanical shark will ever dim its appeal, even as I revisited it recently for the hundredth time I still got tingles all over my body. So file it alongside King Kong in the pantheon of Monster Movie Masterpieces. 10/10 always, now go enjoy your dip in the ocean. || Is it safe to go back in the water? ...

Steven Spielberg got ahold of the incredible Peter Benchley-penned novel about a giant, carnivorous Great White (dubbed ""Jaws"") who swims the ocean waters off a fictional resort town, preying on both the Island's locals and its visitors alike, and adaptated, for the silver screen, what would become one of the most terrifying American made thrillers to ever be released in the worldwide cinema. Exceptional filmmaking! And members of Spielberg's crew had the nerve to maliciously ""mock"" Jaws, by referring to it as ""Flaws"", during the filming process? All because of a few ""glitches"" in the mechanical shark? Ha! Who's laughing now?

Great screenwriting by Benchley and Gottlieb. Great composition by the legendary John Williams. Great direction by Spielberg. Phenomenal performances by Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss. Great supporting cast. Just...magnificent. Jaws is a magnificent film. A true classic. || Much like the shark itself, the movie starts slowly, deep down in the depths before coming to the surface to explode in pure sensationalism.

Jaws is one of those rare exceptions where high-brow art meets fun entertainment. At the time of its making, however, simply keeping its head above water was the most the cast and crew were hoping for.

But Spielberg had created something special. During production, no one saw it--I'm not sure Spielberg himself saw it, but it was there. I think it was really editor Verna Fields who saw it and put it together.

Jaws begins the way most primal fears begin: someone is alone, in the dark, in an alien environment, and is being attacked from some unknown entity. People remark today how Jaws worked so well, that it's kept them afraid of the ocean for years. I disagree. I think it's because we are scared of the ocean is why Jaws works so well. The opening scene of the young girl being savaged in the black nothingness that is the night ocean is terrifying because it preys on primal fears; it doesn't create them.

Next we're introduced to our cast of characters: There's Police Chief Martin Brody--an everyman with a fear of the water--and his wife, Ellen. There's Brody's loyal deputy Len Hendricks (mysteriously named ""Jeff"" in the sequel). Then, of course, there's the other side. There is the crooked mayor Larry Vaughan, and his two toadies newspaper editor Harry Meadows and coroner Carl Santos. After Brody and Hendricks find evidence of a hungry shark off the coast of the resort town of Amity, they do the sensible thing and start closing up the beaches. The mayor, seeing dwindling dollar signs, convinces Meadows and Santos to back him, and together they confront Brody and put the kibosh on his beach closing plan.

In an era where the primitive special effects technology gave us a shark that looked like a pool toy, it became essential that the shark not be the focal point of the film. And while a fin here and a barrel there do work wonders, it's only because the shark is far from the only villain in the movie. To have credibility, we have to have a human villain. And that is where Vaughan comes in.

After Vaughan's cavalier ""it-can't-happen-again"" attitude blows up in his face, Brody brings in the book smart, but decidedly out-of-his-element marine biologist Matt Hooper. Hooper tells Brody everything he and we, the audience, already know: The shark is out there; it's hungry; it's eating people; and it will continue to do so unless it is killed.

After a disastrous Fourth of July celebration that should have gotten Vaughan impeached, Brody and Hooper join forces with Quint, a grizzled fisherman with a personal vendetta against sharks. The movie then switches from its horror and drama elements and becomes something of an adventure, foreshadowing Spielberg's work on films like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Even John Williams' score begins to conjure up images of Errol Flynn-style swashbuckling. The adventure almost seems fun.

And that is when the shark, previously only a shadow, fin, or plot point referenced by dialogue, takes center stage. The movie shifts gears further near the end, going from adventure to a full on monster movie.

The build up is slow, relying on showing us the results of the shark's presence rather than the shark itself. This creates enough fear and credibility so that by the time the big, rubbery toy shark is commanding the screen, we're afraid of it. It's already been established as a monster.

The movie's pacing, dialogue and acting are all perfect, creating a strong enough foundation on which a silly, albeit terrifying, plot rests. By the time the shark is sinking boats and eating shark cages, Spielberg has made us by into it that he could have had the shark blasting off for the moon and we would have accepted it. And that is how and why Jaws works."

These 3D ventures are amusing. Whenever the plot slows down a cast member randomly picks up a long stick and points it at the camera.

This film is no exception. Whenever the plot crawls to snails pace characters start pointing long sticks at the camera for no apparent reason.

Doing most of the long stick pointing here is Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong - she needs a _strong arm_ to pick random objects up and point them toward the camera as often as she does.


- Potential Kermode || Yeah... not good. I don't dislike <em>'Jaws 3-D'</em> as much as most evidently do, though.

Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong are actually pleasant in terms of the cast, none of those behind them are anything worth noting but are somewhat serviceable. I will say I didn't enjoy the plot, but only because it lacked something worth watching - it's poor, not terrible. More of the shark was wanted, but I would personally say that about the preceding two films as well.

Parts of this 1983 flick that are terrible, though, are the special effects, especially right at the end. There is also some poorly done green screen and it, clearly, has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab, that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D, but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't, in my opinion. It's simply bad. The cover is hilariously awful though, granted. || Any fans of the original ""Jaws"" (1975), hell even of the sequel (1978) need not bother with this completely unrecognisable nonsense. Believe it or not, there is still one ""Brody"" - ""Mike"" (Dennis Quaid) who wants anything to do with the sea. His previous, death defying experiences haven't put him off! Anyway, he works at a newly opened sea world where a baby great white finds it's way in for a quick snack through a broken seagate. Where's mama, though? She can't be far away! The baby shark is captured, but swiftly dies and it is as if the big one knows, and let's just say she is seriously narked. Aside from some decent underwater photography, and some talented folks doing water-batics, it's a dreadful stain on the reputation of the franchise. The opening titles offer a clue to the 3-D effects, and I do recall sitting in the Odeon in Glasgow with my cardboard glasses on wondering what all the fuss was about 40 years ago. Now I know - it was all just a badly constructed, poorly acted gimmick that is as forgettable as it is terrible."

This is one of those movies that is good because it is bad, whether or not that is done on purpose, for the purposes of parody.  Otherwise it's just a good old jump in ""The Way Back Machine"" to see a litany of cameos or cheap parts by almost anyone who was famous in the mid-1990s.  Though I do feel like most of the actors I liked were essentially wasted, but it is possible that was by design so the Martians could keep the focus for the majority of the movie.

Rethinking on the movie almost makes me want a modernization, it has so many little quirks and nuances that really brings it to a special experience.  Even if you think it looks terrible, throw this on your queque and slot it in for a Bad Movie Night. || **A film full of black humor, and for that very reason difficult to digest for many people.**

Black humor is doomed to be understood by very few, and this film, which is drenched in black humor from beginning to end, paid the price, becoming a minor failure. I believe that, even today, it is one of the less well-appreciated films of director Tim Burton's career, who made films considerably worse than this one.

The action takes place in the 90s and portrays a hostile Martian invasion of our planet. The US government (obviously, the other countries have virtually disappeared from the map and only France is mentioned lightly to show the total destruction of the country) is understandably tense: there are military personnel sexually aroused by the idea of using nuclear weapons against the invaders, there are scientists absolutely convinced that Martian technological superiority is reason enough to believe strongly in the good intentions of the visitors, there are politicians worried about the elections. Of course, when it comes time to showdown, the visitors get the upper hand.

Perhaps the best thing about this film is the strength and talent of its cast, filled with good actors who wanted to work under Burton's guidance. Jack Nicholson stands out naturally in the role of the president and does an interesting job, being well assisted by a discreet Glenn Close and a young Natalie Portman. Lisa Marie plays an unforgettable role where she doesn't have to say a single word, while Danny DeVito seems to revisit some previous characters to do his job here, which is little (but it's also true that he wasn't given much to do) . Tom Jones makes an interesting appearance. Pierce Brosnan looks like he's having fun while parodying himself. We also have good contributions from Sarah Jessica Parker, Annette Bening, Martin Short, Michael J. Fox, Rod Steiger and Jack Black.

Besides, the film is a gigantic satire on the sci-fi B cinema of the 50s and 60s, where it was common to see martian invaders and visitors. The cinematography is colorful, light, and the environment is light, funny. You can feel that the film doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't want to be taken too seriously. So it works reasonably well, at least for those who accept dark humor well."
9086.0,Young Guns II,"Three of the original five ""young guns"" — Billy the Kid, Jose Chavez y Chavez, and Doc Scurlock — return in Young Guns, Part 2, which is the story of Billy the Kid and his race to safety in Old Mexico while being trailed by a group of government agents led by Pat Garrett.",The west just got wilder.,"Western, Adventure",104,1990-08-01,en,6.5,555,1.8602,"Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian Slater, William Petersen",Geoff Murphy,"prison, prostitute, sheriff, bounty hunter, mexico, escape, anti hero, mexican standoff, native american, sequel, outlaw, cowboy, frantic, new mexico territory, 1870s, admiring, assertive, enthusiastic, euphoric","Yoo hoo, I'll make you famous.

Young Guns II is directed by Geoff Murphy and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian Slater, William Petersen, Alan Ruck, Vigo Mortensen and Balthazar Getty. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri, with contributions from Jon Bon Jovi, and cinematography is by Dean Semler.

Brushy Bill Roberts, old and crusty, claims to be Billy The Kid. Which is quite a claim considering the Kid was long thought to have been killed by Patrick Floyd Garrett in 1881. Roberts tells a listening historian that after the break up of the Tunstall Regulators, the remaining members hooked up with Garrett and Arkansas Dave Rudabaugh and still lived the outlaw life...

Young Guns was released in 1988 and became a big enough hit to warrant this sequel two years later. Reuniting gunslingers Billy the Kid (Estevez), Doc Scurlock (Sutherland) and Chavez (Phillips) from the first film, Young Guns II follows the same formula that worked so well two years previously. Billy is still a borderline nut case and his gang, for better or worse, follow him into a number of escapades. This time around, though, we have some added interest in the form of Christian Slater's cocky Rudabaugh, who, as an egotist, wants to run the gang himself. Things are further given a lift when Garrett (a darn fine William Petersen resplendent with major face fuzz) leaves the gang and is persuaded to become a law man. His first job being of course to catch Billy!

Both Young Guns movies are frowned upon by many old school Western purists, which to a degree I understand. They lack any sort of psychological aspects outside of a brat packer like cast shooting and quipping with care free abandon. Character depth is lacking so there is nothing on which to hang your hat on. Here, much like the first film, creative license is used with historical facts but the core basis of story is solid, with many of the events leading up to the documented death of Billy the Kid holding true. Major problem here, though, is that the makers are spinning off from the iffy claim of Brushy Bill Roberts that he was Billy the Kid and did not die at the hands of Pat Garrett. Knowing Billy survives the pursuit and show-down with Garrett at the start of the film kind of dilutes the wonder and impending drama! Film also at times feels like a composite of Little Big Man, Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid and of course Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid.

However, both films, and more so with this sequel, have such a sense of fun like homage to them it's not hard to forgive the obvious flaws. Action is plentiful, with much blood shed during the course of the story, while the story always remains intriguing by way of the character dynamics. Semler's photography is more in tune with the Wild West this time around, as is Silvestri's score, the latter of which lifts parts of his ""Predator"" arrangement to blend with more traditional cowboy harmonies. Great song from Bon Jovi to close the film down as well. 

There's a nice link to Peckinpah's movie with an important cameo for James Coburn as John Chisum (Coburn played Pat Garrett in Peckinpah's pic). But most of all it's just great fun to be in the company of Estevez's Billy, it's true enough to say it comes at the expense of the other characters around him, for it's a film owning show, which also dubiously swerves us into cheering for the baby faced ""outlaw hero"". Yet it plays out as a rollicking good ride in spite of some grey area thematics and a roll call of clichés. And boys, oh boys, Jenny Wright pops in to raise the temperatures considerably with a Lady Godiva moment. If for nothing else, the Young Guns movies got people talking about the Western genre in the MTV age, so that has to be a bonus to the discerning Western fan. 

Acknowledge the faults by all means, but viewing them as gun slinging fun wrapped around real Western folklore might just help you enjoy the experience a touch more. 7/10"

Can they rise from the ashes? Kelly Preston, Bonnie Hunt and Regina King are also on hand.

Jerry Maguire” (1996) is equal parts spirited drama, romantic comedy and sports flick. It effectively illustrates how the fast-paced cutthroat world isn’t interested in inspiring, well-meaning truth, but that doesn’t negate the value of honest friendship, genuine love and, most of all, loyalty.   

It’s all-around ‘hip’ and entertaining, slowing down for the mid-section. But the last act drives everything home and is moving. It pretty much represents the best of the sometimes dubious genre (romcom).

The film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area as well as the Phoenix/Tempe region of Arizona, including Lost Dutchman State Park just east of there.

GRADE: A- || “Jerry” (Tom Cruise) is a successful sports agent who spins the most outrageous yarns to his would-be clients in return for their business and could probably sell sand to a Bedouin. Then, well he has a bit of a brain freeze and decides to reveal some of the tricks of his trade to the great unwashed. All that does it get him canned, but not before he can rescue one client from his rapidly dwindling sources of employment. That is American football nonentity “Tidwell” (Cuba Gooding Jnr.). Now he’s a bit of a pratt, but is a decent and untypically loyal cove who is happily married to “Marcee” (Regina King) and he has potential for a $10 millions contract - if only he can knuckle down and show he has that elusive star quality that brings in the big bucks. Meantime, “Jerry” meets and falls head over heels with “Dorothy” (Renée Zellweger). They marry but we quickly discover that that’s not the adrenaline rush he is needing. Yep, he needs his bro-dance partner to get onto that ball park and do the business. This sees one of Cruise’s more natural performances as he delivers, initially at any rate, quite a compelling impersonation of a venal manipulator out to promise the moon. As the story moves along, though, his role is rather subsumed into a gloop of cheese that’s only really saved by an engaging and enthusiastic effort from a no holes barred Gooding who enters into the spirit of his character quite enjoyably. Zellweger has her moments too, but for the most part her character is consigned to a fairly predicable story arc that doesn’t really add much to what is essentially a story about loyalty and learning to appreciate what really matters in life. Well that, and a sock in the eye to the old boss too! It’s quite pithily scripted and whizzes along poking a little fun at the excesses of an industry that massively overpays for mediocrity, hype and is largely devoid of folks with too much soul."

There's a fun scene with Frances McDormand and the deliberations of the parole board made me smile, and all in all it is still worth a watch. || **Another honorable addition to the Cohen Brothers' remarkable filmography.**

I've seen several films by the Cohen Brothers and this one, far from being one of the most quotable when talking about them, is full of qualities that deserve note. The two brothers are known and respected for the way they create and direct cinematographic projects, giving little room for interference that would disturb the overall vision they have outlined, and actively interfering in all aspects of production. It's their film, they define the characteristics and, whether you like them or not, they are undoubtedly a talented duo.

And being an author's work, this film follows several characteristics that are hallmarks of the two filmmakers. This is a work full of irreverence, where the narrative stands out for its bizarreness and sarcasm, intelligently constructed and crafted in a way that surprises the audience. The story is simple: a couple, who meet and fall in love under the most unorthodox conditions, discover that they cannot have children and, therefore, decide to kidnap a baby from a family that had quintuplets. There is an entire history of crime in the life of one of the couple's members that contributes to them being the target of a brutal chase by a wild bounty hunter. And there are many moments of acidic and difficult-to-digest humor. Added to this is the cinematography and soundtrack, where the Cohens are completely at ease. Personally, I must say, I didn't really like the soundtrack that was used in this film. I found it excessively intrusive and strident, but this is just my personal taste.

In addition to the artistic and author notes, the film also features a skilled cast where Nicholas Cage has plenty of space and material to shine. He is charismatic enough to give his character all the sympathy he needs to captivate us, and he makes a good romantic pair with Holly Hunter, who received a character tailored to her abilities and talent. The two actors have everything it takes to do an exceptional job, and there is no doubt that they won't leave us disappointed. Trey Wilson, Frances McDormand, John Goodman and Randall Tex Cobb join the project, with all their talent, to shine with very well-made secondary characters."

When my family (my mother, my brother, and I) went out on our traditional weekly ""Movie Date Night"" (as we so lovingly named it during that time) to see Grease at the Chicago Theater, ""Thank God It's Friday"" had been playing at the old State and Lake Theater right across the street from the CT. And me being a hopeless Donna Summer fanatic, naturally I'd wanted to see ""TGIF"" too, but it had to be Grease, first, because our tix were purchased in advance ... And also because we were only committed to one movie at a time...sometimes. 😊

I was glad, however, that we got to see Grease, because I was in love with this film by the time it ended. It was one of my most cherished childhood experiences/memories. And I still hold it dear today.

This Randal Kleiser directed musical was one of the greatest cinematic oeuvres of its time - even today, undergoing readaptations for the stage, and entertaining both past and present generations. In Grease, the film, John Travolta (my guy) and Olivia Newton-John (my girl) star as Danny and Sandy, who meet one summer at the beach and fall madly in love. However, there's one problem: Danny is a local fella (and a 'T-birds greaser gang member'), while Sandy (pure and clean-cut from Australia) is only in town vacationing for the summer. When the summer ends, their newfound (and passionate) relationship may also have to. But will it?...

Set in 1950s California, Grease is a motion picture for the Hollywood history books. It is tremendously directed, with a beautifully-composed soundtrack. And the cast? Well, what can you say when you have a gifted supporting ensemble of some of the best in their respective crafts: Stockard Channing, Frankie Avalon, Eve Arden, Joan Blondell, Sha-Na-Na, Sid Ceasar, and Alice Ghostley, among a talented bundle of others.

Grease is one of my all-time favorites. The story is grade A, and so are the legendary performances, as is the equally fabled soundtrack to which it is set. I love this movie, and highly recommend it to everyone ... Especially those of you, who like me, harbor a passion for musicals. || You're a fake and a phony and I wish I never laid eyes on you!

Grease is directed by Randal Kleiser and stars John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing & Jeff Conaway. It's co-written by Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey (Musical), Bronte Woodard & Allan Carr.

1958 and Danny (Travolta) has a holiday romance with the pretty and virginal Sandy (Newton-John). She ends up going to the same high school as he, but he's under peer pressure to stay cool and uphold a tough guy image. They fall out, argue, make up, their friends are equally unstable. Oh and there's the small matter of some truly memorable songs and dances too.

As full of gusto as it is cheese, Grease is the musical that's hard to dislike. The acting is so-so, the direction one dimensional and the plot could have been written on a 50s beer mat. Yet we love it because of its faults, the kooky charm that sidles up alongside those roaring tunes. We care not that these actors are too old to play high schoolers, the fun is watching them have fun being teens again. Hell there's even innuendo unbound and cheeky lyrics for those of an adult mind. A truly great fun movie that's longevity shows no time of ending any time soon. Watch it, enjoy, sing along, pick a favourite tune and character, and then salute it; for Grease is the word baby. 9/10 || Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/gvGcY-PMazg

I don’t even know when I added it to my watchlist, but working through my backlog, the musical _Grease_ suddenly became the next movie to watch. This is of course a classic and I cannot name one person who does know at least one song from it. 

So, deep in your brain somewhere, you’re probably aware generally of what this is about, but here is the official description:

_Good girl Sandy Olsson and greaser Danny Zuko fell in love over the summer. When they unexpectedly discover they're now in the same high school, will they be able to rekindle their romance?_

Made in 1978 but set in 1958 this is a whole lot of toe tapping fun. Almost all of the songs are instantly recognisable, and although I will never admit it, I may or may not have slid across our kitchen tiles on my knees after watching it, yelling “it’s ELECTRIFYING”. 

What’s interesting watching this now is how lewd this is. So much of this went way over my head when watching this as a kid. Condoms breaking, calling cars pussy wagons, singing about chicks creaming and swimsuits getting damp, I forgot how much double entendre and innuendo there is in the song lyrics and the movie as a whole.

What’s even more interesting is the theory of how Sandy in fact died on the beach in the opening scene and that the rest of the film is the dying, oxygen starved fantasy of her brain. Think about it - in the song “Summer Nights” from Sandy’s point of view, Danny says that when he met Sandy, “I saved her life; she nearly drowned.” What if I told you that, in reality, she _did_ drown hence why on the beach Sandy, as she enters the alternate plane asks him “Is this the end?” He replies, “Of course not. It’s only the beginning.” She then has the dying brain fantasy of a year of high school romance with Danny, the visions get more and more outlandish as the time passes, before, at the climax of the movie she and Danny drive off in a car that leaves the ground and drives off into heaven, in what we can only speculate are her final moments. 

Anyway that’s something to think about next time you watch it. Either way it’s a good fun movie and always worth a watch."

I opened this write up with a funny line spoken by Robert Redford because having just finished the film I feel all jolly, and that is a priceless thing after watching one of the most suspenseful films ever! (groan). This film is a multi genre offering, it has pretty much most bases covered and features a cast of actors from different eras clearly enjoying the work that they are doing. There is no earth shattering twists or performances to match, it's a tight and intelligent script that's written to provide two hours of pure entertainment. It does have suspense, and it does make you think about how technology can be an incredible tool/weapon, but chiefly the film is one that you all can watch during a night in and be safe in the knowledge that your rental or TV time hasn't been wasted. 7.5/10

Footnote: The ending is fabulous, I really should go for a higher rating purely for the incredulous looks that James Earl Jones gives as the final reel draws to a close."

Based on the true story, a 19 year-old Ernest Hemmingway (Chris O'Donnell) falls for an older nurse (Sandra Bullock) after being wounded in Italy during WW1.

“In Love and War” (1996) is a solid historical drama/romance similar in spirit to “Legends of the Fall” (1994). As presented in the film, young Hemmingway has a likable, respectable side, but we also see evidence of his immense flaws, such as self-serving lying and exaggeration of his exploits.

At least one important scene is fictitious, and another one probably is as well, but I don’t want to give them away. Look up the facts after watching. Nonetheless, it’s clear that Hemingway’s relationship with Agnes von Kurowsky deeply affected him as he included elements of it in several of his stories, including A Farewell to Arms.         

The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in Veneto, Italy, and Québec, Canada.

Scream followed all the rules and simultaneously broke them in a brilliant self-aware genre reinvention that leveraged every horror movie trope to set up and subvert every expectation. Scream is a love ballad to horror movie fans that intimately knows and zealously honors the legacy of terror-filled films that came before while creating something new, innovative, bold, and surprising. Scream’s dark humor and admiration of overused horror plot points resulted in one of the first meta films in history. Characters know they are living a real-life horror film and yet make dumb and predictable horror movie decisions tricking the viewers into a sort of safety before breaking all the rules and surprising with unexpected twists and turns. Scream was the first of its kind and welcomed a whole new horror sub-genre and a movie franchise that still has no end in sight over 25 years later. || **_Scream delivered a breath of fresh air into the slasher franchise and holds up rather well nearly 30 years later._**

The plot of this film follows a cookie-cutter structure that models nearly all of the great slasher franchises of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but that is entirely the point. Scream is completely aware of the tropes of horror movies and utilizes them in a creative way by adding commentary and subtle comedy delivered by the characters throughout the film. It is not a full-fledged comedy by any means; there is no forced humor or jokes, but it is more of a dark comedy that pokes fun at itself in the background.

The performances from our main cast were great. Neve Campbell delivers an excellent badass performance and is the perfect lead for the franchise. She is capable of fighting back in a brutal way and rivals Laurie Stroud from Halloween as my favorite final girl of all time. Courtney Cox was quite good as well; she had limited screen time but was able to really make the most of it. David Arquette was okay; he did not blow me away by any means, and he is quite replaceable in my opinion. Matthew Lillard was my favorite of the film; his performance was over the top and quite mentally deranged, which worked really well. Skeet Ulrich was also quite good, but took a backseat to Lillard in my opinion.

The direction of this film was great. Wes Craven did an excellent job delivering unique shots and utilizing the camera angle and height quite well. I do think this movie needs a little more gore and violence for it being a slasher film. There was really only one kill that was quite memorable to me. For it being a homage and critique of the slasher genre, it was lacking quite a bit in the slash department. In addition, the runtime felt a bit bloated, and I think if this was cut down to maybe ten minutes, the viewing experience would have been better.

Overall, I do think this movie is slightly overrated, but it is still a great film and worthy of its praise (for the most part).

Michael, excellently portrayed by John Travolta, is an unorthodox Archangel enjoying his last mission (vacation?) to Earth. A supermarket tabloid from Chicago sends a team to Iowa to get a story and pictures; after discovering that he's a real angel they naturally want to bring him back to the big city.

What works best is that the story is essentially a fun-spirited road movie. William Hurt, Andie MacDowell and Robert Pastorelli have an exceptional time meeting Michael and trying to escort him back to Chicago. Michael acts like a tourist having the time of his life, humorously wanting to see those silly little 'attractions' dispersed across the countryside (e.g. ""the world's biggest non-stick frying pan,"" etc.) -- you know, the ones most of us adults roll our eyes at.

Lots of fun things and miracles take place along the way. What struck me the most about Michael (the angel) is that he has a genuine spirit of JOY. The simple joy-of-living-itself is all over him; and this has a phenomenal impact on the people around him. It's something most of us could learn from Michael.

The film has loads of laughs and, surprisingly, even some profundities.

The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in Texas, Iowa and Chicago.

GRADE: A || Andie MacDowell was once the most adorable person in Hollywood wasn't she? And I mean that as it utterly charming. And the same goes for her performance here, she turns up the charm and does her best to sell the role.

But, unfortunately, Travolta (fresh from his Pulp Fiction rebirth) is playing his Vincent Vega role in the comedy and is entirely out of place throughout it.

Really, if you are a Travolta fan you should just watch Pulp Fiction, it's basically him doing the same thing in a film where it works and feels appropriate.

Here, well, here you just have Andie MacDowell attempting to charm the film into a success, while Travolta still thinks he's working with QT."
9361.0,The Last of the Mohicans,"In war-torn colonial America, in the midst of a bloody battle between British, the French and Native American allies, the aristocratic daughter of a British Colonel and her party are captured by a group of Huron warriors. Fortunately, a group of three Mohican trappers comes to their rescue.",An epic adventure and passionate romance unfold against the panorama of a frontier wilderness ravaged by war.,"Action, History, Romance, War",112,1992-08-26,en,7.387,3203,4.9287,"Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Jodhi May, Russell Means, Wes Studi",Michael Mann,"based on novel or book, love triangle, native american, revenge, interracial relationship, period drama, historical, warfare, colonialism, 18th century, warrior, french and indian war","Death and honour are thought to be the same, but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.

The Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann who also co-adapts the screenplay with Christopher Crowe from James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, Jodhi May, Steven Waddington and Wes Studi. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.

1757 during the French and Indian War, Hawkeye (Lewis), a white man who was adopted by the Mohicans, finds himself on a perilous journey to escort a couple of British sisters to their father's fort. This journey brings him, and his companions, into conflict with Magua (Studi), a sadistic Huron warrior seeking revenge on the girls' father.

Inspired by the Randolph Scott film of the same name made in 1936, Michael Mann gives his all to create a stirring classical epic fit to sit in the company of the historical greats of old. Visually it's a treat of some magnitude, where aided by Spinotti, Mann frames his characters in the glorious vistas provided by the North Carolinas. For those with a bent for historical narratives, Mann's film also is not found wanting, in fact it's a cerebral delight. There's romantic strands that sit right in the colourful quilt, action expertly staged and handled by the talented director and the cast, led by a superbly athletic and serious Day-Lewis, are impressive and doing justice to the requisite characters written on the page, and the musical score enhances mood with swirling beauty coupling with primitive potency that wraps itself snugly around the story.

Mann gets all the key ingredients right, but it's his ability to balance the human drama with the energised action that is most impressive. The film is also thankfully devoid of boorish filler, this is a troubled time in history, with much political activity and complex racial manoeuvres, but Mann doesn't need to fill the screen with political posturing and drawn out speeches. We know all we need to know about the period in question, but the story is kept intimate, the focus on a small group of people, of whose fate we most assuredly have interest in. While on the edges of the frame we know we are witnessing the death of an era, for better or worse on different sides of the coin. Also pays to note that Mann's well known penchant for the meticulous is evident as well, for he details the native characters with considerable care.

It's not flawless, accents fluctuate, the odd fake look slips into the production design and the director does what many American directors do, they come dangerously close to caricaturing their British officers, but this is still great heroic escapism tinged with romanticism. Something for everyone who loves classical cinema in fact. 9/10 || It might seem a bit petty, but as a Scot watching a film about a Canadian conflict in which half the characters - ""Munro"", ""Campbell"", ""Cameron"" et al are all Scottish, I found the constant interchangeability in the script between English and British really quite irritating. They are not synonymous terms - is it just lazy writing? Anyway, the rest of this is a great looking adaptation of a solid boy's-own story that tells of the war in North America between the French and the British. The former under the command of ""Montcalm"" (Patrice Chéreau) are laying siege to the fort held by the latter under the command of ""Munro"" (Maurice Roëves). To add to the woes of the besieged, his two daughters are being escorted to what he hopes will be safety with him, when they are the victims of betrayal at the hands of the duplicitous ""Magua"" (Wes Studi) and are only saved by the timely intervention of ""Hawkeye"" (Daniel Day-Lewis), his father ""Chingachgook"" (Russell Means) and brother ""Uncas"" (Eric Schweig). ""Hawkeye"" - indeed the whole colonial farming community - is viewed with mistrust by the military and when it becomes clear that the elder sibling ""Cora"" (Madeleine Stowe) is beginning to take a shine to our hero, they also incur the enmity of the conniving ""Maj. Heyward"" (Steven Waddington). It's a story of romance, certainly, but that's kept very much under control as the warring and scheming takes front and centre making sure the adventure keeps moving along apace. DDL is on good form here, nimbly skirmishing in the forest and proving extremely adept at reloading a musket in ten seconds flat! Waddington never was a very convincing actor, but he's adequate here as our story concludes with violence, sacrifice, honour, vengeance and a sense of the futility of war. Some of the siege photography and the more general cinematography is wonderful at creating some of the claustrophobic aspects of this hitherto densely forested, virgin and perilous, territory and even though they were always at war with each other, it also highlights just how little the indigenous population actually needed our presence on their continent. Big screen if you can - it's well worth the price of the ticket."

He goes all in on.. well, everything.
  
He brings aboard a stellar all-star cast, too many to highlight all, but includes Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Jack Lemmon - none of which are known for their Shakespearian pedigree. Branagh takes on Hamlet, the largest role in all of Shakespeare - and most English language literature.  His interpretation is - not surprisingly - brilliant and worthy of study.  Kate Winslet plays his challenged love Ophelia, and Derek Jacobi is the fraudulent King.  Rounding out the largest roles, Julie Christie is the doomed queen and Richard Briers is the fussy Polonius. All excellent in their handle of the language and expression of humanity.

Much of the film takes place inside the castle of Elsinore, a gorgeous and regal stage set lined with mirrors to challenge each individual's intentions and a chess-board floor to accentuate the challenge in the royal battle for checkmate.  The Elsinore grounds are widespread and scenes in the snow covered Danish mountains all shown in glorious 65mm film... an extremely detailed film stock that was rarely used because of the extreme expense and cumbersome camera size.

With **HENRY V** and **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING**, Branagh has proven he is a master of adapting Shakespeare's long form story into much more manageable American movie length.  Well, here he goes all in and captures the 4 hour play in its uncut full length.  The film was shown with a 15 minute intermission.

**HAMLET** itself is doubtlessly one of the most intelligent character studies ever written by any author, and Branagh does a great job recording that. Even many other productions of the show do as good a job or even better job in relaying that story.

Either way Branagh's film work is filled with many treasures and to this point, his Shakespeare films are close to flawless. For now..."

Released in 1996, the movie focuses on budding writer Novalyne Price Ellis (Renée Zellweger) and her experiences with famous pulp writer, Robert E. Howard (Vincent D'Onofrio), creator of Conan the barbarian and other characters, like Kull, Solomon Kane and Red Sonya. The events take place in central Texas (Cross Plains and Brownwood) during the last two years of Howard’s life, 1934-1936, and are based on Novalyne’s  memoirs “One Who Walked Alone” and “Day of the Stranger: Further Memories of Robert E. Howard.” Ann Wedgeworth is on hand as Robert’s sickly mother.

Howard’s great imagination and expertise with words made him “the greatest pulp fiction writer in the whole wide world,” as he was known. Unfortunately he died way too young at the age of 30 but, thankfully, he was prolific and so we have a lot of material by him to enjoy. It has always been a mystery to me why this talented man died the way he did, but this film gives life to REH’s last two years and helps the viewer understand what happened.

This is a true-life drama with elements of romance consisting of the simple way of life of a writer, his parents and friends in the plains of central Texas in the mid-30s. Most of the sequences take place at the quaint Howard abode, the theater in Brownwood, the school where Novalyne taught and, mostly, Robert & Novalyne driving the desolate landscapes or walking and talking, sometimes in conflict. In other words, this is a simple drama. The potency comes with the subject matter, Robert E. Howard.  I found the drama gripping as insights emerge in the dialogues and other sequences.

A teenage girl (Jenny Agutter) and her little brother get stuck in the Outback, but receive assistance by an aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) on a ‘walkabout,’ a rite of passage into manhood.

Directed by Nicolas Roeg, “Walkabout” (1971) is an arty cult flick that plays like a Terrence Malick film and no doubt influenced his style (since it came out two years before Malick’s feature film debut with “Badlands”). Agutter was only 16 during shooting while her character is 14, according to Roeg.

The themes about the beauty of nature vs. man-made desecration and the clash of the primitive with the ‘cultured’ & the problems of communication thereof were probably fresh at the time but are obvious and old hat now. ""Dances With Wolves"" tackled the same issues almost 20 years later. Still, this is an artistic piece with loads of awesome nature footage, plus it’s interesting to see Agutter so young in the bush. It’s a must if you appreciate movies like “Picnic at Hanging Rock” (1975) or anything by Terrence Malick. 

David Gulpilil went on to appear in such notable flicks as “Crocodile Dundee” (1986) and “Australia” (2008).

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Sydney, Finders mountain range, the red desert surrounding Alice Springs and (supposedly) areas never traveled by Caucasians up to that point.

His tall, gangly, appearance frequently being his principle prop - that his his character's innate crassness and stupidity. As the story evolves, we get a bit less of that and more of Kline's mischievous humour and of course Curtis, whom her pal things is interested in him romantically but she is far more enamoured of the zoo and then rather predictably... There's an entertaining supporting cast here - Robert Lindsay, fellow Python Michael Palin and Ronnie Corbett, and they and their animals add the ""aah"" factor the the thing making it watchable, but not really very memorable."
42424.0,Zeus & Roxanne,"Mary Beth is a marine biologist that gets annoyed when a dog called Zeus stows aboard her research boat. Nevertheless she is intrigued when the intrusive canine makes best-friends with her captive dolphin, Roxanne. She falls in love with Zeus's owner, Terry, a musician who rides a bike.",A friendship no one ever thought possible. An adventure no one ever will forget.,"Adventure, Comedy, Family, Romance",98,1997-01-24,en,5.198,81,0.8211,"Steve Guttenberg, Kathleen Quinlan, Arnold Vosloo, Dawn McMillan, Jessica Howell","George T. Miller, Tom Benedek","marine biologist, dolphin, dog","George Miller directs this family film about a scrappy, mangy mongrel who falls in love with a graceful creature way out of his league, and species- but enough about Steve Guttenberg and Kathleen Quinlan.

Zeus is the dog belonging to widower Terry (Steve Guttenberg) and son Jordan (Miko Hughes). Roxanne is the dolphin being studied by Mary Beth (Kathleen Quinlan), when she isn't busy running after her bratty daughters Judith (Majandra Delfino) and Nora (Jessica Howell). Dog and dolphin meet in the opening scene of the film and the two seem to share a special bond that is never fully explored by the screenwriter.  Terry and Mary Beth happen to live across the street from each other, and Zeus follows Mary Beth to work to see Roxanne. We also meet our villain, Dr. Carver (Arnold Vosloo), who pens his dolphins to study them instead of letting them frolic in the open sea like Roxanne does. Mary Beth decides to apply for a grant to study inter-species communication after seeing Zeus and Roxanne's interaction.  Judith, Nora, and Jordan set Terry and Mary Beth up on a date that goes so well the kids decide shacking up would be the next logical step in the relationship. Terry has second thoughts (making one wonder where his first thoughts are since both adults are shamelessly manipulated by their offspring), and bolts with boy and dog, while Roxanne acts out in her own way. We can't have a story without some conflict, so Carver steals Mary Beth's idea and tries interspecies with his own dolphins and animals in the film's only funny scene. Zeus escapes Terry and Jordan and heads back to Roxanne, while the dolphin is rumored dead and Mary Beth goes looking for her.

If I needed to describe ""Zeus and Roxanne"" with one word, that word would be ""mild."" The film makers saw their target audience, the family, and dumbed down every aspect of the production. What is produced is a bland saltine of a movie more at home on a basic cable family channel, sandwiched in between reruns of drab thirty-year old sitcoms.  Terry and Jordan, two of the film's lead characters, really don't have to be here at all. Zeus could have been a stray dog discovered by Mary Beth, and the main plot of the film (dog and dolphin) could have remained intact. Instead, Terry is an immature musician cared for by Jordan, whose photographs of Zeus reminded me of early Robert Mapplethorpe. So we must suffer through the pulp romance mechanics of Mary Beth and Terry's courtship, while dog and dolphin take a back seat to the humans.

Kathleen Quinlan is actually quite good here. While her character is not as straight laced and prudish as I imagine she was conceived to be, she is the best thing going. Guttenberg is given nothing, forcing that silly grin and probably wondering what the hell happened between ""Cocoon"" and this. The Bahamas location and underwater photography are both beautiful, as it would be hard to muck that up.  Unfortunately, director Miller is as mechanical with his direction as Tom Benedek is with his screenplay. Endless shots of the animals doing adorable things gets old after a while. Bruce Rowland's high-pitched musical score is so bad, I kept muting my television, ready to blame the neighbors for playing their stereo too loud.

The funniest aspect of this film is the breathless blurb on the back of the VHS box from critic Jeffrey Lyons, who salivates: ""A charmer! Zeus and Roxanne will melt your hearts- and parents will enjoy it, guaranteed!"" You know, if I had not checked this out from the library for free, I would be tempted to write Lyons and demand my video rental fee be refunded toot-sweet. Throw back ""Zeus and Roxanne."""

The mayor (Linda Hamilton) is in no rush to terminate her time in office, and when his boss “Paul” (Charles Hallahan) turns up and tries to dial things down, it would seem that all is under control - or under the rug, anyway.

This is a generally amusing “chick flick” focusing on Gringo/Latino relations, albeit formulaic. Some jokes fall flat, but they’re well intended. Perry makes for a likable male protagonist while Salma Hayek is winsome in her physical prime; and Suzanne Snyder in secondary role is nothing to sneeze at. Meanwhile Jon Tenney appears as the protagonist’s best friend. The Las Vegas area locations are picturesque.

I'm not sure if it's woeful or brilliant, I'm leaning towards the latter I gotta be honest. Hear me out.

For most of my watch, I was expecting to give this a less than positive rating. It starts off decently before meandering towards its conclusion. When it gets there, though, it's absolutely bonkers. My feelings towards the final part switched completely, I initially found it stupid (which it probably is) but the last embers of it are so ridiculous that it's actually entertaining.

Don't be fooled by the covers for this film, by the way. It looks like it's going to be a CGI cat but it isn't, a real cat is used for the vast majority as far as I could tell. Even on Disney+ it has the CG cover, which cheapens the film and would've turned me away - had I not been on this Disney marathon that I'm on. Very strange choice from the makers.

At this point, it is worth noting I thoroughly enjoyed the 1965 original film; which is far, far superior to this remake. The cast in '65 are terrific, but the '97 cast list is one I actually rate. Dean Jones, to my surprise, appears in this one. He plays a different character completely, but it's cool to see him nevertheless.

As for the newcomers onscreen, Christina Ricci (Patti) and Doug E. Doug (Zeke) are the leads. Ricci is no Hayley Mills, nor is Doug a Jones, but I still liked them together. Michael McKean (Peter) is also involved, as is Pixar staple John Ratzenberger (Dusty) - who, alongside Mark Christopher Lawrence (Rollo), play a part in the finale.

This has a very low average rating on Letterboxd, which I can completely understand. For me, though, I found it so bizarre that it actually works in a twisted sort of way. Would I recommend this? I dunno. Was I entertained? Surprisingly, yeah.

_Comedy that still holds up, even all these years later._

Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/QzlQnWap2-g || <em>'Vegas Vacation'</em> is decent fare for this franchise, I think I just about enjoyed it. It does go through peaks and troughs, there are some uninteresting moments but by and large what I was viewing was passable entertainment. The Vegas setting and shenanigans keep it watchable, the dam scenes are good too.

Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are back yet again, as is Randy Quaid. I still don't really rate the latter's character all that much, pretty annoying in fact (and not in the intended sense); Chase's Clark is supposed to be <i>the</i> idiot here, so always feels odd to have an even bigger idiot.

The more sentimental conclusion doesn't totally land, at least in terms of how it's portrayed. It felt watching that it was attempting to be super sensitive about family and love for each other, but these aren't the sort of movies where that fits. The Griswolds are dysfunctional, not lovable or relatable.

Still, this is better than I thought it was going to be; especially with the disappearance of the National Lampoon name and the eight-year gap from the previous entry."

I can't say there is anything about <em>'Jungle 2 Jungle'</em> that I liked or enjoyed, I don't think it is anything overtly terrible but it's just so boring. None of the cast are memorable, the plot is lazy and the pacing is well off. It does attempt heart, though it doesn't hit all that sharply.

The performances of Tim Allen (Michael) and Martin Short (Richard) - though not good - at least keep the film away from the depths of awful. I also think Sam Huntington (Mimi) is alright in this. There's also an appearance from Jumba Jookiba himself, David Ogden Stiers.

All in all, It's just a very basic and plain live-action production from Disney. The stereotypical 'jokes' don't help its cause, either. || **Absolutely ordinary, within the standard of any light family comedy of the late 90's. Maybe that's why it ended up forgotten.**

This is another one of those endearing family films from the 90's that made their way to the small screen, and disappeared completely once they left the TV channels. It is a film that I believe very few will remember. I saw it at the time, I forgot about it, and I only remembered it again when I found it by chance, and I decided to see it again, these days.

The script is as predictable and cliché as it can be, but it retains some elements that don't let us hate it, namely the sympathetic way in which it approaches us and tries to create a family story, a light comedy about maladjustment, where a boy born and raised in the Venezuelan jungle ends up traveling to New York, the birthplace of his recently discovered biological father. There are some subplots in the middle, necessary for the film to have more support, because the main plot is too thin to stand on its own. Thus comes the whole business of trading coffee futures with mobsters, or that obnoxious character who is the boy's father's future bride. There are still some scenes, obviously demonstrating the boy's inadaptation to the city and urban society.

The film is far from being good, and it shouldn't have left any special good memory in the minds of anyone involved in the project. However, it has a terrible comic exercise by Tim Allen, who is the main actor and the protagonist of the entire plot. He overacts, he's ham, he tries to be minimally funny. He doesn't always succeed, but the effort is there. Martin Short isn't better, he's just dumber, but these movies need the protagonist to have an idiot sidekick to do something even more stupid than he would do without him. Sam Huntington was a casting error. He may even be the son of two Caucasians, but he would fatally be very tanned in the equatorial climate where he was born, and the young actor is white as milk. His romance with Leelee Sobiesky, while having all the usual touches of a teenager's first crush, doesn't quite convince us.

Technically, the film is absolutely regular. As regular as a light-hearted late 1990s family comic film can be. The cinematography, the sets, the costumes (even the ones in the jungle, where the Indian women were asked to cover up tribal nudity), everything is absolutely and perfectly ordinary and does not bring us surprises."

What you have here are people sitting around talking about sex. You have people walking around talking about their relationship.

Before Sunrise did kind of the same thing, but throughout you had the feeling of love that would be lost. This didn't really pull off that emotion.

It also didn't pull off the tension in many other dialogue driven movies...and it didn't pull off the humor either.

It did, however, develop characters very well, so it gets 3 Stars for great characters. But I just can't give it any more. The characters weren't eccentric enough to be appealing, they were just...normal. Normal would have worked if there was more of a plot, more of a goal.

Instead it felt like talking about your relationship with your girlfriend and then relating that conversation with your friends with no real direction and no one really entertaining and abnormal enough to latch onto."

It has very little resemblance to the Simon Templar that we got to know in the TV-series starring Roger Moore in the lead role. I have not read the books so I do not know how well the movie actually relates to the books but I have to say that I was a little disappointed to see a Simon Templar that was not really…him.

I have never really been a huge fan of Val Kilmer and I do not really think he is the best match for the role. But then, as I wrote, I really do not see this as a Simon Templar movie anyway so. Elisabeth Shue is totally unbelievable as a scientist. I know they had to pick someone reasonably good-looking to satisfy the script but still, she just doesn’t cut it as a scientist. The Russians are giving a much better performance. I quite liked both the Tretiak characters.

That is not to say that this is a bad movie though. You just have to forget about the references to The Saint and Simon Templar. The latter is not very difficult since he really do not call himself Simon Templar in most of the movie anyway. What this movie is though is a fairly decent light entertainment about a skilled high stakes thief with a troubled childhood. I say light entertainment because the plot is really not much more than you would expect from a TV-series pilot. There are some fun action, some fun infiltration, disguises, a bit of high-tech etc. Just a mixture of some “fun stuff” making you go “okay that was not too bad” at the end of the movie.

Oh, one more thing, I know that Simon Templar used to drive a Volvo P1800 but quite frankly, that was the only cool car that Volvo have ever made. Since the movie was so far from what I consider to be Simon Templar it is a real bummer that they had to choose that modern Volvo crap for him to drive. || Good watch, would watch again, and can't confidently recommend.

This movie is definitely dated.  Val Kilmer was still riding on ""I was Batman"" and a bunch of Hollywood actors had decided to have a go at being the next action (/spy) guy, and I think it was to try to knock Tom Cruise out of his position (like that worked).

This international spy of mysterious origin, even with an entire backstory as a prelude in the beginning of the movie, just so happens to be targeting ""cold fusion"", so we get a sci-fi edge.

The person that happens to make the most plausible progress on cold fusion just happens to be a ""stunningly beautiful woman"", Elisabeth Shue, with a heart condition to top everything off.

The actual movie experience was good, I promise, but thinking back on things, it all sounds so ridiculous.  There is a lot of underlying romantic comedy at play here, and if I'm honest, I don't think they movie knew what it wanted to be: mob movie, sci-fi discovery, rom com, action / spy, political intrigue, catholic revolution, or orphan identity.

Most of the fun stuff is spy versus Russian mob or cute rom com stuff, but you could probably get a better experience for either in different movies.

It's a good time, but given all the options out there, you're probably better off looking for a more modern spy movie. || By no means a great movie but for some reason have been drawn to this one, seeing it 3-4 times over the years. For the most part entertaining though the dialogue was pretty bad, however I like Val Kilmer in the lead and shares some nice scenes with the lovely Elisabeth Shue. **3.5/5**"

What now ensues is a really rather poorly constructed story that leaves breadcrumbs for us all to follow to an ending that though taut at times along the way, is really nothing very interesting. As a Brit, I've always found these intrigue films that portray terrorists as glorified freedom fighters a bit tough to stomach and the narrative here plays to just about every dumb stereotype imaginable. There is precious little by way of action and the pace sort of lumbers along with little to engage the little grey cells. The plot is overly simplistic and from a political perspective, totally one-sided and that renders the whole thing little better than an hollow outing for both.

Trust me, you won’t believe how realistic the CGI is. You’d swear the snakes were right there with the actors.

The characters are in no way infuriating. At no point do you ever root for the snakes to win and all the human characters to die in horrible ways. You feel genuinely upset when a character dies and don’t want to laugh or cheer at all.

This is a huge surprise that this holds up after 20+ years, which is great because there aren't enough giant snake movies out there.

This was a bit before modern technology, but that's offset by taking place on the Amazon River, far away from where technology would work anyways.

This was also back when Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube thought they were actors (and I honestly prefer them as actors), and I certainly don't think that they are the any of the bad parts of this movie.

Jon Voight was by far the most confusing, if not ""bad"" part of this movie.  I think he was doing an impression of a Spaniard, but maybe was supposed to be having a Portuguese accent as that's what they speak in Brazil, but it was never clear if he was supposed to be FROM there or not.  Even the character itself is oddly motivated, fighting to stay alive against people, but clearly has no self preservation when comes to catching the snake alive....so he can.....what...mate with it?

Owen Wilson, in typically form, plays the ""let's ruin this"" role and really is a catalyst for the movie spiraling out of control.

This is a ""Mr. Toad's Wild Ride"" of a movie, not good (even back then), but still lots of fun.  With the bad CG and odd, but impressive practical effects, it certainly was never the impending threat of an unstoppable beast that was the problem. || Yep hope I never see any giant anaconda In person.

I'm on the fence with Sorvino and Kudrow -- I neither like nor dislike them -- so it's the story and peripheral characters that are going to make or break the film for people like me, but I can't remember that many memorable parts even though I saw the movie two days ago, which isn't a good sign. On the plus side there's no raunch.

So it's worth checking out if what I said piques your interest but, for me, meh.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in the general Los Angeles area.

Well, first of all, I have to acknowledge the impact and popularity of this film, not just at the time it came out, but even today. It was one of the great successes of the time (except for the United Kingdom, shaken by the death of Diana Spencer, and where the film only later, on physical support, came to gain popularity). It is one of the most popular comedies of the late 20th century and was instrumental in consolidating and expanding Mike Myers' career. However, I don't think it's exactly… my cup of tea. And I will explain why.

The script is, basically, a parody of the James Bond films… Austin Powers is a flamboyant and liberal spy who is described as the man all women want and all men want to copy. This is hilarious because the character is ugly, kitschy and has the manners of a deeply misogynistic sexual pervert. Nothing against it, I'm not a fan of political correctness. What really bothers me about this movie is the total absence of funny jokes and the emphasis on the sex theme. Almost all jokes have a sexual connotation, and this proved not only ineffective but tiresome.

The plot is simple: in the Sixties, Powers fails in his attempt to neutralize his greatest enemy, Dr. Evil, when he escapes and freezes himself in a cryogenic capsule. In order not to be left behind, the spy offers to go through it, being frozen until the day his enemy returns, which happens in the late 90's. From here, a whole sub-plot is generated in which both characters, in their own way, will have to adapt to the new period as they prepare for the final confrontation.

Myers is the driving force of the entire film, taking on the skin of two of the important characters: the hero and the villain. This is not something new in cinema and has already been carried out by Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness, two references that Myers took into account in his work. And even though I didn't really like the film, it wouldn't be right of me if I refrained from praising this actor, and his ability and commitment. Elizabeth Hurley played a spy, daughter of a former colleague of the protagonist, being the ""Powers-Girl"" in this film. She is good enough for the task and does a pleasant job.

Technically, the film does what it needs. A regular cinematography with good colors and sharpness, a very pleasant rhythm and no dead moments. I liked the props and the sets, especially Powers' car (a classic Jaguar). His costume, clearly inspired by 18th century clothing, also seemed creative and original to me, although I have some difficulty in finding any credible basis for this option in the fashions and aesthetics of the 60s. Finally, a note of praise for the very good soundtrack and, in particular, for the lively dance sequence that accompanies the opening credits. || I know this is a very popular movie. It's just a little to weird of a comedy for my liking."
2163.0,Breakdown,"On their cross-country drive, a married couple, Jeff and Amy Taylor, experience car trouble after their SUV breaks down.

While driving cross-country, their car breaks down. The various local people they meet who initially seem helpful are in fact criminals working together. The wife is kidnapped, the husband is told to pay half a million to get her back alive, and Kurt Russell decides he'd rather fight.

I found this a rather lame movie. Its believability goes way down when, for example, Kurt Russell rides on the bottom of a moving truck trailer and easily finds his way up to the cab. There are obvious continuity and other errors here: a villain gets a brutal rifle blast to his shoulder, but a few minutes later he's driving a car with no visible problems; a small child is shown playing video games (so it's early evening), but a few minutes later in the same scene dawn breaks.

About the only entertainment here is the acting of J.T. Walsh and M.C. Gainey, who are caricatures but fun ones. Kurt Russell, on the other hand, acts like he's not particularly happy to have taken this role, and is just going through the motions until he gets his paycheck.

I must say that the purported message, if any, of this film is intriguing. <i>Breakdown</i> seems to be suggesting that decent people from the coasts shouldn't venture into flyover country, since it is the den of rednecks who lie in wait for them. The forces behind this film clearly weren't interested in fairly portraying the Midwest. || Super Thriller.

Breakdown is directed by Jonathan Mostow and Mostow co-writes the screenplay with Sam Montgomery. It stars Kurt Russell, J.T. Walsh, M.C. Gainey, Kathleen Quinlan, Rex Linn, Jack Noseworthy and Ritch Brinkley. Music is by Basil Poledouris and cinematography by Douglas Milsome. 

When his SUV breaks down on a remote Southwestern road, Jeff Taylor (Russell) lets his wife, Amy (Quinlan), hitch a ride with a trucker to get help. When she doesn't return, Jeff fixes his SUV and tracks down the trucker -- who tells the police he's never seen Amy...

Sometimes all you need is a an unflashy thriller that soars because it keeps it simple. Mostow's thriller is a nail biter, preposterous at times for sure, but with Jeff (Russell superb) frantically trying to find what has happened to his wife - out in the desert landscape of America - we get a guy we can totally root for. As the cards get dealt we come to be aware of scumbag predators in his midst, the suspense gets ramped up and we are never quite sure how it's all going to pan out.

This has no ideas above its station, and as the heat gets turned up bit by bit, come the thrilling finale you may find it's time to breath easy again...  8/10 || Simple but really solid suspense-thriller with some good sequences especially the finale with great car stunts.

All in all a excellent movie. || A simple enough concept: Guy must save a World (in the Future!) from Evil! by protecting a Magical Macguffin, only in this case it’s a Girl! instead of a Thing.

There’s really not a lot of story here. Not a lot of character either. Why waste valuable screen time with such paltry concerns when you can instead have Chris Tucker prancing around as a flamboyant radio host in the most annoying cinematic sci-fi supporting character not created by George Lucas? Instead, the film casts actors who do a fair job of acting simply by being themselves: Bruce Wills is Korben Dallas, a brawny, shoot-first hero who, when the chips are down, is brawny and shoot-firsty. The Magical Girlfriend MacGuffin, Leeloo, is played by Mila Jovovich (in her breakout performance) and some strategically-placed wrappings (the wrappings have had a harder time breaking into more mainstream roles). Ian Holm turns up as the Old Mentor, and filling out the cast is Gary Oldman as the antagonist Zord (in his hammiest role ever).

The film seriously rises to the level of made-for-SciFi Channel-original and no higher. The plot is nonsensical, the acting committed but laughable, and the dialogue so stiff you’d think the script pages had been starched.

So where does the film go legitimately wrong? Two main places: first, Besson carries on the proud tradition of French filmmakers doing weird things solely for the sake of being weird. The entire film is filled to the brim with the kind of idiosyncratic touches that I’ve come to expect from that region. Most of the bits don’t work, but I’ll give them credit for keeping things interesting.

The second, more serious issue is another that seems to plague genre French directors, and that’s the whole matter being played (largely) for farce. The most successful (creatively) American (sci-fi/)action films are defined in very large part by their villain. This film, like so many other sci-fi/action films I’ve seen from French directors, never establish or maintain an element of power for the villains over the heroes. The villains are painted as clueless, moronic, out of their depth, or outright incompetent. That tradition continues here. What would Star Wars be without Darth Vader? Die Hard without Hans Gruber? Aliens without…uh, aliens?

Lacking a strong (or even memorable) central villain (we have two: a Gary Oldman so hammy I’m pretty sure Muslims couldn’t work on the film, and the other being a giant planet-size ball of…Pure!Evil! No joke.), the film sacrifices the one shot it had at having some kind of weight or dimension. There’s no sense of danger or peril, no chance that the Hero won’t triumph, and [spoilers!] the day is essentially saved by a Care Bear stare.

So, does what I’ve just said make it bad? Well, yes. Let’s try again. Does that made it unenjoyable? No, and it’s an important distinction to make. The film is an interesting curiosity. After a half-hour of the bizarre, if you can let yourself be swept into its idiosyncratic world you’ll find a perfectly watchable B (or C)-movie. It rankles a bit to think about how much was wasted making dreck this dreck-y, but it’s entertaining dreck. || Ever since I first watched The Fifth Element in the late 90s, I've been inspired by Gary Oldman's Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg.

Grimley Colliery Brass Band has been going for nigh on a century, but as the town's colliery itself comes under threat of closure due to the drawn out miners strikes, so does the bands very own survival. Giving much relief to a very depressed area, the band are hoping to make the grand finals day at the Royal Albert Hall, could the arrival of Flugelhorn player, Gloria, be just what the band needs? Or is she merely the catalyst to something far more critical?

Brassed Off is the first of what I personally call the Magical British Trio, three films that perfectly portray the British sense of humour during dark depressing times of unemployment. The other two of course are The Full Monty (1997) and Billy Elliot (2000), of which Brassed Off is essentially an appetiser of sorts, the warm up act for the big hitters so to speak. Not to say that Brassed Off is not worthy to sit alongside those well received pictures (home and abroad as they say), it most certainly is, it's just that its blend of humour and strife doesn't find any easy ground, thus making it hard for the undiscerning viewer to be at ease at the right moments. It is in short, unsure of what it primarily wants to be. The humour does work well tho, but it's in the dramatic core of the miners strikes, and the affects they have on the denizens of this quaint colliery town, that Brassed Off truly works, with some scenes literally tugging away at the old heart strings. Then there be the music itself, The Grimethorpe Colliery Band {on whose real life story this film is based} provide the music for the soundtrack, and its most enjoyable, often stirring, and definitely poignant at crucial moments.

The cast are tremendous, Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald offer up splendid youthful heart, but they are playing second fiddle (or should that be third brass section?) to Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. As father and son, Postlethwaite and Tompkinson give the film its deep emotional being, each driven by differing needs, Brassed Off's success rests with both men being able to hold the viewers attention from the get go. Tompkinson has made a very profitable and thriving career in British Television, and rightly so, but it remains criminal that he didn't go on and make more well known and profitable full length feature films after his fabulous turn here. Filmed in the ideal Northern English town of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Brassed Off is a film that has evident problems, but to someone like me, a Brit who lived thru those depressing days under Margaret Thatcher's government, it's a film that I love for a myriad of reasons, one can only hope that one of those reasons strikes a chord with yourselves.

A completely biased 9/10 from me! || A touching drama of a declining mining community in Margaret Thatcher's Britain. Pete Postlethwaite is subtle but forceful in his portrayal of ""Danny""; the leader of the Grimley Colliery Band - one of the traditional brass bands that usually accompanied each mine in the North of England, much a there is a choir usually associated with a Welsh one. The story marries the inevitability of the mine closure with the impact on family and relationships throughout this close knit community and uses their band rehearsals as the axis for the plot. Tara Fitzgerald, Ewan McGregor, Philip Jackson and Jim Carter all contribute genuinely to this frequently dryly-humoured ensemble effort and by the end we are all too familiar with Rodrigo's ""Concerto de Orange Juice""."

The Lost World: Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp from the novel written by Michael Crichton. It stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard and Harvey Jason. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kamiński.

Four years on from the horrors of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, it transpires that there is a second dinosaur site on Isla Sornar. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) is forced to head off to face the horrors once again when he learns that his paleontologist girlfriend, Sara Harding (Moore), is already on the island as a forerunner to a team John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is assembling to document the dinosaurs in their habitat. Once there, though, the problems soon arise, especially when a team from InGen arrive with other ideas about the dinosaurs on their minds.

Given the massive success of Jurassic Park in 1993, a sequel was inevitable. What transpires is pretty much more of the same, it's very safe film making by Spielberg. Coming off of the emotional exertions of his last film, Schindler's List, few can deny that the director was entitled to wind down with The Lost World project, there was after all nothing safe about Schindler's, but although Jurassic 2 is a hugely enjoyable family blockbuster, a jazzy bit of hi-tech fun, it lacks the requisite brains to make it an inspiring sequel.

Formula follows the same path, humans in peril on the island, with some added and new dinosaurs (double T-Rex a bonus), and then the ""twist"" in the narrative sees some monster peril come to San Diego, King Kong style, for the finale. There's inter fighting between the good dudes led by Malcolm and the bad guys led by the weasel Peter Ludlow (Howard) who is Hammond's conniving nephew and current head of InGen. Family issues also feature, of course since this is Spielberg after all, while the dangers of tampering with science message remains as strong as ever.

Cast are ably led by a witty Goldblum, who is a reassuring presence carried over from the first film, and the tech-credits are as expected, very high. Some scenes soar, such as a sequence shot from under a pane of glass that starts to crack under the weight of a character, others not so, such as having Malcolm's teenage daughter turn into Nadia Comăneci for one credulity stretching scene. But all told it's an honest blockbuster purely aimed at the target audience who helped to see it make over $600 million in profit. Safe often pays you see, and as sequels go it's one of the better ones in the 90s. It's exciting if intellectually stunted. 7/10 || MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

The Lost World definitely didn't deserve its originally bad reception. Sure, it's far from the incredible 1993's Jurassic Park. Less interesting character arcs and overall (silly) story.

However, it remains fun enough with equally memorable dinosaur sequences. Goldblum rocks.

The fact that I do like Nicolas Cage, even though he is at times really lousy at choosing which movies he participate in, is of course an additional plus.

Naturally I do like the performance of Nicolas Cage in this movie but John Malkowich is also great as the main bad guy and Steve Buscemi is perfect as the nutcase although his role could have been a bit more expanded upon. The rest of the actors are doing nicely as well although it always saddens me to see Colm Meaney playing a dumbass and/or bad guy after his role in Star Trek.

The story is not really bad although it has the usual Hollywood mistakes here and there. The ease by which they pick locks in this high security flight is somewhat laughable and I seriously doubt that they would have been able to haul the plane out of that desert junkyard in flyable condition in real life for instance. Still, it is not a bad story and it works for moving the movie forward.

There are plenty of action and it is mostly quite entertaining. Sometimes it is a bit silly and rather unrealistic of course but, as I wrote, mostly it is quite entertaining. The ending is definitely a bit on the silly side with the plane touching down on the Las Vegas Strip. This bit felt like the producers realized that they had some FX budget left and just had to burn it.

Anyway, on the whole a quite entertaining movie. || Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. I have the only gun on board. Welcome to Con Air.

Hummingbird Humdinger.

Con Air is directed by Simon West and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and John Malkovich. Plot sees Cameron Poe (Cage), a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter after serving years in prison for manslaughter. He's travelling on a plane full of the most dangerous criminals currently being held in America, they are being transferred to some new super prison. Inevitably something goes wrong and the cons take over the plane, with only Poe standing between them and freedom.

No doubt about it, Con Air is one of the most over the top action film's you are ever likely to see. But it knows it is, it embraces it - and positively revels in it. What we have is a bunch of sicko's and psycho's on a plane, their roll call of crimes as gargantuan as the excess of explosions and quips are. Down on the ground are a frantic John Cussack and an angry Colm Meaney, the play off between the two almost as funny as the shenanigans on the plane - where characters called Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), Cyrus The Virus (Malkovich) & The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) push mania to a new level.

Enter director West, who clearly under orders from Bruckheimer, unleashes a barrage of explosive set pieces, each one more outrageous than the last. It's neatly edited and paced like a good action movie should be. There's also no small amount of tension to sidle along side the white knuckle thrills. As Cage strips down to his Bruce Willis vest we have a real likable hero to get on side with, yes it's played tongue in cheek, very much so, but his character has been so well written by Scott Rosenberg we really forgive the ridiculousness of each heroic act. Also along the for the ride are Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, M.C. Gainey & Rachael Ticotin, the latter of which does admirably well as the lone female surrounded by 800 tonnes of testosterone.

Junky nonsense as a story for sure, but just like the cast are having a blast of a time with it, so too should the discerning action comedy fan. 7.5/10 || Great movie. One of my favorites growing up. Action packed with a great storyline. Great cast too."

These perfectly crafted characters - and some accompanying and wonderfully enigmatic stories, all emanated from the works of a lady-in-waiting at the 10th century Heian court in Japan. Subsequently, as an adult she is fascinated by this form of art, and with painting the bodies of those who share her rather lively sex life. ""Jerome"" (Ewan McGregor) has slovenly hand-writing that drives her mad, but soon they are enthralled with each other and he becomes one of the the more willing partners joining in with her games of sex and scribe-work. There's no doubt that some of the body work she creates would be the envy of many a modern day tattooist. Now there's got to be a twist - and soon she discovers that ""Jerome"" likes his oysters and his snails - and that he is having a dalliance with a publisher who made life difficult for her father. She sees an opportunity to not just get even, but to get her own book out there too. The presentation, like the book, is delivered in chapters. That's not always the easiest to follow, nor are they in anyway chronological - the narrative has a rather rambling mind of it's own sometimes and that does undermine the literary value of this leaving us with a story that does jar occasionally. Essentially, in the end it's a gorgeously photographed aesthetic that works well sometimes, not so well others. It's not a great story, but it's a creative and visionary look at the beauty of the male body - and personality - as seen through a woman with love, lust and revenge in her eyes.

Joel Schumacher delivers us the final nail in the lid of Batman's coffin with none other than George Clooney in the guise of the Caped Crusader, probably the worst on screen Batman we'll ever see. Clooney was actually a pretty inspired choice if you're thinking solely about the billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne, but ask any Batfan and they'll tell you: the character's true identity is Batman, Bruce Wayne is just a mask he wears.

Finally, this isn't a real complaint but something that I'm going to address anyway: The Batman movie with Batman and Robin is called _Batman Forever_, but the one with Batman, Robin and Batgirl is called just _Batman & Robin_? Go figure.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **_Easily the best of the four_**

Staunch fundamentalist fanboys have declared 1997's ""Batman & Robin"" to be a blasphemous blemish in the superhero's chronicling, but it's easily the most entertaining of the four Batman films that came out between 1989-97.

Let's face it, all four of these flicks have the same cartoony tone. They were a couple rungs above the 60's TV series in campiness, but with better costumes and a super budget. And ""Batman & Robin"" was the most entertaining of the four. I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of the goofy/surreal style of these movies; I prefer Christopher's Nolan's raw realistic approach in the Dark Knight trilogy (""realistic"" to a point, that is). It's just that ""Batman & Robin"" is the most entertaining of the earlier series. Which is why I never got the whole ""Tim Burton's Batman is a masterpiece"" mindset. Really? Not to me. It LOOKED great, but the story was tedious.

Again, all four of these films have the same general cartoony tone and there's simply no validity to the position that Burton's ""Batman"" or ""Batman Returns"" are more serious/realistic in approach compared to Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin."" I've seen 'em all back-to-back and they each have the same colorful we're-not-taking-this-too-serious style. 

For anyone to enjoy these films you have to be willing to accept the comic booky world the filmmaker's have created. If you're willing to do that, these can be fun, half-serious Batman movies. You can't watch them expecting the tone of ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" or you'll be severely let down. 

With this understanding, ""Batman & Robin"" is my favorite of the four. Here's why:

- It has the best Batman/Bruce Wayne in George Clooney. Although Val Kilmer has the better Bruce Wayne demeanor (i.e. grimmer), Clooney just LOOKS like Wayne. In addition, he's charismatic and entertaining in the role from beginning to end.

- It has the best sense of family between the inhabitants of Wayne Manor. The warmth and camaraderie of Bruce, Dick/Robin (Chris O'Donnell), Alfred and Barbara/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) is a pleasure to behold. 

- It has Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl. Nuff said.

- It has Uma Thurman shining in the role of Poison Ivy. I usually don't find tall, thin women appealing (I'm more attracted to females akin to Silverstone), but I have to admit that Uma completely owns the over-the-top role of Poison Ivy and is thoroughly alluring.

- Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as Mr. Freeze. Yes, every time he merely opens his mouth you know it's Schwarzenegger, but he's amusing and he has a great look and costume.

- The film has heart. Although Poison Ivy is truly ee-vil and gets her comeuppance, you can't help but sympathize with Freeze's love for his wife and desire to resurrect her. Batman is able to see under his icy veneer and see a warm heart that's willing to accept redemption and make restitution. Furthermore, as noted above, you really feel the love of Bruce and Alfred and the others at Wayne Manor.

- Lastly, the film is full of vibrant colors and goofy over-the-top thrills. It's just a fun movie, if you're in the mood for a half-serious/half-campfest superhero flick.

I also like that Smashing Pumpkins song that plays over the end credits.

The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes. 

GRADE: B+ || This is the worse batman movie out of all of them. Besides Clooney, the acting was horrendous. No wonder why Clooney regrets being in this movie it sucked."

<em>'Hercules'</em> doesn't stick a connection, I felt very unfulfilled throughout. I have little negatives, yet there isn't much the other way either. I like the cast, but that's honestly about it.

James Woods, Danny DeVito and Rip Torn all give noteworthy performances in the roles of Hades, Phil and Zeus. However, Tate Donovan as the titular character is forgettable, as is Roger Bart's voice when Hercules sings.

Bart isn't helped by the very average music, none of which is memorable to me. The plot is mild, one that is quite easy to predict and doesn't produce any thrilling moments. The animation is actually OK, satisfactory for sure.

I can see this is very well rated by others, which I respect. For me, though, it isn't any good. || Undoubtedly one of the better 1990s Disney films. The story and animation are very much centre stage with the music much less important - no big power ballads! It is a fun take on the Herculean mythology of ancient Greece. Beginning with a suitably grand opening narrative from Charlton Heston, no less, we learn that Hades is desperate to avenge himself on Zeus - who tricked him into ruling the underworld after he and his brothers defeated the Titans. Meantime Zeus is celebrating the birth of a baby boy. Hades decides to strike back, but his augurs (the ""Fates"" but think more ""Stygian witches"") advise that this little boy - Hercules - is the fly in the ointment who must be neutralised if his grand design is to succeed. Hades tricks him firstly into mortality and then cons him out of his great strength - but will that be enough to defeat the determination of our hero? It is a bit of a slow starter; but once it gets into the swing there are some good performances from James Woods (superb as Hades), Rip Torn (Zeus) and Danny DeVito as the long-suffering demi-god trainer ""Phil"" that keep this fantasy adventure moving along nicely. Don't expect to see any of his twelve labours..."

I'm not a fan of romantic comedies, but I recognize their value and quality. There are a number of very good romantic comedies, in fact, but I'm sorry to say this isn't one of the brightest.

Watching the movie, I felt that a lot of its success or failure depends on how much each viewer likes the main character... and I didn't really feel like I sympathize with her. This character's personality is non-existent... to the point of only discovering that she is in love with her best friend when she is on the verge of seeing him in the arms of another girl. Is it really that difficult to know your own feelings and understand when you love someone?

The script, by the way, is basically based on this premise, and the subsequent struggle to prevent him from actually getting married. It should be mentioned that the two characters had an agreement to marry if they reached the age of 28, which brings us back to that worn out “old spinster” cliché. And of course, there is a homosexual in the middle of this story: a very blatant and stereotypical gay, which should sound offensive to any legitimate homosexual (I believe).

Julia Roberts has shown us her talent many times, and there are several films of hers that I could recommend if asked. However, the actress doesn't do a good job here. I don't know how far this could have been a consequence of poor direction and a pathetic conception of her character, but the actress didn't do well, even though she tries to be nice. For anyone who wants to see her in great shape in a good romantic comedy, there are better movies available. On the other hand, Cameron Diaz reasonably gets rid of what he has in his hands, but he is not in a film that allows him to shine more. Rupert Everett is disappointing and one-dimensional, and Dermot Mulroney doesn't do more than the bare minimum. || I don't know why I like this movie. I think it's just because of how crazy funny Julia Roberts starts acting when she finds out her best friend is getting married. Kind of reminds me of some of my crazy ex's."

The frequently naked Bardot, the glorious scenery and quite an interesting look behind the scenes at the now collapsed CineCittà studios that well illustrated the former greatness of this industry as effectively as the Coliseum does for the now faded greatness of Rome. The story - well that's quite another matter. I found it to be contrived and bitty. Their arguments come from nowhere and make little sense. Like petulant teenage spats. Perhaps ""Paul"" is playing a game to leverage his wife for a greater payment? Perhaps he just doesn't understand what makes her tick? She certainly appears to have little idea what makes him, and I found there to be very little on screen chemistry between them - even when the scenes were a bit more intimate. What's also a bit unhelpful is the Georges Delerue score. It's lovely and rich, of course, but Godard turns it on and off like a tap. It's like a musical interlude between the increasingly frustrating scenes that repeats the refrains then stops for the dialogue. Almost like an orchestrated jingle! Fritz Lang steals his scenes - basically because he comes across easily as the most natural of these characters, and Palance is - as usual - as wooden as a plank.

There's a tendency to undervalue the action movie. Certainly there's a wide expanse of land in cinema world where film fans reside, where the thought of praising an action film for being ""classic"" cinema is considered treason against the very word. Yet some of the artistry involved in the genre's leading lights is purely sublime, regardless of how bizarre and unlikely the plot is. Enter John Woo's berserker, ear splitting, high octane actioner, Face/Off. Rightly sitting along side the likes of Die Hard and Predator as genre pieces that showcase how good things can be when it all comes together, Woo's movie is as much fun as you could wish to have for over two hours of explosive, fantastical, unadulterated cinema.

The plot sees John Travolta's serious family man cop, Sean Archer, devote his life to catching unbalanced maniacal bad guy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). There's some bad history between the two and when Archer manages to capture both Troy and his equally vile brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), it would seem to be closure for Archer and his family. However, it's found that the Troy's have left a ticking bomb somewhere in Los Angeles, and if undetected it will flatten L.A. and kill practically everyone. So, Archer undergoes a revolutionary face-swapping procedure with the now comatose Castor and sets about getting the information from the incarcerated Pollux. But wait!, Castor wakes up and turns the tables by assuming Archer's identity, setting the wheels in motion for each man to live the others life until the Face/Off between the pair will decide their respective fate.

Unbelievable? Of course. Who cares? Well nobody should really, because surely going into a film like this one is expecting the ludicrous. Both Cage and Travolta are superbly realising the spectacular nature of the script, and being mesmerising in the duality of the roles into the bargain. Make no bones about it, Woo and his team have crafted a benchmark action movie. There's a trail of thought that suggests that Woo basically keeps making the same movie, that's a fair enough point, sure enough, all of his staple action sequences and traits are evident in Face/Off. Yet Woo has delved into his characters, given them some flesh on their action bones, and then upped the anti in action set pieces to cloak them in chaotic beauty. From the opening Jet escape/pursuit set up, to the outrageous speed boat finale, the film is one long exhilarating breath taker. Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain & Nick Cassavetes all file into the background playing important characters who are rightly secondary to the protagonists, while a ream of extras come and go as each are dispatched in a hail of Woo inspired carnage. The pace never sags and the eyes and ears are treated to a vibrancy that is often sadly missing from many other big budgeted action blockbusters.

This is a masterpiece of action cinema, so even as a Orson Welles crane shot is a magnificent thing, so it be with the sight of two stunt men flailing thru the air in a spray of exploding water. Oh yes sir, this is a classic alright. 10/10 || A quality all-out action film!

<em>'Face/Off'</em> isn't one that'll stick out in my memory as something deep meaning, incredibly written or anything of the sort. However, as an action film it's superb. There's barely a chance to rethink what you've just seen due to the prevalent and manic nature of onscreen events. You also have fascinating performances from the two leads.

Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are awesome in this. I won't spoil the plot, but all I will say is that those two bring it to life brilliantly - it felt, at least to me, very believable; which is impressive. Across the opening portion I thought it was going to be Cage stealing the show, but as things progress Travolta really comes up big to match Cage.

Away from NC and JT, there isn't really anything to scream about cast-wise; although, I gotta give shoutouts to Mike Delfino and Gavin Harris; if you know, you know.

Nothing much more to note, to be honest. The terrific action means I'd highly recommend this. || Never seen a concept for movie this way. They literally trade faces. Good versus evil and not only do they trade faces but there characters and personalities have to change as well. 2 of the best that could ever do it.

""Men in Black"" (1997) is wildly amusing in the first half, but loses its energy a bit in the last act. Nevertheless, it fills the bill for when you’re in the mood for fun & thrilling popcorn entertainment. It inspired three sequels as of this date: “Men in Black II” (2002), “Men in Black 3” (2012) and “Men in Black: International” (2019) with the last one being the only movie in the series without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in New York City & surrounding area (e.g. Jersey City), as well as Semi Valley, CA (the saucer crash sequence) and nearby Los Angeles/Culver City.

GRADE: B- || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

This was a better movie historically than actually.  It at least felt like it introduced some concepts of having aliens infiltrated Terra into the industry, even if it didn't actually.  Maybe it popularized it more, but it was very good at walking the audience across that line that separates our normal Terran view to that of an integrated society.  Or maybe I just love the concept of aliens on our planet that much.

I definitely don't think it was the manner they took: the humor is as annoying as it is funny most of the time, and Tommy Lee Jones is just as funny as Will Smith (that's saying something, personally) as the straight man, credit to both of them.  That said, they were a perfect for the movie, and all the supporting cast did wonderfully.

Vincent D'Onofrio, as ""Not Edgar"", was probably the funniest character in the movie to me, and I don't think he was supposed to be.

The ""haze the rookie by leaving out vital information"" bit is cliche and worn out, but that's have the jokes here.  I definitely like the movie, and I love what it could have been."

It's intelligent, well-acted and directed, and the special effects it has HELPS the story rather than IMPEDES it. Though she hasn't done much lately, either in the director's chair or acting, Jodie Foster is one of my favourite contemporary American actresses, and it's intriguing how her great talent's been utilized of late (ie., 'Elysium', and I'm still very mad at Spike Lee for having Christopher Plummer call her a 'cunt' in 'Inside Man').

Personally, I must admit that I myself have worried what other worlds' inhabitants would think of our civilization from the messages it might get from Earth. Though I thankfully haven't lost any sleep over it (I have 'Thumper' in the apartment above me to thank for that), as Led Zeppelin would say in the classic 'Stairway to Heaven', '...and it makes me wonder'.

As what happens in most of these movies, it's rather anticlimactic once the different cultures meet. I'll say to my dying day that the most difficult thing to do in cinema is end a film. Here (unlike perfect sci-fi masterpieces, like '2001: A Space odyssey' or the more recent 'Children of Men') the decent but otherwise unspectacular ending makes me avoid a perfect rating here. But it's awfully close, worth both owning and rewatching, and provides fairly early evidence (which would come to bold fruition in 'Killer Joe') that Matthew McConaughey could actually act. It's also a tossup between this, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and 'Back to the Future' for my favourite Zemeckis moment. || Random viewing but decided to finally watch after its been in my to-do bin for a while now. It didn't strike an emotional cord that I thought it would but Jodie Foster was quite good as were a respectable supporting cast. Never quite bought into the relationship between Foster and McConaughey though in fairness, probably due to the lack of screen time together (felt like maybe 15 minutes in a 2.5 hour movie). Some of the effects were alright for its time including integrating Clinton footage with the cast and the sci-fi specific visuals were alright. In the end, never was bored and found it to be entertaining. **4.0/5** || Early on in Contact a character is introduced who goes by the name “Kent Clark,” and for the remainder of the film I simply could not get over the fact that no one ever even mentions that he is named after Bizarro’s alter ego.

My theory is that this is a figurative wink to the audience, letting us know beforehand what we otherwise discover at long last: that the events that are about to unfold are nothing but an elaborate prank on the audience and, possibly, the cast.

This movie exists in a limbo somewhere in between Close Encounters of the Third Kind’s unabashed childlike wonder and Ad Astra’s adult ‘we’re alone in the Universe’ pragmatism – which is a polite way of saying that Contact is neither fish nor fowl; the moral of the story, in a nutshell, is that there might be intelligent extraterrestrial life, but then again, there might not be.

Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with some ambiguity, but let’s consider this: untold amounts of money, physical resources and manpower are spent in the movie (but not by the movie, which prefers to cut corners and follow the unconvincing route of CGI – technology which, by the way, has not aged well nor improved a lot ever since), while we spent two and half hours of our precious time, and it’s all only to learn that, maybe, aliens don’t exist except in overly complicated hoaxes and the minds of impressionable people. That’s a lot of work to do as well as a long way to go to arrive at a conclusion that for many, myself included, is of the foregone variety.

And even if the extraterrestrials in the film were real, they’d still be rather disappointing – though I shouldn’t speak in plural, since we only see one in the form of Dr. Ellie Arroway’s (Jodie Foster) long deceased father. The good news is that Ellie’s dad is played by David Morse, and you could certainly do a lot worse than that (and that goes for the rest of the ensemble cast); the bad news is that Ellie’s close encounter takes places on a beach that is supposedly meant to mimic a drawing she made when she was nine years old.

This is bad because the drawing, which looks like an actual preteen might have drawn it, is a veritable Monet compared with the computer-generated beach where Ellie has a very anticlimactic meeting with the alien, who tells her nothing she, or for that matter we, didn’t already know or believe – which in turn doesn’t mean that the place itself has to be equally underwhelming; why not a real beach? Or, perhaps even better, a set made to resemble a real beach? This would doubtless speak to either Ellie’s imagination or the aliens’ handicraft much more than what we end up getting."

At the end of the movie, I just dont know what to make of it.

It is bizarre, but beautifully shot (the cinematography is perfect);

Slow paced, but enticing (the direction is outstanding);

Off-putting and downright creepy at times (Im looking at you first seduction scene), but you feel for both women;

And Otto is perfect (adding small quirks and mannerisms to every second her character is on screen that another actor would not have put in).

It's so unique a cinematic experience, knowing what we know of Schwarzenegger's life and career the 34 years since, seeing him at this juncture, as he's just starting out. (No, I haven't seen 'Stay Hungry' yet.)

Part of me always wishes he had simply stuck to these films (as well as the 'Terminator' series), and was still making them. In his prime, I dare you to find anyone better at this kind of material. Director Milius has a fine feel for the swords-and-sandals/fantasy worldscape this material requires. An excellent and underrated supporting cast is here at well to help Arnie out, too. || ***""Sit here... SIT HERE""***

I was hugely disappointed by ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982) when I first viewed it because it deviated too far from the blueprint established by creator Robert E. Howard. Yeah, they got many things right, but the things they got wrong ruined the film for me. Yet I’ve warmed up to it over time because one can’t deny the film’s merits. If you’re a fan of the books and the faithful comics, it’s important to realize going in that this is an ALTERNATIVE Conan, similar to Howard's, but far from a strict interpretation. 

The flaws mostly have to do with John Milius and Oliver Stone's deviation from Howard. Consider the opening sequence of Conan as a little boy on his father’s knee getting advice about the trustworthiness of the sword: Sorry, but the lad looks like an average soft suburbanite boy, not a tough kid that grew up in the wilds of Cimmeria, land of darkness and deep night. 

Secondly, the ""wheel of pain"" sequence is just dumb. I have a bit more respect for this part now that I realize it's a metaphor for the cyclical drudgery of grade school but, c'mon, the REAL Conan wouldn't spend that many years in captivity! He would have escaped long before, not to mention slay his captors. I suppose it helps when consider that Stone & Milius were taking bits from Howard’s other creations, like Kull, who was a slave for a few years.    

Thirdly, when they first meet Valeria while robbing the temple of Set the flick cops a decidedly campy tone. Although Sandahl Bergman is great throughout the rest of the picture that initial meeting is pretty cringe-inducing. It was at this point that I really tuned out when I first viewed the film. Fourthly, one of the worst parts is when Conan grovels at Thulsa Doom's feet crying, ""You killed my father; you killed my mother!"" This in no way resembles Howard's Conan. But, in its defense, it does make Conan more human and therefore more relate-able to the viewer. 

Thankfully, the film has several strengths, starting with the magnificent and awe-inspiring score by Basil Poledouris. The movie's worth viewing just to hear this score. Secondly, despite acceptable discrepancies (e.g. Conan has black hair not brown), the casting is quite good; although Schwarzenegger doesn’t really reflect the air of REH’s character (Jason Momoa is far better). Thirdly, Milius & Stone show their brilliance by incorporating Genghis Khan's historical quote in Conan's response to ""What is best in life?"" Conan answers: ""To crush enemies, see dem driven before you and to hear da lamentation of der women."" 

Fourthly, the locations, sets and costuming are superb. They certainly got the LOOK of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age right. Fifthly, As long as one is prepared to accept the deviation from Howard's Conan, the story keeps your interest throughout (which is my way of determining the worthiness of ANY flick). Sixthly, Sandahl Bergman is super sharp and sexy; she possesses a certain barbaric beauty essential to the role and it's hard not to gaze at her shapely form in awe when she's on screen. 

Lastly, the overall tone of the film is quite serious and brooding. Despite Valeria's initial campy sequence mentioned earlier and a couple of amusing scenes with Mako, the film eludes the rut of camp (unfortunately the 1984 sequel cannot boast of this quality). 

SPECIAL MOMENTS AND INTERESTING ITEMS:

•The love scene between Conan & Valeria and, later, the death/funeral pyre scenes are reverent, beautiful and moving. The accompanying piece by Poledouris is emotionally potent.

•Conan's spiritual evolution in regards to sexuality and love is interesting: His first exposure is as a slave when beautiful women are occasionally thrown to him for the amusement of those watching. After he acquires his freedom his first (and presumably only) experience with casual sex goes horribly wrong. Later in Zamora he dismisses the solicitations of prostitutes with a wave and a derogatory word. Finally he meets Valeria and discovers true love and commitment, conveyed well in the love/death/funeral scenes noted above.

•Both the battles inside the mountain fortress and, later, the showdown at the mounds are thrilling with the accompanying score getting your blood pumping.

•Right before the battle at the mounds Conan and Subotai brace themselves as the 'riders of doom' trot forth. You can see the bold determination on their faces: They have no other recourse; they will stand and fight as men, come what may. (All men will eventually have to stand and fight in this manner one way or another, and we wuss out at our own peril).

•After their unlikely victory Conan raises his arms (and weapons) in salute to the altar where Valeria was cremated. It gives you goosebumps. 

Both ""The Complete Quest"" and ""Collector's Edition"" contain an excellent 55-minute ""Making Of"" documentary wherein all of the principle actors and creators are interviewed, as well as an excellent commentary by Milius and Schwarzenegger. 

FINAL ANALYSIS: Like I said, I've finally come to see the magnificence of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but I had to get over my hang ups concerning the deviations from Howard's Conan to see it. As an ALTERNATIVE Conan it's a nigh masterpiece of cinematic art. 

One last thing: Um, don't use that first line of dialogue (""Sit here... SIT HERE"") on your wife or girlfriend; I tried it and she didn't take too kindly to it!

The film runs 2 hours, 9 minutes, and was shot in Spain.

A female Senator succeeds in enrolling a woman into Combined Reconnaissance Team training (Navy Seals) where everyone expects her to fail.

Having made a telling feminist mark with his excellent Thelma and Louise in 1991, Ridley Scott picks up the lady baton once again only to drop it half way through. This is a film of confused messages, what starts out as a worthwhile story involving a woman trying to overcome extreme prejudices in one of America's elite fighting forces, ends up as a gung-ho hoorah movie with Jane having ""manned"" up.

Things aren't helped by the sheer ridiculousness of the treatment meted out to Jane by her superior in training, Master Chief John James Urgayle (Mortensen suitably vile), so much so you would like to think if that sort of stuff goes on then arrests should be made. Daftness also comes by way of the superior officers prancing around training camp in the world's tightest shorts, one would think they must be on their way to ""The Blue Oyster Bar""...

Things are further compounded by the fact that as committed as Moore is in the title role, and she is and gives it her all, one can't buy into the characterisation because you simply are watching Demi Moore the actress. Shaved head and beefed up she may be, but this is still one of the highest paid actresses of her era, the characterisation thin on the ground with no depth. The political machinations at work barely get time to breath in fact the key mid-point tonal political shift is given short shrift.

Stylisation as one would expect from Scott, is super, as is his control of top draw action sequences. But the cock-eyed view of a woman in a man's world is hard to swallow, and although it mostly entertains, it's ultimately a shallow exercise. 5/10"

“George of the Jungle” (1997) is an over-the-top spoof of Tarzan inspired by the 60’s cartoon which I’ve never seen. You have to be able to appreciate fun, goofy humor to enjoy this quirky family comedy/adventure. It helps that Fraser is both likable and amusing in the eponymous role (I should add that he really inspires guys to improve their fitness). Meanwhile Mann is as sweet & beautiful as Bernadette Peters in her prime. Everything clicks for great entertainment; I laughed through practically the whole flick.

On its maiden voyage, however, it vanished. Seven years later, it has returned, orbiting Neptune, and a rescue crew is sent out to investigate, along with the scientist responsible for the ship’s creation. The rescue crew of the Lewis and Clark are a group of no-nonsense blue-collar workers, led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), with Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) along for his expertise. When they arrive at the Event Horizon, they find the crew long dead. “This ship is a tomb,” judges Captain Miller at one point. The rescue team begins to realize that the ship passed through a black hole created by the gravity drive, but didn’t return alone. The ship with a long-dead crew shows life signs. The rescue team begins to have terrifying visions. The gravity drive begins to spin of its own accord...

Something is loose on the ship, and the rescue team has to not only unravel out what happened to the original crew, but also protect themselves from the horrors that returned with the ship. It’s a simple but sturdy setup, standard B-movie stuff. What elevates Event Horizon is its first-class production design and solid atmosphere. Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Alien vs. Predator) is not a name one would generally associate with good film product these days, but here he managed (in spite of himself, one may think given the rest of his output) to present a film steeped in suspense, with strong performances, gorgeous set pieces, and palpable horror.

Let’s be honest: there’s nothing new here. The strength of this film lies in how it fits together the pieces it stole from other films. This is very much (and very completely) The Shining by way of Alien, even to the point of lifting the character archetypes directly from Ridley Scott’s 1979 masterpiece. The Event Horizon is the Overlook Hotel, teeming with supernatural power and malice. The film delves into gore in its last third, but it’s not quite proficient enough to have it enhance the scares (which were doing just fine before the blood started flowing so freely). However, the film is even structured like Alien and The Shining, all slow burn and building dread until things begin to go to hell (literally, perhaps). The cast have stock characters but they bring them to life admirably, particularly Neill and Fishburne; among the secondary characters, Kathleen Quinlan, Jack Noseworthy, and Sean Pertwee are particularly memorable. The script by Philip Eisner is derivative but effective, and Anderson was clearly at the peak of his directorial prowess here. Don't misunderstand me to say that the film's lifts from other works make it bad; it's certainly not. Originality is overrated as an attribute, and fairly value-neutral even on the best of days. I'd much rather have a tale well-told than one that does weird things simply for the sake of doing weird things (French sci-fi/fantasy directors, I'm looking at you. Yes, you, Jeunet), though the greatest films find a way to combine both sturdy storytelling and originality in the medium. In total, Event Horizon is a very effective sci-fi horror film, breaking no new ground but doing what it does very well. A minor classic of the sci-fi horror genre. || You know nothing. Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse. 

Event Horizon is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and written by Philip Eisner. It stars Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, Jason Isaacs and Jack Noseworthy. Music is by Michael Kamen and orbital and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle.  

2047 and a group of astronauts are sent to investigate the 'Event Horizon' which disappeared mysteriously 7 years ago. It has returned minus its crew and now the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' become exposed to horrifying secrets of the ghost ship...

It is what it is, a haunted house chiller set on a space ship. It's derivative within the genre but it does the genre staples with no little amount of quality. The tone is set from the opening credits being accompanied by a ferociously foreboding musical score, and from there the pic delivers a ""who is going to get killed and in what order"" process - and why? Just what is the mystery at the core of it all?.

A great cast has been assembled, which lifts it above its ""B"" movie roots, so with some thoughtful ideas within the narrative, it's easy to buy into the characterisations. Naturally the blood will flow, devilishly so, but the makers here put a different slant on the sci-fi/horror assailant thread. Of course it gets a bit by the numbers come the final quarter, arguably a bit hokey in fact, but it's very effective and perfect for a lights off viewing experience.

Smart production design helps keeps up the chilly feel to proceedings, whilst the bleak tonal flows that director Anderson goes for really draws the engaged observer in. It's neither ground breaking or a top line film of its type, but holding up on repeat viewings it proves to be a sturdy and unsettling space based chiller. 7/10 || A fantastic ""horror in space"" thriller led by an excellent assemble cast (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neil, Kathy Quinlann). Do we really want to know what can be found at the edge (event horizon) of a black hole?"

This is ""the movie with bugs that look like people"", there aren't a lot of unique ideas out there, so I like celebrating the ones I can point too.

While the cast and acting was really good, what makes this is the concept, the atmospheric tension and the practical efforts for the monsters.

This is about as close as you can get to being thrown into a termite hive without Rick Moranis or Hank Pym shrinking fools down.

Sometimes it is fun to see a pre-apocalyptic story instead of one where the world is already ruined by calamity. || This is quite an entertaining little sci-fi thriller about a worm that turned! ""Tyler"" (Mira Sorvino) is a distinguished scientist who created a bug that could kill cockroaches that were carriers for a deadly disease. Thing is, though, these super-bugs have started to get a bit out of control, and it isn't long before they decide that it's time to turn the tables on their creators - despite some supposedly limiting genetic engineering developed to inhibit precisely that! People are quite literally dropping like flies, so she and ""Peter"" (Jeremy Northam) have to come up with a solution before mankind gets gobbled up in a particularly gruesome manner. Sure, the acting and the dialogue are all pretty routine, but the visual effects have something of ""The Fly"" (1986) to them, as does the story and there is less frenetic panic in this that we see in many other films of this genre. Dare I say, there is even the merest hint of actual science. It is clearly sending us a message that however we may try to plan ahead for any eventuality, when survival of a species is at stake nature finds a way to get round even the most watertight of safety features. The ending smacks very much of sequel, but I doubt that will be able to develop the story much beyond the perfectly adequate conclusion offered here.

RELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Marco Brambilla, ""Excess Baggage"" stars Alicia Silverstone as an eccentric 18 year-old in the Seattle area who fakes her own kidnapping to get her unloving father’s attention. She develops a relationship with an odd car thief (Benicio Del Toro) while her father enlists the even stranger “Uncle Ray” (Christopher Walken) to find her.

Alicia was 19 during shooting and a rising young superstar after a string of popular roles: A pubescent tease in “The Crush” (1993), a popular Beverly Hills adolescent in “Clueless” (1995), a wannabe Nancy Drew in “True Crime” (1995) and a hot superheroine in “Batman & Robin” (1997). “Excess Baggage” was Silverstone’s first movie after a pricey production deal with Columbia and it was strongly rumored that she clashed with director Brambilla. Originally slated for release in the Fall of 1996, it was pushed back to late the next Summer.

The movie starts confident & strong and could be likened to contemporaneous quirky flicks like “Buffalo ‘66” (1998). It regrettably fizzles out in the second half but, nevertheless, Alicia was in her physical prime with alluring curves. Unfortunately, she’s stuck with one basic outfit the entire film (form-fitting black pants). Much more could’ve and should’ve been done with her. On the other side of the gender spectrum, Del Toro is notable as the mumbling eccentric while Walken is intriguing and entertaining as a former CIA assassin who basically raised Emily (Silverstone) and is concerned about his employer’s aloofness.

THE FILM RUNS 101 minutes and was shot in British Columbia (Vancouver, Victoria & Britannia Beach) and Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. WRITERS: Max D. Adams plus Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais.

17832.0,Kull the Conqueror,"A barbarian named Kull becomes ruler after defeating the old king in battle. In an effort to regain the throne, the former king's heirs resurrect Akivasha, a witch queen. However, Akivasha has plans of her own for the throne, and only Kull stands in the way.",Courage conquers all.,"Adventure, Fantasy, Action",95,1997-08-29,en,5.128,145,0.9348,"Kevin Sorbo, Tia Carrere, Karina Lombard, Thomas Ian Griffith, Litefoot",John Nicolella,"martial arts, showdown, based on novel or book, sword, planetary alignment, traitor, sword fight, fate, barbarian, witchcraft, warrior, sword and sorcery","***“By this Axe I Rule!”***

An Atlantean barbarian (Kevin Sorbo) takes the throne of Valusia when he defeats King Borna (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and so General Taligaro (Thomas Ian Griffith) & assorted “noble-blooded” men conspire to overthrow Kull by resurrecting the wicked Acheron sorceress Akivasha (Tia Carrere). Karina Lombard plays Kull’s love interest, Zareta, while Litefoot is on hand as the priest Ascalante.

Released in 1997, thirteen years after the last Conan movie, “Kull the Conqueror” was intended to be the third Conan film, but Schwarzenegger declined so they morphed it into a Kull movie. For those not in the know, Kull was author Robert E. Howard’s other barbarian hero, who wasn’t as popular as Conan. Kull, incidentally, existed thousands of years before Conan’s Hyborian Age. The switch didn’t really matter because the script was loosely based on Howard’s Conan story ""The Phoenix on the Sword,"" which was a rewrite of the Kull yarn “By this Axe I Rule.”

Sorbo was in his prime here and definitely looks like Kull from the comics, except he has his characteristic geniality whereas Kull was more grim and brooding in Howard’s tales. Nevertheless, Sorbo is well cast and one of the film’s highlights.

The score by Joel Goldsmith is quite good, except for a couple of semi-cheesy metal riffs, like the eye-rolling riff near the beginning and another one much later during the fight at the ice cave, which isn’t as bad. At least half of the score lacks any metal guitar whatsoever and most of the pieces that do include it are very good; there’s just a couple of dubious riffs, which turned me off the first time I watched the movie. These wannabe metal rhythms were rather lame in 1997, let alone today.

Another flaw is that the opening of the movie is weak with Kull’s dealings with the Dragon Legion and his fiery sword fight with Taligaro. If you’re patient, however, the story takes a compelling turn with the palace confrontation. The production is acceptable, but noticeably inferior to “Conan the Destroyer” (1984). I’d say it’s on par with “The Sword and the Sorcerer” (1982), but with a superior story and more interesting characters (once you get past the lousy opening). I should add that Tia looks great as a green-eyed redhead and the fiery demon F/X at the close are quite effective.

IF you can handle its obvious shortcomings, “Kull the Conqueror” is an entertaining S&S flick that should be enjoyed by fans of Conan, Sinbad and the like. If you watched it before and didn’t like it, give it a second chance. I’m glad I did. It’s flawed, but there’s too much to appreciate to give it a negative rating.  

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in Slovakia (Bratislava & Cerveny Kamen) and Croatia (Kornati National Park & Murter Island).

GRADE: B-/C+ || When the ageing but warlike king of “Valusia” decides to do away with many of those who could be heirs to his kingdom, it takes all the strength of the brave “Kull” (Kevin Sorbo) to stop him. In return, the now ailing “Borna” decides to name him his successor! This goes down like a lead balloon with the now circumvented “Prince Ducalon” (Dougie Henshall) and the general “Talibaro” (Thomas Ian Griffith) who promptly plot to be rid of the man they see as a usurper. To that end, they decide on the distinctly dangerous practise of resurrecting the long dead and profoundly evil “Queen Akivasha” (Tia Carrere) who just happens to make Medusa look like Julie Andrews. Of course, once she has air back in her lungs, she imposes her own agenda and soon it falls to “Kull” to try to thwart her attempts to rebuild her long lost empire and… yep, you’ve guessed… rule the world! Some creative effort has gone into the visual effects, and there are plenty of set-piece combat scenes, but the rest of this just reminds you of a dodgy and poorly lit television movie filmed almost entirely on a sound stage and completely devoid of any jeopardy or peril. Sorbo has some charism as “Hercules” (1995) but here, there’s simply no room for that as the story evolves, peplum-style, for ninety minutes that had me looking to watch “Krull” instead. My money was on “Akivasha”."

He is ""Garfield"" - a teacher who survived a vicious knife attack at his previous school in New York, but who is still determined to persevere and so moves to another in Los Angeles. The teenage kids there are a pretty disparate bunch, not really interested in education and certainly not interested in authority. Except, maybe, ""Rita"" (Karina Arroyave) who wants to succeed despite the pressures from her peers. From the outset, ""Garfield"" has a challenger in the young ""Cesar"" (Clifton Collins Jr) and most of the film is spent teeing up the ultimate denouement between the two men, in what is really a rather unfulfilling fashion. Kevin Reynolds provides us here with a pretty savage indictment of an education system that could hardly be more indifferent to the needs of it's staff or it's students. Indeed the state of the buildings, the safety of just about everyone and the attitudes of the students seems to be wrapped in a self-perpetuating film of neglect and fear of law suits. Jackson presents us with a measured performance, but his character is a bit sterile. The sub-plot with his fearful colleague ""Ellen"" (Kelly Rowan) tries to inject a little humanity, but even that cannot penetrate the otherwise dark, gloomy and bleak storyline that may well be based in truth (it was written by a schoolteacher) but makes for a curiously downbeat and unmemorable piece of drama."

Just before Gorbachev’s rise to power in the USSR, a notable naval commander (Connery) takes a technologically advanced submarine on its maiden voyage to conduct missile drills off of America's east coast. Something happens to draw the ire of the Soviet brass while a CIA analyst (Baldwin) believes the captain might be defecting. James Earl Jones, Sam Neill and Courtney B Vance are on hand.

Based on the 1984 Tom Clancy novel, “The Hunt for Red October” (1990) is a well-done Cold War thriller and the first of currently five movies involving the character of Jack Ryan. The next two are “Patriot Games” (1992) and “Clear and Present Danger” (1994) featuring Harrison Ford in the role. Then Ben Affleck would take over for one installment, “The Sum of All Fears” (2002), before Chris Pine’s “Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit” (2014).

To appreciate this movie, you have to be in the mood for military-oriented drama/suspense rooted in global politics and an all-male cast (except for a cameo by Gates McFadden). Like “Ice Station Zebra” (1968), the scenes mostly consist of men dialoguing & strategizing in the cramped quarters of submarines or vessels; as well as political rooms/offices. A saboteur is no doubt lurking nearby.

The movie runs 2 hours, 15 minutes, and was shot in America, e.g. Port Valdez, Alaska (opening sequence); Lake James, North Carolina (closing scene); the state of Washington (Port Angeles & Keyport); naval bases in Los Angeles and Connecticut; USS Blueback; San Diego; as well as Liverpool, England (standing-in for Moscow).

GRADE: B || When British intelligence sends some photographs to CIA analyst ""Jack Ryan"" (Alec Baldwin) he immediately races to his boss (James Earl Jones) with what seems like a fantastic tale about a submarine that uses a hydro-dynamic drive. That renders it almost silent to traditional sonar and therefore a threat to NATO. Next thing we know, the Soviet's have mobilised their Atlantic fleet and it occurs to ""Ryan"" that they could have a defection on their hands. He now has to convince his sceptical superiors that this isn't just a wild goose chase, and that ""Ramius"" (Sean Connery) has a plan to bring his state of the art warship to the USA. Meantime, onboard the ""Red October"" we discover a complex plan that will test the mettle of the crew - officers and men alike, as they ostensibly conduct routine sea trials and missile drills - but with an ulterior motive that the audience knows all about, but the crew - well they're very much in the dark as the peril grows. This is a solidly entertaining story of political intrigue and deception and the claustrophobic settings of the submarines work well to give both Connery (who makes no attempt at all to disguise his thick Scots accent) and the much better than usual Baldwin room to manoeuvre. The supporting cast isn't the best - Scott Glenn, Sam Neill and Courtney B. Vance could have been cheerfully fired from a torpedo tubes early on, but they feature only sparingly as the adventure builds to an excitingly paced denouement. Could it really have happened? || ""The Hunt for Red October"" is an extremely well paced film throughout and it never leaves us in any doubt that Jack Ryan's assumptions about captain Marko Ramius are unfailingly correct and if anything could have sapped the interest and made this nothing more than an overlong and water logged exercise in boredom then this is it, so it is amazing this never actually happens and indeed the opposite just happens to be true. The film also features a wonderfully tense game of cat and mouse through the briny depths as the submarines Konovalov and Red October track each other and it provides a very satisfying conclusion to captain Viktor Tupolev's pursuit of Ramius in which Ramius outsmarts the other captain with fatal results for his opponent."

Unfortunately people are reviewing this with an eye to the present and claiming that it stereotypes Gay men, and it does to an extent, but I do believe that a lot of the single star reviews would have made the same complaint no matter what they did with the lead character.

The fact is, for its time, for its era, it was part of the wave of films and TV shows that helped to normalize homosexuality in America, and it's that normalization that, more than any activism, helped for the Civil Rights victories we are seeing in the present.

To shun it over politics is literally to bite the hand that feeds you, especially since it has a clear message that homophobia is wrong and it was movies and TV shows like this that helped bring the attitudes and views on homosexuality that everyone supports today.

But, honestly, none of that matters. What matters is entertainment, that is why movies are made. Even informative movies have to have an eye towards entertaining the viewers if they want to actually be watched.

And, this movie is entertaining. This movie is hysterical, even if the masculinity tape was a bit of a stretch of the imagination even for a comedy, it still was a stretch that won one or two laughs from the audience.

Ultimately, it is a funny film that will entertain. So try to leave your political baggage at the door, and, if you can't, realize that it was films like this that helped normalize the views the American public has towards your political agenda...and then sit back and enjoy a funny and uplifting film with a strong moral."

It's a good looking film this, and ""Bart"" the bear turns in quite a ferocious effort as he provides such of the menace in this drama. Sadly, though, neither lead actor offers much by way of a performance, the dialogue is all a bit basic and though the grand scale photography is great to look at, the action stuff struggles to look real or plausible.

Curtis Hanson directs and co-adapts the screenplay with Brian Helgeland from legendary pulp novelist James Ellroy's novel. It stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.

It's 1950s Los Angeles and three cops of very different morals and stature are about to be entwined in crime and corruption...

I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.

Tremendous film making. Hanson takes Ellroy's labyrinthine story and pumps it with period authenticity and seamless direction, the latter of which sees him garner superlative performances from the cast. This is the side of Los Angeles nobody wants to talk about, it's awash with corpses, hookers, seedy set-ups, violence, drugs, racism and corruption a go-go. And that's just involving the politicians, the press and the coppers! 

Rollo Tomasi.

The absence of genuine heroes on show still further keeps ""The City of Angels"" covered in dark clouds, where even as the plot twists and turns, as the mysteries unravel and brutality unfurls, the final destination of the principal characters is never clear, thus there's a continuing edge of seat pulse beat within the pic. It's also sexy and dangerous, the dialogue sharper than a serpent's tooth, and while the ending is a little too cosy as opposed to original noir wave conventions, this is pure noir in all but black and white photography.

It won only two Academy Awards, Basinger for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and for Hanson and Hegeland for Best Writing - Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Frankly it should have won a dozen or so for it's not just one of the best films of the 1990s, but also one of the best Neo-Noirs ever produced. 10/10 || After the seemingly indiscriminate slaughter of the folks at a diner, it's the ambitious ""Exley"" (Guy Pearce) who suggests to his bosses that it's time for the LAPD to get it's act together and root out the corruption endemic within the force. To that end, he is promoted by ""Capt. Smith"" (James Cornwall) and sets about trying to assert a bit more of the rule of law rather than the rule of vengeance - that'd be the ""White"" (Russell Crowe) method, or the more venal and sleazy fashion of ""Vincennes"" (Kevin Spacey). Needless to say, nobody takes kindly to this new pure as the driven snow approach, but gradually ""Exley"" starts to make a bit of headway into the world of organised crime, and to realise just how involved the police are in covering up crimes from fraud to murder. He's also aware that someone is pulling his strings, so some sort of rapport with one of his suspicions colleagues is going to have to be forged if he is to stay alive! Each of these characters get their moment in the sun and that allows us to meet the unscrupulous red-top publisher ""Hudgens"" (an energetic Danny DeVito) and the sophisticated call-girl ""Lynn"" (Kim Basinger) who is quite often pretending to be Veronica Lake! I think my only problem with this film was that I reckoned on who was doing what really early on, so the jeopardy was a little bit compromised. That said, though, it's one of Crowe's more natural performances and Pearce shows us he can deliver gritty and bruising parts well too. I could have been doing with a little more of Basinger's quite intriguing character, just to break up the relentlessness of the story a bit more, but it's a solid adaptation of James Ellroy's uncompromising book that Curtis Hanson presents and it doesn't hang about."

A serial killer is loose in Durham, North Carolina, who’s actually a serial collector of young women. Forensic psychologist Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) ventures down from D.C. to assist in the investigation since his niece is one of the victims. He eventually teams-up with a surgeon who escaped the perpetrator’s lair (Ashley Judd). Cary Elwes and Tony Goldwyn are also on hand. 

“Kiss the Girls” (1997) is a detective thriller in the mold of “Silence of the Lambs” (1991) with some “Se7en” (1995) and a dash of “Scream” (1996), but less gruesome and therefore presumably more palatable to a larger audience. What I appreciate most about this flick is the lush nighttime sylvan cinematography. The cast is good as well.

The first half is great for this genre, but the story gets progressively implausible from there with a muddled midsection. And then there’s the ‘big reveal’ at the end, which was predictable from the get-go. At the end of the day “Kiss the Girls” is worthwhile if you like detective thrillers and the cast, but be prepared for a wildly unrealistic tale. The sequel, “Along Came a Spider” (2001), had the same problem where the ‘big reveal’ is even more eye-rolling.      

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in North Carolina and Southern Cal.

GRADE: C || Morgan Freeman is quite effective here in this adaptation of James Patterson's novel about the kidnap of the niece of this police psychologist/detective. Racing to her North Carolina school, ""Cross"" discovers pretty quickly that she is likely to be the latest in a line of youngsters abused and killed at the hands of the so-called ""Casanova""! Fortunately, one of his would be victims - ""Kate"" (Ashley Judd) - manages to escape her captivity, and with ""Cross"" and time very much against them, tries to track down this murderer. It stays fairly faithful to the book and that's maybe why it doesn't quite work. The narrative is really rather dry, the dialogue all a bit too wordy and though the subject matter is quite disturbing, there isn't a great deal of menace on show for us here. ""Cross"" is just too clever; the clues too obscure for us but childsplay for him, and after a while that starts to grate a little. The best examples of this genre allow the audience to participate in the manhunt along with the characters. Not so much here. Freeman owns the screen, as usual, and Judd is perfectly acceptable as his feisty and determined sidekick as we head to a denouement that has just enough jeopardy to keep it interesting. There are loads of ""Alex Cross"" books, so I would expect more from this character - I hope this is but a bedrock for a darker and more complex sequel. || Not that bad of a movie. Gets involved in a sex ring. Alex Cross has to figure out if she a victim or a participant."

“Seven Years in Tibet” (1997) is a biographical historical drama about Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) and his time in Tibet and friendship with the Dalai Lama, a boy, just before & during WW2, as well as the build-up to the invasion of Tibet in 1950 by Communist Chinese forces and the immediate aftermath. David Thewlis is on hand as Heinrich’s German mountaineer friend.

The movie’s similar to other realistic walk-to-salvation wilderness adventures, like “The Way Back” (2010). Pitt is charismatic as the pompous mountaineer who is slowly humbled in the highest region of the globe. The movie couldn’t be made today since it paints the Chinese Communist Party in a negative light; in other words, it’s truthful.          

The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes and the bulk of it was shot in Argentina at the city of La Plata and the Andes Mountains in the Mendoza Province, while about 20 minutes of footage was secretly shot in Tibet. 

GRADE: B || Brad Pitt is acclaimed Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer who leaves his expectant wife to climb in the Himalayas. A couple of high-altitude mishaps and the commencement of WWII see him and colleague Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis) interred by the British and confined to a POW camp. After a few failed attempts, the pair manage to escape and after some perilous trekking through the hostile wilderness, they find themselves at the gates of the holy city of Lhasa. Foreigners are not especially welcome here, but they are fed and watered and gradually become accepted to the point where Harrer is introduced to the Great Mother and thence to the young, curious and engaging Dalai Lama himself. The spiritual leader takes a shine to his new friend with golden hair and the older man regales him with tales of wonder from the outside world. Simultaneously, their much larger and increasingly more territorial neighbour has clear designs on Tibet. With troops massing on the borders, the precarious nature of the independence of this small country becomes more obvious and, well history is never far from the narrative. I think Pitt plays well as the arrogant climber and as the story develops so does his character - from a selfish loner to one who learns to care for things greater than just himself. To that end, Thewlis also delivers strongly as the pair bond - despite themselves, sometimes - and ""Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk positively oozes a decency and spiritualism as the boy who is fighting a losing battle against those who think religion is a ""disease"". Though it does rather oversimplify the politics, this film is beautifully shot with some genuine Tibetan scenes around the amazing architecture that is the Potala Palace and by the denouement you can't help but empathise with a nation that just wanted to be left in peace to live in peace."

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || _**This ain’t the Barbara Eden kind of genie**_ 

Through a priceless gemstone, a malevolent djinn (Andrew Divoff) is released in Los Angeles where he harasses people by answering their wishes. Tammy Lauren plays the protagonist, Wendy Benson-Landes her sister and Robert Englund a collector of idolatrous artifacts. 
   
“Wishmaster” (1997) is inventive comic book horror with a thought-out script that features a villain/monster that is actually interesting for a change. The Djinn is superbly done and diabolically charismatic. Meanwhile Tammy Lauren is reminiscent of a younger Linda Hamilton. She’s likable and spirited, but doesn’t do much for me personally; and the role of Wendy Benson-Landes is too small to note.  The flick isn’t helped by its gaudy low-rent vibe and bland cast, but it entertains well enough with amusingly horrific effects, fun cameos and a unique concept.

As of 2002 it birthed three sequels.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.

An emotionally-detached Vietnam vet making a living as a beekeeper on the boggy panhandle of Florida (Peter Fonda) deals with grief, the meaninglessness of life, his son in prison (Tom Wood), a drug-addled daughter-in-law (Christine Dunford), a rebellious granddaughter (Jessica Biel), a new neighbor (Patricia Richardson) and a couple of thugs from Orlando (Steven Flynn and Dewey Weber).

""Ulee’s Gold"" (1997) is a slice-of-life Southern Gothic that could be mentioned in the same breath as “Ode to Billy Joe” (1976), “The Man in the Moon” (1991), “Sling Blade” (1996), “The Apostle” (1997) “Undertow” (2004), “Back Roads” (2018) and “The Devil All the Time” (2020). While it’s not as relentlessly downbeat & sordid as the last two, it certainly presents some of the most harrowing challenges of life in the modern world of which most viewers can relate. I definitely could.

Speaking of which, I like the movie’s mundane realism and that it has the confidence to take its time to tell its story. While most critics praise the film, one armchair critic complained that the events are so humdrum every-day that it plays like a Lifetime or Hallmark flick. But this presupposes that theatrical movies HAVE to include constant unrealistic thrills and action, which obviously isn’t the case, particularly when it comes to a drama. Imagine how eye-rolling it would be if, say, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” threw in an explosion or action sequence every ten minutes.

The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes, and was shot on the panhandle of Florida just east of Panama City in Apalachicola, Port St. Joe and Wewahitchka, with one sequence done in Orlando.

I was expecting this moving to be funny. It wasn't. This moving is very boring. Nothing exciting or interesting about it. || **A somewhat one-dimensional comedy that is based on uncomfortable dialogues and situations.**

I didn't really know what I was going to find when I sat down to watch this film, directed and written by Kevin Smith (who also appears in the film, in a minor role, his famous “Silent Bob”), who we know best for his participation in the “Clerks” movies. When I finished, I felt moderately satisfied, even though I consider the film forgettable.

The plot is based on an unlikely romance between two very different people: Holden is a comic book artist who lives and works with his best friend, Banky. Being a conservative and conventional man, he is confused when he falls in love with Alyssa, a liberal and sexually experienced woman, who says she is a lesbian, but who does not give up having sex with men when she feels like it. The romance will cause mutual discomfort and will lead Banky to try to “protect” Holden from that woman, who is so different from them.

Creating a romantic comedy in which a conventional and conservative man gets involved with a clearly more liberal and experienced woman is a good idea, but the film stops there and doesn't go much further than the tension created around it. The characters are poorly developed and are limited to “symbolizing” incompatible ways of experiencing sexuality. We never know more about them and their motivations or thoughts, and the film is not very effective in the way it tries to create comical situations around this. Thinking about the subject, I believe that the funniest dialogues are those of Banky, who shows from an early age that his character is spontaneous and prone to saying things that shouldn't be said.

With a poorly developed script, situations whose joke never exceeds the average and production values that also do not surprise or exceed the “standard”, the strongest point of this film ends up being, in my opinion, the work of the main cast, in particular Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams. Affleck, especially, is superb in the way he brings his character to life. One could hardly give more strength and credibility to that character. Lee is equally good, in that he can be funny, even if he is one-dimensional. Joey Adams does a very good job, and it's strange to see how this film didn't contribute much to the growth of his career."

When male strip show act The Chippendales come to Sheffield and the local women pay in their droves to see the show, Gaz and the rest of his unemployed pals pick up on an idea to make some cash. They will do a one off show where they themselves will strip on the stage, with the difference being that this lot will go for the ""Full Monty"" - totally naked dancing!

The Full Monty is a very winning comedy, it's preposterous in premise of course, but in amongst the frivolity and outright daftness, lies a very clever and functional tale of personal relationships. In spite of what some American reviewers have said over the years, the picture is awash with very funny gags, it's just perhaps that the untrained none British eye isn't seeing the jokes? For instance, during the famous dole queue dancing sequence, have a look at the guy standing behind Tom Wilkinson, who after witnessing Wilkinson do his Fred Astaire act, merely puffs out his cheeks and carries on waiting his turn! It's little touches like that that say so much about the divide between British and American comedy.

As I alluded to earlier, The Full Monty isn't just a comedy about unsightly men doing a strip tease. We have a group of men who each strive for something in their lives, be it the strain of home life or sexual identity, these guys are given sensitive emotional themes from which to regain some dignity. If there is a criticism here, then it would have been nice to give the female characters a bit more flesh on their bones, but ultimately this really is about the boys after all. Backed up by a foot tapping soundtrack and boasting excellent performances from the cast, The Full Monty is a hugely enjoyable picture that rewards on repeat viewings. So just keep your eyes peeled for sight gags you just may have missed the last time you viewed it. 8/10 || Robert Carlyle (""Gaz"") and Mark Addy (""Dave"") are great in this role reversal comedy set amidst Margaret Thatcher's ""recalibration"" of Britain's manufacturing industries and communities. Sheffield is bearing the brunt of these changes, and unemployment is rife - with little hope of any of the former steel workers escaping their new found poverty. Even the foreman ""Gerald"" (Tom Wilkinson) is struggling to feed his voracious population of gnomes (and his extravagant wife). Walking past their local working men's club one day, they notice that a famous troupe of male strippers are selling it out, and so they decide that there's no reason why they can't do it too! Helped by his rather sceptical young son ""Nathan"" (Wim Snape) the dancer recruitment process amusingly starts the ball rolling in this darkly humorous story of aspiration and sheer bloody-mindedness that takes quite a fun swipe at gender roles and stereotypes. Trying to keep their plans under wraps, they clandestinely develop and rehearse their routine with plenty of Hot Chocolate and Donna Summer to get the hips swaying and the toes tapping. It's well paced and pithily written - even if some of the language wouldn't pass any political correctness tests twenty-five years later. The characterisations are largely left to develop the story without too much familial clutter and the diverse nature of the characters offers us an enjoyable and optimistic look at what the human spirit can do when it's challenged. It packs loads into ninety minutes and it's nice to see a British film that doesn't rely on national treasures or stately homes. || **An excellent comedy, with intelligent and creative humor.**

This is an interesting comedy that shows that British cinema sometimes surprises with small gems of quality. I don't know exactly how the film was received in its country of origin (it was a time when the British were in shock due to the death of Diana Spencer, ex-wife of the current King Charles III), but, in my country, the film received little attention due to the film “Titanic”, a box office phenomenon. Still, as far as I know, the film was profitable overall, and was well reviewed by critics. At the 1998 Oscars, it was nominated for four awards, but only won Best Soundtrack for a Comedy or Musical, a category that only existed for a few years.

The story takes place in Sheffield, a British city famous for its steel industry, but which was greatly affected by the economic recession and the closure of many factories, similar to what happened in Detroit with the automobile industry and in Matosinhos, in my country, with canning factories. To try to earn money, six men join forces to become a group of male strippers. They have to overcome their own prejudices and then public ridicule, when everything becomes known. The film has lots of moments of intelligent, well-constructed humor, and the dialogue is quality. Contrary to what some professional critics said at the time, I thought the use of slang and specifically British words was good, as it added authenticity to the dialogue. There are also some touching moments of understanding and mutual help.

The film was very well directed by Peter Cattaneo, and was edited effectively, with a sense of rhythm that allows the film to be engaging and entertaining without wasting time or dispersing into subplots that would lead to nothing. On a technical level, the film has a good set of sets and the filming locations were very well selected, but what deserves the most attention, in my opinion, is the soundtrack, which is virtually a beautiful collection of memorable hits from the 70s. and 80s, including “You Sexy Thing”, “You Can Leave Your Hat On” and other well-known songs. This luxurious soundtrack was one of the aspects that I most enjoyed about the film.

Another strong point of the film is the general performance of the cast led by Robert Carlyle, a creative protagonist who gives us an inspired and spirited performance. Alongside him, we also have some great British actors such as Tom Wilkinson (in one of the best comic efforts of his career), Hugo Speer and Mark Addy. Each of them is truly good at what they do and have been given very competent material to work with."

Oh, yeah, almost forgot, Keanu is in this one too...but for a good slice of the film he doesn't play the most savory of characters and, really, honestly, he just seems too nice to play a lawyer...

...but despite that he does a pretty good job of exhibiting the ego that has to come with the law profession...just not the vile evilness. So, I can't totally fault him for miscast as I could for Dracula.

Jeffery Jones is in there too and due to recent revelations he totally fits the sleazy lawyer role.

But yeah, 1997, the 90s had a way with films that was only really beaten by the 70s and The Devil's Advocate is one of those films that could really only be made in those two decades. Stand alone horror not intended as a franchise piece and one with a twist that asks you to think a little.

No way that would be made today and that is a shame.

She starts to cool on their arrangement and wants to return to Florida but pretty soon it's clear that ""Kevin"" is addicted - and not to her! Pacino is on good form here as it becomes clear just who his character is, and how adeptly he is pulling all the strings and manoeuvring his new charge into a position that might suggest that the clue is in the title! Now as a life-long lover of the baddie in films, I felt a bit let down by the ending. Faust it isn't - but, to be fair, it still goes as close as Hollywood will probably ever go in portraying a characterisation of the epitome of evil (and offering a wonderful critique on vanity being the downfall of mankind) that actually has a fighting chance of prevailing! Reeves is not the finest actor to grace our screens. Easy on the eye, certainly, but somehow he's just a bit too lightweight here. That might be because, however, Pacino is very much in his element and even though it can drag at times during the almost 2½ hour running time, it's a remarkably compelling ride that still holds up quite well."

Kevin Williamson, hot off of the success of his screenplay for Wes Craven's Scream, here adapted the Lois Duncan novel with mixed results.

A bunch of pretty teenagers in a coastal fishing town run over a man in the road and try to cover it up. Not a wise move at the best of times, even more so now as the victim, a hook wielding fisherman, is coming to get them.

And that's pretty much it. Williamson adds some humour into the play, while director Jim Gillespie plays his shock tactics well and keeps the pretty young cast annoying enough for us to want to see the fisherman guy enact revenge.

It sadly gets away from itself in the last quarter once the stalker is revealed, and in truth there's very little imagination gone into the whole pic. But it's a decent night in with beer and popcorn for those after a short sharp shock type horror. 6/10 || _**The guilt will haunt you and maybe even KILL you**_

Released in 1997, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" takes place in coastal North Carolina where a group of just-graduated teens experience a tragic event and compound it by foolishly reacting. They swear to carry the secret to their graves, but the next summer it becomes clear that someone knows their secret and murders start piling up. The teens are played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. Also on hand are Johnny Galecki, Anne Heche and Muse Watson.

This movie is full of slasher clichés, like the killer who's always in the same garb (this time a fisherman's slicker outfit), the slow-methodical walking of the killer (never running) and the undead dead. There are also two blatant ""Yeah, right"" scenes (noted below). Thankfully, it makes up for it by the stellar coastal locations (strangely shot on BOTH East and West coasts), a quality cast, some effective sequences and the potent moral on haunting guilt that slowly kills ya. The immediate aftermath of the opening accident is particularly well done.

The film runs 99 minutes and shot in Southport, North Carolina, and Jenner, California, and nearby regions of both coasts.

GRADE: B or B- (6.5/10 Stars)

***SPOILER ALERT*** (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM)

Here are the two eye-rolling scenes:

1. The sequence where Max's corpse is found in the trunk with the crabs. It couldn't have been an illusion since Helen didn't yet know Max was dead, so it must've really happened. If so, how would the slicker-killer get the trunk cleaned-up so quickly with no one seeing him in a neighborhood in broad daylight? Also, how did he even get into trunk? Did he have his own personal key? The sequence is just too far-fetched.

2. After Barry is murdered by the killer at the pageant how does he know that the cop and Helen would be driving down the alley by-pass an hour or so later? (I realize the street was blocked off and he might've been the one who set it up, but how did he know this would be the precise route taken by the cop and Helen? And how would he even know Helen would be riding with the cop? It's not like she wouldn't have other friends & family in town with whom she could ride. Anyway, wouldn't people living in the downtown area or other passersby notice a man in full-slicker garb working on his truck?

Sequences like these take intelligent viewers right out of the story, which explains Roger Ebert's response: ""After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie than the makers did."" || I liked this movie. I wish there was more action and killing but overall pretty good. Has a good cast in it too."

I think what helps in that regard is the short run time and the fact that I do believe the actors were trying, they were just lumbered with a poor product. Harland Williams plays the role of Fred as well as anyone could have to be honest, while it's nice to see Jeffrey DeMunn - shoutout Dale, <em>'The Walking Dead'</em>.

The way the premise is brought to life is the biggest downside to this. It's cringe, predictable and lamely written. The more serious space ending is OK but doesn't fit the rest of the film's silliness at all. There aren't many, if any, laughs; for me at least.

""Gattaca"" (1997) is a sci-fi drama “tech noir,” which combines futuristic science-fiction with 40s/50s noir. 
It’s not just the suits & hats, the cars look like 50s/60s coupes, but whine because they’re electric. It’s similar in this respect to “Dark City” (1998), but more dramatic. Imagine if “Dick Tracy” (1990) was a somber space-age sci-fi and you’d have a pretty good idea. 

The film flopped at the box office while critics generally praised it. It plays better if you have an interest in eugenics and the philosophies thereof. For me, it’s decent, but too low-key. I prefer “Dark City” if I’m going to watch a film of this sort.

The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal: Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael; Otis College of Art and Design; CLA Building on the campus of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona; the spillway of the Sepulveda Dam; outside The Forum in Inglewood; and Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station.  

GRADE: B- || Simply put, Gattaca is one of the greatest movies ever made. Some might think that's going too far but it truly is a masterpiece. Everything from the casting, set design, cinematography, writing and the Universe in which the story takes place. It is not only a great source of entertainment but an inspiring work of art. 

By far the most poetic movie I have had the pleasure of watching. Every line is elegiac and truly beautiful. It's the type of movie that keeps you thinking days after the credits have rolled. Not because it is fast-paced, intense or has a crazy twist ending but for its tranquil philosophical ideas. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a jaw-dropping movie night. It should be on every cinephile's list of must-watch. || ."

Directed by Joe Chappelle and written by Dean Koontz, who adapts from his own novel, Phantoms (not the greatest title all things considered) is a considerably well put together amalgamation of horror/sci-fi/creature feature tropes. If at times it feels clichéd and formulaic, then that is ultimately a curse of the cinematic genres it lives and breaths in.

Plot basically has two sisters played by Rose McGowan and Joanna Going arriving in the town of Snowfield, Cololrado, to find most of the inhabitants dead, diseased or dismembered. A trio of coppers turn up played by Liev Schreiber (shifty malevolence), Ben Affleck (square jawed bastion of heroism) and Nicky Katt (fodder of course), and thus a fight for survival ensues as Peter O'Toole's sharp doctor character comes flying in to become the fulcrum of the story. So yep! There's something very evil and nasty at work here and the makers expand upon the reasons why with a drip-feed mixture of mad science and intelligent thematic ideas.

The effects work is more than adequate and the strong cast list perform well up to scratch (nice to see O'Toole doesn't phone it in to denigrate the story). Things are taken very seriously throughout, the makers in no way biting the hand that feeds them, while the requisite insertions of jump - shocks - twists and mayhem are handled with care and attention by the director. You may come away as I did with a hunger to dig out your copy of John Carpenter's sublime The Thing? Which in truth is never a bad ""thing,"" but this is still sturdy stuff, a pic caked in genre cement, and crucially it doesn't waste the time invested by the genre compliant viewers. 7/10 || The Thing’s long lost cousin (sort of) in an isolated town in the mountains of Colorado

Two sisters (Rose McGowan & Joanna Going) visit a town in the Rockies, which is mysteriously absent of people except for a few corpses. They eventually encounter a Sheriff (Ben Affleck) and his deputies as the mystery deepens (Liev Schreiber plays one of the deputies). Peter O'Toole is on hand as an eccentric British writer who assists the group while Clifton Powell plays the commanding officer of an Army unit sent to the town.

The movie came out in 1998 and was written by heralded horror author Dean Koontz (both the screenplay and the novel). The story is basically “The Thing” (1982) set in a Rockies town with various nuances, like the addition of two females. Speaking of whom, Rose and Joanna have stunning faces, but their beauty is never really capitalized on in the film. Joanna, for instance, wears ridiculously baggy tan slacks the entire runtime.

The first half is nice & mysterious with several genuinely creepy sequences whereas the second half focuses on the incredible source of the horror and the complexities thereof. People complain about the latter portions, and I can see where they’re coming from, but I like the way the protagonists put their heads together to try to figure out and defeat the diabolical phenomenon.

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot in Georgetown, Colorado.

Switchback is written and directed by Jeb Stuart. It stars Dennis Quaid, Danny Glover, Jared Leto, R. Lee Ermey, Ted Levine and William Fitchner. Music is by Basil Poledouris and cinematography by Oliver Wood.

FBI agent Frank LaCrosse (Quaid) is tracking a serial killer who he believes kidnapped his young son.

Switchback is a standard serial killer based thriller that flopped at the box office. It's not a bad film but it never delivers on its potential. The location travelogue of the story is most impressive, especially the last third once we get to the snowy mountains of Colorado, but it's the scenery that grips and holds the attention more than the plot.

The red herrings have interest value enough for us to stay with what is at just under two hours a long film, but resolutions are either anti climatic or too obvious. Cast are a mixed bag, with Quaid just okay as the perpetually bleak protag and Glover sadly winding out as miscast once film shows its hands. Thankfully Leto and Ermey are on hand to keep a rein on things, playing the intended thriller tone just right as per their respective characters.

It's perhaps unlucky to have followed far superior/intelligent serial killer based thrillers, rendering it then and now as weak offerings. It's not the dead on stinker the box office suggests, and trimmed of 20 minutes it would have been a decent time waster, but as it is it plays out as unoriginal and lacking in directorial focus. 5/10"

After the enormous success of Mr. Bean, it was reasonably predictable that, sooner or later, we would see Rowan Atkinson performing his usual antics in a film production. However, despite the actor's efforts, the truth is that it would never be the same, nor could it be, and sometimes the jokes are so forced that they simply lose their effectiveness.

In this film, Bean found work at the National Gallery in London. A job that is apparently safe, if we consider that the character gets into trouble even with the simplest tasks: he is a watchman and sits in a chair while visitors and tourists walk around. The problem is that, in the case of Bean, we know that things are going to get complicated almost by magic: and the gallery directors are very happy when the curators of a Californian museum acquire a remarkable painting by an American author and an expert to talk about her at a presentation ceremony: Bean is the one the directors most want to see behind her back, so they don't even hesitate. From here, disaster is waiting to happen.

Let's be honest: the film is funny and works reasonably well. It's a good quality comedy, and it was also successful at the box office (although that's not synonymous with quality, because it's also true that there are many much worse films, like “Ted”, which also sold well). We can't point out defects that it doesn't have at all. For me, the biggest defect of this film is the audience, which created very high expectations at the expense of the gigantic success of the fourteen episode miniseries that Atkinson created in the 90s. Anyone waiting to have the same experience with This film will always be disappointing. Things aren't the same, they don't work the same way and everything is a little more exaggerated and forced. However, it would be difficult for an American production to make a feature-length film with Bean any other way.

The film takes great care and attention with the sets, cinematography, costumes and effects used, but it is still within the “standard” of light films that the USA released at this time. It's nothing truly exceptional. Throughout the film, situations occur that attempt to recreate Atkinson's style of humor, as he does his best to avoid talking, but still has to do so occasionally. We can say that the actor made a huge effort, but that he also encountered problems adapting his recipe to the North American cinematic style. It's like trying to dress a child in an adult man's costume: it will look bizarre, disharmonious and ugly, but he's dressed.

In between, we also have to positively highlight the work of Peter MacNicoll, and of course, being a historian and an art lover, I have to congratulate the use of the occasion to make known to the general public a magnificent painting that really exists: Arrangement in Gray and Black nº 1. It was painted by James Whistler and can be seen at the Orsay Museum in Paris."

RELEASED IN 1997 and written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola based on John Grisham’s book, ""The Rainmaker"" stars Matt Damon as an idealistic newbie lawyer in Memphis who takes on a fraudulent insurance company with Danny DeVito as his paralegal and Claire Danes an abused potential love interest. Jon Voight plays the lead lawyer for the insurance company and Roy Scheider the CEO of the corporation.

Beyond Coppola’s renowned expertise, the cast is stellar, which also includes Mickey Rourke as a smooth legal mogul, Virginia Madsen as a witness and Dean Stockwell & Danny Glover as judges. This was Damon’s break out role as a leading man, paving the way for hits like “Good Will Hunting” (1998) and “Saving Private Ryan” (1998). He’s affable as the principled young lawyer and I liked the way the movie discreetly shows his new home life with the elderly lady, plus other budding relationships.

This is decidedly a drama with many courtroom scenes, so don’t except the thrills of other Grisham-based films, like the excellent “The Firm” (1993) and action-packed “The Pelican Brief” (1993), although there is an intense action sequence in the second half. While the first half confidently take its time with the drama, throwing in moments of realistic amusement, it segues into a compelling third act. Furthermore, “The Rainmaker” is a must for anyone interested in the good, the bad and the ugly of the legal arena in America.

The movie made $46 million domestically from a budget of $40 million (not including revenue from other countries), but it was still considered a disappoint in comparison to “The Firm,” which cost roughly the same amount and made six times as much at the box office. Coppola subsequently took a decade break from directing before reentering the fray with the inscrutable “Youth Without Youth” (2007).

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 15 minutes and was shot in the Memphis area of Tennessee, as well as Cleveland, Ohio and California (Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco).

GRADE: B || The Rainmaker is a compelling legal drama that showcases Francis Ford Coppola's return to form after the less successful Jack. Adapted from John Grisham's novel, the film follows Rudy Baylor, a novice attorney portrayed by Matt Damon, as he takes on a powerful insurance company in a wrongful death lawsuit. While the case's outcome may seem predictable, the narrative remains engaging, keeping viewers invested throughout.

Matt Damon delivers a strong performance, capturing Rudy's earnestness and determination. 1997 was indeed a significant year for Damon, with Good Will Hunting also releasing, further establishing his presence in Hollywood. The supporting cast, including Danny DeVito as Deck Shifflet and Jon Voight as the opposing attorney, adds depth and nuance to the story.

Coppola's direction brings a grounded realism to the film, focusing on the intricacies of the legal process and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters. The courtroom scenes are particularly well-executed, balancing tension and drama effectively. With Coppola's direction and the performances, The Rainmaker is notably one of the better adaptations of Grisham's work.

Despite its strengths, The Rainmaker didn't achieve significant box office success, grossing $45.9 million domestically against a $40 million budget. However, it received generally positive reviews.

In summary, The Rainmaker is a well-crafted film that combines strong performances with insightful direction, making it a noteworthy entry in Coppola's filmography and a testament to Damon's early talent."

Fame is a fickle friend, however, and the writing is soon on the wall for our emotionally ill-equipped young man who never for a moment considers that this escalator can go down as well as up. This story is filled with engaging and enigmatic characters - ranging from the stoic ""Amber Waves"" (a cracking effort from Julianne Moore) who seems to try and instil a sense of proportion and responsibility to the gorgeously stereotypical ""Reed Rothschild"" (an unlikely casting, I thought, in John C. Reilly). It's Mark Wahlberg who proves to be the revelation here, though. He works quite naturally with the on-form, and entirely plausible, veteran Reynolds and for quite a while, their roller-coaster of sex and success is compelling and quite enjoyable to follow.

The formula of this thriller (Drama) is not (was) new or even flag bearing as regards action set pieces and hide behind your hands suspense, yet it is still one of a kind for the genre and the decade it came from.

The plot is a sizzler as it involves the central theme of outsiders who are considered outside of the mainstream norm. To have a thriller involving the Amish community not only brings into focus how different folks' beliefs can be, but to also hit home at just how ignorant many are to the ways of minorities and what they stand for. So many great things about the movie stand out.

Harrison Ford is perfect, yes it's a perfect performance, his John Book is gruff and rugged yet as the story moves on he nails the endearment and knowing traits that the character calls for. Kelly McGillis is an actress who I feel drags down nearly all the films she leads in, yet here I forgive her because she is marvellous as Rachael, an Amish woman fighting her inner feelings as much as she is the bad outside world that wants to hurt her son.

Peter Weir IMHO is one of the most under praised modern day directors around (yes even now), and here his deft hands put the story together adroitly, whilst John Searle's cinematography is gorgeous and out of the top draw. It's an almost perfect movie as regards acting and the process of making a film, I do however fly in the face of popular opinion as regards the score, it doesn't work for me (I'm sad to say), Maurice Jarre's drawn out synth seems to me out of place for the setting we are watching, I personally would have liked a more subtle string arrangement - but that is me...

For those looking for a first time viewing in the Drama/Thriller genre then they can do no worse than seek this one out. It delivers on a plot front, and the ending doesn't pander to studio yearnings either. 9/10

The S/E DVD has a wonderful making of feature that is crammed full of quality input, and for Ford worshippers such as I, it contains none aloof input from the legend himself, that alone was worth the 5 Euros it cost me for this cracking film. || My Fiance is a Millennial and I've been trying to get her and her friends to watch some classic films. Some, Taxi Driver, Chinatown, The Godfather, Godfellas, The Princess Bride, Blazing Saddles were epic fails for a variety of reasons.

Witness actually stood the Millennial taste test for some reason, and this is significant because it is really hard to get them to watch or listen to anything that is older than 4 years.

That says something, I'm not sure what, but it was a film that they actually sat through.

It is also one of the tightest scripts Hollywood has produced, which is saying something since it was released in 1985 following almost a decade of the best movies that Hollywood has ever produced.

It's pure story, and that story is backed up with acting and directing making for a beautiful picture all around. || **An action film mixed with a guided tour of an Amish community.**

Here in Portugal, there are few religions other than the Catholic Church and there are no Amish, Mennonite or similar communities. Therefore, this curious religious community is an object of fascination for me and also of renunciation: to explain further, I radically disagree with their religious conceptions, I would never be part of such a religious congregation and, however, I find it fascinating, in today's world, the idea of ​​trying to have a simpler life, without excessive technology and in greater harmony with the natural rhythm. It would be a lifestyle that I wouldn't mind trying, even though I knew I would have difficulty adapting and living without access to the technologies that I work and entertain myself with.

In this film, we follow a police officer who, upon discovering a case of corruption in the ranks, finds himself on the verge of having to disappear to avoid being killed and to protect the only witness to a crime in which another police officer was murdered: an Amish boy who lives with his mother, a widow, and his maternal grandfather, in an isolated rural area that is not very receptive to visits from “the English” (as some of them call to the normal people in this film). In the midst of all this, the film shows us the habits, beliefs and customs of these strict religious communities who, out of appreciation for humility and simplicity, renounced everything that could be a luxury and live stoically from subsistence agriculture.

I won't go into considerations about the verisimilitude of the plot, but I believe that the script made an effort to create a convincing and reasonable story that we can believe in. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, which means something. What I can say is that, although the film is engaging, there are aspects that could be improved: the identity of the killers and villains could be kept a mystery for longer and, on the other hand, their motivations don't seem clear enough for me. Another aspect that was not clear was the fate of the young Amish widow's husband. The tension created between her and the congregation's elders could have been better explored, as well as the community's acceptance/rejection of the police officer.

Directed by Peter Weir, the film had serious difficulties in finding a studio willing to commit money to the project, and did not have great support from the Amish community, which not only rejects the capture of images but also fears being invaded by crowds of curious, eager of souvenirs and photographs. Technically, the film is exceptional: in addition to the good cinematography, excellent editing (another Oscar that won) and good action scenes, we have good sets and costumes, which perfectly recreate the environment in which the Amish live, and their simple ways of living. Negative note: Kelly McGillis's nude scene, in addition to being out of place in the film, doesn't fit into the story and seems gratuitous.

After many fantastic and sci-fi films, Harrison Ford got a different work, in a style that he would invest heavily in over the following decades: the action hero, with a pistol in hand and willing to do anything to save the day. The actor seems to be completely at ease with the task and gives us excellent work, fully deserving the Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Kelly McGillis doesn't do so well, but she does what needs to be done and doesn't deserve a negative rating. Danny Glover is a convincing villain."

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || ##No time for regrets in the fury of battle
Again and again there are undertones in this movie that show us that the situation is not as simple as the leaders of the world portrayed in the film might want their underlings to believe. A reporter asks the question whether the humans were the ones who started the war and whether the Arachnids are simply acting in self-defense. A talk show guest finds the idea that there could be intelligent Arachnids preposterous, showing how much the propaganda has done to degrade the enemy. In a great scene we see the eye of one of the arachnids for the first time and for a second I was wondering what was going on inside the creature. Of course, this brief moment of reflection is quickly erased by a gun shot and the continuation of the fury of war.

But this, to me, seems to add to the overall anti-war message: The soldiers can only stay obedient servants if they are not given moments to reflect and question the system. And so when the viewer see the propaganda clip at the very end of the movie proclaiming triumphantly and bombastically ""They'll fight and they'll win"", they might have already forgotten that just a moment ago they saw a sentient being being tortured in the name of this promised glorious victory. || Good watch, will watch again, and can recommend, possible for a Bad Movie Night.

I'll start by saying the movie definitely isn't good, it's infamous for being a bad movie that people still love.  Granted it was 1997, but the cg effects were horrendous.  The practicals actually weren't so bad, but there are very few shots to actually appreciate them.  Again, 1997, this movie is weirdly dated with its perception of what the future would have been.

For those that weren't familiar, this is most decidedly spurred by the popularity of Starcraft in the late 1990's, and that there weren't too many horde movies out there, at least not ones that weren't zombies.  Clearly inspired by Starcraft's Zerg and Warhammer 40K's Tyranids, a bug by any other name.

The world is amazingly crafted, and we only see the tip of the iceberg.  There could have been an entire ""Star Trek"" style series set in that universe.  For the parts written all the acting is sufficient, the cannon fodder acts at the level of characters that would be thrown away, the stars are clearly the stars, and there is some hierarchy in between.

I honestly don't know how much better they could have casted this, but I imagine if the character work in the script had been better, then maybe they could have drawn a couple of names.  There is a young Neil Patrick Harris, and Amy Smart, and Dina Myers was golden, but the other characters weren't exactly likable, and I can't figure out if it was the character writing or I just didn't like their faces.  I get Denise Richards was a big deal, but her nose makes me remember the Grinch blooper where Carey bites off the mayor's nose, and even in ""Wild Things"" I thought Neve Campbell could do better.

The large picture stuff is a good enough, and it's filled with enough action and well placed comedy that it'll get you through the movie.

It's fun, please don't take it seriously.  If i can do it then you can."

He lives every moment under the unblinking gaze of thousands of hidden TV cameras.",On the air. Unaware.,"Comedy, Drama",103,1998-06-04,en,8.147,19096,15.5082,"Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor","Peter Weir, Andrew Niccol","escape, paranoia, dystopia, suspicion, video surveillance, deception, hidden camera, simulated reality , television producer, tv show in film, make believe, actor, tv show, allegory of the cave","**""The Truman Show""** dares to question the reality. It's original, complex, and philosophical. It manages to make you feel truly frustrated and **claustrophobic**. 

Perhaps many of us can relate to Truman as we live in a time of routines. We often live our lives without giving a second thought to the simplicity and meaninglessness of life itself. Our limited perspectives keep us from seeing. The lies we are told keep us from the truth. If we could push the boundaries of our reality, what are the odds that we'd face what Truman faced in the end?

It was a joy to watch **""Jim Carrey""** as **""Truman""**, it is yet another proof that Jim isn't just a comedian. || Truman...One of my favourite films. It's just hilarious. The whole concept that this man thinks he is living in the real world.

Very well done to the Director and Writers! || On the surface, The Truman Show is about a man who has lived his life trapped inside of a bubble. He tries the entire movie to pop the bubble, and he eventually does.

Under that layer, though, is a complex theme. Does Truman really enjoy his cell? He seemed to for years. At the same time, he struggled with memories, but don't we all?

As the viewer, we're left to determine the morality of the happiness of millions versus the freedom of one. We're also left to consider whether Truman's cage was better than his freedom. A child born into a system that doesn't have a great track record or a life of relative safety with no knowledge of the cage.

The viewer also has to determine the sturdy nature of reality. What is reality besides our perception of it? What's real to Jim or to Bob? Are the things that are real to them real to me if I've never seen or heard about them?

Beyond the philosophical questions the movie poses, the film itself is solid. Jim Carrey pulls off the part wonderfully. He's more than just a comedian, although he can bring the humor the instant the scene needs it. The supporting cast fell right in line.

The pacing may be a little slow early on for many viewers, but that is remedied once the action begins to pick up.

If you want something light and silly, go watch something else by Carrey."

RELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, ""The Jackal” is an international crime thriller about a joint FBI/MVD mission (led by Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora) that enlists the aid of an imprisoned IRA combatant (Richard Gere) to stop a brutal master-of-disguise assassin known as The Jackal (Bruce Willis) from completing a big hit in Washington DC. This was a loose remake of the film “The Day of the Jackal” (1973), which was based on the 1971 novel by Frederick Forsyth.

The first act is too convoluted for my tastes as the story globetrots from Moscow to Helsinki to Canada to the USA. But the movie finds its footing and settles into an entertaining political action flick not far removed from the tone of “The Saint” with Val Kilmer, released the same year. Both films are from the same genre, have the same tone, were made for the same amount ($60 million), feature an antagonist who’s a master-of-disguise and are named after that person. While both movies made roughly the same in North America ($55-60 million), “The Jackal” proved more popular worldwide, making almost $160 million, which was $50 million more than “The Saint.” IMHO “The Jackal” is the more all-around entertaining picture.

Critics love to lambaste this movie because (1.) it deviates too much from the original film and (2.) because of the mounting nonsensical elements. But (1.) “The Jackal” was made to stand on its own in late 90’s cinema and (2.) why do other action thrillers like James Bond get a pass when it comes to ridiculous plot holes? Besides, many of the supposed nonsensical moments can easily be cleared up if you pay attention to the details; not all of them, of course, but many of them.

What I don’t like is the disingenuousness of many of the criticisms. For instance, Roger Ebert’s opening criticism of the film was to mock the way The Jackal sneaks into the USA from Canada by purchasing a sailboat and entering a race from Mackinaw to Chicago. Ebert reasoned that there are easier ways to enter the US inconspicuously along the 3000-mile border, but he left out an important detail: The Jackal was smuggling a huge computerized machine gun and its formidable mount. THAT is why he bought the yacht and used the race as a means to enter the country unnoticeably amidst a crowd of other crafts. Aduh.

One of the best aspects of this flick is the great cast and seeing them work together. Poitier was 69 during filming and looks very distinguished; this was incidentally his last theatrical release (although he appeared in four TV movies in the ensuing four years). Jack Black is effective in a peripheral role tailor-made for him.

But it’s Gere and Willis who steal the show, naturally. The latter is particularly entertaining in an almost shocking departure from his typical easy-going, friendly persona. As The Jackal, Willis is relaxed, carefree, cold, malicious, cunning, calculating, smart, icy and ruthless; a charming psychopath.

I shouldn't close without mentioning the excellent score by Carter Burwell mixed with an edgy alternative rock soundtrack, featuring cuts by Massive Attack (""Superpredators"" and ""Dissolved Girl"") and the like.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour, 4 minutes and was shot in Moscow, Finland, Montreal, London, the Carolinas, Virginia and Chicago. SCREENPLAY: Chuck Pfarrer.

GRADE: B-/C+ || This is one I've seen several times over the years and while certainly not great and it is funny hearing Richard Gere with an Irish accent and the numerous hair changes with Bruce Willis, I still find it watchable and somewhat entertaining.

That said, how the Jackal was written was a problem because while for most of the movie he's a cold-blooded and calculating character, his actions of going after Isabella was strange to do in the midst of planning an assassination versus going for revenge (which itself didn't make sense) after he completed his mission and got paid, and that's not to mention giving away his true target with a line about Declan unable to protect his women, though even then not sure how Declan came to that (albeit correct) conclusion. Probably just lazy script writing.

However, there are some cool shots (in the days when they used helicopters for aerial shots compared to using drones) and the direction from Michael Caton-Jones was solid. **3.0/5** || The Jackal is the kind of Thriller that does everything by the book. Most of the movie is comprised out of well-known and established tropes, it's got a packed cast and decent action scenes. It may not reinvent the wheel or keep you on your toes, but it does offer some solid 90's entertainment for about two hours."

Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the makers here basically stick safe to the formula of the series. This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M. Dwyer) takes the breath away. Yet come the final straight it loses its way, sinking into a mire of over confidence, topped by a crown of thorns involving an albino baby alien hybrid. Shame that. 6.5/10 || A pretty average movie, specially compared to the previous installments in the Alien franchise (even Alien 3). The plot sometimes gets very confusing and none of the characters are memorable. Some of them are even rather cartoonish. The movie seems like a cheat attempt at cash crab, by using a known franchise. I would recommend watching if you are a fan or are looking for a mediocre action/horror movie to watch with friends. || _**A combo of the first three with a couple fresh ideas**_

Two hundred years after Ripley’s death in the previous film (Sigourney Weaver), she wakes up as a clone in a space station, which also serves as a colossal vessel. Scientists there are experimenting with xenomorph/human eugenics to create, I guess, the ultimate living weapon. Meanwhile a ship of smugglers visits the station when (big surprise) the aliens escape captivity.  Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman play space pirates while Dominique Pinon and Michael Wincott are leaders at the station. Brad Dourif is on hand as a scientist.

""Alien Resurrection"" (1997) is the fourth film in the series and combines elements of the previous three while throwing in a couple of new things. The diverse cast is great but I started to get bored by the end of the first act. Thankfully, the movie perks up with an outstanding underwater sequence that recalls “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972), albeit more amped up.

The peripheral cast is highlighted by the voluptuous Kim Flowers as Hillard and the formidable Gary Dourdan as Christie. But you just know they’re the equivalent of red shirts in Star Trek.

If you’ve seen the first three entries, there’s no pressing reason to see this one. It has a been-there-done-that vibe. However, if you appreciate those films and want more of the same with a new cast, “Alien Resurrection” is well done for what it is, proficient sci-fi/horror. Armchair critics have been too hard on it. While it lacks the mystery of the first movie and the suspense & utter horror of the second, it has more pizazz than the relatively subdued third installment.

The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes.

A timely intervention from the US Navy rescued some of the crew, but then subjected the erstwhile cargo to an humiliating and debase battle for their ""ownership"". Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) takes up the cudgels on their behalf - at no small risk to himself, and with the assistance of former US President John Quincy Adams (Sir Anthony Hopkins) takes this principle all the way to the Supreme Court. It is most bizarre to watch this and even begin to contemplate a society in which the concept of one person, business, or nation claiming the possession of a human being is actually being discussed by rational people in a court of law, but here we have it. The film looks great, plenty of attention to the detail with the costumes and the sets but there is far too much incidental dialogue and the pace of the story seems more intent of delivering a story of epic length rather than meaningful drama. Sir Anthony delivers well in the last fifteen minutes with a most potent piece of oratory; this is probably the best effort we have yet seen from McConaughey and there are strong supporting roles from Sir Nigel Hawthorne (Van Buren); an impressive Djimon Hounsou - who has no English dialogue - as the leader of the incarcerated and Morgan Freeman also delivers well as he tries to facilitate the freedom and potential repatriation of these people back to modern day Sierra Leone. The moral and ethical issues here are writ large and presented in a well crafted, poignant and sometimes quite brutal fashion that make this a decent, if not great, film to watch."

""The Apostle"" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've matured. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios wouldn’t touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him (Farrah Fawcett) and more. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile to the backwaters of Louisiana. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his ""calling"" and ""anointing"" – to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers.

If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it – lively praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer – I suggest staying far away from ""The Apostle."" I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing depictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment.

Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy: A man of God who falls into adultery and, then, worse. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there are big differences between their transgressions.

""The Apostle"" is the best kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and interesting discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a ""man (or woman) after God's own heart"" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testament believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats? 

There's nothing like ""The Apostle"" in cinema. It's a unique and moving drama that gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless. There's just the right amount of ambiguity that keeps the viewer guessing and the movie open to interpretation.

The film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in Collin County & Denton County, Texas (both just north of Dallas) and Lafayette, Louisiana.

Of course, ""Harry"" is seeing a therapist (Robert Harper) and with just a day before his conferment, he realises that his entire shambolic life is a result of his inability to fall in love. He likes women, he likes sex but he doesn't really like commitment, wanting always to treat a relationship like something he can buy in, or return to, Walmart. That's the basis of this story of a flawed individual that using a series of statically directed sit-com style scenarios takes us thorough twenty-four hours in the manic life of the shallow and unlikeable individual. I have never really been a fan of Woody Allen and this did nothing to change that. Granted his writing is quick fired and his observations potent at times, but his sense of humour is just too crass for me. There's nothing at all subtle about it, no cleverness - and the opening scenes of this set a scene for what I thought became increasingly puerile and predictable. A sort of slickly-delivered linguistic slapstick. Vulgar can be fun, but not when it's got some pseudo-intellectual underpinning about cause and effect of an human behaviour that becomes more and more contrived to fit the narrative the auteur wants to deliver. Are the jump cuts just there to divert our attention from the dwindling characterisations and increasing soapy melodrama? He doesn't imbue his character with anything I could care about, and though I did think Judy Davis and a cast of many reliable faces did their best to shore it all up, in the end it's very appropriately titled - it just doesn't happen quite quickly enough."

At a social level he is headstrong, arrogant, likes getting into fights as well as ending up in police cells for his regular anti-social behaviour. 

Despite having friends, they are not shining beacons leading him into a better light. He is happy with his lot, shuns commitment and his best form of defence is attack both physically and verbally against those who want to impose their will on him for better or worse.

At the same university a professor of mathematics throws out a complex mathematical challenge to his students, asking them to complete the formula on a blackboard in the hall outside of his classroom. Will is cleaning floors one morning, comes across the blackboard and within seconds he has completed the formula before carrying on his duties while the professor wonders who it was!

It turns out Will was abused in his youth, and has moved on from one foster family to the next, but none of them were seemingly any better, and never reached out to his needs leaving him feeling bitter and angry.

A psychology professor (Robin Williams), spends various sessions with Will, and slowly, ever so slowly, Will begins to open up his darker side until both Will and the professor find a bond.

Make no mistake the premise is original but predictable. However, the acting performances are terrific, especially from Damon, whom I never really had much time for up until this film.

I was also impressed by the performance of Will's girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver. She soon fell in love with him, only to find that he never reciprocated and pushed her away just as had done to other people who tried to get too close to him in the past.

It is very much a feel-good film with a nice satisfying ending. It pulls at the heartstrings sometimes, but you just know everything will work out right in the end. || So great!

<em>'Good Will Hunting'</em> is a film I had heard many a great thing about but had never actually seen it so didn't know anything about the plot - so much so that I genuinely thought it was about the good will of hunting or something... and certainly not about a character named Will Hunting! The poster makes it look like a film of that sort, in my defence.

I also didn't realise, aside from the lead two, that the cast list was so stacked until the credits came up at the start. The names didn't let me down either, as the acting is superb across the board. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are truly outstanding together, I already rate them from other productions so I'm glad I can add another cracker to their respective filmographies.

Even away from Messrs Damon and Williams, you've got very good displays from the likes of Stellan Skarsgård, Minnie Driver (emotionally, particularly, excellent) and Ben Affleck. Pretty impressive that it was written by both Affleck and Damon too!

The plot is great, the way the friendship builds between Will (Damon) and Sean (Williams) is so beautifully done. Both characters are very interesting, even if I didn't buy the genius of Will at all at first but I quickly let that go as the film does such a grand job at crafting everything together around it.

In short, it's ace! Glad I finally checked it out. || ""Will"" (Matt Damon) is a rudderless character who works as a caretaker. He's an attitudinal pain in the neck whom, aside from his best friend ""Chuckie"" (Ben Affleck), is pretty much shunned by everyone. ""Professor Lambeau"" (Stellan Skarsgård) spots some potential in this wayward lad, especially when he realises that he has an amazing ability to solve mathematical problems. To that end he sends him to see the eccentric psychologist ""Sean"" (Robin Williams) who proves remarkably adept at cutting down the young man's defences and at beginning to rebuild the character of the man in a more positive and life-affirming fashion. The film combines some excellent performances from all four men, but especially a bang on-form Williams as the penetrative, but flawed, route to salvation for an equally flawed and angry almost younger version of himself in the genius ""Will"". Damon is entirely convincing as his temper and his prodigious nature are juggled adeptly and aided by a powerful script that allows the actors to take and keep centre stage as the potency of the plot becomes more and more focussed, we are presented here with a ground-breaking and thought-provoking look at what makes a great teacher as well as what makes a human being tick, what makes one happy and fulfilled - and what makes one the opposite! For my money, Gus Van Sant's finest interpretative work and well worth watching a few times, for more detail emerges to appreciate each time you see it."

This kid definitely isn't Macaulay Culkin, but Alex D. Linz was able to carry this movie, and he did it again in ""Max Keeble's Big Move"".

I'll be honest I re-watched this because ""Hot Ones"" mentioned Scarlett Johansson was in it, and I couldn't remember that.  She has a bit role, but even back then (possibly unrefined, the role didn't have a lot to work with) she was a big personality in a small role.  She has one, brief, powerful scene that would really be worth remembering: most of it is the messing up the burglars.

This has a very different vibe than the first 2 movies.  While Kevin was isolated and unable to get help, Alex starts by doing everything right to get help, but no one believes him so he feels forced to ""do the right thing"".  However it manifests in almost a psychotic fashion.

Of course, almost everything that happens in this movie should kill someone, but doesn't.  It also had a very easy out: at any time Alex could give the chip up, and it would be over, the bad guys leave the country: he's heavily volunteering for this carnage.  Kevin was being targeted, he saw their faces and was actually defending himself and his home because the ""wet bandits"" were coming for HIM.

Ultimately it's fun and charming, and interesting what the limits of technology were back in 1997 with cellphones and pagers, RC cars with block long range, but not wireless cameras, but remote control gizmos that can turn on the neighbors tv.

The biggest problem I have with it is that his brother's bird is basically as smart a person, having conversations, and taking bribes (or insisting on being paid at least), and the worst bit is that I know there are people with birds as smart as that.  I'm not sure if it would be a Conure, but I don't deal in parrots.

That said, it's not overly hilarious, it's not bad, but it's just not great either."

I was expecting something more mysterious and thrilling, but <em>'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'</em> manages to entertain nicely - despite a long run time, which I thought was going to hamper it but it didn't.

I'm just not buying into the bad rating for this film, in 1996 Wes Craven's Scream reinvigorated an ailing genre and got fans back into the horror groove. The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.

Sidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...

The film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.

This is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.

Scream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10 || So, moving along two years from the first carnage, ""Sidney"" (Neve Campbell) has moved into the Omega Beta Zeta frat house and is getting on with the her life. Well, that is what she hopes anyway but after a few minutes of this derivative and unimaginative sequel, we are back to square one when she learns on television that the grim reaper is back taking out fans at a sneak preview of ""Stab!"" - a film based on her first terrifying experiences. Then her friends start to drop, one by one - slasher style. Can she and reporter ""Gale Wethers"" (Courteney Cox) stay alive long enough to find out just who - or whom - is behind these ghastly crimes? I'm sorry, but this is just a straight and pretty shameless rip off of the first film. It's entirely devoid of menace or originality and the concluding twenty minutes are borderline farce. Wes Craven has a magic touch when it comes to gory action-horror films, but here he left it on the bathroom floor. This is just poor and repetitive and despite a competent cast just left me yawning after twenty minutes. Two hours is simply ninety minutes too long. I'm certain there will be a ""Scream 3"" - but I don't hold out high hopes. || **_Scream 2_ starts off strong with a fantastic first act, but slowly stumbles into mediocrity with a lackluster finale.**

The beginning of this film was exhilarating, it was so messed up seeing how infatuated people were with this real-life killer and their seeming lack of awareness that a woman was being brutally murdered in their presence. They crank up the gore from the original, leading me to believe that we were going to be in for a treat, but I was wrong. The first act was really strong, and I enjoyed the college campus setting with some exhilarating scenes in the sorority houses. But towards the end of the second act, the film starts to drag on, with too much down time spent on character development and lackluster chase scenes. I think the main killer’s motivation is pretty weak. They try to pull off a _Friday the 13th_-type reveal with Billy Loomis’s mom, but it just doesn't land. She abandoned her child before the first film, and all of a sudden, after he becomes a killer, she wants to get revenge on the victim? It just does not make sense. I did enjoy Mickey, as he was the only interesting new addition to the film. This story had a lot of potential, but I can't help but feel it was slightly wasted.

Our performances were mixed this time around. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox were fantastic; they are the true stars of the franchise, and their characters have such a nice arc here that I really appreciated, especially Cox. Jamie Kennedy was also great as the only character who truly realizes what is going on in this horror film, his commentary going forward will be missed. David Arquette was again pretty weak; I do think it mainly had to do with poor writing, as the crimpling walk he had to perform felt weird and in poor taste. Jerry O’Connell was corny and forgettable. Liev Schreiber’s character stinks. Timothy Olyphant was the only new addition that I genuinely enjoyed.

The direction from Wes Craven was still great overall, with some fantastic scenes, particularly in the sorority house, that I thoroughly enjoyed. This may be personal taste, but I still think this franchise can push the horror and gore more. I feel they are giving us a tease in every film of what they are truly capable of.

Overall, _Scream 2_ left a lot on the table for what could have been a really great sequel. It is still somewhat enjoyable, but it is hard to deny the massive step back it took from the original.

It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.

You jump - I jump.

Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.

Never let go.

So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10 || Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS ""Titanic"", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young ""Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy ""Rose"" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée ""Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother ""Ruth"" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, ""Rose"" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young ""Dawson"" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer ""Lovejoy"" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older ""Rose"" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television. || Awesome"

After a British warship is inexplicably destroyed in Chinese waters, the planet teeters on the brink of world war. Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) traces the rising pandemonium to a powerful media baron who manipulates vital data and news to his own diabolical ends (Jonathan Pryce). Teri Hatcher plays the industrialist’s wife while Michelle Yeoh is on hand as a Chinese agent with whom Bond teams up.  

""Tomorrow Never Dies"" (1997) is a competent enough Bond flick with loads of action highlighted by the opening terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border, a melee at a newspaper factory in Hamburg, an underwater investigation of a wreck near the South China Sea and a wild motorcycle chase in Saigon with 007 handcuffed to the Chinese agent. Hatcher is another highlight in one of the best “whoa, mama” moments in the franchise’s history, albeit brief. I also enjoyed the entertaining banter for the first two-thirds of the movie.   

Unfortunately, the picture lacks the colorful dynamic of pre-Brosnan installments, hampered by a muted grey pall throughout. Then there’s the eye-rolling sequence in a parking garage where Bond operates his BMW via remote control while lying in the back seat (Why Sure!). Plus the showdown on Carver's stealth ship in dark waters is curiously dull despite all the “exciting” thrills; in other words, it’s overkill action garbage.

Still, it’s a serviceable Bond flick; it’s just forgettable and the least of Brosnan’s 4-film stint. 

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Bayonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France
(Arms bazaar opening sequence); many locations in England; Hamburg, Germany; Thailand (standing in for Vietnam); and Rosarito, Baja California Norte, Mexico (naval scenes).

GRADE: B-/C+ || Pierce Brosnan wasn't my favourite James Bond by any means, but somehow I think that might be as much to do with the fact that he was given some really weak storylines to deliver. This one centres around megalomaniac media mogul ""Carver"" (Jonathan Pryce) who manages to engineer a deadly conflict between the Royal Navy and the Chinese military over a mis-directed destroyer. Next thing we know, ""007"" is drafted in to find out just what happened before the world finds itself facing an international conflagration that seems designed to ensure that ""Carver"" gets media rights in the hitherto unwilling China. They, too, are suspicious at the turn of events, so despatch their top agent ""Wai Lin"" (Michelle Yeoh) and together they must combine their resources to combat the menacing henchman ""Stamper"" (Götz Otto) and the quirkily engaging ""Dr. Kaufman"" (Vincent Schiavelli) whose film-stealing scene as the dapper, yet lethal, assassin does raise a smile. Teri Hatcher provides the short-lived love interest. An unremarkable actress at the best of times, she brings a little glamour but very little else to this frequently rather (contrived) dialogue-heavy enterprise. Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer renew their long established partnership for a few scenes, and Desmond Llewellyn gets a few extra ones which is nice to watch. Otherwise, this is just another fairly charm-free, factory produced instalment of a franchise that is struggling to make impact amongst an increasingly more competitive genre that is out-writing and out-impressing this tried looking series. || Solid second entry for Brosnan who still is charming. Not a great story but still timely with news and manipulation. Does make me appreciate the slower, more character driven nature of the Craig run, that this one was lacking, That said, Pryce made for a fun Bond villain. **3.5/5**"

David Brin himself defended the film, saying that the resolution of the battle between the Holnist/Survivalists and the postal carriers was good.

The boy was but two, but already there was a fear amongst these folks for whom time has largely stood still, that their neighbour has designs on their homeland. As the boy ages into youth, those threats manifest themselves more practically and by the end, the man has little choice but to embark on a perilous journey to safety in India. The actors are perfect for their roles - the three iterations of the principal character morph seamlessly together as he must learn to tread a very thin line and attain the level of political acuity necessary to deal with the disarming, but ruthless, Chairman Mao (Robert Lin).

It does take it's time, but it is a subtly delivered hypothesis, this. It suggests more than it imposes on history and that makes for a more complete film to enjoy. Sure it has a message, quite a few as it happens, but they are there for us to develop ourselves - Scorsese doesn't tell us what to think. He invites us. Deakins was nominated for an Oscar for this, and to appreciate that fully then do try to see it on a big screen. In any case, it's well worth a watch offering plenty of food for thought."

Heavily inspired by the 1970’s blaxploitation flicks, it tells the story of a stewardess, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who was pinned inside the cash-smuggling business as she’s tormented between two choices, becoming a cash-mule and in the end snitching her own boss or being smart by keeping the money for herself. It’s quite rare to see a film where the leading role is a female. Even though the plot relies quite much on Elmore Leonard’s novel Rum Punch, Tarantino really did great in giving his own personal touch to the existing materials by adding up a fine composition of clever dialogue, dark humor, and even the ultra violence in the forms of gun-battling badasses, drugs, and absolutely very graphic language, making it absolutely a typical Tarantino flick.

This film also possessed its own controversies that put Tarantino in the prosecuted seat because of his frequent use of the word “nigger”. This serious accusation was made by Spike Lee who furiously (while busy counting) noted that was used 38 times, excessively, throughout the film and he claimed that it’s an abuse and definitely an insult to black people. Apart from the above accusation, in my opinion, Jackie Brown, with its strong casts  from Pam Grier, Bridget Fonda, Robert Forester, and Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton and Robert De Niro really add up to the greatness of the film.  The way I see it, every cast here is given a complex set of character for us to study. Both De Niro and Keaton, despite their small roles, they remain favorable and memorable. || Booyah!

Coming as it did after critical darlings ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", it's perhaps not surprising that Quentin Tarantino's next film failed to - at the time - scale those giddy heights. Yet on reflection these days, when viewing Tarantino's career over twenty years later, it's one of his tightest works.

Working from master pulper Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"", Tarantino had a concrete base from which to build on, which he does with aplomb. Cleaving close to the spirit of Leonard, ""Jackie Brown"" is rich with glorious chatter, each conversation either pings with a biting hard ass edge, or alternatively deconstructing the vagaries of the human condition.

Oh for sure this is a talky pic, but nothing is ever twee or pointless, for it's a film that pays rich rewards to those prepared to fully grasp the characters on show, to be aware that all is building towards the final third. It's then here where the story brings about its stings, with a complex operation cloaked in double crosses and evasive captures, of violence and more...

There's a wonderful portion of the story that sees Tarantino play the same sequence out from different character perspectives, but this is not self indulgency. Tarantino reins himself in, not letting stylisations detract from the characters we are so heavily involved with. His other triumph is bringing Pam Grier and Robert Forster to the fore, who both deliver terrific performances. It's through these pair, with their deft characterisations, where Jackie Brown is most poignant and purposeful. 

Is it a case of ""Jackie Brown"" being undervalued in Tarantino's armoury? Perhaps it is? For it's ageless, holding up as a piece of intelligent work of note, and well worth revisiting by anyone who hasn't seen it since it was first released. 9/10 || Outstanding, no two ways about it.

<em>'Jackie Brown'</em> makes for a great watch, I personally found the pacing excellent; which is obviously important for a 2hr 30min+ production. The cast knock it out the park, while the story is riveting. It's worthy of the hype, one of Quentin Tarantino's best no doubt.

Pam Grier is fantastic as the titular character, Samuel L. Jackson is quality as well - the scenes that those two share are top notch. Robert Forster plays a much larger part than I was expecting at the beginning, which is only a massive plus as he gives a great performance. You also have the likes of Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker and Robert De Niro involved - I actually would've like to have seen De Niro used more meaningfully.

Not much more needs to be said, I'd only be repeating what everyone else has positively said about this. It's brilliant."

Everyone else on the cast is good too, amusing seeing Peter Stormare in a role like this - as opposed to one like John Abruzzi. Speaking of <em>'Prison Break'</em>, Jonathan Krantz is also in this!

The film starts like a house on the fire, I did find the rest of it - particularly the middle portion - a little (emphasis on 'little') less as the story is stretched out a tad, though all in all it gave me a good time and I'd happily rewatch it no doubt. || The “Dude” (Jeff Bridges) just wants to go through life drinking and bowling so is a bit narked when two thugs break into his apartment demanding cash!

He reckons she’s probably behind the crime herself, but agrees - for a fee, and recruits his loud mouthed mate “Walter” (John Goodman) to help out. That’s not all, though! It turns out that there’s yet another “Lebowski” and she’s his daughter “Maude” (Julianne Moore). She’s an energetically enigmatic, quite ruthless, woman who points out that the cash they are proposing to use is actually not her dad’s - and she needs it back. With the scene now set, the capers quickly escalate and no rug is safe! Bridges leads this ensemble cast really well here as the story lurches from one disastrous escapade to another, marrying some witty dialogue with some borderline slapstick and all held together via White Russians and the bowling alley. Moore is also on good form as is the less-is-more performance from an underused but amiable Steve Buscemi as the third wheel on their wagon “Donny”. The plot itself doesn’t really matter, it’s largely incidental to the engaging efforts of all except, maybe, for a Goodman whose constant expletives lose their potency quite quickly as his character becomes a bit too boorish.

For a film that’s about relationships, possessiveness and sex it’s a shockingly sterile exercise with JLM as wooden as picket fence and Nolte just not at all convincing as the sex magnet his aptly named character would have us believe. “Phyllis” is an erstwhile actress and is a classy woman too, so what she’d ever have seen in her scruffy philandering husband didn’t leap of the screen at me in the first place. The same could be said of the plausibility of the other marriage that’s unsurprisingly struggling here. Perhaps the scenario is supposed to engender empathy from those of us in marriages that have entered cruise control and that have no longer any flare in them, but I just couldn’t find anything about any of these people that I wanted to like, so I couldn’t really have cared less.

Initially, the original “3 Ninjas” stands out as a remarkable film, even though it may not have received the same critical acclaim as others. It exudes a fun 90s vibe that resonates with many viewers. The characters Rocky, Colt, and Tumtum are engaging, especially in their martial arts pursuits under the guidance of their grandfather, Tanaka. While the film lacks in-depth martial arts training, it still retains a nostalgic charm that endears it to audiences, making it a cult classic worth revisiting.

The sequel, while decent, faced challenges with the recasting of Rocky and Tumtum, disrupting the continuity of the original cast. Despite this, the replacements manage to maintain the film's fun and entertaining essence, although it falls short of its predecessor. The lack of martial arts development persists, but the presence of the grandfather adds continuity to the franchise.

The third installment attempted to reunite the original cast for a nostalgic touch, yet the decision to recast once again puzzled viewers. While incorporating Indian culture and indigenous heroes, the film comes across as cheesy and lacks re-watch value, except for the reunion of the original cast members, notably the grandfather.

The franchise's downfall came with the fourth film, a disastrous attempt featuring Hulk Hogan and a Pamela Anderson look-alike in a money-grabbing amusement park takeover plot. The casting of Tumtum was particularly egregious, leading to a lackluster performance. Rocky and Colt were relegated to side characters, detracting from the essence of the three ninjas. The film's shift towards a villain-centric narrative fighting the FBI was seen as the franchise's lowest point, contributing to its eventual demise and disappearance from the spotlight."

Welcome To Shell Beach. 

Dark City is directed by Alex Proyas who also co-writes the screenplay with Leon Dobbs and David S. Goyer. It stars Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien and Ian Richardson. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. 

A man wakes up in a grotty hotel bathroom and upon finding a dead girl in another room he realises he has no recollection of who he is or how he got there... 

There's a lot of Blade Runner fans still out there waiting for that film's sexual partner to happen along. What many of them don't realise is that Alex Proyas has already made that movie. More than a cult film yet still criminally ignored in certain circles, Dark City, by way of poor box office and studio interference, never got off to the best of starts. The problems were compounded with the release of The Matrix the following year, where that film's popularity, and its sci-fi linkage to Dark City, led many to think that Proyas' movie was a Matrix rip-off; pushing it further (unjustly) back in the sci-fi noir pantheon. Fact is is that Dark City homages much great cinema from previous years, but it has influenced much that followed, with Inception fans asked to note that Nolan himself was taking notes... 

Stolen Memories. 

Dark City is a feverish film noir dressed up in stunning sci-fi clothes. The amazing visuals have led many to state that it's a film with much style and little substance, something which Proyas has fiercely argued against; and he's right to do so, especially once his own preferred director's cut became available to view. The story is a complex one, pulsing with human characters living in a world where there is no daylight, with their respective memories scratchy to say the least, it quickly becomes evident that a creepy alien race are overseeing things. The aliens, wonderfully attired in black trench-coats and hats to match, and aided by Kiefer Sutherland's shifty - stammer affected - doctor, have special powers and their reasons for being here unfold in deftly constructed stages. One man stands in their way, John Murdoch (Sewell), but he is an olde noir amnesia sufferer supreme and his battle to unravel what is going on is our task as well. 

Do you think about the past much Mrs. Murdoch? 

The search for identity and the truth is what propels the picture forward. Murdoch in his confused state is not only at the center of an existential dilemma, he's also the focal point for a serial killer murder investigation. This also as he tries to come to terms with matters of the heart, it seems he has a beautiful wife (Connelly), and that she may have cheated on him? And why is he drawn to the place known as Shell Beach? A simple narrative hidden by visual splendours? Don't make me laugh! But hell you have to say the visual look and atmosphere of the design is very much attention grabbing. 

I have become the monster you were intended to be. 

With the film noir characters in place; Hurt's dour sleuth, Sewell's amnesiac and Connelly's sultry torch singer, Proyas brings German expressionism in abundance whilst overseeing an eye splintering neo-noir colour palette. Greens and reds often ping from the screen, while the murky browns and golds down on the angular city streets pave the way for changed perceptions and revelations of plotting. There are reoccurring motifs throughout, with swirls and circles integral to mood and meanings, while at the mid-point we then get to see Proyas' tricks of the trade, where the city shifts and moves to create a meeting of Metropolis and Gotham, all as the humans slumber away. Watch those clocks folks... 

You know how I was supposed to feel. That person isn't me... never was. You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human. Well, you're not going to find it... 

Acting performances are hardly top of the line (Sutherland especially irritates more than he impresses), but they actually don't need to be, and they all look terrific in their respective dressage. The story is of course bonkers and one which I myself found was much better whilst consuming mucho alcohol! (I watched it three times in 48 hours!) While Proyas himself is on record as saying it's a far from flawless picture. Again he is right, but he also knows that his film is still under valued and in need of more to seek out his director's cut. The late Roger Ebert championed Dark City with much gusto, and he provides very good input on the DVD, much like Roger I have to say, this is a unique and fabulous sci-fi noir experience. A film in fact fit to watch alongside Blade Runner; And I do not say that lightly. 9/10 || **_Atmospheric, dark mixture of film noir, comic book horror and sci-fi_** 

A man (Rufus Sewell) wakes up one night to great mysteries: There's a dead prostitute nearby that he gets blamed for murdering, but he can't remember much of anything. Several people seek him in the ensuing night hours of the big city: a somewhat mad doctor (Kiefer Sutherland), a detective (William Hurt), his estranged wife (Jennifer Connelly), an alluring woman of the night (Melissa George) and a group of pale bald males in black trench coats. He tries to piece together reality and escape the perpetually dark city.

Alex Proyas' ""Dark City"" (1998) takes place entirely on elaborate shadowy sets with CGI backgrounds, etc. The first time I tried to watch it I gave up after 20 minutes. But, if you're in the right mode, it's a cool sci-fi flick with elements of film noir and mystery/horror that is thought-provoking and never devolves into predictable blockbuster dreck.

The revelations at the end are well done. In addition, Sewell makes for a top-rate protagonist and William Hurt is effective. Many complain about Kiefer's offbeat performance, but the role called for it. If you don't like it blame the writers.

On the female front you have Jennifer Connelly when she was still curvy and ravishing (by the early 2000s she lost too much weight and thus her alluring appeal). Meanwhile Melissa George is gorgeous in her small role as a call girl.

My interest in ""Dark City"" was spurred by Roger Ebert's exuberant accolades. He was so impressed by the illusion of the vast scope of the city, which can be attributed to the well-done CGI backgrounds and accouterments beyond the immediate exemplary sets. Of course, this is no big deal today, but at the time it was still fairly new technology.

Some people compare ""Dark City"" to the more popular ""The Matrix"" and for good reason since they have similar themes and ""The Matrix"" was actually shot on some of the same sets, but that one came out over a year later in 1999. There are also similarities to ""Gattaca,"" which debuted 4.5 months earlier in late 1997.

""The Matrix"" went on to mega-success at the box office while ""Dark City"" floundered despite its brilliant bits. Why? For me, the characters needed fleshed-out more with increased human interest. There's some, for sure, but not enough. As such, audiences in general found the film odd, perplexing and uncompelling. However, sci-fi aficionados should eat it up.

It's superior to ""Gattaca,"" but not as as good as ""The Matrix.""

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and the Director's Cut 1 minute longer; it was shot on sets in Sydney, Australia.

GRADE: B-/B || Intriguing sci-fi

This is one of my favourite movies of a spate of movies dealing with philosophical themes. This group would include The Matrix (reviewed here by me), The Thirteenth Floor and Gattaca.

I saw this movie many years ago and it has stuck with me all this time. Don't be put off by my description of these movies as 'philosophical'-they are entertainment first and foremost.

The philosophical theme of this movie is, I suppose, the old chestnut of nature versus nurture. Is there an 'essence' to human identity? To use a different example than that in the movie...if Hitler as a young child was reared in religious orphanage or some such, would he have ended up a jolly good chap? Or was he a bad seed who would still give forth rotten fruit? I suppose the flip-side of that would be how the Pope would have fared had he been placed in Hitler's circumstances.

The movie deals with these kinds of themes in its own, intriguing way. I don't want to get into much more detail than this.

I did read a review of this movie in the Halliwell film guide, I think, and was surprised how low it scored. Not sure, but perhaps the reviewer was misguided into thinking this film lightweight when it is so much more than that. Again, Halliwell seemed to give many poor reviews for movies that I would consider masterpieces, especially Australian movies like Mad Max 2 and Bad Boy Bubby. American snobbery perhaps?

This is a terrific genre movie that should not be missed...along with the other movies that I mentioned above.

It's an intriguing story rooted in Aramaic mythology but applied to 20th century Philadelphia. ""Hobbes"" (Denzel Washington) is a detective who worked on the case of serial killer ""Edgar Reese"" that saw him captured and executed. Not long after this supposed closure, however, other - very similar - crimes start to occur and he and his partner ""Jonesy"" (John Goodman) are perplexed.

There is something mysterious afoot that can inhabit a body, move effortlessly and invisibly from one to another - and it seems to have ""Hobbes"" in it's sights. Desperate to shield his family from this evil, he must try to find a way to destroy it before it destroys him. It all takes too long to get going, and Goodman is not particularly well cast, but once we have the gist of the plot then Washington and director Gregory Hoblit turn in quite a well put together story, using the photography well to give us a perspective from our menace whilst effectively conveying the sense of nimble mobility this creature possesses as the resourceful ""Hobbes"" tries to combat it. Donald Sutherland pops up now and again, to no real purpose, indeed much of the supporting cast sort of blend into the wallpaper of this exercise that really plays to the strengths of an on-form Washington delivering a solid and interesting theme. It's too long, but still worth watching. || I generally have a distaste for movies where Denzel plays the smart cop/government agent/detective because he does it far too often, he seems to be typecast, and it's a waste of pro talent.  He's above playing the same sort of role over and over again.

But this is one of the exceptions.  He does an excellent job, but despite this, it's not Washington you remember.  You remember Elias Koteas and he's only in the film for a few short minutes.  It's remarkable that in a Denzel Washington movie, someone else steals the most memorable role, and it's even more rare that the role you remember has nearly the least amount of screen time.

So... it's already off to a good start, or at least a memorable one.  Those are two things that tend not to happen.

But then you have a William Holden noir style character monologue that is actually done right and adds more to the story's atmosphere than it really should.  You have a spooky plot, and on top of that you have some extremely well done and downright spooky scenes.

From start to finish it's just a well executed movie, a well acted movie, and one that deserves to be remembered a bit more than it is.

As in the first this one also tells two stories: of a hitman (Leon Lai Ming) that wants to detach from his activities and his partner, a woman that cleans his apartment while he is out, and have a secret love for him, while he meets another girl nicknamed blondie. 

The second one is from a ex-convict escaped from prison, Ho Chi-mo (Takeshi Kaneshiro) that is mute and works and lives with his father, also breaking into other works at night to sell their goods and services (here we have a meet with the Chungking Express with the first movie) and keeps finding another girl Charlie that lost his girlfriend for blondie), aside from a sequence that he meets another character from the first story in the end.

While having its themes along with Chungking, it differentiates from he first one by the use of cinematographer Christopher Doyle shooting mainly at night and using extreme wide-angle lenses, keeping the camera as close to the talents as possible to give a detached effect from the world around them, giving an wide-angle distortion of images creates an effect of distance-in-proximity, conveying the characters' solitude. 

The visuals are frantic, out-of-focus, and neon-lit. The camera also follows the characters and segments of B&W and heldcam camera also are used.

Another difference is the use of voice overs (as in thoughts) in the place of dialogues and pop songs this time mainly Cantonese versions of many musics, some of them also being ocidental (like the instrumental ""Speak My Language"" by American avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson and  Flying Pickets version of ""Only You"" by member Vince Clarke, while he was still with Depeche Mode).

To me a score of 8,7 out of 10,0 / A along side with the previous one a must to watch movie of an bygone era before the delivery of the city back to China in 97."

That very split average rating chart makes for interesting reading; suppose it's down to a mixture of Spice Girls fans, people who have nostalgia for the film itself and people who have little to no knowledge of them before viewing. I'm at the nostalgia level, I'd say.

I remember watching <em>'Spice World'</em> when I was very young and liking it, not sure to what degree but I certainly remember it. I undoubtedly enjoyed their music growing up, entirely truthfully... they did some bangers, don't @ me.

As for the film, which I probably haven't seen in 15+ years, I'll put it this way: Spice Girls as musicians: yes! Spice Girls as actresses: not quite. It's extremely cheesy and the acting is very subpar, but the likeability of Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton & Co. at least keeps it watchable; to me, anyway.

Richard E. Grant commits to his role, while they also got James Bond himself, Roger Moore, involved. There are also a number of cameos. Their music is entwined well, I wouldn't class myself as a fan but I rate a fair amount of their songs.

I can understand if you dislike this, I truly can, but I found it alright to be honest. I definitely wouldn't say it's anything good, or all that close, though. Fans of the group will love it, I presume."
9457.0,Deep Rising,"A group of heavily armed hijackers board a luxury ocean liner in the South Pacific Ocean to loot it, only to do battle with a series of large-sized, tentacled, man-eating sea creatures who have taken over the ship first.",Full scream ahead,"Adventure, Action, Horror, Science Fiction",106,1998-01-30,en,6.2,738,2.8561,"Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Anthony Heald, Kevin J.

A gang of modern day pirates board a luxurious ocean liner intent on looting it of everything. However, once on board the liner appears to be deserted, all traces of human life seemingly vanished into thin air. Apparently some strange sea creatures have run amok and the pirates themselves are now next on the menu! 

""Deep Rising"" doesn't have any delusion about what it wants to be, it was marketed as a raging ""B"" movie man versus beast gun fest, and that is exactly what it is - with tongue firmly in its bloody cheek. When the tag line reads ""Full Scream Ahead"" then you get the impression it's not a film to be remotely taken seriously. 

Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy""), ""Deep Rising"" is a blend of ""Alien"", ""Poseidon Adventure"" and ""Under Siege"", all built around the ""Ten Little Indians"" structure. Blood spurts and quips are dealt, and the film isn't found wanting in the good old ""it's behind you"" department. The cast give it the full gusto histrionics, Treat Williams, the sumptuous Famke Jansen (holding her own surrounded by hundreds of pounds of testosterone), Anthony Heald, Kevin J O'Connor, Wes Studi, Djimon Hounsou and, erm, Jason Flemyng also star. 

It's a mini riot out at sea, great great fun. 7/10 || _**Big-budget ‘B’ adventure/horror on the high seas, but too cartoonish**_

A band of ruthless hijackers seize the world’s richest cruise ship in the South China Sea, but no one’s on board. Something mysterious & terrifying from the great depths got there before them. Treat Williams and Kevin J. O'Connor play the protagonists who inadvertently transport the hijackers while Famke Janssen plays a survivor on the vessel. Meanwhile Anthony Heald is on board as the shady owner of the ship and Wes Studi plays one of the key thugs. 	 

“Deep Rising” (1998) is an action/horror that mixes “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972) with “Alien Resurrection” (1997), but encumbers it with camp and a creature that does wildly unbelievable things. While the monster is interesting in some respects, it’s actually not original. It’s a glaring rip-off of the Celestial Man’s true form revealed in the 1974 issue of Marvel Comics’ The Defenders #14.  

Nevertheless this is a fun, thrilling adventure if you can roll with the above hitches. The cast is diverse and spirited. Yet this doesn’t change that it’s basically a B-type of dumb adventure/horror flick. It just cost 30 times as much as the usual B sci-fi and bombed at the box office. Meanwhile the feminine department is limited to Famke Janssen and she never did much for me (but she’s a’right), although Una Damon has a small role.  

The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes.

GRADE: C || After being hired by the rather unsavoury ""Hanover"" (Wes Studi), Treat Williams finds himself embroiled in the at-sea hijacking of what appears to be a broken down luxury liner. Thing is - where have all the passengers gone? Turns out that the would-be looters are about to become the hunted in this actually quite enjoyable sea creature escapade. As with so many of the films in this genre, I wanted the multi-tentacled beastie to win - all the way along. The characters - even the ones we are supposed to like - are all pretty shallow and frankly deserved any sticky ending coming their way. It features plenty of action, fireworks, loads of implausible scenarios and the odd bit of gore before an ending that was very much as expected. It is sustained to an extent by some decent production values, and the end-to-end nature of the action makes it quite a watchable, if entirely forgettable, maritime monster movie with some wonderful audio that sounds like a serious case of indigestion."

So, it seems like it want's to be a tribute to the Blues in that way... but it doesn't come across as the same comedic love letter to the music as the original one did.

And of course John is gone and even though this was Akroyd's love child, it just feels wrong having John Goodman--or anyone else--in his place.

But on the other hand it does have Koko instead of Franklin and I always liked her more. But it was the cameo of all cameos wasn't it?

It's still lacking Buddy Guy and Magic Slim and Fats Domino and some of the other greats of Blues who where alive at the time and in their place is B.B King, who isn't bad in his own right, but doesn't doesn't at all like the line up they had in the original.

Oh, the Adam Sandler mullet. What a thing of beauty 🤣. The Wedding Singer marks the first Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore team-up, and it's a wonderfully goofy and fun film. Once again, Sandler's buddies come together to play some outrageous characters, making a simple plot all the more entertaining. Barrymore seems to innately understand how to fit into the ridiculous world of an Adam Sandler movie and slightly ground the film while bringing her charm and comedy. The Wedding Singer will put a smile on your face from start to finish as Sandler's Robbie Hart warms your heart and makes you laugh with his craziness when he flies off the handle. Like any Sandler movie, The Wedding Singer ultimately focuses on love, family, and friends above all, making it an endearing entry in the Adam Sandler catalog of wacky rom-coms. || This is a quite a jolly rom-com with Adam Sandler as a rather cheesy wedding singer (""Robbie"") engaged to ""Linda"" (Angela Featherstone). When things don't quite go to plan on his wedding day, he begins to develop a friendship with ""Julia"" (Drew Barrymore) who is herself engaged to the rather unpleasant ""Glenn Guglia"" (Matthew Glave). Using a cracking soundtrack from the 1980s, the film tells the story of the ups and downs of their burgeoning romance. Sandler is the nice guy here, and from the start he has the audience rooting for him; he's one of those folks who'd step into the path of a Chieftain tank to rescue a kitten; and his singing coach scenes with the elderly Ellen Dow (""Rosie') just make you want to take him home to your mother for ice cream and cookies.

I feel like I have a thing for the isolationism of deep sea bases.  ""Bioshock"", ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""The Meg"", ""Underwater"", ""The Abyss"": just the idea of being far away from any help in the most dangerous living conditions possible on the planet.

Add in a mysteriously time traveling alien sphere and let bake in the survival situation where people are losing their minds and things keep manifesting into existence.

It's a little insane, but it has a quality cast, plot, and some great action for all the characters being a bunch of nerds. || **_The power to actualize your thoughts and fears_**

A huge spacecraft at the bottom of the Pacific ocean with a strange, humming sphere found inside. A team of scientists are sent down to investigate – a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), a biochemist (Sharon Stone) and an astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber). Two notable characters at the station on the ocean floor are played by Peter Coyote and Queen Latifah. Mystery and (some) horror ensue.

Based on Michael Crichton's 1987 novel, ""Sphere"" (1998) intermixes elements of other scif-fi flicks, like ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""Solaris,"" ""Alien,"" ""Galaxy of Terror"" and ""The Abyss."" Like those movies, the plot involves a small group of people who are isolated from society and encounter the unknown. The theme is the actualization of one's thoughts and fears and the potential for good or, more likely, bad that comes with it. Are we mature enough as a species to handle such power?

Of course, we already have this power, just not to the degree depicted in the story (seemingly). Anything important that we do, whether productive or destructive, is formulated within first and then manifests without, like a song or a book or a loving relationship. If we truly knew the power at our disposal we'd hardly be able to sleep at night we'd be so excited!

The first hour or so is quite good because the film definitely makes you feel like you're at the bottom of the ocean. The mystery is engaging and the actors formidable. Unfortunately, some parts of the second half don't work so well, which destroys the illusion of the movie. As far as the ending goes, it features tricky material that's not easy to pull off. The fact that it's somewhat successful is largely due to having great actors.

Despite the murkiness of parts of the second half, the theme is great. This isn't a slasher film in space, like ""Alien,"" and refuses exploitive thrills, like ""Galaxy of Terror."" Rather, it shoots for well-acted drama and thought-provoking ideas. However, there are some harrowing aspects, like the jelly fish sequence.

While many lambaste ""Sphere,"" it wasn't the box office dog you might think in light of the bad press. It made $37 million (in 1998 dollars) in the USA alone, which is hardly a clunker. The problem was that it cost over twice that to make.

It runs 2 hours, 14 minutes.

GRADE: B-

QUESTIONS ON THE THEME (***Don't read further unless you've seen the film***)

Why is it that the dark side of the human subconscious is empowered by the alien technology/entity? Why not the positive side? The four scientists (and the others) strike me as quality souls who pretty much have it together. While not perfect human specimens, they're strong people who have their phobias and destructive emotions under control. So why aren't their GOOD, PRODUCTIVE thoughts/desires manifested rather than the bad? I could see if the story took place in a prison and the characters were pieces of sheet, but that's not the case.

Also, who or what does the sphere represent? The Fountain of Life (Psalm 36:9)?"

But after reuniting with his loyal and violence hungry gang, he finds the odds are very much stacked up against him. Not only has New York changed for the worse, being run by incompetent pretenders to his crown, but the police force are also after his head - dead or alive!

First time viewers to this picture should not go into it expecting some Scarface type gangster movie, I made that mistake almost 17 years ago and came out the cinema totally cheesed off! Revisiting the film now has opened up a whole new ream of delights that when put together have created a simmering and brutal piece of work. What director Abel Ferrara has managed to do here is portray a fable of how a leopard never changes its spots - even though it wants too. Frank White is here a victim of his own past doings, with his reputation on the wane and the authorities with long and unforgiving memories.

What hits the most (outside of some brilliant acting) is Abel Ferrara's bleak yet gorgeous vision of a sin city Big Apple, the characters are all one step away from a death, something that we the audience hope comes swift and nasty, all of which is cloaked in this plink plink lighted vision of the underworld. Ferrara chooses to pace his picture to give us a sense of pervading doom, it's quite a knack and means the viewers have to hang on in there to get to the wonderful, and dare I say it, bleakly appropriate conclusion.

Christopher Walken is Frank White and gives one of his best career performances, all scary eyes and dialogue spurting precision, he pours out grit and emotion to garner sympathy where he perhaps really shouldn't be getting it. Larry Fishburne, David Caruso, Victor Argo, Wesley Snipes, Janet Julian and Steve Buscemi fill out the cast list, with Fishburne and his manic Jimmy Jump character practically walking off with the movie. So all in all it's a visual delight and a story that is very good on the ears, with the violence perfectly harsh to flesh out the grim nature of this pot boiling crime picture.

So, those in need of a pick me up should probably steer well clear then. 8/10 || Incredibly acted and beautifully stylized. Really enjoyed this entry in the 90s crime era, one of the best in my opinion. || Shoulda loved it, didn't.

The violent nature of <em>'King of New York'</em> is its strongest element, though otherwise I found this to be unsatisfying. A lot happens but none of it really clicked for me, while I held very little interest in any of the characters - despite an exceptional cast list.

Christopher Walken, Laurence Fishburne, Wesley Snipes, Steve Buscemi and Giancarlo Esposito are all in there, yet none of their performances shone through to me to be honest. Walken is the obvious standout, though that's only via a process of elimination.

Gritty gangster flicks would usually be my thing, but for some reason this 1990 release disappointed me."

The cast are on screen, but they - especially Hackman - don't really seem to care. Their efforts are flat - not helped by an unremarkable screenplay and a plot that offers us nothing at all new. Indeed, one has to wonder what Paul Newman saw in it when he accepted the part. It's fairly clear to the audience who is pulling the strings and thereafter it's all just a procedural effort made watchable only by the charisma that is on the screen in spades.

Paul Newman, Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon were great and Newman's scenes with Hackman was some of the highlights. Also get to see Reese Witherspoon (and all her glory) and Liev Schreiber in supporting roles, along with James Garner who was always great even in a smaller role here. But the script and noir never quite clicked for me and the ending was a bit predictable, however at the very least this never dragged. **3.0/5**"

Released in 1998, “U.S. Marshals” is the sequel to the 1993 hit “The Fugitive.” Tommy Lee Jones returns as Federal Marshal Samuel Gerard. He & his team hunt down an escaped prisoner named Sheridan (Wesley Snipes) from wilderness regions to the streets of New York City. Robert Downey Jr. is on hand as a Defense Security Service agent who assists the marshals.

This sequel makes you realize just how well-done “The Fugitive” is. It features the same basic plot, but without most of the magic. The first act with the plane crash & swamp sequence is decent but it doesn’t hold a candle to bus crash/train wreck & dam sequence of the prior flick. Snipes is effective, but his character doesn’t evoke the sympathy of Kimble (Ford) because for most of the movie we don’t know if he’s innocent or not.

Nevertheless, if you’re in the mood for a movie cut from the same cloth as “The Fugitive,” “Enemy of the State” (1998) and “Con Air” (1997) then “U.S. Marshals” should fill the bill, but it’s the least of these. I’d put it on par with “Patriot Games” (1992) and “Money Train” (1995).

The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Tennessee (Reelfoot Lake), Kentucky (Benton), Illinois (Chicago, Bay City, West Vienna, Metropolis & Shawneetown) and New York City.

GRADE: B-/C+ || Hot on the heels of “Con Air” (1997) this time it’s Tommy Lee Jones who finds himself in charge of flying a load of dangerous villains. His “Sam” is charged with transporting “Sheridan” (Wesley Snipes), but when a bit of onboard fisticuffs results in a forced landing, his charge behaves in an altogether different fashion to that expected before skedaddling. Hot on his heels, our intrepid deputy marshal soon begins to suspect what we have already clocked - that something about this whole thing smells and that perhaps the fleeing felon isn’t exactly the criminal everyone assumed he was. With their cat and mouse game gathering pace amidst some pretty dense woodland, “Sam” realises strings are being pulled and trust soon becomes at a premium, especially with his new partner “Royce” (Robert Downey Jr.). The scenario helps it out a bit and both Jones and Snipes are proficient, but the story is just too join-the-dots and it’s relatively easy for us watching to deduce from quite early on what’s going on, and what’s bound to happen as the denouement edges closer. If you’ve seen “The Fugitive” from five years earlier, you might spot one or two similarities that really just render this little better than a vehicle for a star who is going through the motions. Passes the time, but that’s about it."

Sadly, though, the actors don't really gel - they are four men who seem to be vying for screen time as much as anything else; there is little evidence of a team on screen which rather belies the truth about why this gang were at all successful. It does move a long apace, though - there is plenty of gun action and some fun pyrotechnics as their antics gain momentum and their targets become bigger. Historically, the ending is quite interesting - and I think quite suitable, though I very much doubt the railroad saw it that way.

Hana-bi (AKA: Fireworks) is written and directed by Takeshi Kitano. It stars Kitano, Kayoko Kishimoto, Ren Osugi and Susumu Terajima. Music is by Joe Hisaishi and cinematography by Hideo Yamamoto.

Yoshikata Nishi (Kitano) is a loose cannon police detective who quits the force after a tragic incident results in his partner, Horibe (Osugi), being confined to a wheelchair. His retirement brings him the time to care more for his seriously ill wife Miyuki (Kishimoto). Nishi can find no peace, though, more so as he has borrowed money from the Yakuza to pay for his wife's needs, and they are growing impatient for the repayment...

Very early in Kitano's superb slice of Japanese neo-noir there is a piece of graffiti on the wall, it says ""Drop Dead"", while Hisaishi's music is a devilish accompaniment to the scene. It's ominous and foreboding, setting the tone for what is to follow. Pic is deliberately paced, beautifully so, with the opening nonlinear approach and scattergun shifts in time adding a sort of psychological maelstrom to the impending narrative darkness.

Yet to suggest it as a perpetually bleak picture is doing it a small disservice, for Kitano (himself working from a damaged psyche that occurred in real life) has this adroit eye for poetic beauty and human tenderness that marries up with bursts of violence and emotionally shattering passages of play. And it works brilliantly, with stabs of humour also filtering in via the outer frames. 

Nishi the character is a force of nature and a walking - brooding - contradiction, a man pained behind his sunglasses, his expressionless visage amazingly still saying so much. When he explodes the impact is doubly strong, mainly because dialogue is so sparse, but the interwoven visuals - very much a Kitano speciality - strike an almighty chord for the story. To which we edge towards the finale, which unsurprisingly brings beauty and infinite sadness.

Unfussy camera work, sabre sharp editing (Kitano & Yoshinori Oota), elegiacal musical arrangements, art, kites and Kitano's intense performance, this rounds out as film making greatness. In fact, a masterpiece. 10/10 || There's greatness in there, for sure, but <em>'Fireworks'</em> (or, the better title, <em>'Hana-bi'</em>) drags on for too long.

I was with it for the first 45-55 minutes, but the final portion of the film really dragged for me; aside from a few moments, it kinda just repeats the same sorta scenes over and over. Like, personally, I got it... needed a bit more to it, in my opinion.

There are some very good performances, no doubt. Takeshi Kitano is the obvious star of the show, though I was also impressed by Ren Osugi - who is just as excellent as the aforementioned writer, producer and director of this 1997 flick. The support cast are solid, while everything onscreen looks neat too.

I did like this overall, but I can't say it hit me as much as it evidently has for others. Worth a watch, either way. || You wouldn't want to be policeman ""Nishi"" (Takeshi Kitano). His young child died a few years earlier, his wife is terminally ill in hospital and his partner at work takes a bullet that renders him paraplegic. Unsurprisingly, he hits the skids a bit and his priorities become compromised. When his wife is told she can come home, he is determined to make that happen - but where will the money come from to facilitate her? Well he goes and borrows some money from some unsavoury types he has encountered in his career. With his sole raison d'être now being to spend as much time as he can with his ailing wife, some of his other decisions become more and more dubious and requiring of increasingly dangerous and violent action as his creditors demand repayment - in cash or in kind. This is really quite an effective mix of the romantic and the brutal. It illustrates the vulnerability of even the most robust of human beings when touched by tragedy and despair - and when that person is a cunning and capable killer, these risks for all become ever more exacerbated. There's not a great deal of dialogue here, it's mostly Kitano reacting to and dealing with the scenarios he faces trying to sustain that sense of stability and to deal with his crescendo of guilt and it's quite enthralling at times to watch. It does plod along a little at times, and can also be repetitive but it's a different style of dark drama that shows us an human side of someone not motivated by power, or money, or revenge."

This feels a little dated, given the more recent ""Lost in Space"" series, and given the original series it certainly feels like a very different angle.

The cast is great, but doesn't quite feel like it gels well, especially sense it is supposed to be (mostly) a family unit.  Mat LeBlanc actually surprises me by showing he has some action range,  a young Lacey Chabert comes off much more obnoxious than I  would have expected, and solid, if expected, performances from William Hurt, Heather Graham, and Gary Oldman.

There is just very little that goes beyond expectations.  Don't get me wrong there are some very interesting sequences and effects, but just nothing impressive I'm going to remember down the line.

In the end I had a good time, and I'd do it again, but I'd rather see a more modern or higher production version of this like ""Voyager"". || **_Thirty years after the TV show, Lost in Space debuts at the cinema_**

In 2058, Professor John Robinson (William Hurt) and his family (Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, Lacey Chabert, etc.) take a mission to travel to the nearest inhabitable planet to set-up a hypergate so humans can easily transport there. At the last minute, a hotshot flyboy is assigned to pilot the Jupiter II (Matt LeBlanc). Unfortunately, they’re forced to enact hyperdrive due to the interference of Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman), which flings them to an uncharted part of the galaxy.

“Lost in Space” (1998) is the serious movie version of the cheesy television series modeled after The Swiss Family Robinson that ran for three seasons from 1965-1968. The late 90’s sci-fi sets & costumes are great while there’s a lot of action and the movie respects the intelligence of the viewer. 

Although Hurt is relatively boring in the role of the Robinson patriarch, he’s respectfully stalwart, and I’m sure his role would’ve evolved in the planned three sequels, which never manifested because the film underperformed at the box office. I was never a fan of LeBlanc (or Friends), but he’s great here as the flying ace. Too bad he’s given really eye-rolling lines as he courts Judy (Graham) like a clueless Neanderthal.

Speaking of Heather, she looks great as usual while Chabert (Penny) was only 15 during filming. Too bad the director didn’t know how to shoot women.

I’ve heard critics complain about the drab, murky palette. Sure, the movie’s dark because it takes place in deep space but, otherwise, I found the colors nice ‘n’ bright.

I could do without the time-travel element, but it’s alright if you roll with it. And I liked the surprise Dr. Doom-ish character in the last act that turns out even worse. 

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot at Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles, with some scenes done at Red Rock Canyon State Park, which is 90 miles north.

Luckily, the initial in-your-face character establishment settles down and the somewhat preposterous plot takes over quite quickly.

He and his charge bond well - given the youngster has precious little salient dialogue; and it is action-packed enough to pass the two hours in a satisfactory way.

During one of his assignments he meets and becomes intrigued by a surgeon (Meg Ryan) and wonders what it would be like to be human. Andre Braugher is on hand as Seth's angel friend while Dennis Franz plays a human in whom Seth seems to have an affinity. Will Seth ""fall to the earth""?

I saw this when I was younger and it didn't have much of an impact, although I liked it. Viewing it at an older age definitely heightened my appreciation and shows that this is a movie for mature people (regardless of age). It skillfully touches on heavy issues of which younger people don't particularly dwell.

Based on the 1987 Euro film ""Wings of Desire,"" everything depends on if the film can convince the viewer that the angels are real and believable in the context of the story. It does so convincingly with a tone similar to ""Meet Joe Black,"" which was released the same year as ""City of Angels"" (later); and maybe 1990's ""Ghost."" If you like these two movies you will definitely appreciate ""City.""

I don't want to say anything more because it's better that you watch the movie and discover its potential riches for yourself. The script is well thought out, although they didn't milk the ending for all its potential, plus it seemed rather rushed, not to mention there are some glaring theological holes. Regardless, this is a nigh spiritual masterpeace. (No, I didn't misspell that).

The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, Malibu, Big Bear Lake, Lake Tahoe and the San Francisco Public Library, California.

The first half of the film is essentially about Mr. Badi's difficulties finding someone to carry out this small task, in spite of the substantial amount of money he's offering. He is initially mistaken as a homosexual cruising for sex, a misunderstanding that Kiarostami even ribaldly encourages through suggestive dialogue. A seminary student refuses to help him because suicide is a sin. I must say that I was very disappointed by these 40 minutes plus. Shooting so much of the film inside the car as Mr. Badi drives around is a waste of the possibilities of cinema. Furthermore, there is no real rapport between Mr. Badi and the various actors, as it was originally Kiarostami sitting in the passenger seat, and the dialogue of the men Mr. Badi picks up was only dubbed in later. The film does largely rely on amateur actors, as is common in Iranian productions from this era. Mr. Badi is played by the architect Homayoun Ershadi, and though Ershadi eventually established a film career, this was his first role.

The film does become stronger in the second half, when Kiarostami starts to move from the dusty and barren quarry to more lively scenery of inhabited Tehran, a clear metaphor for the joy and colour of life that Mr. Badi would be giving up if he went through with his plans. The film starts to be thought-provoking instead of merely awkward, and as a glance at discussion forums will show, the film does offer enough to keep cinephiles talking about it. Unfortunately, the ending that Kiarostami chose for the film (which I won't spoil here) feels to me like a cop-out, not to mention something that is already an old auteur trope by now.

If you like the Iranian Second Wave, then you'll probably find it worthwhile to see Ta'm-e gilas at least once. However, in spite of its winning of the Palme d'Or, I do not feel this is an especially great film."

So not only is hit man Marky Mark a door mat, everyone involved in the caper is a dumb-ass. Couple this with the movie going overboard trying to portray these dumb-asses as ""cool"" and ""edgy"" in the most horribly cringy (and at times super offensive) ways: this was terrible.

But it's executive produced by John Woo so the action scenes are great, right? No. The gun fights usually involved Wahlberg doing breakdance moves (remember, he's ""COOOOOL!"") while excessive wire work gets applied to anybody shot. This sounds like it could be cool, and there were some hilariously exaggerated shots (pun intended), but the editing of the action scenes was just really poorly done. 

They'd cut from shots of Mark spinning on the floor, shooting everywhere, to one of him flying through the air, possibly in a completely different room. A guy would get shot and fly TOWARDS the shooter or sideways. I swear there were guys that would fly through the air or through glass for no reason... just guys flying through the air I guess. And then there's the car chase... So many shots where a car rammed something, was obviously seriously damaged, only to have the car look completely unscathed a second later. 

Also, Wahlberg's hair color changes inexplicably and seemingly at random throughout the movie. From a reddish brown to an almost greyish/blondish brown to a dark brown. At first I thought it was the stunt double, but it happens in non-action scenes as well. Maybe it was the product he used for different scenes, maybe it was the lighting, but regardless it was weird. 

It doesn't lose that final star because we did have fun laughing/cringing at how absurd it all was. Looking up stats, this unbelievably doubled it's budget in revenue (seriously, W.T.F.!). It was also fun remembering how awful late 90s styles were, and oh god are some great styles on display here. There's really no need to see this movie though, it really is terrible. If you want to laugh AT a movie, there are so many better ones to choose from. || I'm beginning to think that nobody on this site has a sense of humor or a brain.

This movie is a good example of Warner Bros' desperate desire to be like Disney instead of doing their own thing when it comes to animation.  It even looks like they lifted a character directly out of ""Alice in Wonderland"", and maybe there was a legal loophole they had , but it was really unnecessary.

Honestly, most of the premise is a lot of nonsense, and I don't mean to dash dreams and lose the fancy of imaginative creation, but it's not even just fun.  They took one of the few popular free stories (King Arthur) that Disney hadn't monopolized (""Sword in the Stone"" only covers Arthur as a child, and this is after Camelot was realized), and then added so much magical guff to it that it was hardly recognizable as a version of the original story.  This is not a ""King Arthur and his Knights"" story, it's a Kayley, and you don't know who that is because they made her up.

Even Cary Elwes (Princess Bride: The Man in Black), by far the best actor /  character in the movie, seems to have impatient disdain for having to perform the role, and he's probably the 3rd most occurring character.

A knight that Arthur never would have made a knight, that the audience doesn't know, traitors the crown (when Lancelot did it, it was impactful) and kills a knight, that the audience doesn't know or care about, so the main character is launch into adventure on a basis that the audience objectively doesn't care about, and that adventure is further preluded with a Griffon dropping Excaliber into a cursed wood (which would have normally been represented by Merlin and/or the Woad), and having some magic would be fine, but they basically rip off the ""Fire Swamp"" from ""Princess Bride"" and add in all these questionably real people with weapons for hands.

This version of Godzilla is a difficult one to give a simple overall rating. Honestly, if Hollywood had just made this into a generic monster movie, kind of the way they did with Cloverfield, it would have easily been an above average movie, possibly even breaking into 4 star territory. The acting is above average (including the must-have flavor of the month, Jean Reno), the F/X are excellent for 1998 and the plot actually makes sense.

Nevertheless, the failure for this movie is that it was made by people not familiar with the franchise and/or what Godzilla means to his fanbase. Godzilla is to the people of Japan what Batman and Superman are to Americans, what Dr. Who and James Bond are to the British and what Shaft and the Black Panther are to the Black Community.

The demotion of Godzilla to that of nothing more than an over-sized animal working wholly upon instinct instead of the more humanistic level of intelligence that we in the fandom have come to know and expect was a slap in the face. Furthermore, the final scene where Godzilla is killed (a blasphemy only seen two other times in his 60 year history (Gojira (1954) and Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995), the later being the planned end to the franchise in its entirety) by only three F/18s and a total of 6 missiles when entire armies have done nothing more than irritate the King of Monsters was beyond belief. For those not familiar with Godzilla's accomplishments and reputation, imagine the outrage that would come from the respective communities if James Bond was taken out by a mall cop or Superman was killed by 3 six-year-old brats with baseball bats. Now you understand why Japanese movie-goers were storming the box-offices DEMANDING a full refund for this insult and why Toho quickly resurrected their dearly departed Kaiju less than one year later for probably one of the best movies in the entire franchise, Godzilla 1999 (Godzilla 2000 here in the United States).

All in all, as a monster movie, Godzilla gets 3.75 stars. However, for a Godzilla movie, it gets a 1 star rating. I'll cut the difference and meet them somewhere around the middle with a 2.5 star final score. || The hype was as big as the monster to start with! 

It felt like this take on Godzilla was advertised for 2 years in advance of the actual release, every time (it seemed) I went to the cinema I was awestruck by little teaser trailers, in fact the one of the old guy fishing and hooking Zilla is a personal favourite...SIZE DOES MATTER! Love it I do. Sadly as most of us now know, the film didn't meet fans and critics expectations at all, but was the film done down by the hype and an expectation of a masterpiece for the genre?.

Well it didn't help that is for sure, but taking aside that problem, the film only glimpses at what might have been. It has many great points that seem to have been forgotten, so sadly we are all too aware of the film's failings on the makers behalf. The build up in the film is excellent, the makers mount the tension in steady strokes, doing what all classic monster movie makers do, they have you waiting with gripping expectation of the creature by a series of scenarios and inventive dialogue. The sound is incredible, making it an essential viewing for those who cherish home surround cinema, while some of the shots and destruction of New York are well worth the viewers time.

But then? Well they throw the good work away by turning the film's focus away from the big lizard to a story line that was only fitting for the cartoon version of Godzooki. Thus rendering the film as a poor man's Jurassic Park, which quite frankly doesn't sit well. Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Hank Azaria all deserved better scripting, hell we all did!

It's not the evil stinker some would have you believe, it does have its moments of both good and bad, it is, by definition, very much a film split down the middle. 5/10 || I found this to be quite a fun take on the Godzilla fable. Matthew Broderick as ""the worm guy"" and Jean Reno as the French Secret agent deliver quite watchable performances as they investigate some radioactive shipping incidents and some really big footprints. The special effects are decent enough too and help carry this admittedly over-long little movie. Roland Emmerich & Dean Devlin are quite good at churning out these adventure films - never great, but usually they move along nicely and keep you entertained and the last half hour of this is actually quite fun to watch and on a big screen if you get the chance."

Instead they make it about a man with a midlife crisis who decides to speak ""the truth"" to the youth and minority cultures of America by rapping... because that, apparently is the only way to reach them.

Ultimately, he is reaching out to the minority community by talking down to them with the assumption that they won't understand it if he spoke to them like he would ""normal"" humans.

Which... is kind of telling of how that certain political group views the people they claim as their base.

I guess if you are Black, poor, it would come across as kind of offensive, another liberal politician talking down to you and claiming he understands you as he treats you like a child. And, I guess, if you're not a minority, it must be commendable and virtuous how much he talks down to diverse communities in an effort to speak their language.

Honestly, I never was a part of that whole ""Social Justice"" trip, I kind of looked at it as just a way for people to justify censorship by claiming outrage... but this is actually pretty offensive in it's assumptions of how to reach youth and minorities."

Don Roos known for television direction and script writing tries his hand at a theatrical film. The movie stars Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Ivan Sergei. Sixteen year old Dede Truitt (Ricci) is the opposite of sweet sixteen, politically incorrect and acid-tongued. When her stepfather passes away she runs away from home, and pays her half brother Bill (who is a gay teacher) a visit. Unaware that he has an alternative lifestyle, she meets his significant other, Matt (Sergei).

Dede takes a liking to Matt and seduces him into having sex with her, much to the dismay of Bill (Donovan) and Lucia Dalury (Kudrow), who is the sister of Bill's former boyfriend Tom who passed away. Dede then tells them she is pregnant and Matt is the father, the two elope and run away with Bill's safety deposit money and Tom's ashes. The chase begins, to add more tension Bill has to deal with Matt's other boyfriend. The grunge looking flamboyant Jason Bock (Johnny Galecki), who slanders Bill by falsely accusing him of molestation.

Bill at risk of losing his job, must track down Dede and Matt in order to clear his name. Meanwhile, Lucia who is a repressed old maid is disgusted by the thought of sex. With the help of a Carl Tippet (Lyle Lovett) they track down Dede and Matt only to discover that she has hooked up with Randy, a somewhat religious old friend of hers whose beliefs clash with Matt. The two then make a run for it, leaving Bill, Matt and Lucia concerned about Dede's well-being. Meanwhile, Bill is hounded by the media and tabloids thanks to Jason's false accusation much to the frustration of Lucia.

With the help of law enforcement they are able to track down Dede and Randy at a motel. Dede angry that Randy is wasting her money coldly breaks up with him, causing him to be physically abusive. They get into an altercation which ends with Dede and Randy fighting on the bed and her firearm going off. Matt then arrives to the motel and after Dede tells him she accidentally killed Randy they flee. With no other choice other than to stay at the motel Lucia and Bill check-in. Bill and Lucia then have a falling out after learning that Tom's AIDS was the result of gay sex.

Just then Carl arrives at Lucia's room, and both find themselves in the heat of the moment. Lucia finally is able to get over her disgust of sexuality, but is unable to leave Bill alone. Bill learns he is suspended without pay, and is later surprised by Jason who has a message for him. Bill frustrated with the events and Jason's false accusation painfully forces him to reveal the location of Dede and Matt. Upon learning that Matt and Dede are in Canada, Bill and Lucia are able to track them down.

Dede frustrated that Jason told Bill where they were located then goes into labor. It is then that Bill, Lucia, Dede, Matt and Jason must all put their differences aside and help Dede in her time of need. Dede gives birth to a healthy baby boy, but then shows signs of postpartum hemorrhaging. The others are relived to learn that Dede and the baby are okay. Dede and Matt are then brought back to answer questions about their actions. Dede ends up doing time in jail for Randy's death, but a lack of evidence and Randy's corrupt religious beliefs play in her favor.

Lucia then discovers she is pregnant and gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Matt and Bill go their separate ways and Bill ends up dating Dede's parole officer. Deciding her baby will be happy with her brother she gives him full custody. Dede then realizes that she never wanted to get involved with sex, because of its consequences (disease, pregnancy and worst of all relationships). The movie ends with Dede stating that she was a changed person after that summer.

While not a financial success, despite being produced on a reasonable budget  and being produced by a studio that was running into financial issues the movie does manage to get a few good laughs out of its audience. Christina Ricci proves her versatility in the transition from kid-friendly films to more adult fare. Her portrayal of the acid-tongued Dede Truitt is wickedly delightful. Lisa Kudrow's Lucia is our opposite to the happy somewhat cheerful Phoebe Buffay, as the acid-tongued spinster who is sexually repressed she sells this role. Martin Donovan, Ivan Sergei and Johnny Galecki are all charming as well. 


If you like satirical films and can laugh at human sexuality, then I highly recommend this film. Sony Pictures Classics was generous enough to take over this film after Rysher Entertainment gave it up due to financial woes. The company may not have been able to top major studios but it certainly went out with a bang thanks to this film. Alright, I think you've seen enough now go watch the film."

Excellent performances, with interesting twists on the original film, and compelling direction by THE FUGITIVE‘s Andrew Davis highlight this intriguing suspense film. The film isn’t without it’s flaws, as you may find it difficult to resolve the fact that you’ll probably wind up rooting for the murderous Douglas not only due to his usually being the good guy in his films but because the lovers are severely flawed characters most will think deserving of getting offed, especially the lame-ass Mortensen as Paltrow’s love interest. With PSYCHO and REAR WINDOW also being made this year, I am left with mixed feelings about this latest trend. On the one hand, these remakes speak to the fact of Hitchcock’s timeless themes in his films, while on the other hand it points out that Hollywood has perhaps run out of ideas when even a remake of a middling Hitchcock film is one of the better thrillers to come out in recent years. || You should thank me.

A small-plane pilot (Harrison Ford) is stranded on a remote Pacific island with a New York magazine editor (Anne Heche). Not only do they have to survive and find a way back to civilization, but they encounter other mortal dangers. David Schwimmer plays the woman's fiancé while Jacqueline Obradors is on hand as the dalliance of the pilot.

""Six Days Seven Nights"" (1998) is a lost-on-a-deserted-island adventure/romance sometimes compared to ""The African Queen"" (1951) for obvious reasons, but ""Six Days"" seems more farcical. There's also a little ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965) added to the mix. 

Harrison is charismatic as the stalwart, but slightly alcoholic loner/pilot while Heche is intelligent and likable. Unfortunately, some of their bickering comes across forced in an eye-rolling way, but the movie makes up for it with a surprisingly potent dramatic scene near the end. Beyond that, the movie is quick-paced comic book fluff that never gets boring, but also never goes deep or realistic enough for my tastes. Nevertheless, I'm a sucker for stranded-on-deserted-island flicks.

The contrast between Heche and Obradors' characters is interesting: Robin (Heche) is attractive in an intelligent plain-Jane kind of way while Angelica (Obradors) is alluring in a bodacious cutie manner. The fact that the latter is air-headed and morally dubious removes her from the realm of possibilities, as far as a lifelong soulmate goes. She's babelicious, though, and the movie tastefully shows it.

The film is short and sweet at 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot at Kaua'i, Hawaii. The locations are spectacular.

GRADE: B || Six Days, Seven Nights is an easygoing adventure rom-com that benefits from its tropical setting, solid production, and the natural charm of Harrison Ford and Anne Heche. Their chemistry keeps things entertaining, and the film has a breezy, energetic feel that makes it watchable. The cinematography captures the island beautifully, and the music complements the lighthearted tone. It is the kind of movie that is easy to sit through, with enough fun moments to keep it from feeling dull.

The biggest drawback is the predictability of the story. The plot follows a formula so closely that there is little room for surprises or creativity. Comedy and serious moments don’t always blend well, making some scenes feel unintentionally awkward. It never fully commits to being an adventure, romance, or comedy, which leaves it feeling a bit weightless. That said, if you go in just looking for a simple, visually appealing adventure with likable leads, it does the job well enough."

There's a lot to enjoy about this film, it's not without a few less entertaining parts but overall it's one that many will like. The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.

Ming-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the <em>'Shrek'</em> franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.

Animation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.

I do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable. || If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @

2020 brings us yet another Disney's live-action remake. After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short.

This is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming.

As with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith's music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney's best animated flicks ever.

However, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I'm genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it's hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan's (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father's spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules.

Ming-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula.

Now, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I'm sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don't think ""oh, that's Mushu"". I think ""that's Eddie Murphy"". It's a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney's trademark humor, so the tone's balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he's the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny.

All in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character's arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one's self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can't complain too much. It's a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.

Rating: A- || Disney heads East for this fantasy adventure, this time based on an ancient myth from Imperial Chinese folklore. The Hun hordes are attacking the ancient kingdom and the Emperor must rally every troop he can to defend the nation. His riders travel far and wide calling upon all his men to join the army. They arrive at the home of ""Mulan"" and rather then send her ageing father, she decides to impersonate a boy and go join the fight. There is plenty of action in this much darker animation; the evil ""Shan-Yu' has devilish, piercing eyes and the use of darker colours and hues - alongside heavy drum-based themes from Jerry Goldsmith goes some way to project a decent sense of menace on the latter half of the film. ""Mulan"" herself, though spending half of the film pretending, turns out to be a feisty heroine easily the match of her male counterparts. So, why only 3/5 - well: Eddie Murphy drove me mad. ""Mushu"" was as irritating as he was noisy; a hammer to crack a nut - so overblown as to largely ruin the film for me."

When the students & staff of a girl’s school outside Melbourne take an outing to Hanging Rock on Valentine’s Day in 1900, three girls and a teacher mysteriously go missing. What happened to them?  

Directed by Peter Weir and based on the 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, “Picnic at Hanging Rock” (1975) is an artsy psychological mystery that seems timeless. The style is akin to movies like “Days of Heaven” (1978), “The Secret Garden” (1993) and “The Virgin Suicides” (1999). If you like those movies you’ll appreciate this one. While not as compelling as Weir’s future “Dead Poets Society” (1989), there are some obvious parallels. Both movies deal with prep schools that represent the curious constraints of civilization; you play the game to survive and the only way to escape is through some kind of exile.

The first act is artistic, but rather dull with an increasing sense of foreboding. Things pick up during the haunting outing at Hanging Rock. Once the females go missing the movie becomes compelling because the viewer WANTS to know what happened. The fun of the movie is to speculate on the clues and come to a probable conclusion, as well as look for symbolic meaning.

I should add that I own the “The Secret of Hanging Rock,” published in 1987, which contains Lindsay’s supposedly missing 18th chapter. I strongly believe this was a scam by the publisher to sell more books after the author’s death due to the increasing interest in the story via the movie’s international success. There is zero factual evidence of this apocryphal 'last chapter' containing the 'explanation' to the original book. Lindsay had repeatedly stated that she did NOT write any solution and purposefully left the story a mystery, fiercely advocating the open-endedness of her tale. It doesn’t help that this curiously brief ‘last chapter’ doesn’t fit the style & content of the original novel; it’s awkwardly blunt with its peculiar ‘explanation.’ Still, it is ONE of the possible answers and certainly adds to the interesting mystery.

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, with another version running about 8 minutes longer. It was shot at Hanging Rock in the state of Victoria, about a 50-minute drive northwest of Melbourne in southeast Australia; the Appleyard College sequences were shot at Martindale Hall near Mintaro in South Australia, about a 7-hour drive northwest of Hanging Rock. Other scenes were shot in the studio at Adelaide, which is about an hour drive south of Martindale Hall.

His latest period of incarceration, however, introduces him to millionaire fraudster ""Dick"" (Albert Brooks) who is being ripped off for protection and in-prison luxuries by ""Miller"" (Don Cheadle). They vie, for a while, over this lucrative gent before deciding that the best plan is to join forces to relieve him of his reputed $5m in uncut diamonds hidden at one of his many properties. With the determined ""Sisco"" in pursuit, off they set on this quite entertaining quest with plenty of duplicity and the odd thwacking before an ending that is distinctly fishy. Of course there is some romance - ""Sisco"" and ""Foley"" certainly spark, and aside from the on-form Cheadle, Ving Rhames and the always slightly quirky Steve Zahn provide much added value as this otherwise procedural story moves along. It's far too long. At over two hours, the film struggles to sustain itself for periods at the start; it takes it's own sweet time to build up an head of steam, but once it gets going it has a genial charm to it and Clooney holds it together with a glint in his eye and his tongue in his cheek. Forgettable, but fun. || Not a favorite of mine amongst Soderbergh's works (I'd rank Ocean's Eleven and Traffic above this) but still highly entertaining crime-romance-comedy with Clooney and Lopez sharing some wonderful chemistry.

An angry sad sack (Vincent Gallo) is released after five years in prison near Buffalo and proceeds to kidnap a cute girl at a ballet studio (Christina Ricci). She surprisingly agrees to go along with the charade of being his wife to fool his nutty parents. His sole ambition seems to be to kill a field goal kicker for the Bills who let him down five years earlier. Anjelica Huston, Mickey Rourke, Jan-Michael Vincent and Rosanna Arquette have brief roles.

“Buffalo ’66” (1998) is an offbeat indie written & directed by its star, Gallo. I only know him from Coppola’s “Tetro” (2009) where he proved to have an almost Brando-like charisma (I said “almost”). Ricci is one of the highlights here as she’s petite, voluptuous and adorable. Unfortunately, most of the episodes in the story could’ve been cut by one-third or even one-half. As it is, they become tedious, such as the loong segment at the parent’s house. But the final act wins the day with Yes’ “Heart of the Sunrise” placed strategically and a profound moral about the power of uncompromising love to change a piece of sheet.

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes and was shot in Buffalo, New York, and surround areas (Gowanda, Lackawanna and Woodlawn).

GRADE: C+/B- || ""Billy"" (Vincent Gallo) gets let out of prison and promises to bring his new wife to meet his mother. An hasty promise for two reasons. First - well, he hasn't actually got a wife and second - he is desperate to pee. Intent on sorting out the latter problem, he encounters ""Layla"" (Christina Ricci) whom he promptly thinks can solve his other problem, so he frog marches her to her car and hopes that she - by now at gunpoint - will agree to help him out. Risky strategy, that! Can it work out for him? Well what now follows is an entertainingly quirky road movie that sees the two gradually bond whilst we learn about both of their rather complicated pasts. It's not just his mother (Angelica Huston) that he wants to visit; he also has a score to settle with a bookie (Mickey Rourke) but maybe, just maybe, his new companion might adjust his priorities? This is a well paced, intimate movie and there is a good, almost magnetic, dynamic between Gallo and Ricci. The story is lively and engaging offering us an offbeat love story that is, though maybe a touch predictable, based more on two characterful performances rather than cheesy sentiment (of which there is none!) and gooey love scenes as they head for their own kind of redemption. Coffee and doughnuts anyone?"
95.0,Armageddon,"When an asteroid threatens to collide with Earth, NASA honcho Dan Truman determines the only way to stop it is to drill into its surface and detonate a nuclear bomb.

An asteroid the size of Texas is heading towards Earth, the consequence if it hits is a global killer, the end of mankind.

Enter Harry Stamper and his rough and rugged crew of deep core drillers. Can NASA get these men up on the asteroid and do the job? The fate of mankind rests with a bunch of odd balls!

Perhaps because I have a particular kink for the disaster picture, I find it hard to understand the hate for Armageddon. I am after all a man who gleefully defends The Towering Inferno et al with staunch defiance. Armageddon does exactly what was expected from it, ridiculous high octane entertainment with laughs, peril and obligatory chest thumping bravado. All of course cloaked in director Michael Bay's gleeful insistence on blowing things up with devilish panache. Sure there are some twee moments, sure there is some less than great acting on show, but you know what? It's a disaster picture for Michael Bay's crying out loud sake! Check the brain at the door, turn the sound and colour systems up, enjoy the effects on offer and singalong to Aeromith's smashing, ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"".

Armageddon, does exactly what it says on the cover, don't take it so serious folks. 8/10 || Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

This has a great premise and stacked cast which is incredibly well balanced not only between the ""diggers"", but the control crew and the astronauts as well.  While they take that opportunity use the characters to really build the world, the story really just boils down to ""meteor going to kill earth"" and ""guy and girl connection, but girl's daddy doesn't like"".  Surprisingly the latter takes up a significant amount of time in the movie, but everyone gets their moment in the spotlight.  Steve Buscemi definitely has some of the most memorable moments in the movie.

This is the first movie I can think of that has this sort of detail of space travel, let alone tried to simulate the hellish landscape of an asteroid.  It really feels like they put the production value into not only to making the movie look good but getting the details right.

This is a ""I laughed, I cried"" sort of movie, and while I don't think it does any one thing especially well, it definitely delivers a solidly good experience. || This starts off quite entertaingly as ""Stamper"" (Bruce Willis) discovers that his daughter ""Grace"" (Liv Tyler) has been having a romance with one of his employees ""AJ"" (Ben Affleck) and so chases him around a drilling establishment taking pot shots at him with a shotgun. Sadly, though, this silliness is soon replaced by a greater one as we discover a great meteor is heading our way and ""Stamper"" and his team might be the only hope for mankind. Egged on by ""Truman"" (Billy Bob Thornton) they must quickly learn to be astronauts, then by way of a Russian space station, head into space to plant a gazillion ton nuclear bomb on the thing so it will split up and harmlessly pass us by. This is probably Willis at the top of his game, lively and mischievous and Affleck was at his most eye-catching, but the rest of this just just fits nicely into the well trodden sphere of sci-fi disaster movie. The visual effects are fine, but the dialogue is pretty pedestrian and the ending has a cheesy sentimentality to it that made my eyes roll. It is far, far too long. We spend at least an hour faffing about on the preamble, establishing the characters and when finally lift off comes, I was not entirely convinced the meteor wasn't welcome. There is quite a fun contribution from cosmonaut ""Andropov"" (Peter Stormare) who knows just how to fix high-spec technology, but otherwise this is all just a rather colourful vehicle for the star that is enjoyable enough, eventually, but really nothing to phone home about."

This is one of those movies that, without a doubt, is bad. More than just being bad, it is an object of study for any apprentice filmmaker, because almost everything that could go wrong actually went wrong.

The problems begin with Ed Wood's utterly incompetent direction. My cat is the best movie director. Inattentive, careless and incapable, Wood simply lets everyone else do their jobs at their own risk. Wood doesn't seem to be concerned with any question of continuity (days and nights seem to happen at random, props appear and disappear several times), he allows us to calmly see the filming material (cameras, microphones, light equipment, etc.) until the cardboard headstones in his cemetery fall, so obviously fake it's incredible they were used in a movie. And I'd rather not mention the flying saucers, which are obviously children's toys hanging from transparent threads, probably maneuvered by fishing rods!

The script is, of course, another problem, giving us one of the most fanciful and clearly false stories that science fiction has ever seen: unpleasantly mixing vampires, undead and aliens, we feel that we just need to find Tarzan, Donald Duck, two or three cowboys and a family from Minnesota on vacation, having a barbecue in the cemetery. The imagination is the limit! And the dialogue? The film is an unstoppable source of jokes and memorable phrases, the result of the childish and idiotic way in which everything was written.

The cast brings together a series of names well known to most of the public, not because they are good actors, but because they have played important and notable roles at certain moments. This is the case of Maila Nurmi, the eternal Vampira, who doesn't say a single word and does little more than stare at us and the other characters. Even without opening his mouth to utter a sound, this is undoubtedly one of the most iconic films of this actress, in one of the most remarkable “personas” of her career. The friendly Tor Johnson is also here, with his unmistakable look that made him a striking figure in the cheap horror movies of this era. Bela Lugosi had his last film appearance in this film. Invariably wrapped in his aristocratic vampire cape, which immortalized him and in which he would later be buried, he died during filming, having been very skillfully replaced by another man, who hides his face with the cape so that it is not so evident that they are two different people."

Stiller and Diaz are the main characters. It's a bit of romance, allegedly, but if you're looking for inspiration or chemistry or charm, forget it.
Still, there's nothing wrong with the story. It's just dull. The guy goes on a bit of an odyssey, and the only funny part of the movie is a bit where he stumbles at a rest stop where the police turn on their lights and see a hoard of men engaging in sexual activity with each other.

""All Quiet on the Western Front is, by far, one of the best films of 2022! An emotionally powerful anti-war epic that portrays WWI in a cruel, merciless, disturbing, truly traumatic manner through the gradually more sensitive eyes of a German soldier.

A two-and-a-half-hour tense, brutal, extremely captivating runtime, primarily due to one of the most astonishing cinematographies in recent years - Roger Deakins would be proud of James Friend's masterful work, which deserved the big screen treatment. Equally impactful score (Volker Bertelmann). Hypnotizing performances.

I tend to avoid over-the-top reactions, but after observing countless lists with movies from the genre, it's challenging to find many that are superior to this brilliant adaptation by Edward Berger.

From now on they'll spell mutiny with my name.

A tyrannical ships captain takes his reluctant crew on a two-year voyage that will change British maritime law forever...

Directed by Frank Lloyd and starring Charles Laughton, Clark Gable and Franchot Tone, this 1935 version of the often filmed tale of the ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (book by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall) is the template by which other adaptations would come to be judged.

We are in safe hands from the off due to the casting of Laughton as the strutting evil peacock that is Captain Bligh, and Gable as Fletcher Christian, the handsome hero who decides enough of tyranny and raises a sailor army to usurp the tyrannical Bligh. The pic positively thrives on the characterisations, instead of giving over to fanciful sea faring shenanigans, it's more concerned with the principal players and the conflicts that said characters partake in.

Based upon an actual real life instance, there's a realism factor on show as the sailors of The Bounty deal with the harsh realities of sea voyage in the 1700's, this before their captain thinks nothing of flogging an already dead shipmate!. We witness the best and worst of men at sea, this be a time where loyalty and harsh discipline were in turn expected and meted out as a course of nature.

It's a tragic tale, though it's a little let down in the mid-section when the ship gets to Tahiti and it's all jolification and frivolity, which belies the harsh nature of the core beast. Yet once Laughton and Gable square up against each other, we are in the presence of greatness, mortal enemies are born and they take us to a finale that asks us the audience if it is indeed justified? 9/10 || A really outstanding adaptation of this story of the tyrannical behaviour of the Royal Navy Captain Bligh (Charles Laughton) who was tasked with sailing round the world to procure breadfruit trees as cheap fodder for slaves in the Caribbean and in so doing brutalises his ill fed and thirsty crew to the point of mutiny lead by Lieutenant Christian (a very dashing Clark Gable). I found Franchot Tone a rather good looking but wooden ""Byam"" and Gable's accent is probably best to be glossed over but the production standards, and excellent maritime photography are proof positive of what could be done without computer animation. There is a rousing score from Herbert Stothard and a great supporting cast of professionals - especially Ian Wolfe's efforts as the odious ship's clerk ""Maggs"" and Herbert Mundin's rather hapless ""Smith"" - giving this story added depth, a soupçon of humour and lots of style as they battle the hostilities of the sea and the inhumanities of a brute. It's history, so not too much room for jeopardy with the narrative, but Laughton proves to be entirely convincing as a man never to be crossed."

France was still finding it's political feet with the second empire giving way to the third republic, the Germans were across the border heavily armed and the French military under considerable pressure to keep their country safe. It was this last point that led to the infamous ""Dreyfus"" affair. The High Command essentially framing a young officer (Joseph Schildkraut) for treason and banishing him to the aptly named Devil's Island. There's some disquiet about this process in Paris and Zola (Paul Muni) decides that only he has the profile (and the wit) to make some accusations that will see him in court defending a libel action whilst giving him a well publicised platform to criticise the army's behaviour. The busy courtroom drama that ensues serves well to illustrate the difficulties in fighting for the truth when the state and the generals have no interest in perpetuating this story. It's also at this stage that the film is at its most entertainingly combative. Donald Crisp is quite effective as his defence solicitor and the assemblage of familiar faces on the unformed side - notably Louis Calhern, show us just how devious and malevolent these people can be when they are turned upon. It's a bit verbose at times, but then it is about a writer, and the ending is all a bit rushed. It's not really a story about the life of this acclaimed author, it's more a critique on the trial and on the state of France justice.

A heartwarming film from start to finish

My favorite movie is Frank Capra's 1938 Best Picture winner, You Can't Take It with You.  Okay, honestly I have a good twenty favorite movies.  But this one ranks above them all.  Why?  Because I love the feel, the message, the theme inherent in the plot.  Put very simply, it is this: life is too short to waste it in the pursuit of wealth, which ultimately brings no happiness.  It makes infinitely more sense to spend it bringing joy into your own life, and the lives of those around you.  Why, you might ask, do you need to spend over two hours watching a movie just to hear this idea reiterated?  Because, I would answer, the journey, from the opening scenes of a day in the life of a wealthy Wall Street banker to the final scene of saying grace before supper, is just so much fun - good, clean, heartwarming fun, at that.  Also, there is the not inconsiderable merit of Mr. Lionel Barrymore playing the harmonica and railing against the ""isms"" of the world.

Under Capra's expert direction, a mix of acting talents so perfect the cast must have been blessed from above, comes together to create one of the most down-to-earth, enjoyable, and hilarious screwball comedies of all time.  Oh, but be warned: the firecrackers do tend to go off with a real bang from time to time.

It's the story of Alice Sycamore, a relatively normal young woman - normal considering she comes from an offbeat clan of free spirits, including her grandfather Martin Vanderhof, her aspiring playwright mother Penny, and one old gentleman who came to deliver the ice one day and never left.  She's a secretary for the son of banking magnate Anthony P. Kirby, and she falls in love with the boss's son - or rather, with the back of his head, as she tells him herself.  But the horribly sane, dull world of Anthony Kirby, Jr. isn't so well-suited to  the topsy-turvy, go-with-the-flow lifestyle adopted by Alice's family.  The rest of the film deals with the juxtaposition of the two very different ideals and lifestyles, and whether or not Alice and Tony can find happiness together.

Some ridicule this film as an over-the-top fantasy slamming work ethic and responsibility, and making the rich look like poor fools.  While it's true that life can't always be as simple and beautiful as it is for the fictional Vanderhof family, it's a gentle reminder of what's really important in life, and how we need to take the time to live in the moment, sometimes even with joyous abandon, and never forget to have some fun.  

 Consider the Vanderhof family this way: each person seen as a unique individual; free to do whatever it is they want to do most; never overlooked; never judged; but always loved.  I like to think that almost every person secretly, somewhere deep down inside, would want to live that way.  I know I would."
27367.0,Mrs. Miniver,"Middle-class housewife Kay Miniver deals with petty problems.

Here we have the magnificent line-up of Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon, Teresa Wright, Dame May Whitty, and Henry Travers, to name but a few.  All do a splendid and highly accomplished job.  Greer Garson is lovely, as usual, and Henry Travers is a most likeable old character actor.  This sentimental WWII drama tells its simple, honest story remarkably well, and is most definitely a classic.  As a side note, this, along with the movie Random Harvest, made in the same year, served to put Garson right at the top in Hollywood in no time. || It is not easy to describe this film. For the current generation, the film might not mean much but imagine those who watched this film, witnessing the events they themselves have gone through. Only then you truly understand the power of the film.

To me, who is in his mid-30s, the film is certainly a reflection of decent, honest, not over the top acting you may be accustomed to see in films of the same era. This is certainly the reason it gets the score I gave.

It could certainly be shorter but then you’d have to give up on some important character development scenes.

Would I watch this film again? I don’t think so. Would I make my friends watch it? Possibly not. || The ""Miniver"" family are a well-to-do lot living a middle class life in rural England. ""Clem"" (Walter Pidgeon) and his eponymous wife (Greer Garson) have to get to grips with the arrival of the war when their son ""Vin"" (Richard Ney) joins up and they are told they can't leave their landing light on anymore - to help guide in the planes when landing at a nearby RAF base. What now ensues illustrates gently, but quite potently, the impact on ordinary people across the land of the Luftwaffe's constant raids and their concomitant fears. It's the start of the war so confidence is still high - a fact well demonstrated by the stiff upper lip attitude of the stoic ""Lady Beldon"" (Dame May Whitty) who insists that the local flower show (which she usually wins) proceed as normal. With a couple of unwelcome house guests and a determination to help with the Dunkirk evacuations, this is an engaging - if slightly rose-tinted - look at survival amongst a class of people ill-equipped for this profound change in their circumstances. The rose growing ""Ballard"" (Henry Travers) also serves as an unlikely conduit for the political message too, as his relationship with the lady of the manor spells, amiably, the final death knells of the entitled aristocracy. Garson is entirely convincing here, as is Dame May, and with Pidegon providing a solid bedrock we are presented with a touching story that's maybe a little heavy on sentiment, but still well worth watching."

The story, with time, is quite expectable but the characters are well defined and developed by the cast.

Also, it is a good (and probably, too positive) review of the after WWII war lives of the US veterans.

A must to be seen. || This is really quite a touching story, recounting the experiences of three American veterans of WWII who return home and have to adapt to their new, not always welcoming, circumstances. Frederic March is ""Al"" who returns to a senior position in a bank - responsible for helping other returning soldiers with loans to start to get their lives back together; ""Fred"" (Dana Andrews) returns to a far less optimistic outlook, ending up working for peanuts selling perfume in a drug store, and finally the outwardly cheery ""Homer"" - who lost both his hands and who cannot decide whether his long term fiancée actually loves him anymore, or just feels pity. William Wyler and Robert Sherwood manage to interweave the inter-connected tales poignantly, illustrating the frustrations, bordering on despair, not only of the three men - in completely different ways; but also of their respective partners who must also adjust to their return, and to their new circumstances once the war is has been won. There are some strong performances from their ladies too - Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright, less so the always rather wooden Virginia Mayo and by the end you do have some, slight, semblance of an idea of just how tough it was for these men to lose the security and discipline of their army lives and to cope with a life that has, in many cases, just moved on without them."
28580.0,The Lost Weekend,"Don Birnam, a long-time alcoholic, has been sober for ten days and appears to be over the worst... but his craving has just become more insidious. Evading a country weekend planned by his brother and girlfriend, he begins a four-day bender that just might be his last - one way or another.",The screen dares to open the strange and savage pages of a shocking bestseller!,Drama,101,1945-11-29,en,7.6,623,0.9573,"Ray Milland, Jane Wyman, Phillip Terry, Howard Da Silva, Doris Dowling",Billy Wilder,"based on novel or book, alcohol, brother, paranoia, bartender, addiction, alcoholism, flashback, film noir, suicidal, black and white, writer, alcoholic, bats, low self esteem, dishonesty, hopelessness, delirium tremens, lies, devoted girlfriend","Delirium is a disease that only comes at night.

Don Birnham is not a drinker, he is in fact a drunk, he is left alone for the weekend by those who love him under the proviso that he gets stuck into his writing, thus the hope is that he stays away from the booze that is killing his life and the loving foundation that his life is built upon.

Billy Wilder directs this with brilliant hands, he pulls his first masterstroke by casting Ray Milland in the lead role of Don Birnham, at the time Milland was better known for light and airy roles, so for audiences of the time it was quite something to see someone so normally affable descend into a real dark shadow of their perceived persona. It was a formula that ""Blake Edwards"" would repeat some 17 years later with ""Days Of Wine And Roses"", there, comedy great ""Jack Lemmon"" would wow the viewers with his own descent into alcoholic hell.

It's no different here in 1945, Milland (and Wilder) drag us into an airy, almost jaunty first reel, and the foundation is set here for us to firmly stand by Don as he spirals through a series of nightmares that is acted with genuine skill by the leading man. The journey has us rapidly trying to hock a typewriter - if only we could just find a pawnbrokers open.  We will beg in touchingly heart breaking fashion for a drink from the trusted barkeep, we will find ourselves in a dry out ward where the night terrors take over, we will be terrified by the delirium as sobriety threatens to unhinge this vile addiction...

We will be part of this film because of the simple magnetic qualities that draws you in. It's not just Milland's realistic show, Wilder the crafty sod uses deep focus to emphasise anything that will steer us to the demon drink, be it escalating water rings as each shot of Rye is consumed, or camera shots through the bottles themselves, Wilder doesn't let up with knowing reminders of the core subject. The score is just terrific, Miklos Roza scores it to perfection because the music leads you into a swirling nightmare as Don's functional mind gives way to the haven of numbness, in short, the tech work on the film is tops.

The back story to this now revered masterpiece is somewhat hilarious, Paramount didn't want to release the film after temperance groups protested that the film championed drinking (LOL). One strong arm group even offered 5 Million Dollars to have the film's negative destroyed, Wilder stood by his guns and thankfully the movie watching world still has a dark and poignant classic to view with resonance in any decade. 10/10 || One of Billy Wilder's best films, and certainly Ray Milland's best performance as he's cast against type playing a failed alcoholic author. Milland perfectly captures the despondent, manipulative and even criminal behavior of the lead character. More than 70 years after its release this film still packs a huge punch. || This Best Picture winner (also won for director, actor and screenplay) was decently acted, albeit a bit too theatrical (stage type) for my taste but still well made movie with what I assume is a realistic take on alcoholism (never drank myself) from director Billy Wilder. It is a bit optimistic in the end but still an engaging enough drama. **3.75/5**"
23383.0,Hamlet,"Winner of four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, Sir Laurence Olivier’s Hamlet continues to be the most compelling version of Shakespeare’s beloved tragedy.

Even during the most potent of his soliloquies, he always manages to avoid any direct eye contact with the audience! His ""Hamlet"", here, though, is the definitive representation of this troubled Shakespearian character and combined with an excellently selected cast, we are presented with quite a compelling 2½ hours of tautly directed and gloriously eerily lit tragic drama. His father has been slain and his mother ""Gertrude"" (Eileen Herlie) has remarried his brother, now the king, ""Claudius"" (Basil Sydney). ""Hamlet"" is suspicious that this man had a hand in that murder, quite possibly his mother did too - but he cannot prove anything. That's where his father's ghost helps out - he reveals the secrets of his assassination and his son decides to incorporate these deeds into a play that he hopes, will shame the murderers and torture their souls. Not quite, and an unfortunate altercation in his mother's chamber sees him despatched, formally, to England but en route he encounters some pirates who might just be able to return him home for a show-down with the conniving liars and schemers at court. Olivier's masterful interpretation of this troubled and vacillating character is probably as near to that intended by the playwright as it's possible to get. That said, it's still an abridged version he delivers (I saw this on stage at the RSC many years ago with Kenneth Branagh, and it came in at over four hours) so he does have to sacrifice some of the dialogue from this longest of his plays, but that isn't so important as the dark and gloomy photography does much of the supportive heavy lifting and we can actually see enough to compensate for the dispensing of some of the more descriptive narrative. Jean Simmons is remarkable as the young ""Ophelia"" - a woman in whom ""Hamlet"" has a romantic interest, but who has been sternly warned by father ""Polonius"" (Felix Aylmer) to stay away! That relationship is further compromised as she struggles, mentally, when her father is also a victim of murder most foul. Sydney is also quite effective here as the king gradually begins to struggle with the guilt of his crime - and as ever with this writer, that inevitable descension into madness is grippingly presented by a series of increasingly desperate monologues. The extended denouement is the literal epitome of tragedy and confusion - with poison abounding: but rarely does it go into the right mouth, and at the conclusion it falls to ""Fortinbras"" to promise to regale this story to any who will listen. A solid and engaging story, with twist, turns, treachery and duplicity, love, honour and betrayal - all of the ingredients for a great drama with an excellent cast that really does captivate the imagination."

Willie Stark is an upstanding pillar of the community, when he is coaxed into standing in the local election he gets a thirst for politics. As he progresses through the political ranks he loses sight of the very things that he first stood for, with him, and all those associated with him getting muddier by the day.

Adapted by Robert Rossen (director and screenplay) from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Robert Penn Warren, All The King's Men is the story about the rise and fall of a rotten politician. Almost certainly based on Louisiana Governor, Huey Pierce Long, it's a towering piece of work that is as politically cynical as it is ego centrically human. Not merely just another film about ""when good guys go bad"", this picture serves notice to the many things that drives politics on, for better or worse. The role of the press is under scrutiny for example, and just how come simple things such as rallies can be staged by some conniving aide sitting at the back? All roads in this gritty piece are paved with suspicious looking stones, the very foundations of which have been murkily formed.

It's a testament to Rossen and his excellent cast that All The King's Men is still as potent today as it obviously was back at the tail end of the 40s. Every once in a while a similarly themed film will come our way, but few, if any, can boast the hard hitting realism that seams throughout Rossen's film. Helped by location shooting at run down Stockton in California, and boosted by a powerhouse performance from Broderick Crawford as Stark, this film most definitely is a hallmark in the political genre. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, it won three in the main categories, Best Actor (Crawford), Best Picture (rightly) and Best Supporting Actress (Mercedes McCambridge with an incredible debut performance). 9/10"

You're a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinkin' mug! And I'm glad what I done to you, ya hear that? I'm glad what I done!

On the Waterfront is directed by Elia Kazan and adapted to screenplay by Budd Schulberg from a series of Malcolm Johnson articles. It stars Marlon Brando, lee J. Cobb, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Rod Steiger and Pat Henning. Music is by Leonard Bernstein and cinematography by Boris Kaufman.	

Terry Malloy (Brando) was once a boxer with potential and big dreams. Now working as a longshoreman on the docks for mob boss Johnny Friendly (Cobb), Terry witnesses the murder of a fellow dock worker and finds himself conflicted about if he should inform to the crime commission about what he knows, more so as he gets in tight with the dead man's sister.

As good as anything Kazan, Brando and Kaufman ever did, On the Waterfront strips it down to a stench filled corrupt part of New York as honest hard working men battle to make ends meet under the rule of corrupt mob led union bosses. The dialogue is almost lyrical in its simplicity, deftly at odds with the dull pallor of the environment involving barely livable housing and misty docks holding awful secrets.

Although a defence for squealing, with the finger pointed at those in the high chairs here, it's a seminal classic that deserved every Oscar win and nomination that it got. From the electric ""contender"" speech (watch Steiger's facial acting here), to Brando's heart aching discovery of his beloved bids being killed, and onto the unforgettable punch the air finale, thisis a s good as classic cinema gets. 10/10 || This coulda’ been a contender in a lot of greatest movie polls if people just took a second to fully appreciate it. || Although it's Marlon Brando who takes top billing here, I found it was Karl Malden's ""Father Barry"" who stole the story as the priest who is determined to galvanises the New York dockers to step out from under the oppressive shadow of their boss ""Johnny Friendly"" (Lee J. Cobb). He's standing over a corpse, that of ""Doyle"". The deceased had been reputedly chatting with the crime commissioner and so took an unexpected dive off his building. He was a pigeon fancier, and it was this hobby that we know ""Malloy"" (Brando) used to lure the man to his pen on the roof. We know, but the late man's sister ""Edie"" (Eva Marie Saint) doesn't. As she determines to get to the bottom of the crime, she and ""Malloy"" start to become closer. He even begins to fall in love - but the priest tells him that can come to nothing unless he is honest. ""Malloy"" knows full well that any honesty will set him on a collision course with ""Johnny"" and with his own, cashmere coat clad brother ""Charlie"" (Rod Steiger) who acts as the number two around here. A meeting at the church does motivate ""Dugan"" (Pat Henning) to try to do something about this increasingly unfair scenario, but when he has a little too much whisky, it falls to ""Barry"" to render up his soliloquy and the dial starts to shift. If you've seen Charles Frend's ""The Cruel Sea"" (1953) you might recall a scene where, their ship torpedoed, the men float around in the water - water covered in debris and oil. It's dark and menacing looking. The photography here is almost that dark. It's black and white with the emphasis very much not the former. The photography almost seems to magnetise the darker elements of the buildings, the water and bring them to the fore. They become claustrophobic. Cobb is impressive as the boss as is Eve Marie Saint who avoids many of the usual pitfalls for the female lead. Her character is strong and her courage palpable in the face of an increasingly dangerous and desperate scenario. The denouement is gripping, touching and entirely fitting snd if you can get a chance to see this on a big screen, then do - it is a roller-coaster of a film that imbues it's flawed characters with personality and us with a sense of having some skin in it's game."

West Side Story is directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. It stars Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, George Chakiris, Simon Oakland and Ned Glass. Music is by Leonard Bernstein (lyrics by Stephen Sondheim) and cinematography by Daniel L. Fapp. 

In the less affluent areas of the upper West Side of Manhattan, New York, a gang of Polish-American teenagers called ""The Jets"" are in conflict with a rival gang of immigrated Puerto Ricans called ""The Sharks"". They each thirst to own the neighborhood streets, but with tensions reaching peak point, two kids, one from each rival gang, fall in love...

A Multi Oscar winner, West Side Story is a musical update of Romeo & Juliet. Set in the 50s in a steamy gangland New York, pic unfurls in a blaze of booming colour and scintillating choreography (Robbins). It has very much become a film that musical lovers can rejoice in, for even though it has problems, when it soars it soars far and away.

Problems come with the crossed gang lovers played by Wood and Beymer, the actors dubbing is poor, their dialogue delivery also itchy. It doesn't help that the film's quality noticeably dips when this fall in love axis of the story (as key as it is) shows up - stretching the run time to a nearly unbearable and unjustified length.

Yet it remains a joyous experience even today, you can forgive it for its ills when you get songs like ""America"" (Moreno the best thing in the film by far) that transport you up there on the screen. Or that the choreography is like a ballet version of circus acrobatics in full effect. In short, if you have any kink for musicals in filmic form, this is a must see. 8/10 || Not one for me.

I did not enjoy 1961's <em>'West Side Story'</em>, unfortunately. I felt almost everything about it to be kinda crappy if I'm honest. For one I didn't feel any chemistry with the cast, with no standout performer in sight; and that's on top of the iffy casting itself. None of the music - aside from that one tiny bit of ""Tonight"" - hits and the story comes across as forced.

The musical numbers are also extremely staged, the whole thing feels like a stage performance rather than a film; in fact, I genuinely assumed that the actors were just Broadway performers - à la <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/jersey-boys/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jersey Boys</a>'</em>. New York City also doesn't feel real or, away from the main characters, lived in.

Admittedly musicals aren't my go-to, though I'm more than capable of enjoying them. This, however, just didn't work for me at all. I wouldn't class it as anything awful, it's just simply quite poor - in my eyes, of course. Many, including the Oscars apparently, disagree!

With all that said, I'm still interested in checking out the 2021 remake at some point to see what Steven Spielberg did (or didn't do) with it. || **An old musical with some hints of ethnic prejudice, and it didn't seem as good as I thought it would be.**

This is one of those films that, honestly, I find difficult to understand. It is a production that brought to the cinema an interesting Broadway musical, which is still shown in several places today, and which tells a story similar to Romeo and Juliet in the context of youth gang wars in New York in the mid-20th century. The idea is seductive, and developing it from Shakespeare's source material is a point of quality. But sixty years have passed, and it is worth rethinking some things.

The film was directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise, and makes great use of the action and music of the theatrical version, having achieved resounding box office and critical success, in addition to a plethora of awards, including ten Oscars (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Art Direction in a Color Film, Best Editing, Best Cinematography in a Color Film, Best Costume Design in a Color Film, Best Film, Best Soundtrack for a Musical Film, Best Sound). Since then, it has placed on the list of the greatest and most memorable musicals ever made. It is understandable, therefore, the film's impact at the time and its classic status.

The studios spared no expense, taking advantage of their budget to create a huge visual and sound spectacle, in a luxurious production with impeccable cinematography and magnificent light, color and filming work. Taking advantage of all the Broadway material, the film inherits Leonard Bernstein's songs accompanied by exuberant dance numbers by magnificently choreographed groups, something challenging and innovative for this time. I think it goes without saying that the melodies and songs can stand on their own and have its proper value. In addition to all this work, the film has good sets and costumes.

Although all of these are enormous qualities, I have to be honest, even though it will offend some people: while watching the film, I didn't feel empathy for the characters or enjoy the story. The steering is decent, but it doesn't go beyond that. The script is the same as the original musical play, but it is not engaging or convincing, and that romance seemed forced and far-fetched. If the two dance groups are dangerous gangs of delinquents, they are certainly harmless and only use their knives to peel fruit. But worse than all these are the Puerto Ricans: the group was represented according to unacceptable ethnic and cultural prejudices, with racist contours. This makes it even more insulting that they chose painted-faced Anglo-Saxon actors for several of the Latin roles, with Natalie Wood being the most obvious case.

This brings us to talk about the cast. As it turns out, for me, Wood was a total casting mistake. She may be the right age, the smile, but she's not even Latin, she doesn't even sing a note, she doesn't even know how to dance. She simply took the opportunity to be part of a great film. Richard Beymer, her love interest, does a better job, but is still very bland and not very interesting. Russ Tamblyn and Rita Moreno do positive work, but they don't help much."

Anyway the bad is out of the way, the good is the performance, it was really Oscar worthy in the truest sense, and the evolution of both the lead character and the supporting cast right down to the town around him was legendary.  Subtle, but legendary.

It even had a sense of humor, little jokes in it that were probably added to break the tension, but added in a way that you have to look for them so it doesn't break.

Start to finish it is brilliant. || Warren Oates (""Wood"") steps from his patrol car in the quiet town of Sparta and discovers the body of ""Colbert"" - a controversial local employer. Shortly afterwards he discovers ""TIbbs"" (Sidney Poitier) sitting waiting for the 4.05 train. He is black and there is a wealthy white murder victim on the street - ergo, two and two... Next thing, though, the police chief ""Gillespie"" (Rod Steiger) is interrogating their visitor and discovers that he is an accomplished homicide detective. Initially inclined to just send him on his way, ""Gillespie"" decides - with a bit of persuasion from the widow (Lee Grant) that it might make sense for ""Tibbs"" to do some of the investigating himself. Backs up, heckles raised, the white supremacists are outraged and astonished in equal measure as the police allow him to follow his nose and to uncover some rather nasty little home truths about their community and the people who dwell within. On the face of it, it's about racial prejudice and perhaps, offers a rather simplistic get out solution. Or, maybe, it demonstrates that the best cure for ignorance is exposure to that which we loathe or don't understand and let behaviours and experience alter these views? There is room for both perspectives as we evaluate the police attitudes to this clever and slightly arrogant man who clearly considers himself to be as superior to them as they to him. Fifty-five years on, it's hard to appreciate just how profound this kind cinema was in alerting the US population to the bigotries in their own backyard, and Poitier always was a poised and measured actor when it came to making a point without shoving it down your throat! Steiger is also on good form here. He underplays his role, his character has flaws - sure - but as we progress there appears to be a willingness to mature and his performance manages that well. Small town life, small town mentality - with a racist, xenophobic, tinge. Well worth a watch."

Fred Zinnemann directs and Robert Bolt adapts the screenplay from his own play. It stars Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller, Leo McKern, Robert Shaw, Orson Welles, Susannah York, Nigel Davenport and John Hurt. Music is by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Ted Moore. Plot has Scofield as Sir Thomas More, the man who refused to cede to the mighty machinations of King Henry VIII (Shaw).

It's very much an actors movie, beautifully literate and costumed and photographed up to the nines. So not one for those more keen on the action orientated historical epic, then! The story is thriving on the anguish of Thomas More, who is torn between loyalty to his King and his own moral beliefs, the beliefs of his religion system and the potential damning of his soul. The political and religious machinations positively pulse throughout, vividly brought to life by a cast of great thespians (Scofield is as great as you have heard).

Great credit has to go to Zinneman, one of the deserved recipients of the 6 Oscars the film garnered. He never lets the cast run away with things, no chewing the scenery or smell the fart acting, he keeps them in check and they respond by providing an utterly fascinating and compelling historical saga. But most of all, with all the royal pomp on show, it's the intelligence of the writing that shines brightest. The dialogue via the sharp script throws cloaks of suspicion over everything being played out. Religion and politics, huh, it's for the birds. 

Top film making. 8/10 || Paul Scofield is superb as the Lord Chancellor of England ultimately torn between his loyalty to his king and to his conscience. As Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) becomes more and more infatuated by Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave) he insists that all of his subjects acknowledge his absolute supremacy over the church. Most, fearful for their lives and property, acquiesce but Sir Thomas More (Scofield) cannot. The King has long relied on the honest counsel of his friend as so initially is content to allow him to retire, but soon those conspiring against More use everything at their disposal to bring him to ruin. Wendy Hiller sensitively portrays his stoic wife desperate to save her husband from the scaffold but cognisant of his overwhelming sense of right and wrong. Leo McKern also stands out as his scheming successor Thomas Cromwell and there is a cameo from Orson Welles as the clearly out-of-favour Cardinal Wolsey. Robert Bolt adapts his own stage play without compromising the genuine sentiment of his original work - fear, honesty, integrity and power - making this a thought-provoking watch from Fred Zinnemann."

Charles Dickens famous novel of an orphan boy, Oliver Twist, who escapes from his poor life to seek his fame and fortune in London, is adapted as a glossy musical.

Who would have thought that a story from the brilliant Dickens could be so sweet and endearing? So it be with Carol Reed's (Best Director Winner) unforgettable 1968 Best Picture Winner. Yes it's some way away from the essence of the source, those in need of that should be seeking out David Lean's fabulous 1948 version, but with an array of wonderful tunes and choreography, this Oliver is a treat for all the family. The cast are uniformly strong, notably Ron Moody (Fagin), Oliver Reed (who as Bill Sykes is probably playing himself!), Mark Lester (Oliver) and the fabulous Jack Wild (The Artful Dodger). While Lionel Bart's songs are as timeless as they are engaging.

The 60s was a tough decade for cinematic musicals, with many of them turning out to be bloated exercises in tedium. But Oliver! is one of the shining lights in the genre, a true uplifter guaranteed to have the feet a tapping and the smile firmly implanted on ones face. So if you have yet to see and be charmed by it? Come on in, join our number and consider yourself one of us. 8/10 || Sir Carol Reed has delivered a belter of a film that I'm certain would have Charles Dickens dancing with delight. Mark Lester is ideally cast as the weedy title character; brought up in the harshness of a Victorian workhouse. After daring to ask for ""more"" at supper time, he is sold to the local undertaker; runs away to London and the rest is the stuff of well known literature. Ron Moody is outstanding as ""Fagin"", with Shani Wallis ""Nancy""; Oliver Reed as the dastardly ""Bill Sikes"" and Jack Wild as the ""Artful Dodger"" all making the best of Lionel Bart's cracking musical adaptation of this tale of 19th century London squalor and violence.

One can always count on Hoffman and his ability to absorb the character he is portraying with such ease. He has a knack at portraying that deep, bronchial coughing schtick. When watching, I had to wear a surgical mask - just in case.

Voight, as usual, is magnificent as the innocent amongst the scum. Watching this wide eyed lone ranger slowly losing the tassels from his jacket is a deeply moving experience.

A word of warning, you may want to use antibacterial wipes on your tv screen after watching Hoffman here. One cannot be too careful.


- Potential Kermode || This is certainly my favourite role from Dustin Hoffman as he turns in an outstanding performance as ""Ratso"". He hooks up with the dapper, but out of his depth cowboy ""Buck"" who arrives in New York all set to be a hustler, but ends up paying his first client for the sex she's supposed to pay him for! Initially, ""Ratso"" fleeces this gullible guy too, but gradually the two start to depend on one and other - which is as well for ""Ratso"" who is clearly not long for this world. His persistent cough is being worsened by the squalid conditions in which he, and latterly, ""Buck"" have to live and by their poverty row existence. This is a great story and John Schlesinger tells it with some panache. The relationship between the two men is honest and decent, even though that attribute could hardly be said to apply to either of them when it comes to anyone else: ""Ratso"" would probably have hustled his own grandmother given the chance. Their bond feels real, plausible - unsentimental and convincing; and the Waldo Salt screenplay ensures that the dialogue - though frequently quite sparing - is both poignant and humorous. || <em>'Midnight Cowboy'</em> is a beauty. It's one I've seen mentioned positively online many times down the years, especially on those four favourites videos that Letterboxd do with well known folk. Despite that I knew nothing coming in, which - as always - is the best way to view a flick.

Dustin Hoffman's involvement was all that I did know heading into it, I wasn't even sure it was Jon Voight as the main guy until he started scowling his face - a distinctive look! I actually only know of him in film terms from 2003's <em>'Holes'</em>, he is memorable in that classic.

In this, Voight is just as excelllent as Hoffman. They make for a fantastic pairing, I did thoroughly enjoy seeing their friendship build and build; even if it made the obvious, overhanging conclusion more and more saddening. Credit is due for the bit part actors in this, as well.

Music-wise this is top notch too, even if that recognisable Harry Nilsson track is a touch overused. Away from that, I didn't actually know the ""I'm walkin' here"" quote came from this movie (I'm terrible with film quotes, clearly), though of course pretty cool to see it pop up unexpectedly."

They suspect that it's Charnier (Rey) who is masterminding the whole enterprise, but they can't pin anything down on him. He hides in plain sight, clad in cashmere with a distinctive hat and dining in fine establishments - but always beyond their grasp. He almost teases the increasingly frustrated policemen who stray ever closer to the line as they try to apprehend him. Will either of them ever crack?

Scheider does enough, and there are also quite a few effective supporting contributions from the likes of Ann Rebbot as Mme. Charnier and from the odious henchman ""Nicoli"" (Marcel Bozzuffi). Gradually we are exposed to the ruthlessness of both sides as the stakes become higher, life becomes cheap, and the denouement again offers us a degree of palpable realism as no simple or convenient solutions are provided.

It was inspiring with the training, it was inspiring with the fight, and it was about the characters and the characters are what makes a great story.

The down side was Creed, he was a little under-developed in this wasn't he? They make up for it in Rocky II, III, and IV, but in Rocky he felt like a faceless nemesis didn't he? He was Mohamed Ali without real depth in this and the story could have used to develop him a little more in the first one.

But... we got it in the sequels.

The biggest selling point was the love story... I know mushy, right? ... but they did a great job of making it awkward and at times intimidating as well as absolutely sweet and charming and it was completely realistic and believable.

You could sit down and watch it and understand how they fell for one another. You got a sense of who they were and that carried over into Rocky II... but kind of ended in III and we only caught a glimpse of it here and there until Balboa.

Still, it was the low budget movie that stole out hearts. And it was the inspiring story about the underdog, and Rocky movies are best when they inspire. || Rocky is an inspiring story about an ordinary man who takes advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

I do have to say, the movie has a rocky beginning, as the dialogue is pretty clunky and awkward at times. But after about twenty minutes, the movie really gets into its groove and had me locked in till the end. My favorite aspect of this film is the humanity it has; it takes a look at a big and intimidating fighter in Rocky and explores his emotions and insecurities. My favorite scene is when he lays in bed next to Adrian with the sudden realization that he cannot win this fight. It was an incredibly vulnerable moment for him and worked really well.

As I said before, the dialogue is very inconsistent, especially in the scene at Rocky's house with Adrian. It was very unsettling to watch because she is written as if she does not want to be there, but then the next second she is in love with him. It was very weird and creepy. On the other hand, in some scenes, the dialogue is written very well, which lends itself to boosting the actors' performances. But when it is off, the acting on display is negatively affected. Despite that, this movie gets a lot more right than it does wrong in the script department.

Technically, this film excels. The score is fantastic, with one of the most iconic songs in cinematic history. The cinematography is top-notch, with some incredible shots in the city and very creative angles used during the training sequences. 

Overall, this film lived up to every ounce of hype it had behind it, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second spent with these characters.

Score: 98% |
Verdict: Masterpiece || Sylvester Stallone is ""Rocky"", an enforcer for a small-time Philadelphia mobster who works out in Burgess Meredith's gym (""Mickey's"") and is keen on the sister of his friend ""Paulie"" (Burt Young), the shy and retiring ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire). Meantime, World Heavyweight Champion ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers) finds his impeding tilte defence kybsoshed by an injured challenger. At this point serendipity takes a hand and ""Creed"" decides to pluck a challenger from obscurity - and he chooses the ""Italian Stallion"". What follows is a solid, engaging tale of grit and determination as the champion assumes it's all in the bag and together with his tight-knit team, the challenger is focussed and determined to, at least, go the distance. Sure, Stallone isn't an actor in any traditional sense - he is more of a character, he oozes the part rather then portrays it - and that is what makes this work. You are subsumed into his life, his love, his training and his ambition - almost as the then aspiring Stallone would have been whilst writing and making the film. The action scenes are first class, and the charisma offered by the star, and by trainer Meredith help this stand the test of time well. There are holes in the plot - but they are fairly easy to overlook if you allow the sentiment and strong performances to take and keep hold of your imagination. Great stuff."

To what extent can a simple social story and a familiar family problem such as separation or divorce. To what extent can it represent and reflect the condition of an entire society, the culture and morals of this society, and the social changes that occur to it. The events of the film tell about the story of the divorce and struggle of the Kramer couple over the custody of their child, which reflected in its essence the social and cultural change in American society during the seventies of the last century.

In 1979, the American social film Kramer vs. Kramer This film won good reviews, including an Academy Award. It is a reflection of the changes that took place in the family and in women's choices after widespread demands and protest movements in the United States of America in the sixties of the last century. Part of these demands was related to the call for women's liberation and the struggle for equality.

After the round of conflict, the woman came out strong, and a measure of her rights were taken away. She also became economically independent and self-reliant, and the door of her ambitions was wide open, and she turned from a subordinate to an equal. Certainly, all these changes had to find their reflection on people's daily lives, on the woman's relationship with the man, and on the arrangement of women's priorities in terms of family and life, as yesterday the family was at the top of the list of American women's priorities, but after this cultural and social transformation, we see that the ambition of some women as Kramer's wife It is what settles at the top of her priorities now.

And as the wife Kramer is the strongest and most economically able, she takes custody of the son from the father without regard to whether this behavior is in the best interests of the son or not.

I was affected by what Kramer's wife did, which is that she was faced with two difficult choices, either to take care of the son, or to continue what she had achieved in her work. Unfortunately, it was prescribed for a woman to sacrifice everything. || Much more heart than expected!

<em>'Kramer vs. Kramer'</em> is a film I've heard of for as long as I can remember, though I didn't actually know much about it itself... a quick glance at Wikipedia and I saw that they class it as a ""legal drama"", which is obvious given the title. With that, I was waiting for a long court battle to start so was surprised to see it not arrive until the final 30 or so minutes. The film is actually mainly about a father and son, in how they react to a certain life event.

And boy do the filmmakers do a great job at making you care for the characters of Dustin Hoffman (Ted) and Justin Henry (Billy)... and even Meryl Streep's Joanna, though I could've personally done with more development for the latter's character; especially as the ending is quite predictable, so additional scenes for her side of the story would've been nice. I wouldn't say it's a big deal, however, as you see what's needed.

Hoffman puts in a terrific performance, as does youngster Henry. Streep also brings a good showing, as do Jane Alexander and Howard Duff more minimally. Credit to everyone onscreen, in truth. It's, of course, sad to read about the offscreen incident(s) that occurred during the production involving Hoffman and Streep, albeit settled incident(s) between the two.

In conclusion, and this won't come as a surprise given my rating and all the positive noise that this film has received in the decades since its release, I'd undoubtedly recommend this motion picture from 1979."

A family in an affluent neighborhood north of Chicago tries to recover after a tragedy. Timothy Hutton plays the troubled son who gets help from a therapist (Judd Hirsch) while Donald Sutherland & Mary Tyler Moore play the seemingly okay parents.

“Ordinary People” (1980) was Robert Redford’s debut movie in the director’s chair and it was a huge success. The story is two-pronged: It’s a coming-of-age drama about the anxious son at home, school, therapy and his relationships with the fairer sex, as well as a marital drama about the parents.  

This was Hutton’s first theatrical movie, but you wouldn’t know that by his powerhouse performance, which is on the level of Brando. It’s interesting how simple, realistic drama can be more compelling than some overblown “blockbuster” with an explosion every five minutes.

Winsome Elizabeth McGovern is a highlight as one of the girls the son dates.

On the negative side, the storm sequences are pretty artificial, reminiscent of a TV flick, and the story almost drowns in its unrelenting drama in the last act (I said “almost”).

The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was mostly shot in suburbs north of Chicago, e.g. Lake Forest and Highland Park.

This film is about character acting at it's best, though, and Shirley MacLaine (""Aurora"") and Jack Nicholson (""Garrett"") bring us charisma and entertainment in spades which thankfully rescues the really pedestrian plot from abject mediocrity. Since her birth, ""Aurora"" has fussed over her daughter ""Emma"" (Debra Winger) and upon the death of her husband, settles down to a rather vicarious existence living life through her daughter, her husband ""Flap"" (Jeff Daniels) and their children. She is a strong willed woman, with love that can be gentle and kindly, or that can be rude and interfering with much of the frequently sardonic humour emanating from her disinclination to let them live their own lives. Next door we find ""Garrett"", a somewhat disreputable womaniser. A former astronaut who trades well on his erstwhile status, but who takes a bit of a shine to ""Aurora"" - and that's another source of lively comedy as the two clash with engaging regularity. The last hour descends rather quickly into melancholy, though, as the young ""Emma"" has to deal with her own problem husband, and an illness that starts to focus the attention from all concerned onto what really matters with their relationships. MacLaine is always good with these rough-round-the-edges roles and here there is plenty of chemistry on the sparing occasions in which she and Nicholson feature. Sadly, for me anyway, the rest of this hovers way too close to melodrama and though at its best it is really good, for the most part I was rather underwhelmed by the family antics that underpinned so much of the (over-long) story."

Both of these men have considerable athletic skills, and the story intertwines their efforts to get to the Games, whilst both must deal with their differing priorities and challenges. It's this middle portion of the film, the prologued character development phase, that all plods along too slowly. It has too little pace and too many characters, and that just drags the film down. The last fifteen minutes liven up considerably though, not just with the events on the track - but amongst those determined to ensure that the whole team attains success making sacrifices and compromises along the way. It has a classy look to it, the costumes and settings are top drawer, but I found the leading performances rather disjointed and at over two hours long, I did struggle to stay engaged."

It depicts the end of empire and the birth of new ones - and it does it in a spectacularly colourful and stylish fashion. The death of the Empress Dowager sees the toddler Pu Yi ascend the Dragon Throne of China, and live amidst concubines and eunuchs in the Forbidden City. He grows up believing his is a divine right to rule, and it is only upon the arrival of his tutor RJ (Peter O'Toole) and his procurement of spectacles that his eyes begin to be opened to the reality that his kingdom is entirely enclosed within a wall of golden yellow tiles. When this idyll is disrupted by warring events outside, the Emperor (now John Lone) sone finds himself a playboy, married to an opium addict (Joan Chen) and a useful puppet of the manipulative Japanese who have invaded much of his erstwhile realm. WWII arrives, power struggles ensue and the story of his eventual - and rather brutal - reintegration into the newly established Chinese communist society is depicted sensitively and without recourse to too much melodrama or sentiment. The score adds a wonderful richness to what is undoubtedly the star of this - the cinematography. Set inside the splendour of the actual Imperial Palace complex in Peking, we get a wonderful sense of the grandeur, isolation and luxury of life inside this sumptuously decorated collection of marble and brightly painted villas whilst outside, poverty and mysticism reigned more surely than did the occupant of the throne. The costume design is also remarkable - a perfect eye for the detail of the period from the start to the middle of the 20th Century. To be honest, the acting - aside from an engaging performance from the inquisitive and mischievous three year old (Richard Vuu) is all pretty routine. O'Toole features sparingly and doesn't quite fit the bill as the learned and worldly scholar. Lone and Chen are competent but they really only shine a light on the rather stilted dialogue. This isn't really a film about words - it's a film about visuals. It's about history, politics, corruption, betrayal - and even a little bit of love - all encased in a shell of creative elegance. It's wasted on the television - but is certainly one of the best examples of ""epic"" cinema yet made and Bertolucci has clearly invested a great deal of himself in this beautiful piece of drama.

Morgan Freeman is terrific, as is Jessica Tandy. Dan Aykroyd and Esther Rolle play their part too.

It is something of a great cinematic achievement that Rain Man became the great film it clearly is because the story surrounding it is interestingly Hollywood in itself.

Four directors, six screenwriters, two cinematographers, eight producers, writers strikes, crew change, and a studio fighting for its life.

All of the above are common knowledge but it doesn't hurt to remember these facts when viewing the award wining triumph of a movie that stands the test of time today. The film is so simple in structure it really needed something special to pull it out of the prospective banality of being ""just another road movie about finding oneself"", Rain Man achieves something special by tackling its subjects with very sensitive hands and splicing a believable human concept into the story via the incredible shows from its two leading men.

Dustin Hoffman gives a magical moving performance as the Autistic Savant Raymond, the ultimate complement I can pay the performance is that it really is believable, both moving and clever rolled into one artistic result. Tom Cruise is equally as great in a role that called for drastic layer changes, a role that demanded much conviction from the actor taking it on, and Cruise gives the role much depth as he goes from shallow bastard to a very emotive and feeling human being, it's a great show that stands up to reevaluation these days. A performance that seems to have sadly been forgotten in light of Hoffman's film stealing show. With a film such as this you pray that the ending can do it justice, and I'm glad to say that there is no pandering here, it's an ending that says so much because it doesn't cop out, I thank god for those rewrites because the endings to the original scripts would have had me booting the TV set out of the window. Essential cinema. 10/10 || I am not going to pretend I have much substantive to say about this movie that will make readers gasp or slap their forwards and realize, yes, that is why I should love this film! But as this is one of my wife and my favorite movies ever, I thought I would share why. 

When this movie came out, we saw immediately the similarities between Raymond (Rain Man) and our daughter. No, she is not just like him. In addition to her autistic, obsessive behavior, she is deaf and developmentally delayed so that even though she knows sign language, she only answers questions with it and never uses complete sentences. 

But like Raymond, she has always exhibited weird special gifts. She solves math problems on her fingers that even sign language interpreters don't understand, she remembers exact dates of things that have happened years before, she can create beautiful rugs on a large floor loom. 

On the other hand, and she can't cross a street by herself, she throws a fit at times over the smallest change in her routine. For example, when she lived t home with us as a child, if we grabbed the TV guide from next to the tv to check out the schedule, she would stand over us and get more and more agitated and shake with frustration and anger. We finally had to start buying two TV guides, one that was ""hers"" and one that was ""ours."" But we couldn't buy two of everything.

So anyway, what this all meant is that when we watched Rain Man back then when we were living in our daughter's wake, we found ourselves laughing at stuff that had previously driven us crazy with frustration. Needless to say, Dustin Hoffman gave a virtuoso performance, but I think Tom Cruise's efforts were underrated, perhaps because it seems like a natural role for him.

I don't claim this is the best movie ever, just our very favorite, for personal reasons. || ""Charlie"" (Tom Cruise) works his luxury car import business quite literally wheeling and dealing when he is told that his estranged father has died. Driving to meet the solicitor he's informed that he is to receive some perfectly grown roses, but that the $3m estate is to be left elsewhere? Where? Well he discovers that he has a brother ""Raymond"" (Dustin Hoffman) when he visits him at in institution that cares for autistic people. Resentful and completely unaware and uncaring of his actions, ""Charlie"" decides to take his new-found sibling on a trip back to LA. Not afraid of throwing the odd tantrum, ""Raymond"" refuses to fly with anyone but Qantas so they have to drive and it's on the road that the story develops into one that, to be honest, we could probably predict quite easily. Now there's no getting away from the fact that ""Raymond"" is an exasperatingly annoying character at times, but that's what gets under your skin. Whether or not Hoffman is acting or mimicking, he presents us with an highly intelligent personality with a few pieces of his cognitive jigsaw missing. ""Raymond"" can display the traits of a small child, but equally those of a sophisticated and complex character who absorbs more from around him than perhaps we'd expect. Cruise is also at the top of his game here. He manages his character's evolution from smart-assed and selfish ""Charlie"" to a rounder, more mature and responsible individual with an aplomb that certainly belies some of his previous roles. It also doesn't do any harm that his brother's genius comes in quite handy in Vegas either! It's pretty poignantly and sometimes amusingly written offering some on-the-ball observations and plausible scenarios well supported by some equally potent photography, and though not always an easy drama to watch, as it progressed I felt a little invested in whether or not this relationship had legs or was, ultimately, just about a man's desire to get hold of an inheritance."
466.0,Klute,A high-priced call girl is forced to depend on a reluctant private eye when she is stalked by a psychopath.,You'd never take her for a call girl.

Klute is directed by Alan J. Pakula and written by Andy and Dave Lewis. It stars Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Charles Cioffi and Roy Scheider. Music is by Michael Small and cinematography by Gordon Willis.

When businessman Tom Gruneman (Robert Milli) mysteriously disappears, private detective John Klute (Sutherland) is hired to find out what happened. Travelling to New York, Klute follows a lead to high class prostitute Bree Daniels (Fonda), who is known to have had much correspondence with Gruneman. An uneasy relationship forms between Klute and Daniels, but when it becomes apparent that she is being stalked by someone sinister, Klute gets in far deeper than he ever could have imagined.

Alan J. Pakula, a purveyor of 1970s paranoia infused cinema, lends his astute sense of screw tightening to make Klute a taut and menacing neo-noir. He gives us a New York cloaked in urban claustrophobia, a place populated with lost souls, of emotionally stunted abusers, and sexually charged murders. Right in the middle are John and Bree, two people in search of meaning and direction in life, brought together by way of a miserable scenario. Their respective psychological make-ups suggest complexities, yet this chapter in their life is not.

The mystery element to the narrative is not particularly strong, but it doesn’t really need to be, such is the strength of the lead characterisations and the atmosphere rung out by Pakula’s sparse direction and Willis’ spectral photography. Fonda is terrific, a ball of emotionally conflicted fudge, sexy, feisty but ever so fragile, she deserved her Academy Award. Sutherland is equally ace, masking John’s inner anxieties with stoic outward bravado. While Scheider and Cioffi offer firm and telling support. A very strong neo-noir that is an ode to great film making techniques, where story and characters are chosen as being more important than visceral shocks. 8.5/10"

Repo Man has become one of those films where even though it was savaged by many critics of the time (not Ebert, he loved it), was met with very poor box office as well, but now everyone seems to shout that they loved it back then, always have! It is the very definition of a ""cult movie"", a pic that went underground and found its audience, so much so it burst back above ground and today is still being discovered by an ever intrigued movie loving audience.

Repo Man was one of a kind, a film that refused to be pigeon holed, a true original. Story for what it's worth has Emilio Estevez as L.A. punk Otto Maddox who gets bluffed into a repo man job. Taken under the wing of Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), Otto gets to become a fully fledged repo man, taking on all the perks and dangers that come with the territory. But when a mysterious 1964 Chevy Malibu arrives on the patch, all bets seem to be off because everyone is either after it or being disintegrated by it!

The life of a repo man is always intense.

OK! Where to start? Offbeat, eccentric, punk, funky, funny, smart? Repo Man is all those things, it dares to be bold and challenging, its satirical edges slicing away at film genres and American societies. Director Alex Cox (how wonderful that such an American film is directed by a British guy) fills out this scuzzy part of L.A. with hippies, freaks, punks, aliens, scientist nutters, UFO nutters, effeminate coppers and the repo men themselves, a bunch of grizzled souls hardened by life's travails, but always with a quip, a smile and a gunshot at the ready.

The dialogue fizzes with cheeky derring-do, some lines even today still quotable and used in pubs and clubs across the continents. Robby Muller's cinematography has snap crackle and pop, as does the rocking soundtrack as Cox invites the likes of Iggy Pop, The Circle Jerks, Black Flag and The Plugz into his weird and wonderful world. Performances are bang on the dollar, Stanton the class act, Estevez superb, Tracey Walter proving what his fans already knew, that he's a legendary character actor.

From an opening involving a pair of smoking boots, to the glowing sci-fi nirvana finale, Repo Man kicks ass. One viewing is never enough, and for sure there are those who have seen it once and hate it to the point of refusing to ever watch it again. That's a shame, because repeat viewings are essential, because the more you watch the more Cox's deliriously cheeky movie makes sense. 9/10"

Luckily, they also encounter the mighty ""Ludo"" who is on good terms with boulders large and small - especially useful as they find themselves uncomfortably close to the 'Bog of Eternal Stench"" which bubbles and festers so you can almost smell it in the cinema.

Bowie doesn't actually feature that often, here, but when he does he brings a mischievous charm to the proceedings (even if he doesn't look that comfortable in his hoes!). The visuals are great fun, mixing the costumed with the manufactured skilfully and energetically and though I don't suppose there's really any jeopardy at all, the film has something akin to the ""Wizard of Oz"" in it's storytelling.

The brain, the athlete, the princess, the basket case, and the criminal - yes we’re talking about _The Breakfast Club_. It’s been dubbed as a seminal film of the 1980s and takes a place as an intergenerational classic. 

_They were five students with nothing in common, faced with spending a Saturday detention together in their high school library. At 7.00am they had nothing to say, but by 4.00pm they had bared their souls to each other and become The Breakfast Club._

Directed by John Hughes and starring Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ally Sheedy it rightly deserves that spot as a revered movie. It's very much a comedy-drama and is surprisingly deep in parts, like the scene toward the end where they are all explaining what they did to get the detention. The acting is brilliant, and even though there is a very small cast, its basically the five members of The Breakfast Club and the Vice Principal, they hold your attention because they are so good.

What I particularly liked was how they took the standard college stereotypes and then slowly deconstructed them over the course of the movie, and showed that they actually all had a lot in common. They all had their loves and hates, their sensitivities, and the burden of expectation from their parents, the school, and society as a whole.

It's funny, it's sad, and by the time it concludes, it's quite uplifting, and if it's been a while since you saw it, it might be time to load it up for another look. If you've never seen it, then I suggest you check it out for a great time capsule of a movie that has themes that still resonate today. || _**Forced, artificial dialogs with eye-rolling character arcs**_

Released in 1985 and written & directed by John Hughes, ""The Breakfast Club"" is a teen dramedy about five high school students from five different sub-cultures during an all-day detention over the weekend at their suburban Chicago school. Molly Ringwald plays the popular girl, Emilio Estevez the jock, Anthony Michael Hall the Brainiac nerd, Judd Nelson the dope-smoking rebel and Ally Sheedy the neurotic misfit. Paul Gleason and John Kapelos are on hand as the host principal and janitor respectively

This movie has a big reputation as an 80's teen flick, but I was wholly disappointed. Most of the discussions between the five students from different cliques come across contrived and unconvincing. Some of the dialog is actually cringe-inducing.

The hoodlum could've worked as a character, like the Fonz or Vinnie Barbarino, but he's such an annoying, loud-mouthed jerk that he loses all sympathy, particularly when he verbally rapes the redhead on multiple occasions for no ostensible reason. *** SPOILER ALERT*** The fact that the two end up together at the end adds insult to injury. ***END SPOILER*** Not to mention two others that unrealistically couple up.

It's strange that ""The Breakfast Club"" is billed as a comedy because there's very little that's funny, although it's occasionally entertaining, like some of the music sequences. Unfortunately, Hughes wasn't into the heavier side of rock and so the soundtrack consists solely of bland 80's new wave bands, like his other 80's teen flicks (e.g. ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""). Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of quality songs, like ""We Are Not Alone"" by Karla DeVito, but where are the heavier popular bands of 1984, like Van Halen, Scorpions, Judas Priest, Ratt, Dokken, Queensryche, Def Leppard, AC/DC or Motley Crue? Is it asking too much to have ONE song that actually rocks?

But the music is the least of the movie's problems (and isn't really a problem at all, except that there aren't any heavy tracks). The actors are fine, but Hughes' dialog is unconvincing. As such, you don't buy the characters. The script needed a serious rewrite.

The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in the suburbs north of Chicago.

GRADE: C- || An absolute classic, and no mistake. If you disagree, sorry, you're wrong. John Hughes was an utter genius."

A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is the runt of the Elm Street litter. It was unfortunate to be the sequel to a landmark horror film, a film that birthed one of the ultimate horror icons whilst having at its core a terrifying premise. A premise that was superbly executed by all involved in the first film. Part 2 bravely tried to advance the bogeyman story to another level, to one of possession, which in hindsight was a mistake.

There's also the mixed tonal flow and confused intents that hamper the pic. Whilst the young members of the cast are too blank to garner the required amount of sympathy to get us to care about their plight, especially lead lad Mark Patton as Jesse Walsh. However, there is still a lot to like here, some striking imagery grabs the attention and it is not without some unnerving scares.

The debates about what metaphors the makers were going for still exist, and that homo-erotic sheen is never going to go away, but even though it's an average Elm Street movie, it's not as dreadful as it was first painted. 5/10 || Freddy's Revenge deserves redemption. If you don't expect a film about Freddy, you can appreciate this sequel for what it is, instead of begrudging it for what it isn't. The argument for a gay reading--the idea that Freddy is symbolic of the protagonist's repressed homosexual desires--isn't entirely convincing but even without it, the movie's a lot better than many credit it. This is a Nightmare on Elm Street story that uses the creature to explore what it feels like to grow up. It's confusing and scary and transformational. Tonal shifts and plot mistakes only contribute to the overall intent. || The nightmare that started it all. Made us all scared to go to to sleep. My favorite horror series next to Friday the 13th.

*** This review contains an implied spoiler in last paragraph ***

By the time A Nightmare on Elm Street had rolled around to this, part five, Freddy Krueger had long stopped being a scary bogeyman. He was now a figure of fun, a purveyor of one line quips, while the makers were desperately trying to come up with new ideas in which to have the pizza faced Krueger still exist, and thus have more films for him to be in...

Here we are sold the idea that a foetus can dream, so not only do we get a horror staple of sex being bad for you, but it lets Freddy (Robert Englund) back in the fold - in this another garbled screenplay. Cue friends of the pregnant Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox) being stalked and offed by the old stinky green and red jumper killer.

It's all very frenetic and cartoonish, with gore replacing scares. There's a little ingenuity with some of the kills, such as a comic book section that has a good thought process, but once the laughable finale arrives - cuz - like - love conquers all - then you may be digging out parts 1 & 3 to remind yourself how good this series used to be. 5/10 || This one was just ok. For some reason the kid in this movie just bothered me. Yea he looked scary but he was a bad actor. The movie itself would have been better with a different actor or just cut him out altogether."

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || ***Serious retread of the first film with some differences***

I'm fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise even though I’m not a gorehound and only occasionally watch slasher flicks. It has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young people in a fun camp-type environment in the woods; the presence of an unstoppable killer, who increasingly becomes a hideous monster over the course of the series, adds an air of danger and suspense. Include scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise.

Released in 1981, one year after the first film, ""Part II"" is basically a retread with different characters, a different killer and a different camp on the same lake, not far from ""Camp Blood,"" i.e. Camp Crystal lake. In reality, the film was shot on an entirely different location; specifically Kent, Connecticut.

It's interesting how none of the films were shot at the same location even though, typically, the location in the story is the general vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake. The locations of the films in the series include northern New Jersey (I), Connecticut (II), Southern Cal (III, IV, V & IX), Georgia (VI), Alabama (VII), British Columbia (VIII & XI), New York City (VIII), Toronto (X & XI) and Texas (XII).

It's the camp-like settings of most of the franchise and the unrelenting monster that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

Concerning the tone, the first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the series introduced a campy element in Part III, which plagued several subsequent entries (V, VI, IX & X) until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway; still, I prefer the serious tone. Speaking of which, the only thing questionable about the first film, as far as realism goes, is how the killer is able to throw an adult corpse through a window or hang a body from a door, etc. But I suppose these things can be attributed to the powerful psycho Voorhees gene (or the demon thing disclosed in 1993’s “Jason Goes to Hell”).

Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some chilling atmospherics, some of the others as well, but, with the exception of the 2009 reboot, I don't find these movies particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not scary. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes. There are numerous jump-scares, of course, but that's not what I'm talking about.

Part II doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 87 minutes. It introduces the adult Jason Voorhees, but he's noticeably smaller in stature and more human than in later sequels. A couple of times the main protagonist, Ginny (Amy Steel), is able to deter him fairly easily (like opening a car door or kicking him in the groin). Speaking of Ginny, she's a fine heroine in the manner of Alice in the first film and Pam in Part V. Kirsten Baker plays the requisite hottie, Terry, and the filmmakers don’t fail to highlight her beauty. Unfortunately, the ambiguity of the ending is inexplicable.

GRADE: A-

(If you wonder why I rate a film like this so highly, I'm grading it according to what it is: a slasher flick. No genre is beyond redemption or above contempt and this one delivers the goods). || Since I already watched the first film last month, decided in celebration of the day, re-watched Part 2 and still highly entertaining though pretty tame by today's standards. Thought the cast was also a bit better than the first. Still has scenes that make little sense (how exactly did Jason find Alice?) but was fun nevertheless. **3.75/5**"
4488.0,Friday the 13th,Camp counselors are stalked and murdered by an unknown assailant while trying to reopen a summer camp that was the site of a child's drowning.,"They were warned...They are doomed...And on Friday the 13th, nothing will save them.",Horror,95,1980-05-09,en,6.4,3095,5.6125,"Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer, Kevin Bacon, Jeannine Taylor, Harry Crosby","Sean S. Cunningham, Victor Miller","lake, new jersey, drowning, summer camp, sadism, villain, woods, revenge, murder, stalking, serial killer, cabin, camp, slasher, summer, series of murders, 1950s, teenager","Clearly, the team behind “Friday the 13th” expected at least to make a reasonable profit out of it, but I seriously doubt that anyone involved in the making of this film even considered the possibility of it becoming the cult classic that it is today. Victor Miller, who wrote the story, openly admitted that he was riding off the success of Halloween (1978). The late actress Betsy Palmer even claimed that, after reading the script, she thought the story was trash (well… she actually used another word), but she took the job because she needed a new car. Little did she know when she took the role that her character would immortalize her as one of the biggest horror icons of all times.

Yes, it is evident that Victor Miller and Don Mancini capitalized on the success of Halloween (1978), but the truth is that “Friday the 13th” manages to stand out on its own, and in the end, other than being two slasher films about a killer who prowls around murdering teenagers; these two films don’t really have that much in common. To this day, John Carpenter’s “Halloween” is considered a more “serious” horror film (for the lack of a better word), while “Friday the 13th” remains a classic, but is still seen as a less underappreciated respectable flick. Why? Probably because, even though I absolutely love it, I will admit that “Friday the 13th” certainly has a campy nature (no pun intended). In my case, I don’t mind the campiness, I actually enjoy it.

In “Friday the 13th”, the story begins in 1958, in a summer camp named Camp Crystal Lake. We see two young camp counselors who are about to have sex, when someone appears out of nowhere and murders them both. We don’t get to see who the killer is, since the murders are shown in a point-of-view shot, and the reason behind the murders is not yet explained either.
The story then jumps to 1980 and it focuses on Alice, a young and sensible girl who, along with other kids of her age, is hired as a counselor by a man who attempts to reopen Camp Crystal Lake. Unfortunately, someone doesn’t seem too thrilled about the reopening of the place, which will lead to a series of gruesome murders. Could it be the same person who killed those two counselors back in 1958? In the end, it is Alice who will have to come face to face with the killer and fight for her own life.

*Spoilers ahead*

Plot-wise, “Friday the 13th” may not be too remarkable, but it doesn’t really need to be either. I could be wrong, but I believe this film first introduced the formula that consists on: a summer camp as a scenario, a pinch of mystery, plentiful gore, creative deaths and a gratifying reveal towards the last minutes. Just like this film attempted to ride off the success of a previous slasher, ironically, “Friday the 13th” itself ended up generating a bunch of (arguably) inferior clones as well. Of course, commercial success doesn’t necessarily imply quality, but I do think “Friday the 13th” has a certain something that makes it appealing to a lot of people.

For the most part, the characters in this film seem somewhat generic and one dimensional, which is a common attribute in slasher films. There really isn’t much of a character development, and we don’t get to know them very well. Most of the victims are young boys and girls who seem to be in the camp to have a good time themselves, rather than working hard to make the children happy. Surely, these characters don’t really deserve to die for being immature and silly, but at the same time, it is hard to feel too bad for them either. However, the first character that gets killed after the time-jump seems genuinely sweet and caring, so one obviously feels bad for her when she is brutally murdered, just for being naïve enough to trust a stranger. I think this death after the time-jump was a perfect move, because it sets the tone perfectly for what is going to happen later: a bunch of innocent young people will be brutally murdered without having done anything to deserve it. 

The acting in “Friday the 13th” is mostly plain or, in some cases, over the top, which, along with the silly dialogs and lines, provides the film with an enjoyable campy nature. The late Betsy Palmer, who played the role of Mrs. Pamela Voorhees, was nominated for a Razzie Award, and while I love the character of Mrs. Voorhees and I felt bad to hear about Palmer’s passing, I can understand why she was nominated. It’s true, Betsy’s portrayal of Jason’s mother is over the top and it can appear as unintentionally funny during her delivery of some of her lines, but at the same time, I’m not sure if I can imagine the character being played differently at this point. Then we have Crazy Ralph, literally jumping out of a closet, telling the kids to leave, because they’re doomed and that Camp Crystal Lake has a death curse. This character, aside from being called “Crazy” Ralph, (in case anyone didn’t notice that he was crazy in the first place), is perhaps one of the campiest characters in the slasher subgenre, which earned him an iconic place in the franchise and even a small part in the first sequel.

“Friday the 13th” offers a nice variety of gory murders, with Tom Savini in charge of the makeup effects, which is an undeniable seal of quality. The legendary “axe in the face” death scene is perhaps one of the most memorable parts of the film for many fans. In this scene, Sean Cunningham and Tom Savini not only offer a morbidly satisfying and shocking on-screen death, we also get a lot of tension and suspense preceding the murder, which creates a feeling of panic and desperation. 

The final confrontation between Alice, our final girl, and Mrs. Voorhees, Jason’s vengeful mother is really extensive for a good cause, as it helps to build a lot of tension that culminates with a gruesome murder. To some extent, when Mrs. Voorhees suddenly appears out of nowhere and begins to tell the story of what happened to that “poor boy”, it is easy to assume that she is responsible for the carnage, or at least, that she is involved to a certain degree. Up until this point, we had never seen her before throughout the entire film, so why is she popping out now? There are no other supporting characters left to blame for the murders and Mrs. Voorhees shows up the exact moment when things got really ugly? What could she be doing at Camp Crystal Lake in the middle of the night, other than murdering boys and girls? Of course, our final girl, even though she is not unintelligent, seems to be somewhat oblivious of what is really happening and this is what makes up want to scream “Get out of there!”. Mrs. Voorhees is basically explaining the whole story to the audience, but at the same time, she is subtly revealing herself as the killer, before going into a weird trance, in which she starts talking as if she is possessed by Jason, her own son, who drowned at the lake (I always considered this like a switched version of Norman Bates and his mother). 

As mentioned before, the acting in this final confrontation is not exactly brilliant and the audience ends up getting more than they probably needed to understand the story, since Mrs. Voorhees’ monologue basically goes into detail of what happened, just to make sure we get it right (just like when they make sure that we understand that Ralph is a crazy old man, by calling him “Crazy Ralph”). Regardless of the over the top acting and the spoon-feeding to the audience, the confrontation is full of tension, and it is still considered one of the most memorable “killer reveal” moments in the history of horror for a good reason. || Some films benefit with time, maturing and holding a nostalgic charm. Others rot like a bad apple, like _Friday the 13th_. Perhaps I had to be alive in 1980 to actually appreciate this one, but it is really not as groundbreaking as some people like to think it is, rather another spin on films like _Psycho_ and _Halloween_, minus the budget. And the acting. || Certainly not the first slasher movie, but arguably the most influential.

This original film stands alongside _Part V: A New Beginning_ as the only two movies in a 12 film long franchise where they play the killer as a mystery, I think that premise would wear thin had they tried it every go around, but here it is executed, if not masterfully, at least to the film's benefit. _Friday the 13th_ is a movie I'll watch at least once a year, ever since I first saw it in the early 2000s. Maybe it's not the best movie ever, or even the best slasher movie ever, Hell, maybe it's not even the best Friday the 13th movie ever, but the fact that I'm not sick of it yet has to count for something.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || ***Somewhat fun and entertaining, but adds campiness and bad writing***

The first two films from 1980-1981 are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths at a remote camp, but the franchise introduced a campy element with this third installment, which pretty much plagued the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. 

Still, this is the main detriment of ""Part III,” released in 1982. The opening credits song tips the viewer off that this isn't a wholly serious horror film (like the first two), which is compounded when a couple of the protagonists meet some sinister bikers at a convenience store in the boonies, which takes place about 25 minutes into the story. These hoodlums are too cartoonish to take serious and so it's hard to take the horror seriously either. This doesn't mean it's not entertaining in some ways, just that it's my least favorite installment.

The dubious writing doesn’t help. For instance, why does Fox go into the barn? Speaking of that dang barn, why on earth are so many characters preoccupied with it? It’s like the writer wanted to come up with any possible excuse to use the barn as a focal point. Also, why does Vera leave Shelly to go outside and hangout by herself? I realize she probably wanted to get away from the pathetic guy, but she informs him that she’s going to go outside with a sense of purpose and come back in, but she really doesn’t do much outside. Sequences like this reflect lame writing. 

Another noticeable difference between Part III and the two previous films is that, although the story takes place in the area of Crystal Lake, the film was shot in Southern Cal instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Melody Ranch (where the barn is located). The geography is obviously dryer and the contrast in setting is too glaring. While it could be argued that the different environment provides a nice change of tone, the setting seems too one-dimensional.

As usual with the series, the film thankfully features a nice assortment of females: three white girls, a Hispanic and a black woman, the latter being the biker chick, Fox. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the main protagonist, Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is probably it, followed by the stoner chick, Chili; not to mention Debbie and Vera (Debbie has a quality bikini scene).

BOTTOM LINE: Part III is entertaining in some ways and is notable for switching the filming locations to dry Southern California, not to mention Jason is bigger and more imposing than in Part II and he finally acquires his iconic hockey mask. Yet it’s my least favorite of the franchise due to the goofy elements, the subpar writing and the limited setting with too much focus on a freakin’ barn.

The film runs 95 minutes.

GRADE: C || Decided to get in one more Friday the 13th movie and this one reminded me why it's not high on my list in the series, though I liked portions of it, just nothing involving Shelly and watching it in 2D, the shots made for 3D are pretty annoying. I will say, I did like the lead actress and I'm a fan of the hockey mask Jason. **3.0/5**"

In truth it's a good old 1980s slasher pic, but that doesn't necessarily make it worthy to anyone outside of the hardiest of hardest Friday13th franchise fans. The kills and gore quotient are high, bloody and gooey, with the kills not lacking for invention, but plot formula is tired and weary. Crispin Glover makes for something of a curio appearance in the piece, whilst a young Corey Feldman rocks up for a bit of Damien Thorn channelling.

Some series fans love it whilst others abhor it. Question is? We know it wasn't to be the final chapter after all, so how does it hold up against the others that would follow it down the bloody intestine strewn path? || Doesn't divert much from the formula of the first three films, but does add two new elements which I actually enjoyed. I am curious though, when they made this one, did they **actually** think that this was going to be the final chapter, or where they fully aware they were gonna keep beating that horse for decades to come?

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || ***Another entertaining sequel, better than Part III***

The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths at camp, but the franchise introduced a campy element with Part III, which pretty much plagued the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. 

Released in 1984, ""Part IV: The Final Chapter"" is an exception as it thankfully omits the cartoonish elements of ""Part III"" and serves up another take on the same basic story. This time several youths go out to their parents' vacation home on Crystal Lake to party where they meet the sister & brother from a nearby house, Trish & Tommy Jarvis (Kimberly Beck and Corey Feldman). Then Jason attacks! There’s also someone at the lake hunting Jason for vengeance. 

Like Part III, this film was shot on the West Coast instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Topanga Canyon, which is 30 minutes south of Santa Clarita, as well as Zaca lake, about 150 miles northwest. The geography is obviously dryer and an all-around contrast to the first two films, but this won’t matter to most viewers.

As usual, the film features a nice assortment of females. This time out, there are no ""minorities"" like the previous movie; the ladies consist of five white girls and a winsome petite mother. Trish is my favorite, the best heroine yet (until the next film that is), followed by Samantha; but they all have their points of interest. 

BOTTOM LINE: Despite its title, Part IV is far from the ""Final Chapter."" There would be four more sequels before the 80s even ran out! In any case, this is another entertaining segment in the series with a fresh assortment of characters and a new female protagonist. This sequel is notable for introducing the character of Tommy Jarvis and hinting at the lingering diabolic Voorhees spirit. 

Like its predecessor, Part IV was shot in dry Southern Cal and Jason, with his iconic mask, is bigger and more imposing than in Part II. While the movie is a step up from Part III it's not as effective as the first two films, largely because of the uneventful mid-section and the rather lame portrayal of Jason in the last act, although his unmasked face is great.

The film runs 9l minutes and the uncut version 97 minutes.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || ***Heavily criticized, but one of the most entertaining and re-watchable installments***

I find the ""Friday the 13th"" flicks appealing because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods; the presence of a lunatic killer just adds an air of danger and excitement. Although this fourth sequel in the series is maligned by many, it's the installment that turned me on to the long-running franchise. Say what you will but “A New Beginning” ( aka Part V), is one of the most entertaining and re-watchable segments.

Released in 1985, the story centers around a halfway house for troubled youths deep in the sticks (filmed in Camarillo, California). Tommy Jarvis, who is still traumatized by the events of the previous film, arrives at the home, now approximately 17 years-old. Murders slowly start mounting up leading to an action-packed climax. Since Jason clearly died in the previous film, who is the killer? Is it Tommy?

The first two films in the series were serious murder-mystery horror pictures. Part III added campy elements, which is the case with Part V. Although ""A New Beginning"" plays it semi-straight, it's filled with black humor (e.g. when the ambulance man kneels over a hacked-up body and makes a hilarious comment to the frightened youths standing nearby), not to mention the OTT goofy mother/son hillbillies. In fact, there are so many laugh-out-loud moments that it's almost a comedy. Which is not to say it's bad; like I said, Part V is one of the most entertaining segments. If the campy hillbillies turn you off just chalk 'em up to side entertainment.

The deep woods halfway house for people with emotional problems is an interesting set-up and caught my attention right away; it sets this installment apart from all the others. In addition, Tommy, played by John Shepherd, is an interesting character: He's understandably troubled and there's a mystique about him (is he a hero or a mad killer or maybe both?), not to mention he can kick some arse when he has to. Speaking of which, a critic complained about Tommy's fighting skills being unrealistic, but it makes sense that he would do something like learn martial arts over the past five years to occupy his time and cope with emotional trauma and loss. There's nothing unrealistic about it.

The film is also notable for featuring perhaps the best assortment of women in the series: three blondes, a brunette and a redhead, no less. The lead blonde, ""Pam,"" is played by Melanie Kinnaman, the protagonist of the story, who's so striking it's hard to take your eyes off her. What's interesting is that Melanie is one of the few comely females in the cast that is never shown nude or partially nude. She's fully clothed the entire picture (although she has a wet-shirt moment) proving that a woman doesn't have to flaunt her beauty cheaply to get attention or instill awe.

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film). Aside from being entertaining like most of the installments, it should be pointed out that Part V does something better than any other film in the series: It shows the long term negative EFFECT Jason (and his mother) can have on people. Jason isn't physically present but his lingering, haunting diabolic presence permeates the atmosphere. So much so that Jason de-creates in his own lunatic image with the killer and Tommy Jarvis donning the mask at the end. In fact, the ending leads one to the conclusion that either Tommy has gone psycho or that he is the new embodiment of Jason (although Part VI implies that it was a dream or Tommy's imagination and not reality). This isn't that outlandish of a theory given that ""Jason Goes to Hell"" (Part IX) explains that the demonic thing that possesses Jason has body-leaping powers. It may very well be concluded that Roy and, later, Tommy were possessed by the spirit of Jason in this manner. Adding support to this theory is the superhuman strength displayed by the killer throughout. For example, he literally smashes through a door, breaking it to pieces, he hurls an adult man up and through a window, he decapitates a guy with one swipe of a cleaver, etc. No ordinary human being could do these things, unless they were possessed by a malevolent force/entity. ***END SPOILER*** 

Some of the cussing is a bit overdone. I'm sure the filmmakers threw it in as a comical touch. It goes without saying that if you find overkill cussing offensive you might want to skip this one.

BOTTOM LINE: ""A New Beginning"" is just a fun and entertaining deep woods horror flick with numerous highlights noted above, including black humor and camp. It’s easily the most all-around kinetic movie in the series and one of the few that works as a mystery, like the original.

As to the criticisms regarding the absence of a certain character, again, the film does a good job of showing what can ultimately happen to those severely traumatized by Jason. Not to mention the fact that Jason IS present in spirit, literally. So, yes, it's a vital part of the series.

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Camarillo, Beverly Hills & Los Angeles).

An absolute hoot of a addition to the Friday 13th franchise. As is often the way with the ""Friday"" sequels, you can talk to one horror fan and this is the worst of the bunch, talk to another and it's the best etc etc. There's a more airy touch here and it serves the formula well, which if the series' fans are honest, is a formula that was getting stale quite early in the chain, so any sort of new ideas or direction is most welcome. 

After a glorious James Bond parody opens the credits sequence, accompanied by Harry Manfredini's superbly thunderous musical score, we get long running tormented character Tommy, here played by Thom Matthews, digging up Jason Voorhees' corpse so as to make sure the evil one is dead - oh and to kill him again. Enter a glorious Frankenstein homage (cheeky steal if you like) that sets us up for another round of stalk and dismember as Jason heads back to Camp Crystal Lake, which is now called Camp Forest Green!

The kills are not particularly inventive, but there's a real thud of humour about much of them. From an American Express Card to a bloody smiley face imprint, it's clear the makers have a glint in their eyes. We even get an early appearance from Tony Goldwyn, some four years before Ghost would make him a known name. Adding to the quality score, which BTW rattles around home cinema speakers lie a supernatural entity, is Jon Kranhouse's cinematography, which is gorgeous in colour lens selections. All that and you get an Alice Cooper soundtrack as well. 

From joyful reanimation to a suitably watery finale, this part 6 delivers more than enough to almost make you rush out to rent part 7. Almost... 6.5/10 || _Jason Lives_ is the _Friday the 13th_ movie that starts injecting comedy into the franchise, which after 5 movies of more or less the same tone, is understandable. Prior entires have still had fun, but _Part VI_ has multiple, actual jokes. This bugs a lot of people, but me? Not so much. It's definitely not the high point of the franchise, but I still would never skip this one during a marathon.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || ***Jason lives again as a horrific zombie, plus Megan (Jennifer Cooke)***

Released in 1986, ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" is notable for being the premiere of the zombie Jason as his rotting corpse is resurrected in the prologue indirectly through the actions of Tommy Jarvis and a friend who recently got out of a mental institution. This prologue also shows that Tommy didn't murder Pam at the end of Part V and that he was simply experiencing hallucinations from his trauma with the diabolic Voorhees spirit. Another difference with Part VI is that we finally get to see a busload of kids, children, at Crystal Lake, although they changed the name to Forest Green. Tommy runs to the local police to inform them that Jason has been resurrected but the sheriff, of course, doesn't believe him (would you?). His hot daughter, Megan, is attracted to Tommy and, when the bloody body count rises, the sheriff realizes that Jason is indeed alive.

Tommy Jarvis is played by Thom Mathews rather than John Shepherd, who was excellent in Part V. Thom is a worthy replacement, but I prefer Shepherd's brooding charisma.

The film features one of the best Friday girls in Megan, played by Jennifer Cooke, although Pam from the previous film is my favorite. Other than that, though, the females in Part VI are rather weak, although the redhead in the Volkswagen is notable (Nancy McLoughlin). 

The campiness of Part III and Part V returns for this installment, particularly with the goofy paintball warriors and the graveyard caretaker. But “Jason Lives” is noticeably superior to Part III and shares the kinetic vibe of Part V.

As far as locations go, Part VI returns to the East for filming, being shot roughly 40 miles East of Atlanta in Covington & Rutledge .

BOTTOM LINE: You either like the Friday the 13th series or you don't. Part VI is another retread of the same Friday formula with the entertaining spirit of Part V and the distinction of Jason now being totally inhuman, a horrific zombie; not to mention the addition of children at the camp. It also has a better story than parts III and IV with the sheriff and his daughter & Tommy going after Jason, plus Megan is one of the top Friday girls in the series. 

The film runs 91 minutes and the cut version 86 minutes.

A killer buried, but NOT dead.

Jason Voorhees is unintentionally revived from his watery grave by a girl with telekinetic powers.

And so the Friday the 13th bandwagon rolled on for another sequel, a part 7, that once again pitches the unlikable Voorhees against a number of annoying teen types. Those involved here deserve some respect for at least trying to add some impetus to the flagging series, here by way of a gimmick, that of a telekinetic foe played by Lar Park-Lincoln, but ultimately it just ends up same old same old. In fact it's a considerable step down from the more fun and funky part 6. 

The telekinetic issue becomes something of a side-bar, which is annoying as there's a potentially great thread involving a devious doctor (Terry Kiser) that never reaches the heights it should have. There's a little thought in the writing as regards grief management, but ultimately all hope of something more substantial gives way to Voorhees slicing and dicing kids we don't care about anyway. We could watch the first 3 films if we wanted that again.

A decent confrontation fight at the finale saves it from stinkerville, but really it's a weak sequel that offers nothing to warrant it being made in the first place. 4/10 || I know a lot of die-hard horror fans who hold _The New Blood_ as either their favourite _Friday the 13th_ movie since the original, or even just straight up their favourite _Friday the 13th_ movie. Personally though, _The New Blood_ is the franchise low. It's arguably the most ridiculous, but that isn't the problem for me. The problem is that they take something that ridiculous, and then treat it so seriously, and riding that line doesn't work with _Friday the 13th_ for me. The older and more grounded first few movies I dig, and then the absurd but having fun with it movies that came later I dig, but _Part VII_ simultaneously doesn't try to be either of those things, and falls apart from the word go.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || ***""Carrie"" vs. Jason with a subpar script***

Released in 1988, ""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood"" takes place about ten years after the previous film, which explains its title ""The New Blood"": Tommy Jarvis is no longer in the picture and there's a new set of youthful blood for Jason to spill. This installment is the second to feature Jason as an inhuman rotting corpse and the F/X of Jason at the end are great. The highlight of Part VII is the inclusion of a Carrie-like heroine with mental powers who squares off against Jason at the end. We also get Terry Kiser as Tina's therapist, Dr. Crews. If you're not familiar with Mr. Kiser, he played the charismatic preacher in 1968's ""Rachel, Rachel"" in the mind-blowing Pentecostal service sequence.

Although my title blurb describes this segment as ""Carrie vs. Jason,"" it's the same Friday the 13th formula, but with a protagonist who has Carrie-like abilities. The script is weak however and needed tweaked to work out the kinks, which makes it the weakest in the series next to Part III (and the last act of Part IX).

This entry features a quality collection of females, which the franchise is renowned for, but the creators failed to milk them for their potential, so to speak (and I don’t mean nudity or sleaze since the movie has a little bit of both). For instance Jane (Staci Greason) and Robin (Elizabeth Kaitan) are the top women, but not enough is done with them. Jane’s role is too brief as she’s the first to buy the farm while Robin eventually has some quality screen time, but the director fails to truly capture her beauty. For those who care, the attractive Sandra (Heidi Kozak) has a brief skinny dipping scene. Meanwhile Melissa (Susan Jennifer Sullivan) is decent, but she’s depicted as such a biyatch you almost WANT her to die.	

As far as locations go, Part VII was shot in Southern Alabama, just northeast of Mobile, with bits done in Southern Cal (e.g. the house where Robin is killed is in Topanga).

BOTTOM LINE: Part VII is another retread of the same Friday formula with the distinction of the protagonist having psycho-kinetic powers and, like the previous film, Jason is now totally inhuman, an infernal monster. In addition, the climax is the best yet, featuring the ""Carrie"" vs. Jason fight and a spectacular explosion. Unfortunately Part VII fumbles the ball a little in regards to its subpar depiction of the women. Worst of all, the script is amateurish like Part III. Nevertheless, it's a fairly entertaining installment that thankfully lacks the camp of III, V and VI.

NOTE ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER***): No, the corpse of Tina's Dad was not left in the lake for ten years, the original ending made it clearer that her Dad's body coming out of the lake was a product of Tina's mind powers, although the long chain was real. Of course, this doesn't explain why Jason's corpse was still in the lake early in the film, but I suppose we could chalk that up to the curse that was on Crystal Lake and the fact that no one in their right mind would want to visit that part of the lake (near ""Camp Blood"") by this point in the series.

The film runs 88 minutes.

Jason Vorhees is once again brought back to life and goes on a kill crazy spree aboard a boat bound for Manhattan.

As is the norm with the ""Friday 13th"" sequels, this one garners scorn and praise in equal measure, so you roll the dice and take your chance really. By now the makers were trying to come up with new ideas to keep the series afloat, here the gimmick is to take Vorhees out of his Camp Crystal Lake ""comfort"" zone, and pitch him on a boat - a boat which naturally is full of ripe high schoolers who are ripe for killing in variously gruesome ways. 

The presence of Manhattan in the title is not wholly accurate since three quarters of the pic is set on the said boat, with standard series rules applying, though Vorhees seems to have attained the dexterity of a paratrooper given that he remarkably appears in kill scenes where the time frame is impossible for him to do so. The sequences in Manhattan are fun, which only makes one lament that more time wasn't spent on this particular gimmick.

The acting is generally weak, while the effects work is standard fare - though the cinematography (Bryan England) is very impressive. So all told, it's another divisive ""Friday"" sequel, from breasts and butts, to blood and bone, and onto The Big Apple, part 8 you will either hate or think it's great. 6/10 || Absolutely ridiculous, and a totally misleading title. Jason still kills stuff, and that's fun I guess, but what a trashfire ending to an already pretty bad movie.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || ***Jason takes a cruise to the big city!***

Released in 1989, ""Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"" is a nice change of pace as the series was suffering from banality at this point; the previous installment is a prime example (people complain about Part V but at least it had an interesting new story angle with Tommy Jarvis going to the halfway house in the woods seeking succor for his psychological trauma, etc.). Part VII tried something new with the Carrie-like protagonist, and that entry has a great finale, but it was hampered by a subpar, amateurish script. 

Part VIII changes things up by switching the normal location of Crystal Lake (and surrounding area) to a ship going to Manhattan with a group of high school kids and adults aboard. Of course, Jason also gets on the vessel and starts systematically wiping out the youths. A handful of them make it to Manhattan, but so does Jason! The different setting is what distinguishes Part VIII. 

The story is split into four parts: The prologue takes place on Crystal Lake and features Jason's resurrection, which is a great opening. The brief first act takes place down the river from Crystal Lake at a docking inlet where the youths & adults board the vessel. The long second act takes place on the ship and the final act involves the survivors on a lifeboat and their adventures in Manhattan pursued by Jason.

Winsome Jensen Daggett stands out as the heroine Rennie and places as one of my top 3 or 4 Friday girls. Peter Mark Richman is also notable as Rennie's peculiar uncle/guardian and Scott Reeves as Rennie's sort-of boyfriend. Sharlene Martin is a highlight as Tamara and the filmmakers show off her physique, but she's so devious that she's a turn-off despite her good looks. Kelly Hu is also on hand.

The main complaint I hear about this entry is that it's called ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" but only the final act takes place in the city. This criticism never made any sense to me as the film spends more than enough time in the big city, the final 37 minutes, not to mention an opening snippet. The fact that the entire second act occurs on the ship keeps the movie from being one-dimensional.

This installment reveals that a fairly large river flows from Crystal Lake to an inlet with access to the ocean. The yacht in the beginning drifts down the river to the bay where the ship is docked. This is how Jason inconspicuously reaches the inlet. If there’s any doubt about this (due to the mistaken claim that the docking inlet IS Crystal Lake), pay attention to what the crazy deckhand says later on. 

As far as locations go, Part VIII was shot in Vancouver & Britannia Beach, British Columbia; Los Angeles (the alley way & wharf scenes); and New York City.

BOTTOM LINE: Part VIII is a worthy entry in the series and is notable for trying something new by placing the main cast in a cruise ship environment and the big city, plus Jensen Daggett is a highlight as the female protagonist. It's actually better than Part III and VII. Interestingly, Jason's facial F/X (shown at the end) aren't as good as the previous two installments, but they're serviceable.  

The film runs 100 minutes.

And, 'Rated R. Under 17 not admitted without a parent.'

(Laughs) ...

Those classic horror film radio trailers used to scare the weebie-jeebies out of me! But boy, did I love them wholeheartedly.

(Pondering ... in remembrance)

Where John Carpenter's independent cult opus ""Halloween"" is concerned, the radio trailer had been no less terrifying. In fact, it made my blood run ice cold. . .

Though Halloween, one of my most beloved horror films in cinematic history, debuted (theatrically) in 1978, it would not be until October of 1980 that my family and I would spend our ""Movie Date Night"" at what had been a gorgeous movie theater in Gurnee, IL., buying hot dogs, Raisinettes, popcorn, and drinks from its state-of-the-art concession areas, and bracing ourselves for the terror which we were about to watch on one of the theater's humongous screens. Even from that time, I had cover and poster love: Book covers, album covers, and yes, movie posters. It was the artwork. Cover and poster art has always fascinated me. And upon seeing the poster art for Halloween, I fell smitten. For it had been one of the most unique movie posters that I'd ever seen at that time ... And I never forgot it. The artwork, featuring a man's hand wrapped around the handle of a butcher's knife, its pointed tip shown to be in alignment with the face of a Jack O' Lantern, was some of the most creative - not to mention original - movie poster art that my eyes had ever beheld at that time. To this day, it STILL reverberates. I can remember my reaction to it so well, what just standing in that beautiful lobby and staring at the poster for Halloween as it hung in its frame on the movie house wall. Too good. Too good.

'The Night He Came Home!' ...

If there is one horror film antagonist who has left a permanent emboss of the word ""terror"" on my psyche, it's Michael Myers. From the moment Halloween opened on the screen, fear came along to take up its abode within my entire being. The score, titled ""Halloween Theme"", which is also the (Main Title), was so eerily distinctive that the entire theater audience fell into silence - every patron hanging on to every piercing chord of it ... Perhaps me, especially, considering my own gift of music. The incredible John Carpenter not only directed and co-wrote (with Debra Hill) the screenplay for Halloween, but he also composed the entire soundtrack. . .himself. Carp is a badass for sure!

Moving on. . .

Set in the fictive town of Haddonfield, IL., this legendary cult film opens to a crowd of children out trick-or-treating on Halloween night. And these candy revelers include a six-year-old boy named Michael, whose choice of costume is a clown suit with a mask. All is well; a seemingly fun-filled All Hollows' Eve night ... Until Michael returns home from his evening of candy collecting, walks, almost mechanically, into his family's kitchen, selects a butcher's knife from the cutlery set, waits until his older sister's boyfriend (who's just finished having sexual relations with her) leaves, then walks, mechanically, upstairs to that same sister's bedroom - catching her unawares. When she turns around (still naked after her sexual escapade) to address him as her younger brother, Michael begins to take his turn penetrating her. . .with the sharp point of the knife. And he doesn't stop his blade puncturing until his sister collapses. He then walks back downstairs and goes out in the front yard to wait. Their parents soon return home to find Michael just standing outside - his face still covered by his mask - with the bloodied knife in his young hand. One of his parents lifts the mask, and we get our first glimpse at the six-year-old face of Michael Myers. The year was 1963.

That was just the opening.

It would be fifteen years later (in 1978) before the now 21-year-old Michael, escaped from the Smith's Grove Sanitarium, could return to Haddonfield for the purpose of laying claim on his former childhood home: Sitting unsold since the time he murdered his sister, ended up at Smith's Grove as the result of it, and succumbed to the abandonment of his parents. When Michael Myers returned to Haddonfield, all Hell broke loose ... Literally.

A phenomenally directed cinematic ouvre, Halloween stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, the teenaged protagonist who becomes the hunted of Michael Myers; Donald Pleasence, who portrays Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis; Brian Andrews, who was cast to play Tommy Doyle; and Nancy Loomis as Annie Brackett, one of Laurie's two best friends, respectively.

Shot on a $325,000.00 budget, Halloween would go on to earn over $71 million worldwide ... For a reason.

A true cult legend is this Carpenter masterpiece. It is sheer filmmaking ingenuity, a landmark of cinema, and more than worthy of each one of its five stars. || _Halloween's_ a classic movie. No doubt about it. One of the seminal films of the slasher genre, and a more-than-worthy inclusion to any Halloween season horror movie marathon. But I think people give it a reputation in terms of quality that it doesn't fully deserve. The opening ten minutes, and the closing ten minutes, are both **brilliant**. But everything in between? It's kind of... Somehow, both boring and annoying. The kills are good if that's your sort of thing, but everything in the meat of _Halloween_ is old hat. Now of course it wasn't at the time, but when I've spent my formative years watching other movies doing it better (and acting it better), it doesn't really matter who did it first.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || _**The Boogeyman cometh**_

A soulless killer, Michael Myers, escapes from the asylum and returns to the Illinois town where he murdered his sister 15 years earlier to wreak havoc on Halloween night. Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers’ seriously concerned doctor.

John Carpenter’s “Halloween” (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, “Halloween” was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963), “A Bay of Blood” (1971) “Torso (1973), “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) and “Black Christmas” (1974). “Friday the 13th” (1980) and its sequels took the “Halloween” template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.

Whilst I prefer the “Friday” films, “Halloween” has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt “The Slumber Party Massacre” (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as “Friday the 13th Part 3” (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.

Although the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What’s NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it’s not late October.

Other problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls’ conversation walking home from school, which doesn’t ring true. Speaking of the girls, they’re decent, but not nearly as good as the “Friday” films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in “Psycho”). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers’ abode speaking portentously.

I appreciate “Halloween” because it’s classy, atmospheric and it’s a flick pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it’s a tad overrated by gushing fans.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || **An honorable continuation, which respects the previous work without bringing anything new.**

I don't like Halloween, and I've had time to say it before, but I recognize that it's the best time for good horror films to be broadcast on television. These days, I saw this film as a follow-up to “Halloween”. I have no doubt that it is a worthy sequel, perhaps one of the best I have seen, in that it is strictly faithful to the original and is made with quality.

It is directed by Rick Rosenthal, but the team and cast remained the same, with the addition of specific names, and John Carpenter's inspiration continues in the script he wrote and in the attention he undoubtedly gave to the entire project. Pleasance is the actor who looks in the best shape here. He finally had better material and more time to show some value on stage. Jamie Lee Curtis has essentially stayed the same and retains much of what he did. It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't bring any surprises either. The soundtrack also doesn't bring anything new, maintaining the essence of the first film's score, which is positive.

After its initial success, it is no wonder that this film's budget was more substantial than that of the first, and that the number of corpses that fall throughout the plot also increases. A plot that is not particularly brilliant, well written and elegant, and that falls into the most basic clichés of slasher horror without any shame, but that manages, at least, to respect coherence with the original film and give the villain an almost iconic aura, an invulnerability that makes him unstoppable and impossible to kill, and that turned him into a cinema icon. In addition to these points of relative quality, we also have good lighting and cinematography, good use of sets and filming locations, better quality effects that are as well executed and practical as those previously used. Everything comes together, therefore, to form the image of a film that is not surprising, but manages to respect and stand alongside its predecessor. || If you recall the conclusion of the first part (1979) then you’ll know that “Michael Myers” is now the deadliest critter alive (that’s assuming that term actually applies!). He’s certainly not forgotten “Laurie” (Jamie Lee Curtis) who’s recovering in the local hospital and luckily for him, this is a dimly lit and largely empty facility that he can wander around with relative impunity slaughtering all who come onto his path. Perhaps the only hope for the bed-ridden gal is the determined doctor “Loomis” (Donald Pleasence) who has teamed up with the sheriff (Charles Cyphers) to try to thwart this latest attempt on her life. What’s pretty clear is that this new, improved, version of “Myers” isn’t going to give up easily and that bullets and knives aren’t going to work. How to stop him? It starts off quite strongly, this film, but once the scenario switches to the hospital it becomes all a bit too stage-managed for me. The place is conveniently dark and gloomy; there is but a skeleton staff and so his rampaging is left unfettered whilst the hitherto poorly patient appears to develop live-preserving ninja skills. Also, fortunately for her her nemesis never appears to want to run anywhere so she can always make it to the timely departing elevator or the conveniently positioned window whilst he flails around robotically trying to impale her on/with something. It relies too heavily on trying to build a gradually increasing sense of peril but with has such inevitability about it that I thought it became quite sterile after about half an hour. JLC doesn’t really feature so much and the only real screaming that goes on here is that which suggests sequel. It’s watchable enough, but hasn’t the creepiness of the first one and most of his victims probably deserved their fates!"

After Halloween III veered in a new direction without Michael Myers, the indestructible killing machine of the franchise, the rights to the series changed hands and so it came to pass that part 4 (though part 3 in essence) brought Myers back. After being in a coma for ten years Myers is up for a transfer to a sanitarium, but wouldn't you know it, he wakes up and upon hearing he has a niece back in Haddonfield, he sets off on a murderous rampage back to where it all began.

It's one of the Halloween sequels that causes much debate among the series' fans, there are those who decry its lack of blood and its ordinary screenplay (both viable complaints), and those such as myself who like that it reverts back to what made the series start so brilliantly. Including a superbly devilish nod to the start of the 78 film.

Haddonfield becomes a town under siege, this the work of one monster, or as Donald Pleasence's scar faced doctor says - ""evil on two legs"". Myers once again is just glimpsed here and there, adding that unearthly suspense factor, until he hones in on his niece and her foster sister and the pursuit begins. Some of the interim characterisations are padding out the run time, the usual teen angst romantic flannel, but Pleasence's determined Dr. Loomis is never far away to remind us that everyone is doomed! Then of course there's the ending, which is an absolute beaut.

There's no brains on offer here, but it's a worthy sequel and a good tracer line for its iconic bogeyman. The story has moved on to another level and leaves the fans hankering for more. 7/10 || I don't know which of the four (or five, by this time next year) different _Halloween_ timelines to consider the ""official"" one, but I guess personally I've always considered the one the includes the ""_of Michael Myers_"" movies to be it for me. Not necessarily the best movies, but its the longest timeline, and (not counting _Season of the Witch_) the first. _Halloween 4_ is a good lead in for the rest of this particular continuity. It's certainly not a perfect movie, but if you're looking for some background kills to accompany your October vibes, you could do worse.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Better than the original; and one of the best 80’s slashers

Ten years after the events of “Halloween” and “Halloween II” (which both took place on Halloween night, 1978), Michael Myers escapes captivity a second time and again returns to his hometown in Illinois with a direly concerned Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) hot on his trail. Myers goes after his sister’s daughter, Jamie, and is willing to take down the whole town of Haddonfield if necessary.

“Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers” (1988) ranks with the best 80’s slasher flicks and is actually superior to the somewhat overrated progenitor of the genre, “Halloween” (1978). Whereas the original “Halloween” was an effective low-key but classy slasher and deserves credit for starting the craze, it wasn’t without flaws and “Halloween 4” (1.) fixes those issues and (2.) improves upon its strengths.

For instance, while the original movie takes place during Halloween in Illinois, you certainly wouldn’t know this by the footage since it clearly looks like summer. This movie, by contrast, definitely looks like it takes place during the fall and has an all-around superior Halloween ambiance with trick-or-treaters and so forth. Another example is the original’s lack of drive and the fact that Michael only kills a few teenagers and doesn’t seem all that formidable whilst this film features a mounting build-up of suspense and potently conveys Michael’s deadly formidableness while upping the ante in the body count.

Other advances includes the lack of lame dialogue (like in the original when the girls were walking home) and Dr. Loomis has much more interesting things to do than lurk in the bushes by the Myer’s dilapidated abode speaking ridiculously ominous words. When Loomis speaks portentously in this entry there’s great reason to believe him (take, for instance, what happens to the Police Station).

Yet another (arguable) improvement is the women: Although Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Kyes (Loomis) and PJ Soles were fine in the original, “Halloween 4” has winsome Ellie Cornell as Rachel and hottie Kathleen Kinmont as Kelly and the movie wisely takes advantage of their presence in a classy way. Rachel may not strike you as anything special at first, but as the story progresses she emerges as an attractive and noble final girl.

The “Friday the 13th” franchise debuted two years after “Halloween” in 1980; and by October, 1988, when this film was released, the “Friday” franchise had no less than seven films under its belt. Meanwhile, “Halloween 4” was only the third Michael Myers movie (keeping in mind that “Halloween 3” was curiously disconnected from the Michael Myers mythos).

“Friday the 13th” of course ripped-off “Halloween,” but simultaneously added original components to the genre (e.g. summer camp and everything revolving around it, easily the best females in the slasher genre, as well as an increasingly devolving supernatural killing machine). “Halloween 4” sort of gets its revenge by borrowing from the “Friday” films; for instance, the character of Jamie Lloyd and what happens to her mirrors Tommy Jarvis’ story arc from 3-4 years earlier. Perhaps the greatest revenge is that “Halloween 4” is better than any of the “Friday” sequels after “Part 2” and is at least as effective as “Part 2.”

The original “Halloween” was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena & Hollywood) while this one was filmed in the Salt Lake City, Utah, region. Like the first film, it’s streamlined and doesn’t overstay its welcome.

Suddenly, Doctor Daniel Challis finds himself thrust into a terrifying nightmare.",The night no one comes home.,"Horror, Science Fiction",99,1982-10-22,en,5.233,1439,2.0592,"Tom Atkins, Stacey Nelkin, Dan O'Herlihy, Michael Currie, Ralph Strait",Tommy Lee Wallace,"mask, factory, commercial, gas station, curfew, halloween, cult, hospital, doctor, death, surveillance camera, stonehenge, holiday horror","Conglomerate Carnage.

A different animal to the Halloween films that preceded and followed it, Season of the Witch is slowly but surely gaining an appreciation as a standalone horror film. Gone is Michael Myers’ indestructible killing machine, in his place is the nefarious Conal Cochran (Dan O’Herlihy), the owner of the Silver Shamrock corporation that specialises in Halloween masks. Cochran has a sinister plan this year - and it’s deadly - Dr. Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) and Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin) are caught in the middle of the vile plot and may just be the only salvation to Americana.

With Nigel Kneale involved in the writing process Season of the Witch is delightfully fiendish. There’s definite barbs being stung here about the commercialisation of holiday occasions, Cochran is intent on restoring Halloween to the true meaning of its origins, creating a Silver Shamrock world order in the process. Kneale would take his name off the credits when the studio tampered with his vision, a shame because his core essence remains -  even if Cochran as a Warlock Wicker Man type could well have been genius.

With John Carpenter and Debrah Hill over seeing things from their production chairs, the picture had supervision of some standing. Tommy Lee Wallace maybe directing but it feels like a Carpenter movie, from Dean Cundey’s photography -  Carpenter’s foreboding synth musical score – and the sharpness of the horror scenes (which are excellent), it’s not hard to see the “non Michael Myers” Halloween series  that Carpenter had envisaged after part 2 had been and gone. 

Boosted by an irritatingly potent advertisement jingle (a Silver Shamrock variation on London Bridge is Falling Down) that counts down the days to Halloween and the day of carnage, Season of the Witch is consistently gnawing away at the senses. Having Atkins and O’Herlihy propping up the acting helps, both are reliable performers for this material, while the race against time finale has edge of the seat credentials.

It doesn’t all work of course, there’s some drag and the narrative feels schizophrenic at times, while if it wasn’t for Cundey’s camera work then Wallace’s inept direction of scenes would be over exposed. Yet as it asks Halloween franchise fans some forgiveness for not actually being part of the franchise, it delivers a smart sci-fi horror hybrid that’s not without shock and awe. 7/10 || I distinctly remember being in Grade 8 when the film came out, and for four major reasons: 1) The excellent TV commercial, with John Carpenter's spooky music and the spider crawling out of the mouth of the mask; 2) The decent book adaptation written for young adults, that I read at the time, and thoroughly enjoyed; 3) Karen Carpenter died of a heart attack from anorexia nervosa; and 4) Major songs on the radio around that time were 'Centerfold' by The J. Geils Band and 'Bette Davis Eyes' by Kim Carnes. Though I had not yet seen the previous two films and wasn't old enough (the R-rating, and my parents were somewhat strict about that kind of thing), I really wanted to see it, but over the years, I never really got around to it, until recently I found used the entire 'Halloween' franchise on a 10-blu ray pack, and no longer have any sort of excuse, really.

I loved Wallace's work in 'Stephen King's It' (except for the last half-hour, but that's probably the book's fault and not the director's) and I thought his 'Vampires: Los Muertos' was rather underrated, so an added attraction for me was to watch his directorial debut here. He impressed me. I enjoyed the film and all of the extras on its blu ray very much. If you like horror films at all, you should watch this. 

Protagonists Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin are very good here, and I liked Dan O'Herlihy even better than when I had previously seen him in 'The Virgin Queen', 'Imitation of Life', 'The Cabinet of Caligari', 'Good Against Evil' and the first two 'RoboCop' films, and, as always, Dean Cundey provides excellent cinematographical work and the soundtrack by Carpenter and Alan Hogarth is dependably solid. Don't bother with the negative reviews that came out at the time the film was released: Most people were upset that the film didn't have Michael Myers in it, and didn't give it a chance. Find out for yourself--in my humble opinion, it's worth both purchasing and at least a rewatch. || A Halloween movie with no Michael Meyers?

Halloween 5: The Return of Michael Myers picks up where part 4 left off, only Michael is not dead, obviously! He's come back to Haddonfield intent on finally killing his niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris), who due to trauma has lost the ability to speak and now has a psychic link with mad uncle Michael. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is once again on hand to be nutty and spout ominous warnings, while all other folk in Myers' way are doomed.

It starts off quite promising, with shades of Frankenstein (1931) offering hope that maybe this wont be a sequel reeking of cash cow formula. Unfortunately it proves to be a false dawn, evidence that the writers were out of ideas, it lacks scares or a narrative spark to ignite suspense sequences. Harris is once again superb, Pleasence good fun as usual as he hams for all he is worth, while an extended sequence in a barn keeps fans of the series happy. It's passable fun for the slasher crowd, but ultimately it's unimaginative and a low point for the Halloween franchise. 5/10 || It's always neat when a slasher movie keeps a protagonist from its previous entry in the franchise for more than just an opening sequence. Maybe because it doesn't happen very often. _Halloween 5_ does have that going for it, as well as the standard ""Invincible dude stabs some folk for your enjoyment"" to a certain degree, and that's great, but beyond this there's not a whole lot good about _The Revenge of Michael Myers_. It did teach me some very incorrect things about the letter þ though, so I mean... There's that...

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole. || Michael Myers attacks trick-or-treaters on Halloween

Michael Myers survives his descent into a mind shaft from the previous movie and holds up with a hermit for a year before returning to his hometown in Illinois to attack his niece during Halloween and any trick-or-treaters who get in the way. As usual, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is on his trail.

“Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers” (1989) has the best sense of Halloween up to this point in the Michael Myers story arc with a considerable amount of the runtime involving the entertaining shenanigans of trick-or-treaters. While it’s not great like the previous entry it’s pretty much on par with the original 1978 movie and I actually prefer it even though it’s less classy/arty and more blunt. Remember the infamous closet scene in the original? This one has a similarly effective sequence revolving around a clothes chute and Jaimie Lloyd.

Ellie Cornell returns from the previous movie as Rachel and looks better, but it’s charismatic raven-haired Wendy Foxworth as Tina who’s the main protagonist (aside from Jaimie, that is) with blonde Tamara Glynn offering support as Samantha. There’s also a Fonzie wannabe and his bud.

This is the first movie in the series to throw in a little camp and comic booky-ness like the “Friday the 13th” franchise did with “Part III” (1982) and subsequent installments. The campiness has to do with the two goofy deputies and the comic booky-ness relates to the mysterious man-in-black and the corresponding twist at the end, which is supposed to segue into “Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995). Like “Friday the 13th Part III,” there’s a long sequence involving a similar-looking barn.

As with “Halloween 4,” the movie was shot in the greater Salt Lake City area, Utah.

Six years after a girl is accidently killed near Lake Erie in the Cleveland area, each of the offenders gets picked off on prom night by an unknown killer. Leslie Nielsen plays the principal of the school and father of the girl who died.

“Prom Night” (1980) combines elements of “Carrie” (1976), “Halloween” (1978) and “Saturday Night Fever” (1977). It contains the prom set-up & conniving students of the first one, the slasher killer & Jamie Lee Curtis of the second and the disco dancing of the third. The emphasis of a group of teens in high school is reminiscent of the later “Christine” (1983). The movie debuted 2.5 months after “Friday the 13th” and less than 21 months after “Halloween.” 

While it’s the least of these as far as polished filmmaking goes, it’s not far off and scores better on the female front than all of them except “Friday the 13th.” It’s basically a coming-of-age flick focusing on high school in the Great Lakes region with the threat of a masked assailant. There are no less than four possible suspects and I was unable to guess the slayer.

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in the Toronto area (Richmond Hill, St. James Cemetery, Scarborough Bluffs and Don Mills Collegiate Institute).

Released in early 1992, “Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil” is a slasher about a psycho priest who manifests stigmata and has a penchant for slaying fornicating teens. He escapes diocese custody in 1991 and returns to St. Basil Seminar, which has been converted into a vacation home. The only problem is that two teen couples have decided to have an alternative-to-the-prom celebration there.

The only two installments from the Prom Night series that are directly related are parts II and III, both of which involve the malevolent spirit of Mary Lou Maloney. Part I features a masked assailant and this one a crazy priest, who’s reminiscent of Marvel’s Foolkiller, which debuted some 18-19 years earlier. In any case, all four films (not including 2008’s “Prom Night”) are connected in that they begin with the 1957 prom at Hamilton High School, near Cleveland, Ohio (this location is clearly established in the original film, for anyone who cares).

The first half hour of “Prom Night IV” focuses on the local diocese and their problems with the cracked priest whom they secretly hold captive in the creepy cellar of a chapel or whatever. I thought this section of the movie was kind of boring but, at the same time, it was a nice change of pace. I liked how this installment returned to the more realistic tone of part I. The story perks up with the two girls, Meagan and Laura, played by brunette cutie Nicole de Boer and blonde tart Joy Tanner, as they prepare to sneak off to the remote summer house of one of their beau’s parents.

As you can see, the plot revolves around the conventional horror staple of the cabin-in-the-woods. The good news, however, is that this “cabin” used to be a monastery and so it’s a more interesting setting for the ensuing thrills than a rinky-dink cabin.

There are a couple of plot issues though. For instance, the priest doesn’t age a bit in 33 years. Even if he’s possessed by some supernatural force, this wouldn’t stop the normal aging process of the man’s body. I’m assuming that the producers simply didn’t have the funds for the make-up necessary to convincingly make him look like he was in his late-50s. So they said, “Who cares? It’s a friggin’ slasher flick.” Secondly, there’s a crank call that’s stereotypical in this genre and Meagan nonchalantly answers the phone even though the teens aren’t supposed to be at the house in the first place; and her boyfriend, whose parents own it, doesn’t object at all when he later finds out (maybe because he was focused on the matter at hand, lol).

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in the Toronto area.

GRADE: B-/C+ || **I wish someone would have delivered me from this snoozefest.**

I wasn't expecting a lot from this, but it still managed to disappoint me a little bit. Slasher flicks are known for being very simple and unpretentious movies that mostly offer entertainment and gruesome kills, which ""Prom Night IV"" mostly fails to provide.

In ""Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil"", two young couples decide to go on a romantic double date, after skipping their prom, for which they head up to a big secluded house that belongs to one of the boys in the group. There, they are chased by an insane former priest, Father Jonas, who has recently escaped from where he was being kept for 30 years.

My biggest problem with ""Prom Night IV"" is that the butchery takes a long time to happen and this is a mistake in a slasher flick. Let's see, for the first ten minutes (or so), we see Father Jonas, the bad guy. He really is an interesting character, with his intense gaze and his over-the-top demeanor. Later, we are introduced to the young characters, who, clearly, are going to be stalked by the aforementioned killer. During the second half an hour, the youngsters go into the house for their romantic getaway, where we see them getting intimate and, eventually, realizing that someone is lurking around. The kills are excessively delayed and end up happening after more than 50 minutes have passed and that's just a lot of time. So, the way I see it, ""Prom Night IV"" is not even that fun, which is something that a slasher flick should always be. They can be stupid, but the carnage should begin early.

The only potentially interesting aspect of this movie was never fully developed and it was barely even displayed during the first minutes. At some point, Father Jonas, the killer, begins to mumble something, like, 'Don't touch him, not there, he's too young...', which clearly idicates that Jonas was abused as a child. It is also heavily implied that Father Jonas was a homosexual, considering that he kisses two men before attacking them. I can only assume that the priest was dealing with an inner conflict, since homosexuality is heavily disapproved by the Catholic church, which eventually resulted in a state of self-hatred and aversion towards sex, as a result of the abuse that he presumably endured as a child. Too bad this was only merely even hinted. At some point, another character explains that Father Jonas was evil because he was possessed, so, in the end, it is not exactly clear if he was deranged due to his traumas or if he was, in fact possessed. Perhaps both things? I don't think the writers even bothered with all these issues, to be honest. Father Jonas actually appears to look exactly the same age throughout the course of... 30 years! If we go by the idea that he was possessed, this could explain why he never aged (either that or he uses a very effective anti-aging treatment).

Though I personally found it a little bit slow, ""Prom Night IV"" is not really a mess. The truth is that this movie has a good production value and plot-wise, it actually ticks all the boxes of a slasher flick. As for the acting, it is pretty decent for the most part. Nicole de Boer and Joy Tanner are very likeable, especially the latter one, who plays an irreverent catholic school girl (who looked like she was in her twenties, but that's okay). Then, of course, we have the kills. The body count is perhaps a little bit too modest for a slasher and the kills are just plain, but they're there. In the end, ""Prom Night IV"" is just one of those movies that don't really stay with you in any way, but it would be unfair to label them as ""unwatchable"""

One night, a tree tries to eat Robbie, but they quickly save him. When the ghosts kidnap Carol Anne through the closet, they are forced to fight the evil spirit that holds their daughter if they ever want to see her again.
Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, with great special effects, _Poltergeist_ is, in my opinion, the greatest ghost story of all time. Let's start with the acting. The way lines are said, the facial expressions, body language, everything about the characters feels real. Craig T. Nelson's performance as Steve is the most real dad in a movie I've ever seen. JoBeth Williams' performance as Diane is the most real mom in a movie I've ever seen. Heather O'Rourke gives the best performance by a 5-year-old I've ever seen. Zelda Rubinstein is also great. It doesn't even seem like they're acting. The performances are top-notch.
The special effects still hold up, because they still look real.
The plot is still _very_ original, because it's set in modern suburban America, and it's about a normal family that loves each other, rather than an abusive husband and father.
_Poltergeist_ is so well-written that nobody has to die, nor does it have to be gory to keep us on the edge of our seats.
Hooper and Spielberg keep it subtle by hardly showing the ghosts.
_Poltergeist_ features a great plot, great acting, great directing, and great writing. I can't recommend _Poltergeist_ enough. _Poltergeist_ **is** a kid's movie, so it's not all that scary, though there are scenes that may scare you or creep you out, but you won't be scarred for life. In the end it really is a fun thrill ride. It's a movie every kid must see by the time they're 8 years old. For some reason, I find myself trying, sometimes unsuccessfully, to hold back tears every time I see it.
_Poltergeist_ is my favorite movie of all time, it truly is a great classic, and it still holds up after over 30 years as its message is still relevant today. _Poltergeist_ tells the story of a family nothing can tear apart. It's a classic good versus evil story, a story of perseverance in spite of your worst fears coming to light, and holding it together in spite of everything seeming to fall apart. It's about never giving up hope. When I watched Craig T. Nelson, I saw my dad on that screen, and I see him on that screen even more now. When I watched JoBeth Williams, I saw my mom on that screen, and I see her on that screen even more now. Your experience might not be exactly like this, but there's no denying that this movie is awesome. I know you're probably worried because of things you've read online about it being scary, gory, or boring, but don't be. The violence is never gory. The occasional cursing never gets too bad. Despite everything that happens, there's a sense of hope that stays the entire movie. Let your kids see it. They'll thank you. || We know it as the beast.

The Freeling family are happy and functioning perfectly well until one night their youngest daughter announces that thru the TV, the supernatural are here!

Poltergeist divides the horror crowd big time, the gore fans are simply not impressed by the events in the film, while ghostly supernatural fans such as myself see it as a wasted opportunity. But strip away the flashy production and you start to see the core joke of kids infatuation with the goggle box, so yes, the film could easily be titled under the banner of being a Black Comedy. But be that as it may, and lets not be under any illusions here that, Poltergeist is not a knowing wink wink horror film of substance, the film really could have been a truly terrifying piece of work to cater for all tastes, and I firmly believe that that was the main intention of the makers from the off.

Thus lies the chief problems with Poltergeist, it tries so hard to cover all bases it gets that confused to the point it veers from tedium to shock and back again before you have time to digest, and it kills what should have been a genre masterpiece. There are moments in the film that chill the blood, the sense of creeping menace hangs heavy during a storm, a toy clown becomes evil personified just by being lit in the stormy light, and then? Well it violently switches to something involving a tree that wouldn't be fit for Creepshow 27! On the film goes, suspense with chairs and pieces of meat, and then BAM...monster time! It just doesn't work, it's a collage of genre splicing that both director Tobe Hooper & producer Steven Spielberg are firmly to be held responsible for, because it's obvious that both their signature's clash to create an uneasy bedfellow.

Yet as uneven as it is, and as blatantly plagiarised as it is of Twilight Zone episode Little Girl Lost, I still find myself enjoying watching Poltergeist, with its slick production and some memorable moments; the clown, poor darling Heather O'Rourke saying ""they're here"", the first chair sequence, and the always creepy Mrs. Tuthill, all things that help to make it a frustratingly enjoyable nights viewing. 6/10

Just don't go into the light afterwards I guess... || Like most of my contemporaries, I remember as a kid staying up late at night during the AMC Halloween horror movie marathon week (or was it a complete 31 days?) and watching the Freeling family get spooked by some O. G. paranormal activity; watching their house turn into a portal for spirits, some of which abducting their youngest daughter.

Unlike some of my contemporaries, I'm very split on this film. As a fan of the genre, horror always intrigues me, even when it's done poorly/reuses the tired tropes. When rewatching _Poltergeist_ for what seems to be the twentieth time - now in my early twenties - the movie seems dated, to the point where what made it bone-chilling in the first place, seems calm and a little ridiculous. Perhaps I'm desensitized to this type of movie. Perhaps I'll appreciate it more when I do have a family, when I _am_ Craig T. Nelson. But currently, the film struggles against its pacing, unconvincing effects (see scene in the children's room where the closet tries to vacuum them up, and the ""face"" scene - you'll know), and the nature of it attempting to be both family friendly and a horror movie. Sustained over the years since its release, however, are the performances by the cast, specifically the parents. 

Overall, it's still a fun film; but because of some considerable flaws, it hasn't aged too well. Recommended for kids? - Hell yes. How else are they going to attain the fear of clowns?"

In going through the original 'Exorcist' trilogy (I have the DVD 6-pack, with the two versions of the remarkable original, as well as the two recent prequels, so far unwatched), I was intrigued of seeing Oscar-winning writer William Peter Blatty's second stint behind the camera (for the record, I adored his 'The Ninth Configuration', done a decade prior), especially for the franchise that became his bread-and-butter (though I loved two films he earlier had co-wrote: 'A Shot in the Dark' and 'The Omega Man').

He once again does quite a credible job--both with the writing and in helming the picture. To me, it didn't matter much that Linda Blair wasn't involved--I like how it became a search for an already-dead serial killer--and I have been a great fan of George C. Scott in genre films since the likes of 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'The Changeling'. The scares and shocks were genuine, and the suspense and interest were there. It made me wish that even more sequels had been made, it was THAT good. || What's good in this film we can attribute to William Peter Blatty's script and direction and to the casting, especially Brad Dourif and George C. Scott; what's bad, to Executive Meddling – in particular the last minute exorcism performed by a last minute priest; it says a lot that Burton's Father Lamont from Exorcist II: The Heretic is more memorable than Nicol Williamson's Father Morning.

Unlike The Heretic, III looks and feels – except for a bizarre dream sequence featuring cameos by Fabio and Patrick Ewing as angels – like it belongs in the same world as The Exorcist; that is to say, it knows the words and the music.

There are haunting visuals that stay with you long after the film is over (the crucifix opening its eyes, the old woman crawling on the ceiling, Scott's daughter's near decapitation). At the same time, the film has a sense of humor that I would call shakespearean; Father Joseph Dyer (Ed Flanders), whose dialogue includes a reference to Mel Brooks's Spaceballs, is akin to the gravedigger in Hamlet or the porter in Macbeth.

What bothers me about III is the same that troubles me about The Heretic – though to a much lesser degree –, and it's the 'how.' Specifically, how Patient X, alias Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), ends up in a cell in a hospital's psychiatric ward for the past 15 years.

It's a good thing that Blatty decided to have X played by both Miller and Dourif – more so the latter than the former –, because Dourif, as James 'The Gemini Killer' Venamun, has a long, expository, loose-end-tying monologue which proves that sometimes you can indeed polish a turd; it doesn't, even after allowing for supernatural intervention, make a lick of sense (the corpse of a beloved local priest bursts out of his ""cheap little coffin"" and goes missing, and no one is the wiser? Yeah, right), but it's all in the delivery.

Dourif turns in a blood-curdling, bone-chilling campfire tale (at one point he even briefly reflects ""is this true?"", as if he finds it hard to swallow himself). Now, I'm not saying Miller couldn't have done this, but in retrospect I don't see how he or anyone else could have; I only know Dourif did it because I watched him do it in a movie-stealing performance that doubled the considerable respect I already had for him and his craft. || This was the best sequel to The Exorcist they made, and that isn't really saying much. The second one was horrible and the ones that followed were horrible. In fact, I think they were so bad it was instantly remade.

But, this one was decent, it felt the most like an actual sequel to the Exorcist, it was unsettling, it was intelligent, it was pretty memorable in its own way. But it still was a bit too much, not underplayed enough to really feel like the one that started it all.

And, honestly, compared to what we have in the theaters today it is a great film"

Friedkin's The Exorcist is a film that shocks rather than scares. A well made film that achieved notoriety via pea soup. A slow and intelligent film with strong performances - yet also a mostly disappointing one for those who dare to go beyond the hype and actually _experience_ it for the first time. 

For a film that _does_ succeed in frightening the audience and with none of the hype - I recommend The Changeling starring George C Scott. Now **THAT** is a scary movie. || The 4K restoration of The Exorcist is absolutely stunning. Every frame has been enhanced to reveal richer textures, making the eerie details of Regan's demonic possession even more unsettling. The colours in key scenes are now more vivid, adding depth to the already tense atmosphere. Iconic moments, such as Father Merrin's arrival under the streetlight and Regan's head spin, have been revitalized, making them feel even more intense. The film's haunting interiors, from Regan's dimly lit bedroom to the unsettling atmosphere of Father Karras's moments of doubt, now have a newfound clarity that enhances the immersive terror. || The Exorcist (1973) is one of those horror films that sticks with you long after the credits roll. It sets itself apart with an eerie, slow-building tension rather than relying on cheap scares. The story follows a young girl who begins exhibiting disturbing behavior, leading her mother to seek help from both medical professionals and, eventually, the church. The plot is simple but highly effective, creating an unsettling atmosphere that feels grounded in reality. It doesn’t waste time on unnecessary subplots, keeping the focus tight and the tension high.

William Friedkin’s direction is masterful, balancing realism with the supernatural in a way that makes everything feel disturbingly possible. The opening in the desert is a great example, setting up the film’s themes with a quiet unease before shifting to the main story. The cinematography reinforces the horror without feeling over-stylized, using dim lighting, tight framing, and cold color tones to build dread. The way the camera lingers just long enough on certain shots makes you feel like you’re watching something you shouldn’t be.

The acting is phenomenal across the board, but the standout performance is from Linda Blair as the possessed girl. She delivers a chilling performance that makes the supernatural feel shockingly real. Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow bring depth to their roles, adding weight to the film’s emotional core. The dialogue feels natural, which makes the disturbing moments hit even harder. The script is smartly written, giving just enough exposition without over-explaining, letting the horror unfold naturally.

The sound design and score elevate the entire experience. The use of silence is just as effective as the unsettling sounds that creep in at the right moments. The film’s signature theme, Tubular Bells, is simple yet haunting, perfectly setting the tone for the film. The shock scenes are well-timed and never feel excessive, keeping the horror grounded rather than over-the-top. The Exorcist still holds up today as one of the most well-crafted horror films ever made, blending strong storytelling, unsettling direction, and incredible performances into something unforgettable."

Of course, the script is extremely talky and lifeless--as if it had been 'exorcised' of all the wonder and shock that William Friedkin's vision of the battle of good vs. evil would entail. Yes, Sir Richard Burton was a great actor--yet when shoehorned with a crappy script and with his more irritating peccadillos left unrestrained, he can be such a chore and bore to watch. Though I have not seen the two more recent 'prequels' for the 'Exorcist' franchise, I can safely say that while 'Exorcist II' is not the worst horror movie ever made (that, by the way, never seemed its intention), it's certainly the worst of the original trilogy--and by a country mile. This is a work that would probably bore the demons so much, they would decide to get out of Regan MacNeil's body, and perhaps even leave Earth's plane altogether, never even wanting a return ticket. || One of the many things that make The Exorcist arguably the greatest horror films ever made – or simply one of the greatest films ever made, regardless of genre –, is that it has no use for the obligatory final shot suggesting that the evil will continue. On the contrary, it ends on a hopeful, optimistic note; a welcome relief following the ordeal we, characters and viewers alike, have just endured.

Exorcist II: The Heretic carries on as if that final shot had actually been there all along. It's not just that Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) must go back to dealing with Pazuzu four years after the fact – meaning that two good men died for nothing –; it's how this reencounter comes about.

Once we accept the possibility of demonic possession, everything else in The Exorcist is perfectly plausible. The Heretic, on the other hand, comes up with a ""synchronized hypnosis"" device that leads to such ludicrous dialogue as ""Your machine has proved that there's an ancient demon within her!""

That this line is delivered by a frantic Richard Burton – who could achieve greatness with the right material – doesn't do it any favors. All things considered, the only heresy on display here is what director John Boorman does to the source material (in fairness to writer William Goodhart, his script was apparently rewritten beyond recognition) – I did, however, really enjoy the metaphorical use of locusts, which can go from solitary and harmless grasshoppers to, well, Legion."

Close to retirement, Detective Sergeant Roger Murtaugh is a bit disturbed to find he's breaking in a new partner. Even more so when it turns out to be fellow Detective Martin Riggs, who since the death of his wife has scant regard for life, his own or those around him.

Light on plot and character development, Lethal Weapon none the less shines bright as a beacon of how a buddy buddy action film should be done. Roughly an hour and forty five minutes of quips, action, villainy, heroics and cross generational/cultural divides. All what else is needed is a star duo with buoyant chemistry - thankfully  Richard Donner's movie has it by the clip load.

Mel Gibson is Riggs, a trigger happy suspected loony on the ragged edge, wonderfully playing off of Danny Glover's (superb) ""too old for this nonsense"" sage old copper. Riggs is a hard dude who quickly became a cinematic hero to many, an unstoppable force with a quip on the tongue and a glint in his eye, to which Gibson is terrific and perfectly cast.

Gary Busey's ""psycho's are us"" henchman flits in and out the picture with gleeful nastiness and Shane Black's script crackles as the super stunt work starts to take a hold. Chief villain Mitchell Ryan as The General is almost a bystander though, and there's the odd piece of careless editing, but really Lethal Weapon has a winning formula that the box office punters promptly lapped up. 

Three sequels, all of which are of differing quality, would follow it, but this is a template movie for the genre and worthy of nostalgic revisits any time of day. 8/10 || One of the best action movies of all-time in my book, and right there with Die Hard, Lethal Weapon still holds up so well thanks to the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Even with the over-the-top staged fight scene at the end, this is just an all around entertaining flick.

(Reason I decided to watch it again today was saw it was on A&E and rather than watch a crappy edited version, why not watch the real deal in 1080p HD?) || **You’re never too old for this!**

Lethal Weapon is the ultimate buddy cop action movie. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover’s chemistry delights as the crazed young gun and the old experienced cop grow to respect and trust each other. Mel Gibson gives another iconic performance in his catalog of outstanding characters as the quirky and lovable but traumatizing Martin Riggs struggling to find a reason to hope. Danny Glover’s grouchy but endearing Roger Murtaugh is a perfect balance to Riggs. The two develop a loyalty throughout the film that makes the audience invest and care. At its core, Lethal Weapon is an epic action movie where the good guys kick some serious butt! For the 80s, this movie raised the bar for the action genre. My only complaint would be the first few minutes have some nudity that, if left out, would have made this a contender for the ultimate holiday action movie."
942.0,Lethal Weapon 2,Riggs and Murtaugh are on the trail of South African diplomats using their immunity to engage in criminal activities.,The magic is back!,"Action, Adventure, Comedy, Crime, Thriller",114,1989-07-07,en,7.023,3527,4.4557,"Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Joss Ackland, Derrick O'Connor",Richard Donner,"showdown, police, loss of loved one, sequel, mixed martial arts (mma), gang, los angeles, california, police detective, wisecrack humor, buddy cop, diplomatic immunity, lapd, maverick cop, action hero, shooting","A truly great sequel that expands upon the friendship that was born in the first picture.

Intrepid cop partners Riggs & Murtaugh are on the trail of South African diplomats who are using their diplomatic immunities to engage in criminal activities. 

With the success of Lethal Weapon in 1987 it made common sense to follow it with a sequel. All the same elements were in place, cast, director and writers were all back for another slice of buddy buddy action bonanza. The only change of course is the villains, here represented by Joss Ackland & Derrick O'Connor's weasel South African bastardos. Joe Pesci enters the fray as the comical Leo Getz, a Federal Witness that the cop duo have to ""babysit"" till trial. 

Right from the off the tone of the film is set as our ears split and our eyes get dazzled by a high speed car chase. Riggs & Murtaugh are in hot pursuit whilst exchanging a now customary difference of opinion as regards police work. We know they are mates and we know that Riggs is still the lethal weapon and Murtaugh is old school copper. So whilst there's nothing new in that the formula remains the same, the makers do flesh out the relationship more as the film progresses - with one or two scenes absolute gold dust as the boys' lives come under serious threat. We are now, in spite of the carnage that surrounds them, involved with them, yes, such is the charm of their relationship, we do care. It's good writing, regardless of the charges from some quarters that these films are nasty shallow excuses for making money... 

It's fair to say that this is Gibson's movie, this is because it's written that way. Some of Riggs' back story is filled in and he even gets a love interest in the slender form of Patsy Kensit. Riggs cracks the jokes and does the outrageous mental stuff, while Glover's (still doing fine work in Gibson's shadow) Murtaugh continues to be the counter opposite, with some of the astute written sequences involving Murtaugh and the South African core of the story being excellently handled by Glover. Regardless of character development and nifty political observations, it's the action that dominates proceedings. Director Richard Donner has a wail of a time putting the cast through their paces. There's explosions, fights, shoot-outs, more high speed pursuits, and on it goes till we get to the finale, and it's a potential cliffhanger one too. 

Two more inferior sequels would follow, all of which still made serious money, but this serves notice of the last time that all the elements came together successfully. A stylish Hollywood action comedy with two impressionable lead actors providing a lesson in on screen chemistry success. 7.5/10 || Fun sequel with plenty of action and the teamwork between Gibson and Glover was great. Joe Pesci was fine but kind of got a bit annoying. Still highly entertaining all these years later. || ""Lethal Weapon 2"" has a generous selection of set piece action sequences which usually results in the wholesale destruction of property and all in the name of entertainment. These sequences have been exceptionally well executed and they certainly go towards further enlivening what is an already highly entertaining although not particularly memorable motion picture experience. A lot of the carefully constructed scripting used to establish exactly what is going on is all too eagerly disregarded in favour of the much lazier and undoubtedly the more crowd pleasing option of simply blowing things up or killing a lot of people just for the sake of it. Of course it would be nice if this wasn't always the more commonplace approach in a genre film such as this one."
943.0,Lethal Weapon 3,Riggs and Murtaugh pursue a former officer who uses his knowledge of police procedure and policies to steal and sell confiscated guns and ammunition to local street gangs.,The magic is back again!,"Action, Comedy, Thriller, Crime",118,1992-05-15,en,6.702,3019,5.0649,"Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Stuart Wilson",Richard Donner,"showdown, police, sequel, mixed martial arts (mma), los angeles, california, rookie cop, wisecrack humor, buddy cop, lapd, maverick cop, aftercreditsstinger, action hero, shooting, cops","The public get what they want.

In this third instalment of the popular Lethal Weapon series, Murtaugh is counting down the days till he finally hangs up his badge, but he and Riggs run into an ex-cop who is dealing in special cop-killing bullets.

In total there were four Lethal Weapon films, regardless of quality (they declined in quality with each release) each film made gargantuan amounts of money. Who could blame those involved for milking it for all it was worth if the paying public demanded it eh? Made for $35 million, part 3 went on to make Worldwide $321 million, thus ensuring that a part 4 was inevitable. But is Lethal Weapon 3 actually any good? Was the loyal paying public rewarded for their time?.

Well yes, chances are that if you were already a fan of the series then this does deliver all you wanted and hoped for. Director Richard Donner and his team of writers shrewdly cottoned on to the basic fact that the ante had to be raised. It's a pretty light plot in truth, but enter more explosions, more action and make Riggs more comically reckless than usual, well it's a successful formula - even if Riggs and Murtaugh are now in essence just a comedy double act (one man love sequence not withstanding that is). Into the mix comes karate-kicking Internal Affairs female sergeant Lorna Cole (a more than agreeable turn from Rene Russo), who simultaneously gives Riggs more scope for gags and a love interest, and love him or hate him, Joe Pesci again pops in with mirth as the whiny Leo Getz. Stuart Wilson gets to play the bad guy with relish, and just to show it's not all about slam bangery and japes, the film also boasts having an affecting strand about kids with guns on the streets - and of course the scum who put those guns into those hands.

It's all very simple and disposable in the world of the popcorn actioner, and yeah, it's not as good as what came before it in the series, but it's still an entertaining viewing for the series fans regardless. 7/10 || **_More fun and dynamic police action with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover_**

Riggs & Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover) team-up with a kick-axx internal affairs officer (Rene Russo) to take down an ex-cop (Stuart Wilson) who’s smuggling confiscated guns to L.A. gangs. Joe Pesci is also on hand.

""Lethal Weapon 3"" (1992) is more-of-the-same in the successful series helmed by Richard Donner. Like the first two, it’s an over-the-top cop thriller with amusing camaraderie and rapid-fire banter. You have to roll with the outrageousness in order to enjoy it, just as you do with similar cop thrillers, like ""The Gauntlet"" (1977), although that one’s superior, as are the Dirty Harry flicks IMHO.

Of the first three, I marginally prefer the second one (1989), but this one is entertaining enough.

The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area with some stuff done in Florida (like the building blowing up at the end, which was shot in St. Petersburg).

In an effort to ward off property developers and save the Walsh's from having to move away. Mikey Walsh, Brand Walsh and their intrepid friends, set off to look for pirate treasure they believe exists after the discovery of a dust covered map.

Fun fun fun! Treasure, pirates, booby traps, crooks, weird cellar dwelling humans, water slides, wishing wells and budding teenager romances, The Goonies has it all. 

Directed by Richard Donner and written by Steven Spielberg and Christopher Columbus, The Goonies is one of those rare animals that thrills the children and bewitches the adults in equal measure. Romping along at a fair old click, the film never stops to pause for breath, thus dragging the viewers along for the ride. 

There is no expense spared with the production (the sets are delightful) and the cast are mostly engaging. There's some minor annoyances, such as the girls being adventure caricatures, but itches are easy to scratch if you have engaged from the off with its fantastical charms.

It's a film that once loved in childhood should hopefully stay far beyond into your adult years. A junior Raiders Of The Lost Ark perhaps? Maybe not, but still one wholly satisfying action adventure experience, one that's standing the test of time for many of us with our fondly nostalgic glasses perched delicately on the end of the nose. 8/10 || Such a classic!

Glad they shown this at the cinema when it reopened - it looked amazing in the big screen! || Second time seeing this and while it's not quite the classic in my book, still a fun family-adventure flick with some nice production design and a nice cast along with some great talent behind the camera with Spielberg producing (and story), Chris Columbus's script and Richard Donner directing. Added bonus for me being an Oregonian and this filmed in Astoria. **3.5/5**"
9342.0,The Mask of Zorro,"It has been twenty years since Don Diego de la Vega fought Spanish oppression in Alta California as the legendary romantic hero, Zorro.

Zorro senior tutors Zorro junior in the way of the blade, their combined goal? To enact revenge on Don Rafael Montero and Capt. Harrison Love respectively.

Martin Campbell was an interesting and wise choice for this latest take on the swashbuckling heroics of the Latin Robin Hood. Campbell was the man in the director's chair for both of James Bond's reinvigoration's, firstly with ""Golden Eye"" in 1995, and then with ""Casino Royale"" in 2006. For here it's evident that The Mask Of Zorro has no delusions of grandeur in the pantheon of cinema, it wants (and is) to be an action film with pure fantastical flamboyance pouring from practically every frame. It honours the swashers of old by ensuring all genre boxes are ticked, yep, we got swords a plenty, yep, we got a dashing hero (x 2 actually), yep, we got a spiffing looking villain, and yes we got a heaving bosom led romance into the mix as well. While Campbell and his team of screenwriters gleefully ensure that humour is a very prominent thing, thus keeping the fantasy in the comic book realm from which Zorro's essence comes.

The stunt work on show is top draw, none more so than during a horse chase sequence where this Zorro tips its hat to former glorious genre pieces (well done Tony Angelotti). Other notable technical aspects deserve a mention, the costumes from Graciela Mazón are desirable and now in this age of High Definition Cinema, good make up work really comes to the fore, so it be that that department did sterling work on this picture (check out Elena's gorgeous face). The cast are basically very strong, Antonio Banderas slips into the Zorro cape with charming ease, and though it's nice to see a Spanish actor playing the famous Spanish character, here in this adaptation the irony is that Zorro is Mexican! Anthony Hopkins is as elegant as ever as the elder, newly retired Zorro AKA: Don Diego de la Vega, and Catherine Zeta Jones is positively ravishing as Elena, while Stuart Wilson does a nice line in pompous villainy as Don Rafael Montero.

Some minor complaints do dwell within the picture. Campbell has a lot to fit into a running time of two hours and twenty odd minutes, and this makes the wait for the rip roaring finale longer than one at first wished for. Though for sure let it be noted that the gold mine action bonanza at pics end is totally worth the wait. Weak in the cast is Matt Letscher as Captain Love, oddly looking like some Kiefer Sutherland tribute act, he lacks any real menace for what is a pretty well written role. James Horner's score lacks the necessary boom boom bang bang that someone like Alfred Newman would have provided, and a comedy horse strand pushes the boundaries of acceptable genre homages a little too far.

But really why moan and groan at irks that don't alter the trajectory of The Mask Of Zorro's blade? It isn't trying to do anything other than whisk you along for a blade swashing ride, and that is something that it most assuredly succeeds in doing. 8/10 || Solid swash-buckling action-adventure cast perfectly with Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones and finely directed by the great Martin Campbell. I don't remember much about its sequel, The Legend of Zorro, but kind of wished there would be one more to complete a trilogy (maybe titled Zorro's Last Ride?). In any case, was a fun ride and been a good decade plus the last time I watched. **3.75/5**"

Yikes!

Back to the Future Part II sees Marty & Jennifer coerced by Doc into travelling forward in time to correct the future. But Biff is still around and spies an opportunity for untold riches; which he takes. Meaning our three time travelling wonders have to find a way back to the past to stop Biff from changing the course of history.

The gargantuan, and deserved, success of Back To The Future ensured {demanded} that a sequel would follow. So taking the bull by the horns, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gray crafted not only a sequel, but a trilogy, of which part two is ultimately a sort of interim plot filler for the finale to come a year later. There's no doubt about it, part two is at first a puzzle box of a picture, one that had this particular viewer back in the day venturing in for multiple viewings to unravel the deft, daft, but intricate plot.

I have grown to love part two very much as I have got older, with each viewing tending to reward me just a little bit more. Directed with absolute keenness by Zemeckis, the film moves at such a pace there is barely time to catch breath, something that hardly helps one to follow exactly what is going on. But it does make sense under scrutiny, and as we lurch from one magnificent set piece to another, we find a dark undercurrent of bleakness in amongst the froth.

The makers offer up two visions of the future, one is all colourful and swamped in glorious 80s nostalgia, yet it's knowingly enveloped in consumerism and hi-tech reliability. The other is bitten by greed and almost under despotic control, it's food for thought and rather wry in its telling. Not content with that, the makers whisk us back to 1955 just to remind us that a time of innocence and hope did exist; and simultaneously with skill they repeat the ending of part one with the additional story of part two! Clever eh? The returning cast are again uniformly strong {Michael J. Fox, Thomas F. Wilson & Christopher Lloyd} while Elisabeth Shue confidently steps into Jennifer's shoes after Claudia Wells {Jennifer in part one} fell ill and was unable to continue the role. Alan Silvestri's score still packs a cross dimension's punch and the effects crew again come up trumps {it's ace in HD}. It now can be seen as the bridge between two better movies, that's for sure, but I liken it to Spielberg's Temple Of Doom-more darker than the more favourable films in a series; but one that is crucially still having fun. It may be a high-tempo ball of funny confusion at times, but this one, courtesy of it's ream of homages and sly observations, is one of the best trilogy sandwich fillers going.

Munch it. 8/10 || This was one I think I was slightly disappointed in when I first saw it in theaters back in '89 and even with subsequent viewings on VHS and DVD, however I've come to appreciate it more over the years post-2000s. Lots of fun though feels disjointed at times going back and forth in time from 1985 to 2015 to alternate 1985 and back to 1955. But I did like the technical aspects re-creating the events of the first movie. **4.0/5**

PS: Still remember back in the day seeing a TV special and believing the hoverboard was real, lol. || My favorite out of the series. I like this one better, because your rewatching the 1st one as the 2nd one is helping the 1st one at the same time. So you get to enjoy the 1st one again with new twists added from the 2nd one. But you can't see yourself watching the 1st one while watching the 2nd one, because the 1st one is not suppose to see the 2nd one watching it, and vice versa. Otherwise something bad will happen if the 1st and 2nd one see each other. Lol you get what I'm saying!"

However, Rotwang secretly plans to programme the robot to make the workers destroy the city and crush Joh Fredersen, as an act of vengeance against Fredersen for a sin he committed in the past...

Lang made this film in 1927, and it was a huge blockbuster event of that year. However, after the premiere, the US distributor heavily cut down the film, and thereafter the original version was considered lost for almost a decade. In 2008 they found the original version in Argentina (very damaged, but watchable), which became the basis for the most recent reconstruction (2010). If you are going to watch this movie (as I highly recommend that you do!) that's the version to watch!

Overall, Metropolis is a REALLY REALLY great movie, that you, once again, MUST watch!

I give it a 10/10 || This has got to be the ultimate cinematic illustration of the strata of human existence. Whether it be a story of the survival of the fittest; the cleverest; the most devious; most beautiful - or a hybrid of some/all - it reflects poignantly how humanity always seeks to exist within a hierarchical structure (merited or otherwise, but perfectly epitomised here by the matriarchal, deific robot), but how much more effectively mankind can succeed if it accepts and values everyone and works together. It also clearly identifies the perennial problem of those with the brain always ending up far more successful, comfortable - and powerful than those who do the labour. Hence, this wonderful tale from Fritz Lang takes us to ""Metropolis"" - a totalitarian - though not necessarily intentionally malevolent - society, in which everyone has their place and role. Except, that is - for the son of the ""Master"". Like many a fickle youth; he has little to occupy his time and his meaningless existence leaves him ripe for new ideas. When he takes pity on a recently sacked employee of his father and shortly afterwards is exposed to a lifestyle he couldn't even have imagined, the story starts to gain a thought-provoking and unstoppable pace. The score magnificently guides us from the drudgery of day-to-day-life through the emancipating revolution that inevitably follows, with all of the ill-foreseen, largely devastating consequences - like a bottle of champagne that has been shaken, sooner or later the cork pops! It is also a story of love between the son and a woman way, way, way beneath his station. Yes, there is light on the sunlit uplands - and much like a forest fire that destroys all in it's path; this film clearly suggests at the end that hope and optimism will triumph and a green shoots of recovery starts to grow again... It also, as a piece of cinema, is clearly the inspiration for so many directors, cinematographers and story tellers that followed..."

Doc Brown is back in 1885 in the Old West, soon to be joined by Marty who has found that Doc is in mortal danger from Burford ""Mad-Dog"" Tannen.

Rounding out what turned out to be a hugely popular trilogy, Back to the Future Part III restored the core essence heart of Part 1, whilst simultaneously tying up all the threads with a fully formed story. More sedate in its telling (not hard following on from the manic pacing of part 2) part 3 fuses science fiction malarkey with, well, Western malarkey. All played out with the usual array of clever jokes and series reprises - only in a Wild Wild West setting. An interesting point to note is how the roles of Doc & Marty have been reversed from the first film, here Marty is the maniacal plot axis, whizzing around getting into scrapes as Doc ambles around in love, courtesy of the delightfully classic looking Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton. Thomas F. Wilson returns for villain duties as Tannen, a Western bully villain pulled straight out of many a classic Oater from way back in the day, and Lea Thompson & Elisabeth Shue ensure the ""past"" is not forgotten.

When Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale started making Back To The Future in 1985, could they have envisaged that they would make three films and end up with a steam engine time machine in the Wild West? Possibly not, but as part 3 hurtles (literally) towards the suspense laden finale, two things are for certain. One is that they wisely closed the series down with a surefire coda winner. Two is that between them they crafted one of the most entertaining family trilogies to have ever graced the screen. No doubt about the fact that part one is the uniformly class act of the three, but parts two & three themselves reward groups of all ages. Great Scot indeed. 8.5/10 || As with Part II, I've come to appreciate this one more, a great blend of sci-fi and western and features once more some fine performances from both Fox and Lloyd, who each do great work portraying different characters (or at least for Lloyd a different time version of Doc Brown). Beyond that, well done set and costume designs and a good enough story to conclude the trilogy. **3.75/5** || ""Marty"" (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 when he learns of the untimely demise of his mentor ""Doc. Brown"" (Christopher Lloyd) back in 1885. Luckily, the DeLorean is on hand and back he goes - to the wild west - to try and prevent this calamity. Once there, he has no idea how to get back; a task not made any easier by local bully ""Mad Dod"" (Tom Wilson) who has it in for this meek city boy from day one. Spielberg is at his best with stories like this, and borrowing heavily from the Western film genre - and quite a bit from Clint Eastwood too, we have a quickly paced an amiable adventure film as Fox and Lloyd have to stay alive whilst figuring out how to charge the flux capacitor and get themselves home. Wilson is super as the ""baddie"" and Mary Steenbergen gives the ""Doc"" a little bit of love interest as the story ticks along nicely. These three films fit nicely with each other, and happily they all decided to hang up their stetsons after this one. It's still great fun 30 years later, with fun pithy dialogue; loads of great action photography and strong entertaining performances all through. Good fun."

It was interesting to see a young Jodie Foster...

While I appreciate this popularizing (I'm still not convinced it birthed) a trope of ""body swapping"", it seems very uninspired: as if they said, ""Wouldn't it be great if a kid and a parent swapped?"" and then just stopped coming up with ideas.  It was honestly very jarring on both swaps, the latter being honestly confusing (despite having addressed it directly).

The movie made me realize how difficult it would be to swap places and attempt to ""be"" that person without a shred of preparation.  I'm sure that's a bad sign as I should be more entertained by the novelty or adversity of the situation, but no.

It's not that its a bad movie, there's a lot going on, a lot of it decent, but it's very dated.  Even the action in it is a little awkward, but I certainly see why people in 1976 would have been impressed with this.

On the other hand, I don't imagine people were talking about it for very long.  There is a lot of thought narration that occurs, which isn't very engaging, and most of the engaging humor is cheap physical humor of ""what's going to go wrong this time"" so you're not engaged very long and the impression doesn't hold.

The part of the movie that is actually rather good is the substance of teaching everyone to appreciate everyone else in the family, but we really took ""walk a mile in his shoes"" to an extreme here.  There are more palatable ways to express the concept, and more movies that use this trope.

I honestly suggest the 2003 version over this one, it's just not very memorable. || Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster are superb in <em>'Freaky Friday'</em>!

Having only seen the 2003 remake, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this 1976 original. In short, I loved it. It's funny and charming, a real shining light in Disney's live-action stuff from the 1970s.

They only give you a snippet of Ellen (Harris) and Annabel (Foster) in their actual state, before switching it up, but it's more than enough to set up how the characters should act versus how they then act. The two leads are utterly fantastic, they both boss their respective roles. It's easy to forget they're acting as their opposing characters in moments, which is very impressive.

Obviously a load of the story elements are outdated in terms of gender roles etc., but even when that stuffs occurs the film - at least in my interpretation - sniggers at it - especially with Bill (John Astin). The actual comedic moments remain amusing.

I enjoyed this way more than I would've predicted, I haven't watched the '03 production in an incredibly long time so look forward to seeing how it compares to this. A great film, elevated by Harris and Foster."

This quite gripping drama sees an ageing ocean liner en-route to the scrap heap make one last, fateful, trip. As new year arrives, the ship is stuck by a gigantic tidal wave and capsizes. Carnage onboard ensues, with only a small band trapped in the ship's ballroom with the savvy to make for the part of the ship where the hull in thinnest - and the most likely spot for any external rescuers - before the ship goes the way of the ""Titanic""! Gene Hackman is great as the almost maniacal preacher who leads this rather motley band through the innards of the rapidly decaying vessel with plenty of perilous scenarios for them to navigate. The cast are generally good - Oscar nominated Shelley Winters is super, Jack Albertson, Ernest Borgnine, Roddy McDowall and Red Buttons all really help the encroaching sense of menace as their task becomes more dangerous. Regardless of their billing - they are all expendable too, and that adds loads to the richness - and plausibility - of this borderline claustrophobic story that certainly doesn't encourage cruising. The cinematography is tight (OK, so you know it is the camera and not the set that is moving!) and there are plenty of pyrotechnics, obstacle courses and deadly traps from ordinary staircases to keep the whole thing entertaining for a couple of hours and I - almost 50 years on - still find it a good watch."

Like the first film, <em>'The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again'</em> manages to suitably entertain. I still don't think Theodore (Don Knotts) and Amos (Tim Conway) are majorly funny, but it is enjoyable to see their shenanigans - especially amid well-known crooks.

Those two are about the same as they are in the 1975 original, but the side story in this isn't interesting at all - the love stuff with Jeff (Tim Matheson) and Milly (Elyssa Davalos) is very forced.

It's a creative piece of writing and it saw Disney take note for continued success in live action pictures. 7/10 || An amusing film regarding Professor Brainard, a character I've always associated with Robin Williams having seen the 1997 remake first back when I was younger.

Fred MacMurray plays the aforementioned in this, the original. He is pleasing here, giving a more than satisfying performance - even if it is pretty similar to the one he gives in <em>'The Shaggy Dog'</em> back in 1959. Elsewhere, Keenan Wynn plays Alonzo Hawk - he is perfect for that role. Nancy Olson (Betsy) and Tommy Kirk (Biff) are also recognisable Disney faces, though it's MacMurray and Wynn who are the standouts by quite some distance.

The special effects haven't aged well at all but I can forgive that. However, the editing is very choppy when the Flubber is in use. I get why, of course, but I feel they could've sharpened the edits up a tad.

The main part that I'll remember from this is the humour, which is nicely crafted. There's a lot of set pieces with the Flubber and basically all of them give laughs to some degree. If it wasn't for the fun, I'd be rating this lower - especially after the somewhat out of place ending.

I prefer the remake with Williams, though that one leaves a similar impression - with the previously mentioned actor elevating that film up tremendously. This, for a special effect-filled production from 1961, is solid."

I thought: ""A Christmas musical film? Uh oh."" I've stated before that musicals are not my favourite, I usually struggle to get into them due to their discombobulated nature. However, to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed <em>'Babes in Toyland'</em>.

The ending does fall flat minutely, but everything up until that point is a true joy. The opening scenes are terrific. Are they utterly random? Yes. Does it really make any sense? Heck no. Was I smiling? I sure was! ""We Won't Be Happy Till We Get It"" is a great opener to Barnaby & Co.

Barnaby is portrayed very well by Ray Bolger, with his side-kicks acted by the fun duo of Henry Calvin (Gonzorgo) and Gene Sheldon (Roderigo) - two who I liked in <em>'The Sign of Zorro'</em>. Tommy Sands (Tom), Annette Funicello (Mary) and Ed Wynn (Toymaker) are also good.

As noted, the conclusion is what knocks my rating down ever so slightly. It isn't even a bad way to wrap things up, it just isn't as entertaining as what occurs beforehand. The other stuff is grand though, the film knows it's somewhat bonkers and commits to it positively.

I'm not a big fan of musicals so I'm probably not the best person to ask about the genre, but all I can say is that I really enjoyed this."
3170.0,Bambi,"Bambi's tale unfolds from season to season as the young prince of the forest learns about life, love, and friends.",A great love story.,"Animation, Drama, Family",69,1942-08-14,en,7.012,5798,6.9244,"Donnie Dunagan, Peter Behn, Stan Alexander, Cammie King, Will Wright",David Hand,"loss of loved one, cartoon, forest, coming of age, best friend, cartoon rabbit, forest fire, fawn, cartoon deer","The scenery in _Bambi_ is honestly so beautiful. If you were to compare it to the animation I grew up with in the 90s, or even the animation of today, it doesn't just hold up, Bambi's nature scenes actually **outclass** them. Positively gorgeous.

But in that spirit of honesty, _Bambi_ is a really boring movie. I think the one and only time I've seen it before I was around 5 or so, that'd be more than two decades ago. Revisiting it again after all these years actually made me appreciate the movie **less**.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Looking back at this film as it was filmed in 1942 by nine freaking directors man... one supervising director David Hand and the rest sequence directors: James Algar, Samuel Armstrong, Graham Heid, Bill Roberts, Paul Satterfield, Norman Wright, Arthur Davis and Clyde Geronimi.

One thing I’d never known before that I learned is that Bambi the film was based on an actual book from 1923 called Bambi, A Life In The Woods written by Austrian author/hunter Felix Salton.  Always thought it was straight creation of Disney’s but it’s not, weird.

Bambi is a film not just about a young deer and his life in the forest it’s really about the survival of nature against the ever deadly animal known as man killing off animal species and there are some scenes that are really drastic for a supposedly family film but I’ll get to that.
At the beginning of the film we meet our very first cast of characters as there’s pink nosed Thumper and A bashful skunk named Flower, friend Owl and the wakening of the forest animals as a new fawn was born to an unnamed Doe whom as we learn is the Son of the Prince of The Forest.




The best thing about this animation is the attention to detail of other wild life besides the birth of Bambi, his beginning stammering and early bonding moments with Flower and Thumper.  I enjoy Bambi’s moment of falling on the ice it’s cute. Shows that he was still not quite used to his young body enough to be sure of himself.


I find the part where we meet his father very regal The Prince has a very stoic prescient and it’s here Bambi gets his first glimpse of the things astute deer do which apparently is rushing at other bucks with antlers with playful bashing of horns.


We also get a playful moment with Bambi meeting young Faline a female doe the first female of Bambi’s species as we can see more awkwardness.  As an adult I found her teasing a little annoying but as a child I remember the moment fondly as his first meeting a girl moment.  Reminds me of The Lion King later with Nala a little bit.


Winter comes and at the first sign of the new green grass his mother is alerted of danger and tells Bambi to run for the thicket and never look back... we hear a shot run out and Bambi calling for his mother is a tear jerker... when he runs into his father and he tells him so solemn that his mother won’t be with him ever again this almost ruined the film for me it was a sad, dark moment.
There is another moment I enjoy in this film where friend Owl explains to the now grown Bambi, Thumper and Flower about the betwixings of love... just love this part it’s so eerily comical... I’d forgotten that Bambi also ends up getting shot himself but I do remember the fire that man caused and watching how many animals had to move their homes... not to mention the pidgin that got frantic and nervous flew up in the air and got shot in the whole process.


In a sense this had the same pivotal message as Lion King as there is a birth/relationship/ rebirth and continuing line of royalty among creatures in the forest.  I think this film hold up and find it very beutiful.  A decent family film to still watch and enjoy.  Thoroughly recommend.  Have it four stars as Bambi’s mothers death still bothers me did it have to be so cruel? || ""Bambi"" is born into an idyllic forest life - his father is the bull stag; his mother an adoring hind and he quickly befriends all the other animals in his gloriously technicolour world. He learns to walk, to talk, even to ice-skate with the help of his bunny pal ""Thumper"" and he encounters the joys and perils of the seasons from sunny summers to freezing winters too. All is perfect until human beings take an hand - then, alongside his father and his friends, he must face the more brutal realities of life. The animation is gorgeous - simplistic, perhaps, by 2020 standards - but the artistic craftsmanship of the drawings and the score more than adequately compensate for that. There is a minimum of dialogue - the images tell the story, and they do it superbly."
346.0,Seven Samurai,"A samurai answers a village's request for protection after he falls on hard times.

Akira Kurasawa's best...perhaps. || **Maybe a little overrated, but there's no doubt that it's good.**

Well, I have to start this text with a note that I believe is relevant to understand what I'm going to write: this was the first Japanese film that I remember seeing. I might even be forgetting something I've seen before, but I don't think so. Therefore, I'm not a good connoisseur of Japanese cinema, so I don't want my opinion to be taken with any authority that I don't crave. I know there are people who want that. I do not. I speak, as in any of my reviews, only through my mouth, from the height of my meager wisdom, without pretensions. I may be right about some things, wrong about others, but that's the most normal thing in the world.

I decided to see this film because it was highly recommended and well regarded… everyone said it was a very good film, so I decided to see it for myself. I just finished it, and read a little about the film and its director, the famous Akira Kurosawa. The film is really a work that is above average, but it is not the kind of film that pleases everyone, and it seems to me to be a little overvalued, which results in damage. I say this because I felt, at various times, that the film failed to meet my expectations, as I am quite neutral, that is, I neither love this type of film nor feel repugnance in watching it.

The script takes place, roughly, in the mid-16th century, when Japan was divided into feuds and kingdoms, and there were frequent internecine wars in which the samurai took part. Of course, in such an environment, it is the common people who sacrifice themselves, and the humblest have always been the most susceptible to abuse by the powerful. That's what we have here, with a rural village that is regularly looted and devastated by an armed band until it decides to hire a small group of wandering samurai to help defend it. They achieve this objective, and we are invited to see all the labors that occur in the preparation of the defense, and in the martial training of those peasants.

I'm going to do it differently, and start by saying the aspects that seemed most positive to me. First, it seems to me that Kurosawa is really meticulous in the work he has done and has great affection and respect for his country's traditions and history. Otherwise, one would not understand the effort and money that were tied up in a film with such a historical and cultural load. To what extent did his taste for realism influence European cinema, or vice versa? I'm sure there are film students who have discussed this. What I can guarantee is the commitment to realism, visible, for example, in the extraordinary design of the sets and costumes, and in the static cinematography, very elegant and sharp. The script is quite solid, and gives us an extraordinarily credible story and very well-built and striking characters. I don't know the actors well, but I think Toshiro Mifune deserves applause for the commitment and work he has done here. He is an actor who naturally captures our attention and has a charisma that comes through effortlessly.

On the negative side, however, we also have several aspects to point out, starting with the length of the film, with more than three and a half hours. I'm sorry to say, but I feel that the script didn't justify that much time, and that Kurosawa didn't work the pace well. With a more restricted edition, he would have managed to reduce the film, without much loss, to two hours, and make it less heavy and exhausting. We don't need to see every village debate or every military training shenanigans. I also didn't like the attempts at humor introduced in the film. They just weren't funny at all. The excessive predictability of the story told also turns out to be a defect. I also didn't like the virtual absence of a soundtrack. I've seen that in other films, and I've never been particularly fond of that stylistic device."

Not sure I have much interest in coming back to this but have some interest to see what Denis Villeneuve does with his adaptation. **3.0/5** || I read Frank Herbert's book, _Dune_, when I was in high school and really don't remember it much except that it was great and a little scary. At that age, I probably didn't get the subtext message.

I never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I review Lynch's version here and both versions in my 2021 Dune review.

This may not be a popular opinion: Lynch's version (this one) is **brilliant** and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute **shit**. Here's why:

Are the character's in David Lynch's version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That's one reason it's so much better! It's Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for super powers? All of Lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.

By the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.

But here's the clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! I would LOVE to see the original cut!

Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I can't say that for the Villeneuve version. Do yourself a favor and see David Lynch's version. || **It deserves to be forgotten.**

I don't read the book on which this film is based, I've never seen it for sale, I have doubts if it will exist in Portuguese bookstores. I'm not particularly fond of fiction set in space, but I recognize the quality when I see it. And I didn't see any quality in this film.

The script is totally idiotic: we have an evil galactic empire (someone has been watching “Star Wars” too much), ruled by a tyrant (really original) and a war of resistance in which there is a hero fighting for democracy and freedom on a sandy and inhospitable planet. The problem is that this planet is the only one where it is possible to cultivate a kind of hallucinogenic drug that is vital in the economy and functioning of that empire.

Films directed by David Lynch are not to everyone's taste, and although I liked what he did in other works (""Blue Velvet"" and ""Mulholland Dr."" are, for me, the director's best works), I don't think he was cut out for making sci-fi movies. He has a very visual and stylized style as a director, and mixing that with special effects, a bizarre setting and an even stranger story was a bad marriage. I also have my doubts regarding the collaboration of Dino de Laurentiis… with very rare exceptions, I didn't really like the films in which this director was involved… at least the ones I've seen so far.

Even so, I have no doubt that the potential of the project and the union of efforts of these two names allowed access to a good budget and attracted actors to the cast. However, Lynch doesn't seem comfortable with the material and, aside from some very visual scenes where his signature is present, he doesn't give us much more and isn't able to direct the cast in the best way. I think the director himself is aware of this. Moreover, the weak critical reception and the bad box office results helped to bury the project, which today is conveniently forgotten.

The cast is, in general, quite weak, especially considering the budget involved and the names of the director and producers. Sting, the rock singer, appears in the project, but he's not an actor, and he never gives us a real interpretation: he just says what he needs and shows off. The scene where he appears almost without clothes is, to say the least, idiotic. Patrick Stewart and Max Von Sydow are totally out of the limelight and given minor characters in a movie where they could have possibly done more. Virginia Madsen is ineffective and doesn't convince us, Kyle MacLachlan was a casting mistake, and all other actors settle for mediocrity.

The film has stylized cinematography and many gimmicks, which would have worked better if the film itself weren't already too unrealistic and imaginative. The visual and special effects don't always work well, and the sets and costumes are, to say the least, of questionable taste. The soundtrack is quite epic, but given the general lack of quality, it sounds too pompous for the movie that it is."

It's an excellent Willem Dafoe who takes on that role as he roams the land of Palestine trying to spread a message of love. It's clear at the start that this is not Gospel-based, and that becomes evident as his closest ally is the sceptic ""Judas"" (Harvey Keitel) and by the fact that he makes a living making the cross-beams for the crucifixion crosses that the Romans use to execute his fellow citizens. As the story evolves, we are introduced to the characters who ended up being his apostles and we uncover more of a man who is constantly facing temptation - of the spirit and of the flesh - at the hands of a father who seems determined to test the very fabric of his son's essence. It largely follows the well trammelled path of previous ""King of Kings"" style chronologies but there are plenty of variations in the detail of the characterisations and some of the more memorable quotations and ""miracles"" are adapted. That doesn't always work and many of the most significant phrases from Christian literature are delivered a little underwhelmingly. A bit like saying ""Alas poor Yorick - he used to be a mate of mine..."" sort of thing, and that's where it feels a little uncomfortably akin to ""Life of Brian"" (1979). It's the last forty minutes that offers us much of the potency of the film (and it's title) and that's where the story becomes much more provocative - both intellectually and physically. In hindsight, given the way the life of Jesus is continually depicted as having/living, this offers us a perfectly rational continuation of his forty day ordeal in the desert and it also imbues the man with an innate degree of humanity and frailty that I found touching and plausible. It also quite openly postulates that ""God"" might be vengeful, might not be this benign entity and that perhaps deities in general are a creation of mankind's necessity for hierarchy and search for an understanding of the inexplicable rather than evidentially based on some miraculously benevolent being whose love of his children (us) is boundless. Barbara Hershey provides an emotionally engaging performance as the prostitute Mary Magdalene and there's the odd laugh in here too (especially if you are named Judith) to temper the accruing intensity of the story. I didn't really love the photography, and the occasional use of slo-motion seemed a bit incongruous, but that's nit picking. It's thought-provoking regardless of whether or not you have a religious frame of mind, and though a little on the slow side out of the starting gates, matures into something that challenges established and contrary perspectives and is well worth a watch."

This film really does miss the previously strong supporting cast too. No Robert Duval; Diane Keaton (with some simply hideous jewellery) features but sparingly and the whole thing just plugs along until a rather downbeat ending that just didn't seem to do justice to the excellence of Puzo's story or to the previously established, captivating, characterisations. It looks great, the production is first rate but this is just not a story to compare with the others. || **_Michael Corleone seeks redemption while a young buck takes over the shady business_**

RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part III"" stars Al Pacino as aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in 1979, who seeks to legitimize his work in New York and Italy and avow for his sins. He mentors his bastard nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), while trying to steer his teenage daughter, Mary, away from him (Sofia Coppola).

MAIN CAST: Diane Keaton returns as Michael's ex-wife, Kay, while Talia Shire reprises the role of sister, Connie. Franc D'Ambrosio is on hand as Michael's son, Antonio, who wants to leave law school and become an opera singer. George Hamilton co-stars as B.J. Harrison, essentially taking the place of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as Michael's chief financial adviser and attorney. Eli Wallach plays an aged don and Joe Mantegna the gangster Michael put in charge of Little Italy after semi-retiring. Raf Vallone plays a dubious Cardinal and Bridget Fonda a fornicating reporter in a small role.

Part III is on par with Part II in tone and quality, but I give this one the edge in overall entertainment value. Michael (Pacino) has much more human dimension here as opposed to his one-note grim depiction in Part II. His scenes confessing his sins to a priest in a Vatican City garden and, later, with Kay in Sicily are good examples. There are several other highlights amidst the drama, like the break-in scene at Vincent's abode, the Atlantic City massacre, the street festival hit, the entire closing opera sequence that juxtaposes the performances of the play with various violent attacks and the aftermath.

Andy Garcia brings fresh blood and vitality to the trilogy in a pretty significant role, as does Sofia in a relatively small part. Winona Ryder was originally cast for the part, but she was too sick to perform and so Francis chose his daughter at the last minute and she's fine in the role. Does anyone seriously think Winona Ryder would have taken this peripheral part and done it any better? I heard all the ridiculous criticism over Sofia's performance before viewing the film and therefore kept waiting for a serious train wreck, but it never happened. She did a fine job for a side character who's an unseasoned, slightly self-conscious (i.e. wooden), flirty teen. To those sheeple who have joined the idiotic critical feeding frenzy: Shut the fudge up and get a life!

The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Needless to say, Life's hard enough without taking that foolish route.

Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with several highlights, but it doesn't rank up there with the first movie, which stands alone. If you're a fan of the first two films it's almost mandatory that you watch this one. It lacks the thrilling greatness of the first film, but it's about equal to the second, although I favor this one a little.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 42 minutes (or 2 hours 50 minutes, the longer version) and was shot in Sicily and numerous places on mainland Italy, including Vatican City; the New York City area; Atlantic City, NJ; and Lake Tahoe, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.

When a Chicago family moves to an island in the Puget Sound, Washington, Steve (James Marsden) encounters the usual cliques at his new high school, but there’s something odd about the Blue Ribbon Club, a circle of high-achieving students who get a pass from the police when they screw-up. Nick Stahl plays Steve’s new friend, Katie Holmes a potential girlfriend and Katharine Isabelle his sister. Bruce Greenwood is on hand as a dubious school psychologist.   

The set-up of “Disturbing Behavior” (1998) is similar to the same in “Twilight” (2008), but there are no vampires and werewolves. I won’t say more about the plot, except that it includes elements of Dr. Frankenstein and “The Stepford Wives” (1975). This isn’t really giving much away as the movie telegraphs everything from the get-go and so is kind of predictable. 

Yet the Great Northwest locations are spectacular, the cast is good, particularly Marsden and Stahl, and the story is compelling enough. It’s just laden by a been-there, done-that vibe. Still, it’s way superior to the similar “The Faculty” (1998), not to mention more serious. It’s also arguably better than comparable flicks from the time period, like “Scream” (1996), “I Know What You Did Last Summer” (1997), “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer” (1998), “Urban Legend” (1998), “Jawbreaker” (1999) and “Final Destination” (2000).  “Bad Girls from Valley High” is on par (which was shot in 1999, but not released until 2005). 

The original length was 115 minutes, about 32 minutes longer than the released version, but producers found it too long and so cut out scenes that supposedly helped the movie to make more sense. Personally, I didn’t feel the movie was hard to grasp and never felt lost. But the last act needed more finesse because it does seem awkward and rushed; for instance, the mental hospital sequence flashes by so quickly you might miss it if you blink.         

The film runs 1 hour, 23 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, British Columbia, including Bowen Island.

Despite being over two hours long, the pacing felt just right. The first act didn’t drag at all, and the transition to the second act was seamless, keeping me engaged throughout the film. Every scene felt necessary, with nothing added unnecessarily to stretch the runtime.

The script was very well written and stayed true to Nabokov’s original novel. It captured the complexity of Humbert’s character and the disturbing dynamics of his relationship with Lolita. Jeremy Irons’ narration as Humbert added depth to the story, giving an intimate view into his twisted perspective while constantly reminding the viewer of the uncomfortable reality behind his justifications.

The cinematography was outstanding, moving in harmony with Humbert’s narration. The film’s focus on Lolita’s legs and feet was a subtle but powerful visual choice, directly reflecting the meticulous and fetishistic way Nabokov’s Humbert describes her in the book. He often noticed her bare feet, her sandals, and the way she moved, emphasizing her youth and innocence while twisting those details into objects of his obsession. The camera captured this fixation without needing explicit explanations, immersing the viewer in Humbert’s distorted mindset.

The soundtrack was beautifully done, complementing the film’s emotional shifts. It expressed Humbert’s feelings, from his infatuation and longing to his jealousy and guilt. The music never overwhelmed the scenes but added a layer of emotional complexity that made the film even more immersive.

Adrian Lyne’s direction brought intentional discomfort. The lingering on certain scenes and objects, like Humbert’s stairs, was not random. These moments were designed to make the viewer feel trapped in the same uneasiness as Humbert’s world. It forced me to sit with the moral weight of the story and think about the darkness behind Humbert’s actions. While they echo Humbert’s fixation and Nabokov’s descriptions, they can feel exploitative in a medium as visual as film. This stylistic choice makes the audience complicit in Humbert’s gaze, which is arguably the point, but it may alienate viewers or overshadow the film’s critique of his behavior.

Adrian Lyne’s Lolita is a visually stunning and narratively complex film, but it is not without its flaws. It is undeniably ambitious, tackling one of the most difficult stories in literature, and it does so with technical brilliance. However, the film's reliance on Humbert’s perspective and its sensual style raise questions about how effectively it critiques its protagonist and the story’s darker themes."
