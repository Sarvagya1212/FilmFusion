We all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.

The both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.

> ""If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.""

The movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.

It was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.

> ""When I was small, I only knew small things.
> But now I'm five, I know everything.""

It was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.

When a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.

There were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.

9/10 || ""I want a different story!""

That line and the scene it's taken from is quintessential to what this movie is about — at least to me.

To me, this is so much **not** about being abducted and trapped in a room but about the apparent pointlessness of being, about coming to terms with it and understanding and accepting that any meaning that is to be found, comes from within ourselves. It's also about moving on, about love and parenthood (""Can I?"" ""There's nothing left.""), and just... Well, humanity and love.

It reminds me of the beautiful relationship between father and son in The Road (the book — I don't remember if the movie conveys this relationship very well, but I do remember the beauty of it in the book). The relationship between mother and son in this movie is heartbreakingly beautiful as well.

Also, I don't remember the last time I've seen a child perform this well in a movie. I have a feeling I've seen better, but I can't remember having seen better.

I thought this would be a horror movie (I don't read synopsises or reviews or watch trailers before watching a movie), instead I was moved to tears again and again. But **not** disappointed.

Brilliant. Watch it. || Jacob Tremblay is really good in this curious, and slightly claustrophobic, tale of a young lad ""Jack"" who lives with his doting ""Ma"" (Brie Larson). Nothing odd about that, you might think - well, except for the fact that thus far in his short life, ""Jack"" has never actually left the room in which he lives. He eats there, plays there, sleeps there - he knows nowhere else. As he ages though, he begins to get itchy feet and his mother finds it more and more difficult to contain his enthusiasm for finding out what is going on outside. What also emerges from their scenario is that ""Ma"" herself is not exactly free to move about. She was taken by ""Nick"" (Sean Bridgers) many years earlier and it soon becomes clear that he is likely the father of the boy she is so desperate to protect. Are they better off indoors or seeking freedom? Well, she decides that the latter offers them a better chance of happiness (and quite possibly sanity, too) - but the execution of that plan is not without risk! Lenny Abrahamson directs this with quite a bit of subtlety. He allows the audience to become immersed in the relationship between the two principals; he lets them do the talking and as the narrative unravels we realise that the story is anything but what we may have expected at the start. There is a palpable chemistry between the confident Tremblay and his more experienced co-star, and she complements that well. This is a nuanced and engaging tale offering us plenty of parallels of modern life - good and bad; with a dialogue that is both poignant and frequently heartfelt too. Certainly, it was nothing at all like I was expecting and it's stimulating and enjoyable in equal measure. Well worth a watch."

This was from the director of 'Irreversible'. This story was told in backwards. It opened with a married couple having sexual intercourse and after a phone call, the flashback rolls. Which begins from that point of the story where it stands to where it all began as per the film character who recalls all the events. Actually, it was impressive idea, not that reverse way storytelling, but how the characters were drawn. And then the story was very simple, like the film '9½ Weeks', the drama and the sex parts shared the remaining narration alternatively for like every 10-15 minutes.

I wanted to like it, but not convinced with the blend between both the drama and sex scenes. They should have developed and blended them together better. Especially since the storytelling was reversified, one of the major plot holes is not solved or revealing what could have happened to that particular character on which this plot was developed. If you are not concerned about the storyline and looking for adult contents as in a film, not as a better porn film, then you might enjoy it.

The other major issue was the length. Two hours long for an adult film means teasing and testing your patience. It should have been under 90 minutes, that would have speeded it up a bit. The actors were decent. The film poster was so hot, it will drag you to watch this film. But I would say not to expect big, either adult stuffs or from the dramatic segments. Within its frame, it delivered, but for me it was an average and a little below.

Rarely does a suspense piece deviate away from the formulaic blueprint that make these types of flicks the familiar frightfests they are in conception. However, the crafty Joel Edgerton, as the juggling movie mastermind sporting directing, acting and writing credits, provides the mind-bending goods in the refreshingly titillating ‘The Gift’, an edge-of-your-seat chiller that definitely is worth unwrapping with nervous anticipation. The ambitious moments in ‘The Gift’ are golden especially when the twists and turns are considered a solid fixture in the film’s creepy conclusion.

It is understandable in assuming that ‘The Gift’ could have been yet another custom-made psychological thriller promoting the same hire-for-dire predicaments. Nevertheless, the insidious presence of Edgerton, along with co-stars Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall, as the Chicagoan married couple settling in their aesthetic-looking LA-based home elevates ‘The Gift’ as a stalker flick with captivating smarts and attitude.

It is actually a homecoming situation for Simon (Bateman) as he returns to his California town courtesy of his job-related executive rise within his computer security firm. The mover-and-shaker couple Simon and Robyn (Hall) settle into their impressive, spacious window-friendly place with a modern innovative appearance. When the couple decides to head out and do some furniture shopping they bump into Gordon (Edgerton). Gordon identifies himself as Simon’s old high school classmate, something that catches the computer exec by surprise because he does not necessary recall the goatee-sporting Gordon right off the bat. The greeting is awkward but Simon politely acknowledges Gordon in an effort to appease him.

Unfortunately, jotting down the clingy Gordon’s phone number is opening up a proverbial can of worms. Soon, Simon and Robyn would be hindered by Gordon’s constant intrusive visits to their elegant home. Furthermore, Gordon adds to the creep factor by bestowing different degrees of generous gifts on the marital twosome. Gordon does not seem to take the hint that his unannounced visitations are smothering and rather bothersome to the lovebirds. The nervy gesture of Gordon hanging around is particularly worrisome because he seems to dominate Robyn’s attention and time as Simon is away  at his lucrative job during the day.

The tension mounts for Simon and Robyn outside of the menacing interruptions caused by the mysterious Gordo. For starters, the pressure is on for the tandem to start a family as they hope to entertain the arrival of their first child. Secondly, Simon tries to best a rival at work to further his corporate ladder climbing into management. Thus, Gordon’s bizarre gift-giving tendencies and continual pit stops in the couple’s blossoming lives purely add to the stress and strain of keeping their marriage solid and conflict-free.

The Gift could have followed its road map to predictability and used the oddball Gordon as the doomsday dude that continues his twisted agenda without any rhyme or reason. Here is where Edgerton, as the aforementioned triple threat in directing, writing and acting, earns his creative stripes because he manages to flip the script on the viewers and causes them to comprehend the off-kilter motivations of this complex agitator. Is Gordon justified in his campaign to cause havoc for the corporate rising star Simon? Is Simon as squeaky clean as it appears? What is the backstory surrounding the nostalgic circumstances concerning Gordon’s and Simon’s past history as childhood classmates together? Can Robyn piece together the perplexing puzzle that involves the two men on different avenues to self-destruction?

It would be a disservice to reveal some of the shocking angles in ‘The Gift’ because the film certainly engineers must of its nerve-racking twists so cleverly to the point of describing too much of the dramatic layers may spoil the tension-driven surprise. The overall toxic message that is conveyed pretty much sums up Edgerton’s inventive and piercing thrill ride. Be careful how you mistreat or dismiss someone from the past on the way up because you very well could tangle with them as one’s fortunes could descend without a moment’s notice.  Or to put it in simplistic street-wise terminology: karma is indeed a bitch!

 || > In a rage for revenge, the GIFTS can be our handy weapon.

Firstly, it was well written by Joel Edgerton as well debuted as a director with it. That is only because of comparing with other over hyped crappy mystery-thrillers. Frankly, to me it was a decent flick that I enjoyed watching. Flaws, loopholes, whatever you call them, this film had so many due to lack of revelation of the earlier occurrence. While I tried to raise the questions on the issues I found, I also discovered possible answers for them. So either way it covers up as a little smartly, but in reality that does not make any sense at all.

Kind of a revenge movie, but I can't reveal more than that about the theme as it may spoil if you have not seen it yet. It was about a young married couple who moved back to their hometown after losing their unborn baby. They encounter one of their high school friends in a shopping mall and the relationship grows intensely on one end where the other side was indirectly denied. So what might happen when the grown up guys caught in a state like this is what brings the crux of the story.

As usual Rebecca Hall was so hot, Jason Bateman in a convincing act and Joel Edgerton, who was in a key role exhibited his part decently. Pretty good title as well. In the beginning it looked so simple, but while story moving forward the meaning was intensely unveiled.

The narration was kind of brilliant, because it won't let you take a side when clash begin to happen. At a time not quite easy to predict the scenes. This mystery-thriller was too much dramaticed and presented at a slow pace. Especially avoids the serious violences, but still covers a few that obviously required to shape up the film. Like I said it was not a special movie, but worth to choose and for a few people it might be an awesome flick.

6½/10 || Being a) the shortest boy in my class in my early years; b) the smartest; and c) adopted by parents of mixed ethnicity (which was a rarity in my small city at that time, the mid 70's), I was a natural target for bullies. At every conceivable instance (and a lot of inconceivable ones as well!), I fought all comers, often coming home black-and-blue, and exhausted--I may have lost some matches to bigger and older boys, but if they were going to win, they were at least going to pay for it, and feel the after-effects for a while. (Thankfully this ended when I was talking with my friend, who was carrying home his personal baseball equipment, when I was approached. I asked if I could borrow his bat for a second, and that ended that. I wouldn't recommend that as a solution to others, for legal reasons. Thankfully the bully's mom and mine were friends, and when he ran home crying and told her what happened, she replied, 'If Billy did that to you, then you deserved it.')

I don't often do so, but I watched the DVD extras before I watched the film (I usually wait until afterwards). Edgerton's impressive directorial debut here, as well as script, fulfilled (at least to my eyes) his purpose, that of making a psychological thriller along the level of his directing idols, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and David Fincher. The three main stars, Edgerton, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall (I kept thinking she was Anne Hathaway!), did very good work here. I never really went for Bateman's work when he was younger, but a good friend often watched 'Arrested Development' when I was over, a few years back, and I have grown to like his acting, but he really hits it out of the park here. Had this not been an independent production but a more big-budget affair (i.e., David Fincher), I think he could have gotten an Oscar nomination--he's THAT good here.

There was the occasional logical issue I had with the film afterwards, when I stopped and REALLY thought hard about it, but I have no problem with that kind of thing, if I enjoy everything else (which I did). Highly recommended. Definitely worth buying and rewatching--and I can't say that about most films made today. I hope that Edgerton doesn't give up acting, because he's definitely good at it, but I hope he also keeps on writing scripts and directing. Simply based on 'The Gift', he has an admirer in me for life."

A strange Danish film. It was a lot like the Danish version of 'The Addams Family'. Written and directed by a screenwriter for the notable films in different languages. This is the story of two brothers who embark a journey to a remote island after their father died. Because they learn they were adopted, so they go to look for their biological parents. They end up in a strange house with the strange people, but realise how they are related to each other. So the remaining part focused on the mysteries surrounding the house. When those things come out, the narration reaches its peak and brings the end.

I think the title should have been 'Men & Animals'. If you watch the film you will know the reason, particularly after the final twist. As I had observed, many people liked it, but to me it was average. The idea seems very good, but the style was missing. Too ordinary presentation. If the approach was atypical like I said 'The Addams Family', it would have gained more popularity internationally.

The actors were good, shoot in the good places. Among all, Nikolaj was the familiar face. This is not your usual film, yet not for everyone. Maybe if you know the language, you might enjoy it better. The subtitle translated comedies are not that effective. Feels like I want to like it, since it was tagged as a comedy I did not get many laughs. So I won't stop you if you want to try it, but only tell you to be careful while choosing it, regarding what you are expecting from it.

_6/10_ || **Dark Dark comedy made by Jensen who is a brilliant writer and director.. Its not made for everyone but personally.. I believe it to be an absolute MASTERPIECE.. I laugh my butt off every time  I re watch it and thats quite often. The comedic genius involved is just mind blowing.. 

Many people dont realize the relationship half the cast along with Mikkelson  has with Jensen the movies creator and director. Its long standing in Danish theater... and its a splendid connection.. Most Americans have NO idea just HOW funny Mikkelson is and has been in films... I REALLY hope he does more comedys and soon... This is a MUST SEE ** || <em>'Men & Chicken'</em> is... out there. Good film, though!

The only criticism I have is the run time, I reckon they could've shaved a decent chunk off so the somewhat predictable conclusion comes around quicker. That aside, I enjoyed this 2015 release. It has a strong cast, good humour (mainly across the first half or so) and has a plot that is certainly intriguing - and even manages a positive message in the end, just about.

Mads Mikkelsen is good value here, as he is in pretty much all of his films let's be honest. I watched this as part of my watch through his filmography, so it was cool to see a number of familiar faces that he worked with previously; as well as director Anders Thomas Jensen, of course. Nikolaj Lie Kaas the most obvious, to me anyway, example of that, though you also have the likes of David Dencik and Nicolas Bro."

Pretty intentional. It says it doesn't want to go that way, but in the end that's what it does. So the story was nothing new, but it was the cast, particularly Lyndsy Fonseca. She was too hot for the title role. A sex addict journalist tries to do a story on high-end escort for his new job. They agree on to be purely professional, but as they explore each day, a new friendship develops. After learning that she's well educated and the reason for taking this path, it all comes to when his story is ready to publish. Their both lives are about to turn around, but how is what told just before the end.

The film was not bad, but not good enough to praise. Worth a watch if you are not anticipating and just want an entertainment. Obviously the film is for the adults, but you won't be happy if you are looking for according to the title. Because the title name is only where the film plot was initiated and the remaining story was all about the character surrounding it. So it is not an erotic drama or romance or a thriller. The film was short and well maintained pace, but not the film of the year.

The film was based on the collection of a series of the real events that takes place in the 17th century New England. The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested.

Wow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings.

It was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement.

A simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups.

8/10 || This was a really good horror film. The direction was very interesting and Robert Egger plays with darkness and shadows in a really horrifying way. The tension is unbearable at times.

The dialogue is a bit hard to follow as it is very ""oldé English"" to add to the historical accuracy of the piece. The actors are all good at reciting this strange dialect and demonstrating the paranoia spreading through the family thanks to religion and superstition.The film is based on accounts and texts found from the era and so everything seen on screen has been taken from sources and barely been touched. Every part of the film seems authentic.

It is refreshing to see a film that doesn't really on jump-scares and annoying ""cattle-prod"" techniques to make audiences scared. 'The Witch' is genuinely disturbing without resorting to these techniques. It is very strange and gory when it needs to be. I also found these strange scenes quite fascinating and educational as the film almost seems like a historical document.

★★★★ || Talk about old school!

“The Witch” is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It’s as if Mel Gibson decided to update “The Passion of the Christ” by 1600 years.

As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until… okay, no spoilers. See the movie.

This is a dark and effective movie. I can’t remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to “get” me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won’t lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster’s “Hereditary,” if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end.

That being said, the film isn’t perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it’s perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It’s kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are.

“The Witch” is quite an achievement and I’m glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking “The Lighthouse.” Definitely worth checking out."

You can see here the desperate Shyamalan Attempt to get back to his old glory days. But in the last ten years he's not able to reach a decent success. Losing truth with big league actors and production house, so ended up doing movies with teens in his previous 3. So this one as well about two young siblings who goes to meet their grandparents from the rural. After the smooth first day the grandparents' unusual behaviour begin to scare the kids. In an attempt to find the truth, what follows is a twist in the tale.

PG13 rated 'found footage' horror-thriller. But the story might be either real or fiction that never explains, because the boy in the movie wanted to do a project. Not that scary except in a couple of scenes. A better story, but the movie was okay type. The entire film revolves around four characters, but the two kids led from the front with their excellent act. It faired well at the box office, but honestly, I was slightly disappointed with everything from it.

Shyamalan is better than this, but he had a few chances to prove it that did not work out well as everyone expected. It's only a matter of time to give an unexpected hit and turnover in his career, that's what I'm looking for, but looks like not any time soon. I think this film was better than his recent ones that delivers within its limit, so I consider it is a one time watch film and nothing else.

6/10 || A grand time of things at the grandparents place?

The Visit is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie and Kathryn Hahn. 

Becca and Tyler have never met their grandparents, their mother left that family home in acrimonious circumstances. Now the kids are off to spend a few days with them - and get far more than they bargained for. 

If you ask some people then they will say that Shyamalan never had form to begin with, so to them this doesn't warrant being called some sort of return to form, what it does do is find him on sound footings. Veering away from big budgets and adopting a low-fi approach, this very much has him back in the spooky zone. 

It's all very nutty of course, the premise and the (very good) reveal are hardly genre defining, but the unease is palpable, the mystery element strong and there's a bunch of genuinely freaky scenes. The last third is almost delirious as the story goes through its bad dream fairy tale throes, and the small cast are excellent, with Syamalan once again showing how good he works with young actors. 

A good honest chiller that isn't purporting to be anything other than that. 7/10 || The Visit had a lot of potential, but unfortunately, it falls flat due to the many drawbacks that are constantly present in M. Night Shyamalan's films. However, where this movie excels is with the fantastically paced tension. Shyamalan incorporates a mix of found footage elements with a bit of Paranormal Activity, creating something that is pretty unique and sinister. This film was one of the more terrifying experiences I have had in quite some time, and I was constantly on the edge of my seat, especially in the night segments. I am sure it helped that I was watching this on a laptop, at night, with headphones on.

The story itself is actually pretty unique. The creepy nature of the grandparents is unsettling but also incredibly grounded. They seem almost possessed at times, and the reveal at the end just makes the entire movie all the more frightening. Shyamalan does a decent job with the found footage elements, although it is nothing groundbreaking.

However, where this movie really begins to falter is with the screenplay and acting. Now, I do not put as much blame on the actors due to the horrendous dialogue that was written for them. This dialogue is so rigid and inorganic, making every interaction feel as though it was written by an alien trying to mask as a human being. This really messed with the pacing of the film and made certain parts of it very difficult to watch.

Overall, I give a lot of props for the creativity and the unsettling feeling it created in me, but Shyamalan definitely missed an opportunity to create a very special film. With a more polished screenplay and better acting, this movie could have been truly exceptional. Nonetheless, it is still worth watching for the unique and scary story that it tells.

My confession is I haven't seen the original film. I had several opportunities, but for various reasons I stayed unwatched till now. Firstly, I won't consider it a remake since both the films were adapted from a novel. Yet no one can stop the people comparing between the two, just to find out which one is true to the book. In my perspective, I think the original source was written keeping the Argentinian society, because that dark tone narration suits them. I have seen many Argentinian films, but for the American kind of storytelling, it does not appeal. Even though it was not a bad film, I somewhat enjoyed, maybe because I haven't seen the other version.

The actors were great, but it was Chiwetel Ejiofor's film, He dominated the screenspace, and Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts were slightly disappointed with their small roles. But overall, they all made it a decent film, particularly the direction impressed me for handling neatly knowing it is already once made a film. The story was suspenseful, yet it feels familiar and lets you predict the each scene before its commencement. Yes, I thought it was holding something big for the end part, and then it gives out all clues leading that way. So I kind of assumed what the end twist might be and that happened, but a bit differently.

This kind of screenplay totally works for a Korean style filmmaking, but Hollywood is expert in a different field. Wherever it comes the film, a film is a film, so I won't blame it on a regional ground for lacking of something. But it should have been a bit better, maybe more thrilling and making the characters more stronger with emotionally appealing could have worked, particularly for a certain group of audience. If you're watching this story for the first time, then you might enjoy it, but for the other reasons you might not. Whatever, not a bad film for watching it once.

The story line is good, and it could have been a very cool movie. However, the directing goes wrong from the very beginning with the going back in time to show how we got here trick, and the voice over, narration. From there it just got worst. The acting/characters are bad, the story gets lost in it self, and the twists don't add anything to the movie.

I can't see how this is good entertainment. They could have done to the spy genre what Shaun of the Dead did to the zombie genre. || > A very familiar theme, as well as a small quantity entertainer.

The second movie for the director. His first, 'Project X' was an unexpected full treat. I simply loved that one, just for the entertainment's sake. I anticipated, 'Project XX' or 'Project Y', followed by 'XXX' or 'Z', but that never happened. I thought the director was setting up his own style of filmmaking, but this film did not clinch well. There's no story, just based on one evening event that stretches as far as another day by adding brief oral flashbacks to match with the rest of the storyline. But the fact is it was a comedy version of 'Hitman'.

The red band trailer I saw revealed many stuffs, but the movie still offered lots of variety from the different angles of the same stuffs. Jesse Eisenberg, I never expected him to play a character like this, he was good. But it was only a partial display, if there is a sequel, I expect that would be an uncompromised when it comes to the stunts and heroic adventure. Although I enjoyed the end credit animation.

Kristen Stewart was just hanging around, though her character had potential to be a game changer, so let's hope the sequel strengthens that part. Yeah, I'm kind of certain about the follow-up after seeing this film's ending, if they don't consider to make one, that would be theirs great loss. Anyway, the movie is a good entertainer, but not your unusual story as you expect it to be.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || **The rise of the Rap music!**

There were lots of debate over this film's snub from the Oscars, but I'm not here to talk about that. As a film, it was awesome and as a biographical film, even more awesome, but not an inspiring film that I was expecting. There were many bad things in it, like the language and character portrayals. Though hats off to the filmmakers for rendering the it with the bold contents. I don't know if it being true to the actual events, but anybody can feel how those circumstances would have been for those involved in the real.

One thing is for sure, the film is not for the families. The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.

This film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull. I totally enjoyed watching it, a good film for adults, particularly those who love Rap music must not think of missing it.

_7/10_ || Quality film.

I thoroughly enjoyed <em>'Straight Outta Compton'</em>, it had me gripped all the way through. That's despite me having little to no knowledge of N.W.A, I knew of their name and of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre but basically zilch about their actual story. I couldn't comment on how true it is to history, but as a film it's fantastic.

You have great performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti. Mitchell impressed me most as Eazy-E, while the casting of Jackson as Ice Cube - his father, of course - was a masterstroke. All the cast do very well, in truth.

I love how gritty the film is too, it feels real - at least as real as film can get. There is some neat cinematography in there, while the music is entwinned nicely. The pacing is almost perfect, aside from a few moments in the middle. I also rate how it all ends, in terms of the story but also with the end credits. There's heart in there."

It was a fantastic small-time thriller. I was completely surprised with its unusualness, either it be roles or the story or the locations. Looks like a best B movie, but Kevin Bacon's presence boosted the spirit of narration. One of the shortest movie, all the way simple yet strong and believable occurrence.

You can't ask for character development here, because it just takes place in a fine afternoon and ends at a terrible evening. Never intended to reveal before events or to disclose what might happen later. Everything was based on the very unusual circumstances. When people cross each others path and expose their secret affairs that put them most vulnerable position. Far from the big towns and out of the human sights with the characters countable on one hand.

The main attraction was the two boys and their innocence like daring attitude takes them to the unplanned adventure. Nothing like another highly intelligent, computer or the science geeky overhyped city boys, but the natural rural kids. Creepy suspense with often struck with dark comedies, you just can't get better than this. I recommend it in the view of entertainment and for those who seeks it, but not to place it in your masterpiece collections.

Just one day event based theme and brilliantly made film. This film was made using iPhone 5s and this is not some film school project. The quality was really top notch, with great performances by all who involved in. I have never seen such perfectly rendered transgender story. I mean no offense, but it looked so real. Hats off to the director, writer and the actors.

Last year, there were some talks about this film's chances at the Oscars, but in the end it did not make. So after that I kind of lost interest in it, but now I had an opportunity to watch and I liked it very much. How a simple story and its simple characters developed were the highlights. You can't predict this stuff, because you won't know what comes after the each twist.

Most of the film takes place on the evening time, so that colour of the sky is what the title represents. I don't think anybody would dislike this film. It was slow, but short and sweet. One of the best films from the 2015. You much choose this to watch for its uniqueness in the filmmaking and the storytelling. In addition to that, it also entertains, so there's your reason to go for it.

_7/10_ || So it was all filmed on my favourite iPhone - the 5S. I had one until only recently when the failing battery finally forced me onto the 12 mini. Aside from that impressive technical feat, though, this really isn't anything special. ""Sin-Dee"" (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) gets out of jail after a 28 day stint for possession, only to find that the guy she took the fall for - her boyfriend ""Chester"" (James Ransone) has been fooling around with ""Dinah"" (Mickey O'Hagan). Livid, she sets off with her best friend ""Alexandra"" (Mya Taylor) to find this woman and to confront her beau with his treachery. Meantime, cabbie ""Razmik"" (Karren Karagulian) breaks up that narrative with some quite entertaining vignettes with his passengers. ""Mia"", a man named after a bird, a couple who have been over-indulging in pre-Christmas booze - and leave him a smelly, unwanted gift - all whilst he cruises for some transvestite action in an alleyway. The stories gradually merge together as it turns out the married Armenian driver has the hots for ""Sin-Dee"" and it all comes to an head in a donut shop with his wife, child, mother-in-law as well! The handheld photography is intimate, presenting us with a fly on the wall style documentary around half a dozen not especially nice or interesting people going about their lives. It is made largely on the move, there is rarely a let up as the story fluidly moves along - but that story is frankly pretty lame. ""Sin-Dee"" drags ""Dinah"" around downtown LA in her bare feet at will; nobody intervenes - even when she drags her onto a bus! The dialogue is weak and angry, the characters selfish and I found that after about half an hour I just couldn't really care less about any of them. Is it supposed to be about friendship? They all appear to be as ready to betray each other as to get up in the morning. Sean Baker does create a film here that is intense, but there is nothing to hook the audience. If this were documentary on transvestite hookers in LA, then it would show nobody in anything like a sympathetic light and adding dialogue to that doesn't change that basic sentiment. As an example of how film-making is going to change profoundly with the advent of small, hand-held, filming technologies this is a great example of a flexible and portable technique. As a story about people, it is pretty miserable. || Filming on consistently overpriced hardware that is a manifest of chokepoint capitalism (term coined by Cory Doctorow) is not enough make great cinema."

It is a semi-biographical film about a person who invented a modern hygienic mop. So all the depicted events and characters were partially real, but for the cinematic reason they have been fairly altered for a good outcome. And yes, I loved it. A very inspiring film among all the Oscars nominees this year. In some way I also felt Jennifer Lawrence should have got the award for her fine character display.

Honestly, I was not interested in this, so I wanted to get over it silently as soon as possible. But I ended up enjoying a lot and instantly it became one of my favourites of the 2015. What I expected after watching its trailer was like I judged it by its cover. As I hesitated in the earlier, but strangely now I'm recommending it to all.

The story of a woman who grew up listening her grandmother's motivational speeches. But realises the life is tougher than she thought and making a living is very competitive. After so many struggles in the life, she finally invents something that changes her and her family fortune forever. But like any new initiative does face, the problems arise and how she is going to fix them is what the remaining film narrates.

A very interesting film in the perspective of the career option. Forget the doctors, engineers, lawyers and those who're settled in their lives with a good job in hand that pays big, but there are billions of people, to them it will definitely serve as an inspiration to ignite their future.

The rating for this looks like a fair value, but still a very underrated film everywhere. Amazing actors, a little funny and a little emotional, but a very impressive film directed by the one who bought the Oscars to Jennifer Lawrence for their earlier venture together. I don't know what's between her and Bradley Cooper, but looks like their onscreen chemistry is doing something big impact. This is their's fourth project together and second with the director, so I hope they do more in the future as well. This is really a wonderful film, so don't miss it.

354556.0,Guardians,"During the Cold War, an organization called ""Patriot"" created a superhero squad, which includes members of multiple Soviet republics.

In our world the sum of $7 million was last adequate for a blockbuster about 40 years ago. Obviously, the Russian team bet on using smaller resources to maximum gain. Not unlike the current Russian president's geopolitics, cough. The result is more than solid—for a direct-to-DVD level superhero flick, that is.

**The women:** gorgeous in a way which only Eastern European women can ever be—combining the Scandinavian Valkyrie component with the finer feminine Slavic beauty. In short—the next Trump-type can do worse than dip into the beauty pool of The Guardians.

**The men**: dreamy types, blond and dark, muscular and lithe—for all tastes.

**The acting quality:** imagine the supporting cast of any generic direct-to-DVD film with Steven Segal, but worse by about 25%.

**The action sequences:** world class.

**The special effects:** more or less on par with the special effects from the first X-Men film from the year 2000, which back then cost $75 million to make. Apparently a decade and a half later technology has progressed enough to enable the plucky Russian team to achieve the same effects of…the effects…for a minuscule fraction of the cost.

**The plot:** Soviet super-soldier experiments decades ago led to a bunch of amnesiac, un-aging men and women scattered around the country, who are gathered once more in order to stop the baddie who is wreaking havoc on New York, *sorry*, I meant Moscow. The baddie in question is like an uglier Bane, but with an approximation of the powers of Magneto.

**The end result:** can it compete with the Marvel or DC films of today? Absolutely not. Is it good entertainment when measured by direct-to-DVD or TV film (or modern computer game) standards? Sure

**Conclusion:** back in the 1960’s and 1970’s Italian directors like Sergio Leone and Dario Argento proved that even if you have no budget and no actors and no coherent plot, you can still create world-class, even legendary cinema through sheer class.

The Guardians has no class whatsoever, but is a perfectly OK derivative adventure with superheroes and things going bang, and in an ""exotic"" setting at that. Maybe this is just the start of something cheap and beautiful?

If Russia becomes a world center for cheap knock-offs of Hollywood films, I for one would be happy with this development and would watch these films, because with smaller budgets and therefore less oversight by focus-group obsessed bean counters, interesting stuff may start to develop within the generic story skeletons, as once was the case with Italian films. || **Not just another superhero film!**

It was more like a counterpart of the first 'Captain America' film. Because both the films set in the same background, which is the Cold War. But the Cold War was merely a reason to initiate what the film needed for its story. So as we roughly guessing the plot, there's something goes wrong in the secret experiment and then there emerges the superheroes and the supervillains.

The last time I saw such scale grand Russian film was 'The Inhabited Island' and decided never watch such Russian flicks. I might be wrong, because my knowledge about the Russian films is less, but there could be a lot better films that I haven't seen. Anyway, I put all my faith on it, despite very low ratings and heavily criticised it on the internet. I must say that, it was a decent film, neither a breathtaking nor a worst film (of the year).

Yep, there's lots of cliché, because you have seen them all in high standard Hollywood films. But since it is not a Hollywood, comparing them is unfair. A little appreciation needed for its effort. Except borrowing the concept should be questioned here. Because that's made its lack of originality. And one more exception is that science is everywhere the same, which is a big excuse for that.

The graphics were almost flawless. The characters are unique, but adapted from the same blueprint how every superhero film take off. So what went wrong with it is the big question, despite everything's carefully and nicely done. And the answer is the screenplay. Any superhero films majorly depends on the best designed action sequences and the stunt choreography with respective superpowers of the superheroes at its best.

> ❝Death for us is not a problem, we've lived long enough.❞

I liked the costumes, which aren't too fancy or simple, and the superpowers, but I don't think they were used that in the best way possible. And have you ever seen a 90 or less minute superhero film. That's another drawback. Because shortening the runtime does not speed up the narration. In this film, there were no space given for the character developments, like to make them, those heroes sit somewhere and have some lazy takes, which surely opens their deep thought, including personal events of the past and all. What I saw was, they came, they saw the villain and they fought him.

Well, at first attempt, it should not succeed, otherwise the film ends there. That's how all the superheroes rise back from the initial stumble. Only after upgrading with modern scientific weapons and gadgets to boost their superpowers, they now can match the bad guy. Those were the properly done things from the film. But not everybody will be happy for it as it is another clichéd segment. So what, that's same even if it is a Hollywood or European film.

Then what makes the film watchable is the production standards, that very much comparable with the big cost films around the world. Those criticised it was wrongly accused as saying it has the cheap CGI visuals, but that's definitely not true. Then the most successful film in the history of Indian cinema, 'Bahubali' would lead such worst visual effects list. If you watch this film, you would know that or you would bring your own perception. But the plot holes, surely there are many, if you are focused enough to identify them.

After all, if you give your interest to watch the film, then there won't be any time to go after such errors. Thus, it is the thing what all the film critics usually do. Madness is some film fanatics joined them. So never mind all the negatives about the film. Don't think I'm defending it. Just know how I rated it, an average. My idea is to expose it not a very bad film as it was labelled. That does not mean it is a fantastic film either. A 50-50 chance film, which can be still watchable, and once you did, the outcome of the watch could be anything. So after seeing all the confusing ratings and reviews, it must be hard for you whether to go for it or not. Suppose if you ask me, I say choose wisely, and if you did, have low expectations.

After all, the temptation is just too much to resist in not exposing such throwaway thrills of intentional insipidness, correct? Plus, incorporating a mixture of smarmy filth and frolic involving menacing zombies, hormonal teens, bouncy bimbos and any other fright-driven clichés that one can think immediately off-the-cuff should be enough to satisfy the creepy concoction of craziness, right? Well wrong...especially when the experimental goosebump gags fall flat and feel synthetically repetitive in the over-indulgent and inane fear farce Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. 

Sure, some will automatically gravitate to the outlandish Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and invite the spirit of the movie's manufactured foolishness as an elaborate playful put-on. In many ways, co-writer/director Christopher Landon wants to promote the silly-coated salaciousness of his teasing teen-oriented terror tale with a sly wink and anticipates that the audience will embrace Zombie Apocalypse as an unconventional, naughty-minded tangy treat for giddy thrill-seekers. Sure, Landon's off-kilter humor horror show is meant as an escapist ruse and wears its badge of honor as a brain-dead flesh-and-blood fright fable garnering cheap chuckles. Nevertheless, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse feels relentlessly lazy, mean-spirited and connects as a raunchy wasteland of sluggish juvenile jolts and jabs.


There is no excuse for Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse to present such a witless,  misplaced macabre mess. In an age where spoofing zombie flicks in cinema can be high-minded and heralded in both creepiness and creativity in the shadows of such riotous offerings as Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, it is inexplicable how something like the rancid and toothless Zombie Apocalypse can be so arbitrarily clueless and contemptible in its strained search for crafting off-balance laughs. Again, it is realized that zombie cinema--however serious or silly-minded--is not exactly on the food chain of being considered a viable selection for the American Film Institute anytime soon. Still, there should at least have been some sense of smartness and perception injected in the aimless zaniness that Zombie Apocalypse emits routinely in its languished lunacy. Instead, Landon and his fellow screenwriters invite a series of empty-minded shock value shrills to the proceedings and hopes that the viewers will embrace the cluttered chaos without question. Sadly, some will do just that (read: the indiscriminate teen demo in general) as they will go with the flow and bask in the baseless swamp of tasteless titillation. Consequently, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is about as adventurous, amusing and intriguing as a medieval stoning in a rural town square.



Undoubtedly, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse needs the approval of its boys locker room impishness to feature such graphic and goofy-minded displays of sexual body part piercings to pad the already morose stupidity put forth in desperate vain. If your idea of horror-minded high jinks include the subjection of zombie-related severed penises and constant groping of female breasts then guess what...Zombie Apocalypse will certainly satisfy one's hormonal guilty pleasures in a heartbeat. In addition, it pays to also have some stunt casting and add to the dumb cheekiness where the likes of the once celebrated Oscar and Emmy-winning veteran actress Cloris Leachman serves as the token oldster to certify the gimmicky warped proceedings (perhaps Leachman's former Mary Tyler Moore Show co--star in the beloved pop cultural and iconic Betty White was not available to sign on the dotted line for this teen terror train-wreck?).

The premise, while highlighting the gore and boyhood gratification of wet dreams, involves a group of youngsters that belong to a scouting organization while being taught the efficiency of  leadership and self-reliance. Naturally, these boys will put their merit badges to the test as they must combat the overflowing presence of threatening zombies that are infiltrating their small community. Not only must these adolescents learn to battle each other competitively and tackle their own nagging growing pains but know they must band together and slaughter the walking dead menaces that look to make some serious ominous waves within their bedroom town.

The teenage terminators that are called into action are Ben, Carter and Augie (played by Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller and Joey Morgan). Of course this trio fits into the distinctive archetype of youth labeling. Ben is the clean cut kid with some semblance of sensibility. Carter is a handful as the insufferable horndog. Lastly, Augie is the geeky hanger-on. So there you have it--the mini-sized Three Musketeers out to destroy some zombie butt and take down numbers in the process. 

The feminine eye candy wrapped up in this monstrous madness includes Carter's sister Kendall (Halston Sage). Kendall also serves as the convenient object of affection for the love-struck Ben. And what would a horror flick be without the resident curvaceous gun-toting, butt-kicking beauty with the killer instinct of zombie zapping?  In this case, that role would go to strip club siren Denise (Sarah Dumont) whose skill in eradicating the zombie pests as she struts around like an armed jiggly cheerleader in heat becomes increasingly distracting (or maybe not for some that might find this bombastic and busty Barbie Doll lustfully ""liberating""). 

The boys' scout leader (former Saturday Night Live alum David Koechner) is the accident-prone wonder whose penchant for overcoming various injuries is supposedly laughable yet the joke of his clumsy confrontations quickly tires out and grows old. However, the scout leader is essential to the storyline for the tykes because he suffers the fate of becoming one of the zombies that needs to be destroyed. It certainly does not help matters any when poor Kendall's safety is jeopardized and the boys (especially Ben in particular) along with Denise's assisted brashness must rescue Carter's pretty sibling and protect the town's masses from the zombie intruders.

For the most part, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is a woefully tepid tease that does not care much about its sloppy execution. The scattershot script constructed by Landon and fellow scribers Carrie Evans, Emi Mochizuki and Lona Williams vacillates back and forth in complete cartoonish chaos and it is never clear as to why any of us would want to put stock in hoping that the periled protagonists of this banal roguish romp emerge victorious? The combination of humor, sentimental vibes and sketchy scare tactics overlap and is perceived as annoyingly inconsistent. The deplorable and disposable foundation for the sexual depiction of the females in Zombie Apocalypse is insulting and does not invite any sense of truth or revelation besides flashing feminine skin for the sake of giving this horror hiccup some trivial sauciness. The hoards of zombies being butchered in some imaginative selective scenes is at first kind of challenging in an offbeat, exaggerated sort of sinister way. The repetitive slaughtering gradually becomes off-putting and you are left wondering rather or not you were better off chopping off your own limbs for enduring this boisterous bomb in the first place. 

Hopelessly choppy and chintzy, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse could have been stunningly irreverent and still carried out its nuttiness with a coherent slice of clever mockery attached to its brand of mayhem. The zombies genre seems all the rage now within today's pop cultural climate. Of course with the continued disconnected gory gumption of damaged duds such as Apocalypse the future invitation of visiting the zombie zone in entertainment may become as extinct as the dinosaur.

(c) Frank Ochieng (2015) || > Scouts guide to the night of the living dead.

At first I believed it was a children's horror movie, I have not even known it was rated R. In the opening scene itself convinced me that it's going to be aggressive as the progression commence. Yeah, it lived up to my last minute expectation. A fine time pass movie for the regular audience, definitely it won't suits for the critics' viewing.

When the three friends find virus outbreak in their town that turns everyone into zombies, they plan to make into a safe place along saving a few others in their attempt. Surely this is what every zombie movie you have seen dealt with. The same old adventure in zombie theme, but the characters and the scenarios were different with lots of fun. I was surprised at that part, surely a cult status will be tagged for it.

Overall movie was decent, but being a horror-comedy was its strength. Just leave the logics behind and enjoy the entertainment it offers. In the end you will be convinced for your patience. It is the movie you might like it, but can't give full marks. One of the many reasons was, it is not a mainstream actor or the filmmaker's film. But still the entire team was awesome, and delivered its purpose. It was not a box office hit, but still I expect there will be a sequel.

7/10 || I thought this film would be a cross between 'Superbad' and 'Zombieland'. I think I was too accurate. There is nothing original about this film. I suppose originality is not what you are looking for when sitting down to this film which is fair enough but every single character has been ripped from the pages of previous 'teen' movie scripts that have gone before it and the humour doesn't even make it stand out.

The story does move on slightly from the tiresome quest of American teenagers wanting to get laid when the zombies appear (spoiler alert!) which kept my interest slightly. The over-the-top gore was fun but only distracted me slightly from how poor the other aspects of the film were.

Overall, the screenplay and performances are nothing to write home about but it was quite well directed.

Biographical movies are always fascinating. If it is not something worthy, the movie would have not taken up the shape. It was a very good movie, and a very important historical subject. It has been 100 years since and now the world we live-in is much different and better. I think after thousands of years, now the women got their freedom.

I thought I knew this story very well, but it was 'Made in Dagenham' which is quite similar to this which is also based on the real. Both the stories take place 50 years apart, but this one was the beginning of a new era for women, not without sacrifices and sufferings.

Great actors, great actings, awesome storytelling, cinematography at its best, direction was amazing and the music was so pleasant, but the method of dealing was a bit gruesome, and sometimes brutal. I thought the terrorism is a new word, but this movie gives a different perspective and meaning to that.

You would definitely love this film if you respect women. All women cast movie, including the director, but for everyone. It might have begun in the UK, but the entire planet saw a drastic change and still taking place in some places. I don't see any reason why I should not recommend it to you.

8/10 || Deeds, not words.

It's a telling point in history, that of the Suffragettes, the militant women's organisations in the early 20th century who, under the banner ""Votes for Women"", fought for the right to vote in public elections. So case in point that any filmic treatments are greatly anticipated - and wanted of course, so here we have Sarah Gavron's film that is written by Abi Morgan and starring Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleeson, Anne-Marie Duff, Ben Whishaw and in cameo Meryl Streep.

Right off the bat it should be noted on two crucial points, one is that this is merely a story strand involving a group of Suffragette women, this is not all encompassing, something which is emphasised by the fact that Suffragette leader Emeline Pankhurst is only cameoed here by Streep. Secondly it has to be said that this is a condensed narrative for story telling emotional gain in favour of the Suffragettes, their more serious activities for attention are very much played down. So with that in mind anyone interested in the subject are urged to seek out literary sources for story as facts.

Filthy Panks!

The gripping story here dramatizes events that builds to the death of Emily Davison at the 1913 Derby. We are privy to the harsh realities of the life of women in this era (period detail superb), the employment pay structures, the treatment at the hands of the authorities, and the home lives that could result in losing ones child on account of poverty. It's potent stuff and ensures that we at least understand the need for change and fully support the women in their ultimate goal, the arguments put forward viable and just.

Thankfully the makers are not on a one way mission to portray all men as monsters, there's a nice balance between good and bad. The implications of the women's long road to reckoning is given thought, the social distortion possibility hanging in the air alongside economic murkiness. So although the narrative often gets heavy handed in striving for dramatic impact, the point is well and truly made and begs all to delve further into a cause that ultimately needed winning.

Small in scale as regards the Suffrage Movement as a whole, but important as an historical pointer and acted with professional assuredness by the cast, this achieves its goals regardless of condensement gripes. 7/10 || This is a good example of what a solid ensemble of strong women actors, coupled with an equally strong story and a creative style of direction (from Sarah Gavron) can do to illustrate really well an historical scenario. Inspired by the sparingly used Meryl Streep as Emmeline Pankhurst, this film depicts the tale of a group of women who decide that they have had enough of being put upon because of their sex, and who put their liberty on the line with a campaign of civil disobedience. The central character is ""Maud"" (Carey Mulligan) married to the nice but rather ineffective ""Sonny"" (Ben Whishaw). When she joins what he sees as the rabble-rousers, he chucks her out of their family home and denies her access to their son. She must now take up lodgings with other, like-minded women and take up the cudgels for their suffrage. It is very wordy, the dialogue is actually intrusive at times. We can see what is happening, and we can use our own emotions to empathise - we don't need quite the running commentary we are provided with here, but that said this is still a potent mix of drama and fact that demonstrates the multitude of factors that influenced the politics of the day. Not least that it wasn't just men who wanted to deny women the vote - there were plenty of women who also felt the activity of these ""radicals"" was downright un-ladylike trouble-making. The film looks good, the attention to details and the costumes add a richness (and, on occasion, quite an effective stuffiness) to the proceedings, and though I am really not a great fan of POV cinematography, it does lend an intimacy as we get into the thick of things. It's probably worth saying that this film really only deals with the start of the struggle for emancipation - not in a ball and chain sense, but of a rebellion against illiberalism of sex, faith, sexuality that is still ongoing a century after this is set. A touch melodramatic at times, but still the contributions of Anne-Marie Duff and a slightly over-cooked Helena Bonham Carter all serve to present us with an entertaining and plausible drama that is enjoyable and informative to watch."

Well, the directing/writing trio of Francois Simard, Yoann-Karl Wissell and Anouk Wissell deliver the devilish gaudy goods in this frolicking futuristic fantasy that begs for audiences to reminisce about such off-beat and clichéd guilty pleasures that are so goofy-minded and gory but infectiously high-spirited for one’s disturbed liking.

Instinctively, ‘Turbo Kid’ looks to shrewdly ridicule the jolting junk cinema with its homage to such trashy treasures ranging from the lopsided likes of gems ‘The New Barbarians’ and 2019,  ‘After The Fall Of New York’ to even saluting high-minded 80’s roguish schlock such as the international cult favorite ‘The Road Warrior’. Fortified with kinetic kookiness and an off-kilter preference for its cockeyed convictions, ‘Turbo Kid’ generates an appealing penchant for cheeky outlandishness that we all relish in our taste for low-grade, salacious cinema.  

Astutely, ‘Turbo Kid’ sets out to do what it is compelled to do and that is to trigger the hungry imagination for yesteryear’s yearning for those gloriously cheapened, low-budgeted cornball capers that oddly registered with the fanboys’ appreciation for convoluted, sensationalistic big screen cheeseball escapism that this unruly genre provided on many occasions for the sanctioned unintentional chuckles.  The gruesome threesome of Simard and the Wissells refreshingly never shy away from the bombastic serving of violence and hokey-minded hedonism  that are the true trademark of throwaway entertainment at its finest.

As the lone wolf adolescent in the distant future of 1997, the orphaned Kid (‘Degrassi: The Next Generation’s Munro Chambers) survives in a tattered world defaced by ominous components of Mother Nature (namely acid rain) and the aftermath results of nuclear destruction. The existence for The Kid, frankly speaking, is bleak and nothing to write home about enthusiastically. Nevertheless, he keeps himself engaged with what he likes to do consistently whether it is chilling out in his bomb shelter-style quarters, riding freely on his BMX bike or browsing comic books–particularly his favorite issue of ‘Turbo Man’ .

Of course things become quite interesting for The Kid when he meets up with the ever-so-quirky Apple (Laurence Labeouf), a young woman whose strangeness and mysterious backstory becomes an attractive magnet for the soon-to-be daring hero. The opportunity arises for The Kid to show his heroic chops (much like his idol Turbo Man) when his galpal Apple’s safety is jeopardized by resident fiend Zeus (Michael Ironside). Not only does the diabolical Zeus kidnap Apple but looks to manipulate and dictate the region’s precious water supply. Naturally, this does not sit well with the miffed Kid as he already harbors resentment towards Zeus based on past unkind dealings with the Villainous One.

As luck would have it The Kid discovers what appears to be Turbo Man’s powered costume and arsenal of skills. Conveniently, this is enough to transform the youngster into a formidable force to take on the dastardly Zeus, restore the honor of the loopy Apple and save the day in general. Not too bad for a wandering cad that escaped his reality in a reliable comic book only to become a real-life comic book rescuer in the form of his worshiped mentor Turbo Man.

Sure, the mayhem and mockery is indeed over-the-top and as lame as the proceedings are in reality one still cannot stop from looking away. ‘Turbo Kid’, with its bloody wackiness in tow, toasts its creative absurdity proudly. The corrosive camp factor works because the mindset is geared for unapologetic subversion into a flagrant fantasy that wears its badge of debauchery with sordid honor. The exaggerated and bizarre displays of colorful chaos as drowned out in crazy-minded outfits, challenging bike chases, manufactured doom-and-gloom predicaments and the basic plodding of good versus evil make ‘Turbo Kid’ an ambitiously naughty and boisterous delight. Clearly, the filmmakers demonstrate their affinity for the aforementioned off-balanced furious-minded fluff of the 80s and early 90s that invaded video shelves the same way weary soldiers approached the unknown shores of Normandy.  Combative, unconventional and guaranteed to impale one’s exposed guts on a spiked iron fence ‘Turbo Kid’ is weird and wonderful if only for the afterglow of basking in the art of dimwitted decadence so lovingly realized in the not-so-forgettable impulsive retro flicks of shining shame from the years past.

MPAA Rating: Unrated

Genre: Science Fiction/Post Apocalyptic Action and Adventure

Critic’s rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars) || > Inspired by the comics to defeat an enemy.

It was made in the style of the 80s movie and the story sets in the future, that mean in the late 90s. If your childhood were the 90s, probably you would have seen plenty of the 80s sci-fi films and this one is dedicated to the fans of that era. Kind of semi-superhero movie like 'Super' and 'Defendor'. Other than that this film has nothing to do with 'New Kids Turbo' and its sequel 'Nitro' as I initially presumed it might the third in the series.

I thought it was a pretty cool flick, so much fun. Sort of replicates the recent 'Mad Max' film, but both the flicks came into the production at a same time and this one is not all about the chasing or even a road flick. So I think it just inspired by the previous trilogy from that franchise, where automobiles are replaced by the BMXes here. Kind of eco-friendly movie!

As the many post-apocalyptic themes depicted, this one as well prioritised about a regional conflict for the source of water. A territory where a ruthless man controlled it and he kills who pose a threat to his crown. There comes an act of revenge from a boy and a girl along a man who challenge him. Who's going to that win the battle is what the finale of the movie.

> ""A man never knows how strong he is
> until being strong is the only choice he has.""

The first impression was the movie is for all, especially for the kids, but once the action parts begin to take place, my stance has changed. There are no high-end stunts, but too much of blood and gore. Although, nothing was so serious, somehow keeps entertaining and sometimes slightly disgusting, but the momentum was held at a moderate pace throughout the film.

The character Apple was so sweet and cute who actually lifted the movie's spirit with her funny, bubbly part, but also disappoints to learn the what's her kind is. Pretty much she helped to bring faintly a romantic atmosphere around which I was not expected. A simple story and a simple twist with the good characters and the fine supporting visuals.

Definitely an above average, but still not that awesome, excepting it is very enjoyable for the first watch. The filmmakers were the quite newcomers, but proved enough with their abilities, under a limited budget to give an acceptable standard flick. If you are okay with the B flicks, then it won't upset you, except you are not familiar with those types. I think it will hit a cult status moving into the next decade and so on among the B movie fans.

An independent film, ""War Room"" (2015) only cost $3 million to make and incredibly became the #1 movie in America upon release. Is it worthy of such a feat?

With inspirational dramas like this I naturally ask myself if I was inspired, and the answer is very much so. Also, did the drama pull me into the lives of the characters and make me forget that I was watching a movie? Yes. The movie effectively addresses real life issues that real families have to deal with and overcome. I could relate to several of the situations.

The movie's similar in ways to 2010's underrated ""Cutback"" (see my review), but made with a bigger budget and is therefore all-around more polished. ""War Room"" is just a great drama and inspiring to boot. It overtly talks about God and prayer in a Christian context, so if that offends you you'll probably want to give it a pass. It goes without saying that topics like this are difficult to pull off realistically and un-awkwardly in cinema, but ""War Room"" impressively pulls it off.

The movie runs 120 minutes and was shot in North Carolina.

It was poorly acted and written on the most part. It was predictable and just seemed like a forgettable straight-to-video gangster film. However, the only saving grace (and a really good one) was Tom Hardy.

Hardy was brilliant in the main roles (playing both of the Kray twins). He made the film funny and really tense when it tried to be. The soundtrack was also really good.

★★★ || Tom Hardy is quite accomplished here as he portrays both of the legendary London gangster Kray twins. The pair managed to stay one step ahead of the pursuing constabulary (led here by Christopher Ecclestone's ocassional appearances as ""Nipper of there Yard"") for many a year living the life of Riley whilst killing, extorting and running a network of protection rackets in the East of the city through their infamous ""Firm"" gang of henchmen. His persona of Reggie presents us with the more calculating, business-like approach whilst his portrayal of the sometimes gay Ronnie delivers a loose-cannon, violent character - but to be clear, it's pretty safe to say that neither are to be messed with, even by those closest to them. Much of the narrative dwells rather disappointingly on the relationship between Reggie and his first wife Frances (Emily Browning) and actually the rest of this is all rather weak and shallow. Aside from a few flirtations in a seamy gay brothel, the seedier side of Ronnie's life is barely touched upon and the story seems intent more on bringing us the bullet points of their lives rather than trying to develop anything like an insight into their respective (and frequently quite unstable) personalities. It's produced to a very high standard with much attention to the detail of 1960s London, but somehow the whole thing is just a bit too empty. The shell of a story that tries to cram too much into too little screen time. It's watchable, and is certainly better than the 1990 attempt at telling us the story of these brothers - but this is probably a story that can only be told comprehensively in a mini-series that allows the nature of their brutal yet sometimes quite sophisticated personalities to emerge more fully."

RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Jason Lei Howden, ""Deathgasm” is a horror/comedy about a group of teens in Auckland, New Zealand, who start an extreme metal band named Deathgasm and inadvertently unleash dark forces that possess the nearby populace.

“Deathgasm” combines elements of “Evil Dead II” (1987), “Trick or Treat” (1986) and “Braindead” aka “Dead Alive” (1992). Amidst the sometimes profane and tasteless happenings, there are moments of masterful hilarity (e.g. the Peter Criss joke and the black metal photo op in the woods), including black comedy, naturally.

Numerous seminal bands are acknowledged throughout, some of which are worthy of the recognition and some not so worthy: Death, Judas Priest, Bathory, Slayer, GWAR, Cannibal Crap, ad nauseam. (Even Def Leppard is noted, which some might find odd, but it reveals the open mindedness of Howden; besides, they were definitely a metal band during their first few albums, albeit not extreme metal). Florida’s Trivium is curiously referenced throughout the flick, which tells me they’re a big hit in New Zealand (‘cause they ain’t all that big in the USA, although they’re certainly a formidable metal act).

The band’s name, Deathgasm, is presumably an homage to Wargasm and Death or Death Angel. The main protagonist, Brodie (Milo Cawthorne), looks like a cross between a young Alice Cooper and Keith Deen, the vocalist of Holy Terror (R.I.P.) while his buddy, Zakk (James Blake), resembles a pasty version of Conan the Barbarian. Kimberley Crossman is cute, curvy and formidable as the blonde babe, but the camera rarely zeroes-in on her beauty, unfortunately.

There’s the stereotypical myth that Christianity and Christians are opposed to metal, but Black Sabbath started the genre and they had overtly pro-Christian songs, like “After Forever” and “War Pigs.” If you doubt that, just read the lyrics. Or how about the ending of “Hallowed Be Thy Name”? Not to mention that there are scores of kick-axx metal bands that have espoused biblical themes in a positive sense, like Cage, Trouble, Megadeth, W.A.S.P., Saint, Tourniquet, Bride, Saviour Machine, Living Sacrifice, Antestor, Zao, Seventh Angel, Theocracy, Barnabas, Believer, Overkill, Deadly Blessing, Avenged Sevenfold and (of course) Stryper. Notice, by the way, that I didn’t say they were all “Christian bands,” just that they have all blatantly espoused biblical themes on occasion. Needless to say, the idea that metal is intrinsically anti-God is laughable. Get real. Christianity has been part of the genre since day one.

The accents are kinda thick so you might want to use the subtitles if you live outside of New Zealand and Australia.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 26 minutes and was shot entirely in west Auckland. The soundtrack features several New Zealand bands unknown outside of the local scene.

Before this film hitting the screens, I remember many experts were expecting it doing well at the Oscars. Now it's got 4 Oscar nods, even though it is very sad the movie is a hit and miss. A slipped away opportunity, had a great storyline, but the outcome was decent. An important historical biopic, at least for a certain section of the audience. I respect that, but it did not impress me as I anticipated.

From the Academy Award winning director for the movie 'The King's Speech', and the last year's winner for a lead role, Eddie Reddmayne together did not deliver the expected masterpiece. But Alicia Vikander was so good, another brilliant co-female-star display just like Felicity Jones from Eddie's previous movie 'The Theory of Everything'. If I were a jury I would definitely give the supporting actress award to her, that's the result I'm hoping for in the next Sunday.

The actor did a hard work for the title role, in the many scenes he mastered it, but that's where I slightly disappointed. I felt his character was a little intense, maybe I'm not getting him because I'm straight. The locations, costumes, even the direction and music were good. Both the lead actors kind looks alike, no doubt on the casting, but it only should have been a bit better in exhibiting story.

Maybe the pace should have been a little quicker as well as some sentimentally appealing scenes would have done good. I desperate to give more marks, but I can't go beyond this. I won't consider it a bad flick, what I meant was a missed opportunity to be a masterpiece. So overall,  it is a good watch.

7/10 || ""You helped bring Lili to life, but she was always there.""

_The Danish Girl_ certainly took a long time getting to the big screen. The script went through dozens of iterations after David Ebershoff’s book was first was optioned. The cast changed numerous times. Directors passed it back and forth. Finally, after fifteen years of floating around, Tom Hooper’s film was released. And while the lead performances were brilliant, the film itself felt a bit flat. And weirdly, this seems to be something we say far too often about films that take a long time to get to the silver screen. Join us – Pete Wright and Andy Nelson – as we wrap up our Transgender series with Hooper’s 2015 film _The Danish Girl_.

We talk about what works in the film, but we really try to dig and figure out what might be causing it to have its issues. We look at the journey the book took to get to the screen, and look at the age-old question of what responsibility do filmmakers/storytellers have to the original story and the original people when making biopics. We discuss Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander and what they bring to the table here, along with their fellow thespians. We chat about the incredible look this film has and how it fits in with the story. And we touch on how this series has opened our eyes to other great films that we would love to share down the line.

This was a fun series, even if it ended on a bit of a downer note. It did give us perspective for the world of transgenders and what they go through to feel ‘right’ in their own bodies. We have a great time talking about this movie, so check it out then tune in!

and the podcatcher of your choice! || **Highly militant, a more neutral film would have been better.**

This is a difficult film to comment on. On the one hand, and speaking exclusively from a technical point of view, it is a really good and well-made film. On the other hand, I have many questions and points of disagreement that prevent me from really approving it. And the reader better be ready to disagree healthily with what I write, because I'm not used to hiding what I think, or amputating my opinions under the guillotine of political correctness.

I know that the film was acclaimed when it came out and that the publicity machine sold it very well. I also know that it is one of the most beloved films in the GLBT (and all the letters and symbols they want to add) community. I have already written some reviews of other films, in which I criticized the excessive yielding to political correctness or moral/social lobbies. Since cinema is an artistic and leisure experience, I don't like to see it used for advertising or indoctrination of ideas and morals. We are supposed to enjoy watching a film and seeing the talent and artistry of those involved, not feeling that the film is trying to tell us what we should think about a subject or a theme, which is what this film tries to do. For this indoctrination, the script addresses an unknown figure: Einar Wegener, a Danish landscape painter little known internationally because he became known more as a “trans” personality than as a painter.

Married to Gerda Wegener, also a painter, it was only after he was married that he discovered (or assumed) his femininity, moving to Paris and starting to assume himself as a woman and using the name Lili Elvenes. What is certain is that he was one of the first men to undergo a surgical process of genital reconstruction, which ended with the rejection of the transplanted organ and the generalized infection that led to his death. The clinical process was burned by Nazism. From that time, only a few of Wegener's diaries and testimonies of those who knew him survive, material that was, after his death, collected and edited in the book “Man Into Woman”, in 1933. Far from being a biography (much less an autobiography, as it is commonly called), the book's objective was to make the public aware of the details about Wegener's condition and the innovative and risky medical procedure he agreed to undergo.

Conveniently, the script had just enough historical data to concoct a good melodrama, full of heartache, existential doubts, and plenty of trans-friendly material. It was what was wanted. More pragmatic issues, such as the relationship between Einar and his original family and the consequences of his transition on his art, and on its acceptance by the public and the market, are never addressed. The film prefers to convey propaganda, as in the famous scene in which the character is attacked in a garden. Such aggression has no logic in a city as liberal as Paris and there is no historical data to sustain that Wegener was assaulted or insulted in that city, where the couple moved in order to have more artistic opportunities and live the frenzy of the Roaring Twenties. However, in order to fulfill its doctrinal role, the film needed to give that pin to those who, today, discriminate “trans” people, so the scene was placed at a point where the public would already have a certain sympathy with the character. Militant from start to finish, the film irritated me greatly. A neutral approach, faithful to the known facts and allowing the public to think for itself, would have been better.

Despite not liking the way the film was conceived, I loved Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander's work. They dedicated themselves, especially her, which earned her an Oscar, awarded with complete justice (the question of being a Supporting Actress or not seems to me a minor issue, and perhaps she also thought so). The only objection I have to make is this: why not a legitimate “trans” actor for the lead role? I understand Redmayne's choice, but I don't think he even looks like the real Wegener. Well, to be honest, I didn't like Amber Heard either, I think her character is left here, and it would have been better to replace her with someone closer to the main character (one of Wegener's brothers, for example).

Technically, the film has good production values ​​that are worth noting: the sets and costumes are excellent and recreate very well the era and the environments where the characters move, the cinematography is really very good and the choice of filming locations it was done in a very thoughtful and judicious way. The soundtrack, despite sounding mellow and slow, fits well in the film."

Some of the decent second tier horror and zombie movies were made in the 2015 and this is one of that. When the actors are in demand, we expect big from their movies, but this story suits for these actors. Because an average story looks better with guys are not in the watch-out list. So I was not surprised with the movie, but enjoyed the entertainment it offered.

Rainn Wilson's the man of the movie, but as for the narration Elijah Woods stands on the front. In this, the children were the antagonist, but it is an R rated movie and nothing was so serious to consider. You know bashing kids kind of stuffs were carefully crafted. Comedy means not like you're going to get the loud ones, but simply acceptable for a change in the storytelling.

If you exclude the zombie kids, the rest of the movie was nothing new. The same old adventure with the similar group of people who tries to survive the epidemic. Especially how it all begins was not logical, so you better not look for a proper explanation for those things. Even the runtime was well shorter than the 90 minutes that makes it sweet, Overall a fun movie, only if you accept what it delivers than what you want.

From the director of 'Blue Ruin', yet another crime-thriller. This time it revolves around a rock band who trapped in the neo-nazi enclosure on the outskirt of the city. So how do they plan to get away from the green room they're locked in, and armed men are outside waiting for them to take down. The film filled with lots of tense moments and mostly unpredictable stuffs which is a one day event.

I was not surprised, I just expected something as smart as the director's previous film. He retained his favourite actor, Macon Blair to play an important role as their third collaboration in this multistarrer and he once again did well. This theme is not the first time explored, it is a well known, but the setting was very unique. All the actors were amazing, but truly very sad to hear the news about Anton Yelchin. He was a young and a wonderful actor and his '5 to 7' was my favourite.

At first, I thought the plot was so silly. I wondered why they did not use the excessive force as they're capable to tackle such situation. But that's the best part, because they threw away the cliché and approached for something new way to deal it. So the writer, I mean the director did great to carve a rare and thrilling film of the year.

There's no martial arts, criminal gang's collision or the cops fighting the bad guys; it was about how the normal people confront during a hostile situation in the real world. Blue and Green are done, now I'm waiting for the director to announce his next colour project.

I watched this because it sounded like another 'Midnight Son'. But I did not find anything like that, in fact, I'm disappointed. It is a B movie and showing our displeasure is definitely not worth. Because I went for it knowing what kind of film it is, so expecting a miracle was a foolishness. Honestly, I enjoyed watching this film, but did not like. Though the effort, including the production quality and performances were laudable.

I don't know many of these actors, that's how a film like this works, but they did their best. The entire film was shot inside an office. The tale takes place nearly two or maybe three days, but the narration stayed in the office and built a story out of it. It is the story of a bunch of lazy office employees who always plays games in their computer placing bets. But when their new manager arrives, he demands a good result for the company to grow. So overloaded with works, employees begin to act strangely, but couple of them comes to know the reason and decides to fight against it.

I think some people would like it, but to find out you are one of those, you have to take a chance on this. The film had potential, but was not fully utilised to make it a classic like you say the one I mentioned in the very first line. Particularly the last few minutes were submerged with the usual horror-comedy stuffs, so boring. If it were clever in some parts, I would have personally recommended it. Overall a better screenplay would have saved the film, but believe me, still it is the worst film of the 2015 I have seen.

Another flick that sets in an isolated place with the limited cast. A low budget film, which was a remake of the 'Death Game'. After playing a strong character in his previous film, Keanu Reeves is back exactly opposite to that one. Yep, remember what happened to the two men who break-in into his house in 'John Wick', but here it is like what if he's not able to handle them or to do anything about it kind of Circumstance.

He played a normal family guy, a father of two children with a beautiful wife and a big house. The trailer itself revealed half of what the movie's. But the rest of the film is not bad at all, and that does not count as I'm praising it. The movie was average because of the writing was too loose. Not only predictable, but aimlessly moved and the motives were never explained. So the mystery remains mystery.

It was one of those films that leaves behind us to suspect the possibilities. A broad open for a sequel, but likely there's very less chance for another film. The girls were so good looking and performed well. The theme aimed for erotic-crime-thriller, but did it achieved? I don't know, the original was released in the 70s, which might have been too sexy for that time, but in the present world, it is not that special or effective, just like 'I Spit on Your Grave'. You could watch it to enjoy your moment, but it would be a cinematically impressive with the great writings, actings, with twists and turns and all.

5/10 || Just say no!

Eli Roth directs and co-writes the screenplay with Nicolás López and Guillermo Amoedo. It stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Music is by Manuel Riveiro and cinematography by Antonio Quercia. 

Reeves plays Evan, a devoted husband and father of two, who while he is left home alone, is visited by two young women soaked and apparently lost. Letting them in to his home as an act of kindness, things quickly spiral out of control.

You do wonder if Eli Roth sits at home looking at the reaction to his movie and giggles like a schoolboy. It's invariably a distinctly average film, but it does get a reaction from the audience, something which Roth is gleefully aware of. Pic is actually a remake of Peter S. Traynor's 1977 movie, Death Game, which starred Sondra Locke and Colleeen Camp, both of whom lend their names to production for this release.

At times it feels like we are part of one of Roth's wet dreams, or conversely one of his sick jokes. Yet as the cast struggle to instill acting gravitas (the girls actually become more annoying than frightening), and Roth chooses psychological themes over blood and guts, there's a deft whiff of a moral fable hanging in the air. While also of note is the nods to film noir, both in story and visuals. It isn't enough to save the piece, but it's interesting enough as an aside to the chaos inside the house. 5/10  || **Finally, Roth gives us something of value: even with its flaws, this film entertains its audience and works nicely.**

Many years ago, a film came out where a pair of young seductresses managed to sneak into the home of a middle-aged rich man, seduce him and torment him: “Death Game” is one of those films that almost no one will remember now. I haven't seen it yet, but having seen this modern remake, I'm curious to see the older film.

Eli Roth gives us a very simple film. What I said above fits this film perfectly: Evan Webber is a conventional husband and family man who makes the mistake of giving shelter to two really attractive girls who, after a shower and clean clothes, decide to repay him with a night of adulterous and totally sinful sex. However, what seemed like an erotic dream come true turns into a nightmare when they begin to terrorize Evan.

This is not a brilliant, surprising film, it will never join a pantheon of great films, whatever genre or subgenre it may be, but it works and gives us what it promises: a sense of menace and pleasant tension, entertainment and a decent story. Of course, there are problems. For example, how would those girls know so much about Evan and his family without having spent a good deal of time spying on him? They showed, at various times, that he had not been chosen at random and that there was an intention in what they were doing with him. This is weird because the movie wants to explain it, but it doesn't do it very well. Personally, I think it would have been better if the film didn't exploit their intentions and just played with all the information they could get from Evan on that short night visit.

Be that as it may, this is, as far as I've seen, Eli Roth's best film to date: ""Cabin Fever"" was a decent effort, but very campy, and ""Hostel"" turned out to be simply unpalatable in its ambition to imitate the worst of “Saw”. Roth seems to have finally learned that what scares us most is what is beyond our sight or foresight. Liters of fake blood and human bodies being hacked to pieces only serve to ruin the theater popcorn vendor's business.

Keany Reeves is the film's big star and the highest rated, and perhaps highest paid, actor here. He did a good job, with a character that, in other hands, could have been more limited, one-dimensional or sketchy. Over time, Reeves gives us a simple, down-to-earth, credibly authentic man, someone we can like. Someone who makes mistakes, but who still elicits sympathy by being punished far more severely than could be justified. Reeves never lets the character be just a puppet. However, the film is entirely dominated by female performances: slender and dangerous, Lorenza Izzo – the director's wife – and Cuban newcomer Ana de Armas deserve our full attention.

Technically, it is a film that stands out for its simplicity: everything takes place in a unique environment, and the scenery and costumes are reduced to the simplest, but effective and functional. Cinematography does not bring surprises or innovations, it bets on conventional formats and solutions and on pragmatism. The soundtrack isn't especially notable either."

I am observing closely Jake Gyllenhaal's acting career and he's giving the best performances in all his films. He's one of top 5 best actor of our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it was, but not that great.

What he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with the wonderful director.

It was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts, but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.

I think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a weird person, so you would easily get it. You must need to be a patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for Gyllenhaal alone. I can't say it should have been better, because there's nothing to get better, everything was at its best.

7/10 || Early on in Demolition there is a brief but interesting scene. Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is looking in a mirror, crying the way bad actors do – i.e., contorting the face to compensate for the inability to produce tears.

Gyllenhaal is of course far from a bad actor, and sure enough, Davis immediately regains his composure. Was he rehearsing? Quite possibly, especially when you consider that he seems more concerned with the faulty vending machine in the hospital hallway than the fact that his wife Julia (Heather Lind) has just died in a car accident.

But Davis is not a heartless bastard; he simply finds it easier to depend on the kindness of strangers. For example, the letter he writes to the vending machine company, which quickly becomes a confessional epistle, and gives us a clue to his impassive reaction to Julia's death.

In contrast, Davis is unable to relate to Phil Eastwood (Chris Cooper), Julia's father. As usual, Cooper delivers the goods, in particular an emotional speech about how there is no word – such as ‘orphan’ or ‘widower’ – to describe someone who has lost a child.

Ironically, while we've been fascinated by Cooper's craft, Davis’s mind has been wandering, trying to discern why the drinks are so expensive at the restaurant where they're at, without taking the slightest notice of a single word his father-in-law has said.

Meanwhile, the letters he will continue to write to the vending machine company customer service department become his main outlet. In a delightful plot twist, Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts), the company's only customer service rep, has been moved to tears by Davis's missives, and begins talking to him on the phone.

Davis is certainly an intriguing character, and to develop him Gyllenhaal has borrowed from others as well as himself. Davis is outwardly a vain, aloof yuppie like Christian Bale in American Psycho – although instead of dismembering people, he takes apart machines, not bothering to put them back together again.

At the same time, he undergoes an inner transformation that is a combination of Kevin Spacey's in American Beauty and Ron Livingston's in Office Space. Also, Davis becomes the opposite of Gyllenhaal's character in Moonlight Mile.

Unfortunately, Demolition loses momentum in the second half, with director Jean-Marc Vallée putting the plot on autopilot. Davis and Karen's relationship is perfect when limited to letters and phone calls, but goes awry as soon as they meet in person. Additionally, and completely out of the clear blue sky, Davis is diagnosed with a rare medical condition that results in part of his heart being apparently eaten by “gypsy moths.” The hell?.

All things considered, Demolition feels familiar, and we can recognize elements we've seen elsewhere, but while some of it is clichéd, the outside-the-box use of some of those familiar elements is in itself refreshing; furthermore, Gyllenhaal provides another stellar performance."

In satirizing the underbelly of deceptive politicking—whether domestic or foreign—there has to be a strong sense of cynicism and truth with caustic humor as the foundation for the perceptive microscope examining the outlandishness.  There can only be a certain elite class of films that demonstrate such penetration and probing into the political spectrum of strident skepticism.  After all, not many pundit pictures in the arena of political turmoil can effectively skewer the consciousness of doubters willing to go along in the authoritative malaise of our so-called policymakers.

Sure, not every attempt at political satire will hit its mark in stride and freshness. Classic offerings such as Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove Or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb  or even lighter and impish selections as Barry Levinson’s Wag the Dog or Mike Nichols’s Primary Colors  have proven to possess the right touch of roving ridicule to convey its point of naughty outrage and reflection.  In David Gordon Green’s well-meaning but repetitive and lightweight political put-on Our Brand is Crisis we revisit the familiar behind-the-scenes corruption and chaos all shielded by political white-washing. The trouble with Crisis is that it does not have the convincing and energetic punch to compete or compare to the class of other films that have touched upon these familiar shady political themes with more forceful bite.  

Indeed, Our Brand is Crisis has its witty moments and it is cheeky enough to tip toe through its see-saw penchant for tension and ticklish situations. Plus, the casting of the Oscar-winning Sandra Bullock (known for both her forte into dramatic and comedic turns) as a glib and weary consultant called into action seemed like a suitable fit for the resilient actress. Still, Our Brand is Crisis merely dabbles, drips and drags at revealing the American presence of political operatives in a South American country that cries corruption in its flawed political system. Hence, there is nothing really juicy or jolting about Brand that would suggest a distinctive or dire take in its observation as political pretentiousness as usual. 

Our Brand of Crisis is the fictionalized account based on Rachel Boynton's 2005 documentary that is similarly titled. Boynton's narrative solely focused on the 2002 presidential election in Bolivia. Well, director Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan imagine their big screen version of Boynton's exposition with Bullock at the helm as ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine, a once crafty-minded consultant called back into service after experiencing a nervous breakdown and retreating to an idyllic existence away from the political spotlight.   

Pulling Calamity Jane away from her resting mode based on the urgency for her input into the Bolivian presidential scene are current consultants Nell and Ben (Ann Dowd and Anthony Mackie) whose hats are thrown in the ring of former president and now senator Pedro Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida). They need Calamity Jane's pit bull prowess to ensure that their candidate Castillo can prevail over the favorable and formidable likes of political rival Rivera (Louis Arcella). However, Calamity Jane's stamina is tested by the Bolivia surroundings making her constantly queasy. Also, the candidate she is representing in Castillo is not exactly her cup of tea either.

Calamity Jane's blunt blueprint for putting the failing campaign of Catillo on track over the popular front-runner Rivera is quite effective in manipulation. The plan: Bodine must invent for Castillo an imaginary ""crisis"" for the country in an attempt to put some cloudiness in the less experienced Rivera's booming candidacy. Any emerging conflict to baffle the country into panic will ultimately benefit the veteran Castillo over the wet-behind-the-ears endearing Rivera. It is a dirty agenda but hey...Jane Bodine is the mistress of madness and there is a reason why she was summoned to get involved and parlay Castillo to victory because her tricks and tactics have some shifty merit attached. Whether authorizing bogus and negative ad campaigns against Rivera or stirring up concocted panic to swirl around doubt that can question Castillo's opponent's qualifications Bodine certainly does not leave any rocks unturned in her relentless quest to put her assigned candidate over the top in the polls. 

One cannot possibly overlook Calamity Jane's other motive for jumping on board and aiding the Castillo camp to triumph over his celebrated Bolivian rival. Apparently at stake is the former alcoholic Bodine's bruised ego, unflinching competitive nature and regrettable incompleteness cause by one Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton). Candy was instrumental in defeating Bodine in a previous political showdown so now it is her turn for redemption as she seeks to hand Candy some humble pie as her candidate must defeat his candidate (yes, Candy is working for the front-running Rivera) as the battle of political wits resurfaces on Bolivian soil.      

In a sense Our Brand is Crisis is challenging and ambitious with its concept of American political outsiders enforcing their superior will and ways on a foreign country as they subject an already pressured people and government to more scrutinized and mischievous practices beset by seemingly corruptible Yankee intruders. But this is the main problem because Crisis never rises to the occasion of following up on the interesting dilemma it wants to poke a stick at with cautionary, dark-seeded chuckles.

Straughan's screenplay is too pedestrian and soft to tackle the outcry set forth in allowing these seedy American political strategists to manipulate, malign and woefully motivate the political process being shaped in a foreign country they are conveniently using for their own beleaguered backyard. Why not take a hearty potshot at such nerviness pertaining to the American political machine interfering abroad? And even if this is what Crisis was doing in its raucous skin the film still did not dig deep enough to find any resolution in such perceived outlandishness. 

In order to be an enticing political satire the presentation has to show some bold and blunt sentiments behind its proposed purpose of cynicism. Our Brand is Crisis simply hints at its misplaced naughtiness without adding any decisive meat to the bone of contempt. Is Bullock's calculating political strategist a cold-heart villainess without morals or practical and procedural iron woman playing an appropriate mean round of political poker? Is there more to former President Castillo's stint in office the first time around that may have caused second thoughts in the public's minds not to trust him with executive power once again? Also, Crisis seems mighty clumsy and awkward at times in its balancing of dramatic effect and comical lapses. 

If anything Our Brand is Crisis can be likened to the handling of a fancy gun. Sure, it is impressive to look at hold momentarily in your hands. However, when it comes to actually pulling the trigger the question remains will it convincingly shoot real bullets that make an impact or settle for delivering routine blanks on the spot? In this case Crisis should never have left its holster.

(c) Frank Ochieng (2015) || **Campaigners, candidates and the citizens, everybody on the streets of Bolivia.**

The film was okay, but you have already seen it. This is the same old story where in America, the presidential running candidates do everything they can to win the precious votes, but here it takes place in a different country. Not bad actually, but disappointment is the American influence. Now I tell the truth that it was inspired by the real event. There's already a documentary film made, but now they altered it little and made a political-comedy.

The two campaign runners from the United States goes to Bolivia to aide two different candidates and becomes themselves confront once again. To gain the momentum, they have to go any length, so the fun begins when each others pull their legs. But who's going to stand ultimately and with what tactic is to be revealed in the next half of the film.

I think, except the American characters dominance, the film was refreshing like the locations, supporting cast wise. But actors like Sandra Bullock, Billy Bob Thornton et cetera holds the key. Obviously the star power is one reason and the other is for keeping the real event's touch. The film does not work for everyone, it did do nothing for me. The director of 'Pineapple Express' failed to deliver. But it was a bad screenplay, underdeveloped or maybe lacks some good lines and strong scenes. I totally suggest you to skip it, you would miss nothing.

A new British dystopian-drama sets in a single 40 storey building revolving around the people who resides there. It was based on the novel of the same name which has a great cast and a decently made film. But it is kind of a 50-50 to me, mostly I enjoyed with a little disappointment in some parts. First of all I did not know anything about the film, so surprised with its development, especially when it reached its midway I realised the theme. The setting was great, and well performed by all, particularly the Tom Hiddleton which is very rare to see him in a lead role.

It was the story of a doctor who moved to his new residency in a high-rise tower and tries to blend in with the others. But as the world is falling apart by the collapse of the society and civilisation, his tower block as well affected very seriously of all kinds of supplies where he confronts various threats from its people. The remaining story concentrates where it is going to end and how with some high and low moments.

Occasionally, the narration takes us outside the building, but it does not stay there long enough. At present there are many dystopian films are made, especially for teens, so this is really good and gives the 70s and 80s kind of effect, despite technologically it resembles the current world. Not many people who watched it liked it, so did I. It was not that bad, but the story was not appealing to the 2016 audience, where so many hi-tech films hitting the screen in dystopian theme. From that perspective, it is good we have here a different kind, but not enough. It would have become one of the classic cult if it was made in the 80s or should have been updated thoroughly for making it today.

<em>'The Night Before'</em> makes for very amusing viewing, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie are great together, I like all three actors individually and as a trio they are just as terrific - all give entertaining performances.

Rogen plays the most obvious role for him yet absolutely nails it, Gordon-Levitt is probably the weaker of the three but is still pleasant to watch - as is Mackie. The casting is top notch, with supports like Michael Shannon and Tracy Morgan. There are other noteworthy faces involved too, like Ilana Glazer and Lorraine Toussaint.

The plot isn't anything crazy or distinctive, yet still feels suitably fresh for the vast majority. I will say, though, the film does hit a bit of a wall at around the midway point, but thankfully picks up almost immediately - thanks to a great scene with a couple of fun cameos.

An enjoyable film. It's ridiculous, but they make it work. Recommended."

Academy Award-nominees Ellen Page (“Juno”) and Rachel Evan Wood (“Thirteen”) are the cinematic siblings in Rozema’s (“Kit Kittredge: An American Girl”) meditative, tension-inducing tale about the futuristic flirtation with global panic and disillusionment when the world faces the possibility of a modern-day meltdown in technological dependency. In short, **Into the Forest** is a low-key character study touching upon not only the survival of the deteriorating societal elements but also the bond of sisterhood glued together by faith and fear under dour circumstances.

Rozema’s unassuming yet disciplined direction and thought-provoking script creates a low-toned “end-of-the-world” cynicism that psychologically works in her minimalist melodrama. Also, the film’s leads in Page and Evan Wood provide a heavy dose of believability as the periled sisters trapped in the unpredictable confines of the ominous and isolating Canadian woods out in the middle of nowhere as the worldwide woes of a collapsing powerless predicament threatens the global community. Rozema does an admirable job of establishing layers of disorientation on both a collectively worldly scale and smaller, personalized scale for its clingy siblings-in-distress. **Into the Forest** truly resonates when the audience is forced to realize the frightening footsteps of its sisterly protagonists facing the mental and emotional scrutiny of their jeopardized existences.

Convincingly atmospheric and contemplative, **Into the Forest** manages to be chilling without being over-exaggerated and cliched as one might anticipate in the routine doomsday dramas looking to exploit its nightmarish nuances. The film, as mentioned previously, is set in the near future where sisters Nell (Page) and Eva (Evan Wood) along with their father Robert (Callum Rennie) reside in an expansive house in the woods located in the Pacific Northwest. The narrative wastes no time setting the foundation for its percolating premise when the loss of electricity causes an obvious impact of the uncertainty--stranded out in the broad rustic boundaries without the immediate access to the daily and crucial amenities needed. Nell and Eva come to the realization that the power may not be restored at all. As a result, the starkness and disbelief elevates as the young women must confront the harsh realities as their supply of food and other necessities are diminishing day-by-day. Thus hopelessness, haplessness and helplessness start to rear its ugly head for the unsteadiness of Nell's and Eva's fragile sanity.

Rozema uses **Into the Forest** as an effective landscape for the self-examination of how civilization can easily unravel in a moment's notice. The commentary is not lost on the complacency, indifference and arrogance of mankind taking for granted the gift of planetary conveniences--whether naturally conceived or technologically enhanced. Perhaps **Forest** is not as deep-seeded in traumatic forethought as one might expect but it certainly feels uplifting, genuine and insightful in its message of human despair predicated on a colossal whim of chaos and destruction. **Forest** is unflinching and reflective and clearly shows an edginess and eloquence that is not easily associated with the typical fear-the-unknown fables that are cranked out of Hollywood with bored redundancy. Thankfully, talented performers such as Page and Evan Wood are able to convey that sense of vulnerability that triggers a realistic concern to comply with the film's haunting, creepy theme.

Canadian filmmaker Rozema is no stranger in presenting prickly and complex women in transition of a reactionary canvas of feminine growth and self-discovery. Previous Rozema-helmed film projects such as the aforementioned ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" from 2008 and debuted feature ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing"" (1987) demonstrate the similar traits that embodies the determined spirit and inner doubts and dilemmas of Forest's harried heroines searching for comfort in the eye of threatening madness. Hence, Page and Evan Wood aptly carries the skillful angst and anxieties on their burdensome shoulders in Rozema's resourceful character-driven showcase of a crumbling and catastrophic World Order.

Undoubtedly, **Into the Forest** marches into the wayward woods of darkness in what amounts to be a surreal, disastrous fairy tale tainted in psychological turmoil. Let's say that the likes of Little Red Riding Hood have nothing on the exposed turbulence of **Forest's** sisterly dystopian divas in Page's Nell and Evan Wood's Eva.

**(c) Frank Ochieng (2016)** || Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

Trigger Warning: sexual violence.

Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood carry most of this ""mysterious dystopia"" movie. I'm sure this story can be used as a parallel of what it is to be a woman in the modern world, but I see it as a survival story. The two aren't necessarily exclusive to another.

The ""last person on the planet"" trope is good, but even just the idea of living off-grid is daunting enough to the average person without it being the only option.

It's a sister story right alongside ""Frozen"" and ""Kill La Kill"" to me. The family togetherness is a good lesson woven into the story.

While I'd prefer zombies, they do a great job of showing the story, the character's emotions and how they're feeling about things at any time.

On the frustrating side of it: you get to see people make a lot of mistakes in surviving, which of course progresses the story bit by bit."

Based on a true story, Everest tells about a climbing expedition on the world's highest mountain that would become devastated by a severe snow storm.

She stands and watches over us all, she is Mount Everest, and climbing her is seen as one of the pinnacles of mountaineering. No matter how many lives are lost over the years, there will always be another group of adventurers ready to take on the mountain and the elements that come with her.

The ill fated 1996 trek up Everest gets a worthy cinematic treatment here. Sure it suffers from some of the pitfalls of the disaster movie genre, such as weak characterisations and fake sequences, but emotional investment is high and ready to be grasped by those so inclined. The drama on the mountain is gripping, and thankfully this is matched by the frantic concurrent story strands involving the family and friends waiting at base camp and the family homes. Cinematography is often breathtaking, the acting performances as solid as one of Everest' rock faces, but it's the story that sells itself. A tale well worth reading about, and the cynical among us should do well to remember this fact. 8/10 || > One of the most realistically approached adventure movie based on the real.

I was completely surprised with the movie. Because I was expecting 'Vertical Limit' kind of movie. Like, you know, there's no heroic adventure with the incredible stunt sequences in it. But it was very real and more real. Usually while adapting the true events for the screen, unnecessary overdose stunts created to commercialise the product. But in this it was too much closer to the real world adventure, like a documentary film.

It was a man versus the mother nature and nothing else. The human villains were not included or the romance and other subplots. It was a multi starrer movie. Lots of big names played only a small role and magnified the expectation for the movie. But like I said expecting awesomeness will lead you to a great disappointment. One must approach this movie with a clear mind for a good result, because I felt the film very honest, and being honest is always a bit boring.

The film was emotionally very strong. No character developments, not individually, but the entire film was focused on one particular expedition taken by a couple of trekking teams that goes wrong after they got hit by a storm. This is Jason Clarke's one of the best films in a lead role, as well as for the director of 'Contraband'. I definitely regret missing it out in digital 3D. It is a good watch, absolutely refreshing from the mainstream commercial films.

This is a fantasy and a black comedy from Belgium that was chosen to represent the country in the last Oscars. This is where the critics overtake the film fanatic to like it more. It is a theme that revolves on what would you do if you get a power to write the laws of the nature. A complicated topic, because loopholes are inevitable, but the writer and director did not care much about that and narrated the tale what they just wanted to tell.

The story centres on an arrogant and abusive father who is also the creator the universe, especially the designer of the lives on the earth and this tale takes place in the Belgian capital, Brussels. When his bored and concerned daughter Ea, runs away from home to re-edit his creation as advised by her brother JC, he goes after her to ensure everything stay as he had planned. In an unexpected confrontation between father and daughter, in the end who is going to be victorious is the rest of the narration. Remember, there is a post credit scene, which opens the door for a possible sequel, but I don't think that'll happen.

> 
> ""Giving men knowledge of their own death... Crazy!""

It was a beautiful concept, but I don't think I liked the entire narration, though some of the parts were very interesting. Since it was a fantasy, logics are not required, but the lack of the basic explanation was the setback if you're a broad minded. This film is for the simple minds, especially after knowing the theme you should not anticipate a genuine tale with great adventure and stunts, particularly not visual extravaganza. It was kind of a drama-adventure, something like entering the world that created by you and experiencing all by yourself the positives and negatives of it.

Somewhat it was a fun, so definitely not a bad film, but I felt it should have been a lot more than that. Kind of a missed opportunity and falls into a simplicity. All the actors were good, especially the little girl. But I think it's not suitable for the children on the ground of a film character who is associated with sex related stuff, hence it got a few brief nudes.

The God character was awesome, even though his acts are predictable I enjoyed the comedies delivered by him. The Ea's undertaking was more a serious and which tries to relate with the Chritianity, especially 'The Last Supper' after her decision to help a few selected people down in the earth over billions. All the above it was barely a magical film, so that's where you've to compromise than to expect crazy stuffs out of it. So in my opinion, it was not delightful as it looks nor the best work of this talented director, but a decent 2 hour long film.

6/10 || Next time you are asked to name some famous Belgians, you can add God to the list. He (Benoît Poelvoorde) is a bit of a slob though and lives with his long-suffering wife (Yolanda Moreau) and daughter ""Ea"" (Pili Groyne). Their son ""JC"" has moved out and despite his mother's longings, they've lost touch. Now this deity loves nothing more than to cause misery to both mankind and his family, and this irks young ""Ea"" into doing something about it. She uses his computer to send a message to everyone on earth telling them how long they have left to live - in the hope that is will completely ruin her father's credibility. Not content with that, she decides to recruit half a dozen modern day apostles to change his philosophy a little. To that end she climbs into their washing machine (that's their physical conduit to earth) and sets about recruiting her new friends. Her encounter with the vagrant ""Victor"" (Marco Lorenzini) makes for a good start as she encounters the whole gamut of society from rich to poor, happy and healthy to anything but, and it turns out that she has quite a decent amount of her own humanity to dispense as the comedy gathers pace and delivers really quiet well. It is satire at it's irreverent best offering a personification of God that could hardly be more different from that put forward by the church, and the surreal nature of some of the characterisations is really quite funny. A glowing fish that just wants to return to the sea; Catherine Deneuve finds new love in a seriously unlikely place; there's some walking on water and when her dad comes after her, well there are some frustrations for him too as he realises that he has no superpowers down amongst the great unwashed. Star of the film? Well that has to be ""Kevin"" (Gaspard Pauwels) whose message telling him he has 60-odd years left to go encourages him to do just about anything reckless and stupid fearlessly - boy is he in for a shock. Groyne delivers well here as does Thomas Gunzig's writing and whilst it's not exactly sacrilegious, it does ridicule nicely people's psychological dependency on the existence of and belief in an higher power. It's whimsical not spiritual."

A documentary film would show the real faces of those offenders to shame them. That's the reason I desperately wanted it to be a documentary, then I would have definitely given a maximum mark. There's no complaint about this movie, but adaptation means fakes acting, fake settings and awards goes to non real achievers. Anyway, this movie kind looked a semi documentary and liked the way it was made.

The movie exposed a very important scandal. If something is open for a debate in the US means, the rest of the world would follow the same route. That's where this theme was inspired by. It all begins with a group of journalists from the Boston Globe with their new editor instruct them to research on sexual abuse of children by priests. So their lead only gets bigger and puts them to recover more evidence in order to publish. How they come up with the story that shake up not only the nation, but the entire world is the remaining.

A collection of bunch fine performances. There's no lead actors in this. Everyone is in the supporting roles. Out of 6, it got nominated both male and female in the category of supporting role for the Academy Awards. I am very disappointed, Mark Ruffalo's performance in 'Infinitely Polar Bear' deserved another nominee. Anyway, this 15 year old story still looks a hot topic. It was a great comeback for the director after critics assaulted him with their words for his previous film 'The Cobbler' only to show their rage on Sandler. It is a must-must see. Beware, is is not your weekend entertainer, but based on the real.

8/10 || Spotlight story is interesting and has a good cast which performs very well, but the feeling of the story is flat.

First, they are talking about abuses to children but you feel almost the whole time that they are following the lead of any other story almost as bureaucrats. There is not much of sensitivity put into the matter.

Second, they are exposing a huge case of system ""missbehavior"" (to say the least) in the Catholic Church hierarchy and you see how the whole city of Boston is treating this institution with great care. Then, this movie is about showing to the world how the exposition was done and the treatment to the Catholic Church is almost as exquisite as the one that has enabled this institution to hide all this cases.

For gods sake! These people are criminals covering the crimes of even bigger criminals and it seems like we still cannot face them and tell them clearly and to their faces the horrible things they have tolerated and hidden. || This was a very shocking and well made film. It is about the scandal involving a cover-up of Catholic priests molesting children in the Boston area. I was surprised with the delicate nature of the film's script and how well it was handled. It had a very solid ensemble cast which helped make the film moving and horrific in parts.

I am glad that a film like this won Best Picture at the Academy Awards as it had a very important message (even if I was rooting for 'The Revenant').

245698.0,Pawn Sacrifice,American chess champion Bobby Fischer prepares for a legendary match-up against Russian Boris Spassky.,On the board he fought the Cold War.

I know Bobby Fischer a genius American chess player, in fact, after watching the 'Searching for Bobby Fischer', which is another biopic as this one. Other than that I know nothing about his life, so I'm very thankful for this film. From the director of many sensational flicks comes this to inspire you. Wait, did I say inspire, but I'm little confused over how this film to be considered. Bobby Fischer was a great player, but he had some mental issues. So you can compare him to John Nash from 'A Beautiful Mind', except they're from different fields, but very intelligents.

This film was a little patriotic abut the American nation, especially defeating the Russians in the chess game. So I'm being neutral here. Bobby was the one to focus how he makes his life big with the game that requires a brain. The story began with short span of childhood and then soon skipped to adult Bobby Fischer competing in a biggest tournament in the world, a championship against the best. Nicely filmed with lots of exciting scenes, particularly Tobey Maguire as the main lead was brilliant. Liev Schreiber was another surprise with his frequent on and off role.

Good film, but feels it is not complete, there should have more to it and like I said earlier, it has impacted, but not inspiring way which is why I'm doubting the screenplay. A man like him and a film about him should have nominated for several international awards, including the Golden Globe and the Oscars. Sadly, it failed at the box office, as well as to get recognised at the film festival circuits. Still, it got praised, looks not for the artistic work, but as the compensation. If you watch it, you will know there's something wrong, otherwise a film like this won't go unnoticed. I hope someone else makes another film about him in a grand way. Meanwhile, it is a good watch, but what do you expect from the Bobby Fischer like his game or personal issues will decide how much you liked it.

_7/10_ || This could have been a fascinating account of the troubled life of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer - unfortunately, Tobey Maguire just couldn't quite convince me that he was that man! The well documented life of this chess genius and of his many demons is the stuff of public record, but this interpretation borders on the melodramatic just a bit too often, and the lead performance is way too one-dimensional for me to get beyond the initial reaction that he was a bit of an arse. An hugely accomplished master of his craft, but as an human being - an arse. There are flashbacks to try and give us some guidance as to the causes of his paranoia. His mother was a communist living in the USA so he genuinely believed that the FBI were listening in on him from a very early age - a neurosis that never left him - and as such his sense of trust was internally compromised and his ability to form meaningful relationships never remotely developed. Liev Schreiber - who really only features towards the very end, does indicate a bit of the grace and professionalism of arch-rival Boris Spassky but that is delivered by Edward Zwick in an almost grudging fashion: the pesky Ruskies will do just about anything to win - except, that is, play fair! It does demonstrate the effectiveness of the cold war chess battle that many of us will recall from the 1970s, but it could have been much more adventurous and less stereotypical with it's characters."

The entire story was told from the Henry's perspective, I mean what he sees through his eyes are the visuals we get. The first person point of view. Like the video games, but you won't play, just sit back and watch it. So you won't see the Henry's face, because he's you and you won't utter a word. That character was actually performed by many stuntmen and their risky stunt sequences pay off so well. That means, the main character is the cinematographer of the film. So all the credit must go to them for doing multiple task at a same time.

It is a one day event based narration. All about running and chasing, right from the beginning. Along the way it lets us know why it's taking place and who's behind it. The rest of the cast was too amazing, especially that South African actor of 'District 9' fame was simply brilliant with different getups. I also enjoyed the Russian locations which were something refreshing.

The story was simple, but puzzled. They explained nearly everything, yet a few doubts remain with us. So I'm expecting a follow-up, more than that I want it to be a trilogy and nothing less. For the sequel, put us in the cinema hall, but give us Virtual Reality Headset, I think that's how the future of cinema should be, especially for this film.

Very unique and craziest film, one of the best of this year. It was kind of similar to Statham's 'Crank', as well as good as that one. If you like action films, then surely you would love it. Especially if you're a gamer, then it will be a double treat. The Americans did not show interest in this like usual which is not Hollywood or British. Especially critics never appreciated the creativity, but this is a must see film and the rest of the world accepted the truth. So don't think of skipping it.

8.5/10 || ""_Chronicle_"" meets ""_Shoot 'Em Up_"".

Like _John Wick_, I knew I was going to see this movie when they had a Payday 2 tie-in. But truth be told I was already clued onto it before hand, and it had my interest piqued, because it looked like something new. Which we don't get a whole lot of these days.

I went in to _Hardcore Henry_ pretty blind, because the trailers give yo very little information. And that was a good way to watch it. All you need to know going forward is that it's bloody, and it's entirely shot from the first person perspective. If those are both things you can handle, then I can't recommend Hardcore Henry strongly enough.

I can understand how these things would turn some people off, and I'm not going to sit here and tell you _Hardcore Henry_ should take home the Oscar for Best Picture, but as en exercise in catharsis it is brilliant, and as a self-aware black comedy, it's even better. There were genuinely more times in this movie that I was out-loud laughing then any other movie I've watched this year. Likewise for the person who saw it with me.

Not for the faint of heart, but definitely worth it for someone with similar sensibilities to me.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || Fantastic watch, will watch again, and highly recommend.

This is one of the most unique and interesting sci-fi action movies I've ever seen.  Doing the entire movie from first person perspective is an amazing feat all on its own.  If you watch carefully, then the cuts are really subtle if they even exist in places where you would expect them to be.  There are a few points of lost consciousness, but those are the more obvious ones.

Because it is a ""First Person"" movie, Andrei Dementiev literally carries the movie through the camera, but Sharlto Copley (""District 9"") is the repeating character that helps drive most of the movie, so he would be the traditional carrier, as opposed to the mute camera.  Danila Kozlovsky and Haley Bennett give great supporting roles as well.

The problem with the main character being ""super powered"" is that they need drawbacks to balance their benefits so they can ""power creep"" to match / exceed the villain by the end of the movie, and this follows that formula really nicely and in unexpected manners, unless you've seen ""Crank 2: High Voltage"".

It definitely makes it immersive and enjoyable, and there is even a very well written plot happening."

Movies about foods and chefs are quite popular since the beginning of the cinema. Not only among the food lovers, but the movie fans, critics as well common people decides to book a table at a nearby best restaurant after watching a delicious film like this. At least one movie in every year makes us to talk about the foods for that entire week. Like the Jon Favreau's last year's 'Chef', this is 2015's.

On this theme, movies are always quite similar, except subplots like family, friends and sometimes foods from the different part of the earth as well. This film was not that brilliant when it comes to innovation in the story. The same old chef who comes back strongly after losing everything to get a another star. So what makes this special is that the actors, everyone was awesome. Even in smaller parts, especially the lead one Bradley Cooper makes all the difference.

There was a twist, but it does not make us say wow. Definitely it was a bit fun, filled with some dark humours. The slow, dull storytelling was almost like a soulless product, but anyway, kind of it worked well due to the style of film setting that created to narrate it. Feels like in the many scenes, characters were intensely dragged in like the cameos, otherwise it would have been very plain. Overall, it's not a best food/chef movie I've ever seen, but very much watchable and enjoyable.

7/10 || **Overall : Too many moments left a bad taste in my mouth to enjoy Burnt as much as I wanted to.**

The beginning of Burnt reminds me of the beginning of a heist movie. Bradley Cooper assembles a team made up of the best of the best to achieve the ever elusive 3 Michelin Star restaurant. The early scenes' energy and promise filled me with excitement, but unfortunately, the sheer arrogance and unlikeability of Cooper's Adam Jones drained the film of most of its charm and ability to enjoy it fully. I didn't find myself wanting Adam Jones to prevail. Thankfully, there is some character growth and development, but the road to get there was much more unpleasant for the audience than necessary."

Loren's first day on the job is about to start and she is to watch over the police station that is all but closed; emergency calls are being routed to another station. Entering the station she is greeted by the oddly acting Sgt. Cohen (Hank Stone LEGION OF THE DEAD). The Sarge takes her on a tour of the station, there are no prisoners, no staff, no other officers, gives her his phone number in case of an emergency, tells her not to leave her post and heads home.

The set up is familiar to anyone who has seen John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (and you have seen it, right?). but LAST SHIFT doesn't deal with a gang attack on the station, it goes in a very different direction. This is the station where Loren's police officer father was killed when the members of a Manson like cult were arrested and brought in to be interrogated. Those past tragic events haunt Loren and all sorts of spooky  and bewildering incidents drive her to panic. Furniture re-arranges itself, a silent homeless man somehow finds access into the locked building, an emergency call comes in from a young woman who needs help to escape from her kidnappers, and Loren has visions of the long dead King of Hell cult members.

Is the station haunted? Or is this an elaborate hoax being played on the rookie? Or is she loosing her mind?

Co-writers Anthony DiBlasi and Scott Poiley, with DiBlasi directing, manage to take a simple scenario and one location and ratchet up the tension. It's not all that often the proverbial hairs on the back of my neck stand up while watching a film. Lead Juliana Harkavy creates a character that is tough yet vulnerable and believable. It certainly adds to the fear factor of a film when we sympathize with and care about the main character.

The ending is a bit of a let down. The script and direction are smart and deft at treading the conventions of a horror film, so much so that I was expecting something other than the predictable 'twist' we have. But up until that point it is a spooky ride."

Frankly, I was not thinking of writing a review for this. You know, some animated movies come and go unnoticed, so I believed it would be one of those. In fact, I did not like the first film much, that is the reason to watch it so delayedly and with a minimum expectation. Better late than never, well, I regret for viewing it so late. One of the best animation of 2015, maybe in the top 10 or 15.

Well, it was a one liner, like, the daughter wants to move to the human social world thinking that might do good for her son's future. But her father plan to stop her getting away from him and the hotel. So those attempts are the rest of the movie. I liked the movie very much because it was very funny, especially the lines were and its accent, Adam Sandler nailed it.

I have said millions of times that I don't know why Americans and critics hate Adam Sandler that much, I don't know about the rest of the world but I kind of like his films. The last few films like 'The Cobbler', 'Pixel', 'Men, Women & Children' and this one were so much better. It did not bring the old Sandler, but brought us a different and new Sandler on screen. He was definitely the main reason for this film's success.

Don't just a book by its cover, well, here the cover is the previous installment. The first part was not a must see IMPO, but this is especially for the animated movie fans.

I usually love the French animations, because unlike American, the stories, musics, characters that influences the thousands of year cultural history. Definitely not comparable to the Hollywood standards, but it had its own technical brilliance. All I wondered was why this film was in English language.

It deserves to be on the upcoming's big occasion (2016 February), if it is eligible for the American Academy Awards. From the director of 'Kung Fu Panda' original movie, which was partially based on the children's novel. The book adaptation is the stop-motion animation and the remaining story's the regular 3D animation.

Just remember the movies like 'What Dreams May Come' and 'The Lovely Bones', those magical worlds and breathtaking landscapes. Usually animations are associated with comedy genre, especially when a child character attached to it. This film was not even a comedy, more like those two titles I mentioned.

The screenplay wise it was a very 'Neverwas' type, except this one was an animation. But appropriate for people of all ages. The kids can realise the importance of their childhood and the older people can become kids again. The film compressed the gap and erected a bridge between the two hoods, the childhood and the adulthood.

> ""What is essential is invisible to the eye.""

I did not know what to expect from it, but I highly satisfied with the final product. The film characters had no names, but called, the Little Girl, Mother, Fox, Rose, Snake, King et cetera as what their role is and species. Barely there are only 3-4 characters where the story was focused. Obviously it had a villain, but very unusual existence time and in a crucial part of the story.

I don't remember how the 100 minutes went so fast like a ray of the light beam flashed away. The pace of narration was not a rushy, except the opening part. But once the old man character, the Aviator, voiced by Jeff Bridge was introduced, the movie turned into completely different and awesome. Yes, Jeff Bridge's voice was so good for the background narration.

This story is about an old man who refused to grow up mentally and believes the existence of the magical stars and planets. The whole neighborhood stayed away from him and his troubles, until a new girl arrives at the next door. The little girl befriends him and falls for all his stories discarding her daily routines, but later it complicates their relationship after her mother finds out what they're up to. What happens to them and how the story concludes is the remaining part.

> ""She was not a common rose.
> She was the only one of her kind in the whole universe.""

This story was finely fused between the reality and fantasy. Most essential storyline for the present world. In the name of education how the children were enforced by their parents to mechanical life with less time to play out and make their own friends. Especially as they were lacking the creativity to make up their own fictional worlds with their toys like the kids from a century ago were.

It might psychologically affect their characters while becoming an adult like the Aviator in this film, but as one of lines from the movie say 'Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is', the children are losing their innocence over the adult's reality world. Who knows, someday those kids may become the greatest writer inspired by their childhood days.

If you ask me, I strongly recommend it for all. It is very encouraging film for the parents how not to raise their children and for the grown ups how not to get lost is the adult world. Most elegant flick of the year, along with a very few others.

You don't have to ignore it because you have read the book, like I said it was not completely borrowed from the original material. Instead, two-third of the film was freshly established out of the same name masterpiece. I'm not familiar with the book, so I've no thoughts that differentiate between these two formats. But definitely the film deserved all the appreciation from critics and movie

It's a wonderful cast and not a bad production either, so I enjoyed the watch, but did not like the film much. The reason is I had seen a few similar flicks which are much better than this in every way. A school kid and his single parents' struggling relationship and their strange neighbour, so it is the concept I'm familiar with, but the story was a bit different. There are a few good scenes in it, but the most of the parts were dominated by the only the nice events like happily ever after kind of stuffs right from the beginning.

The title role was played by Mickey Rourke, but it was Nat Wolff's film. The narration should have been much better, I mean it should have had more complicated segments. I even don't know how it got the R rating. The writing and the direction, both should have been a bit bolder. There are some people who liked it a lot and defending it, but I'm neutral. To me it was 50-50, I neither liked nor disliked. But all I wanted was a bit better than this, so I can't judge it for other. I hope you make a right decision on this if you plan to watch it.

If I'm being completely honest, the two people I went to the cinema to watch _Wonder Woman_ with and I did spend the next two hours after coming out of our screening discussing the various problems with the movie, but we also all agreed on one thing: We still loved it.

Maybe it's just the rose-coloured glasses of comparison, but I had an excellent time with _Wonder Woman_, and I'm excited to go back to the cinema and watch it, at least one more time.

It's the first time I've said that about a DC movie since _The Dark Knight Rises_.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || **The First Great DCEU Film**

This film is the origin story of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), who was first introduced in Batman v. Superman last year. She is born and trained on Themyscira, the hidden island where the powerful warrior women known as the Amazons live. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an American World War I spy, crashes off the coast of Themyscira and is rescued by Diana and the two team up to take down Ares, the God of War, and the Germans, who are developing a very deadly form of mustard gas. There are fantastic action sequences in this film, especially by Gal Gadot. It's amazing to see her single-handedly storm the German front, inspiring the Allies to fight with her. Gadot takes over from the legendary Linda Carter and makes the role her own. She has great chemistry with Pine. They are complete equals in this film. It's refreshing to see the female lead in a superhero film not be the love interest. The only negative part of the film are the lackluster villains. Hopefully, Wonder Woman will have more formidable foes in future films. || **DC Hits A...Bunt. But compared to the strikeouts, a bunt seems impressive.**

Wonder Woman had some things working for it--things other comic book movies have faltered on. But it had a lot of things not working for it too. The result is an average median between what works and what doesn't. While the film is spectacular within the struggling DCEU, as a stand alone film it's mediocre at best. 

Diana's origin story--how she came to be and how she came to be a super hero was refreshing. It showcased the world of the Amazon warriors. It was unique in the often cookie-cutter super hero origin stories. Patty Jenkins did a good job of framing it, but I think the character's origin story dating back to the comics has always been unique in comparison to other super heroes.

The result is that the first third or so of the movie is satisfying--despite dull performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine (who had zero chemistry as a couple). But once we leave the confines of the island and enter the real world, the movie becomes hit or miss. WWI (that's right, WWI now, not WWII. The reason for the change in setting is never apparent) London is portrayed in a way that is almost a distraction. Yes, the world isn't white washed; diversity is a thing--a wonderful thing at that. But DC's version of Captain America's Howling Commandos consist of an Arab and an American Indian. Diversity for diversity's sake becomes distracting--especially when paired with a low-rent Simon Pegg whose soul function is being a deadly sniper who never fires his weapon (that's helpful on a top-secret mission behind enemy lines). 

It's almost as if the movie telegraphs all of these unnecessary plot hiccups to remind you that this is a super hero film, and no matter how much the mortal humans fail, it will all be okay because the super hero will save the day. 

The dialogue can be clichéd at times, and the final theme of the movie--one of love conquering all and the acknowledgement that, overall, mankind is good, is laughable in it's amateur preachiness. 

But what the film lacks in substance and script, it makes up for in the visuals. I found the action sequences to be great fun. Heavily stylized ""Matrix-style"" fight scenes seem right at home in a film about super hero Gods. The freeze frames worked too--as fight sequences froze in over-the-top super hero poses that harkened back to the source material's comic book roots.

The final confrontation between Wonder Woman and Ares--while dragging on a little long--was well done, being one of the few super hero movie climaxes that delivered. 

While aspects of the movie were so similar (Hell! Identical!) to Captain America: The First Avenger, I actually felt embarrassed for the filmmakers, I did come away thinking this was the movie Captain America should have been. It succeeded in places where Captain America failed miserably. 

The movie is entertainment--pure, fun, pop-corn-gobbling entertainment. In that realm, it succeeds and succeeds well. But as a piece of cinematic art, it falls flat on its face with too many plot holes, script inconsistencies, clichés and mediocre acting. Wonder Woman will be an important movie for both the DCEU and the summer of 2017. But it lacks the magic and staying power of Nolan and Donner's contributions to DC comics' films."

A book based film. Pretty much set in the present world scenario. The world where the internet, the social media is controlling people. If any revolution must take place, that's none other place than the virtual world. So a young woman who worked hard to get a job in a leading tech company, starts her life anew. At one end, aged and seriously ill parents, and the other end, making an unexpected leap in the workplace lead her to be a celebrity overnight. But it's only going to change her life forever, but how is to know, one must watch the film.

It was an Emma Watson's film. Tom Hanks was is an important role, but Watson led the show. Nice theme, but predictable storyline. I indeed guessed the end, which spoiled my watch. Slightly an awareness film too. Not all the technology can make life better, but sometimes opposite. Particularly, the film highlighted the privacy issue, how important it is for everyone. And at a same time, transparency too can bring a major change in society. But it all depends on the people and their professions. Surely not to be missed, despite you enjoy it or dislike it.

**6/10** || There are some shows that have a character for exposition. Velma in Scooby Doo comes to mind, and it is their job to summarize the plot points that the viewer has missed.

This is a movie filled with Velmas. Everyone gives a little exposition, everyone has a lecture. And no one seems real because of it. The characters, good or bad, all sound scripted and monotoned.

It hurts to watch it. || The Circle had a solid premise with relevant themes about privacy, surveillance, and corporate power, but it never fully delivered on its potential. The plot starts strong, setting up an intriguing world and characters, but the pacing feels off. It spends too much time in the setup and then rushes through key developments, making the shift into the main conflict feel unbalanced. The directing is straightforward but lacks tension, which makes scenes that should be gripping feel flat. Visually, the cinematography is clean and polished, reflecting the sleek, tech-driven setting, but it doesn’t do much beyond that to enhance the storytelling.

The acting is decent, with Emma Watson delivering a capable performance, though at times she feels a bit restrained. Tom Hanks is solid as always, but his character isn't given much depth. The script is where the movie really struggles. It introduces big ideas but never explores them in a meaningful way, instead leaning into melodrama without the payoff. The score is functional but forgettable, failing to add any real weight to the narrative. Overall, it’s a movie with a lot of potential that ends up feeling more like a missed opportunity than a thought-provoking thriller."

Released in late 2016 and directed by Martin Scorsese based on the novel by Shûsaku Endô, ""Silence"" chronicles events in 1640 when two Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield & Adam Driver) journey to Japan to check on the persecuted church and find out what happened to their mentor, whom it is rumored fell from the faith (Liam Neeson). Issei Ogata is on hand as the sadistic, but seemingly reasonable Japanese inquisitor.

The Jesuits were a society of Catholic missionaries started in 1540 in response to the spreading evangelism of the Protestant reformers. They were an essential part of the Roman counter-Reformation. With this in mind, the seeming Christianity portrayed in the movie is decidedly Catholic in nature, with the requisite unbiblical stuff, like confessions to priests, icons, rosary beads, etc.

In tone and theme, ""Silence"" is reminiscent of movies like the excellent ""Black Robe"" (1991), the solid ""The Mission"" (1986) and the surprisingly great ""Black Death"" (see my review). There are also elements of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). If you appreciate any of these films you might appreciate ""Silence,"" but it didn't work for me. Sure, Scorsese is a great auteur and so the filmmaking is top-of-the-line – the cinematography, the cast, the costuming, locations and score. Unfortunately, the story's not compelling and I never connected with the main character, despite Garfield's quality performance.

There's some worthy mindfood (or spiritfood) to glean from the proceedings, however, like: Why does God allow the excruciating persecution of His faithful? Why is He silent? IS He silent? Can a believer be restored after cowardly denying the Lord in the face of torture/death? Can a Christian hide their faith while living in a thoroughly hostile culture? But I didn't buy for a second that the Japanese couldn't conceive of a Deity that transcends physical nature, like the sun, sea or mountain. While the idea may have been alien to their communal mindset at the time, it's absurd to think that no individual man or woman could discern the obvious (see Psalm 19:1 & Romans 1:20).

Although I'm sorta glad I saw it, ""Silence"" is curiously dull and overlong; and so I never care to see it again. There are far superior movies that tackle similar topics. Those who give it the highest possible rating must be fanatical devotees of Scorsese.

The movie runs 161 minutes and was shot in Taiwan and the Cathedral Of Saint Paul In Macau, China.

The movie that should have been made 50 years ago, but due to the international political tension it did not take off. So now it's here, the same director made it. It's a rocking combo, once again Spielberg and Hanks come together, tell me who's going to miss that. Simply spellbinding, one of the best movie of the year.

I think this flick is for adults. There's no sex, no nudity, not even a single kiss or the bad language and zero violence, its fine for teens and kids can understand, but the story is what I meant that suits only for the grown ups. Like the usual, this Spielberg movie is easy to follow, there's no tricky twists and turns, but aimed for only the event that's based on the real.

Over a 2 hour long negotiation drama with surrounded by suspense and thrills. It's completely a one man show and the end has been just like everybody wanted. I'm not surprised that it is nominated for the Oscars in the 6 categories including the best motion picture. I would be very happy if it puts at least a couple of trophies to its basket. I feel it is a must see if you're interested in WWII related subjects, other than the war.

Several people coalesce in a region of Alaska called the Grizzly Maze where a rogue bear is on the loose: A local man recently released from prison (James Marsden), his ex-girlfriend (Michaela McManus), his estranged deputy brother (Thomas Jane), the deputy’s photographer wife (Piper Perabo), a half-crazy hunter (Billy Bob Thornton), a compromised sheriff (Scott Glenn) and an AmerIndian poacher (Adam Beach). 

“Into the Grizzly Maze” (2015) is a bear attack movie and, more generally, a wilderness adventure/thriller. When it comes to these types of films “The Edge” (1997) reigns supreme, as does the brooding “Hold the Dark” (2018), although the latter has no bear (actually “The Edge” is only partially a bear attack movie, as it goes much deeper than that, like “Hold the Dark”). While nowhere near as effective as “The Edge” and “Hold the Dark,” “Into the Grizzly Maze” is about on par with the Indie ""Backcountry"" (2014) in all-around entertainment; and it’s superior to the prosaic “Grizzly” (1976). 

Where “Into the Grizzly Maze” excels is the locations and awesome cinematography. This might be the best-looking forest flick ever made. The cast is exceptional too. In these areas it’s superior to all the above movies with the possible exception of “The Edge” where it’s at least on par. The conflict-habituated relationship of the brothers (Marsden and Jane) is amusing and it’s nice to see Piper Perabo again, who was about 38 during shooting and looking better than ever, top to bottom. Meanwhile McManus has a stunning face and mesmerizing eyes.  

The film runs 1 hour, 34 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, British Columbia, and Big Bear, California (the bar scene). 

GRADE: B/B- || Bare or Bear Puzzle?

Into the Grizzly Maze is directed by David Hackl and written by Guy Moshe and J.R. Reher. It stars James Marsden, Thomas Jane, Piper Perabo, Scott Glenn, Michaela McManus and Billy Bob Thornton. Music is by Marcus Trumpp and cinematography by James Liston.

Estranged brothers Rowan (Marsden) and Beckett (Jane) reunite out in the Alaskan wild. They set out into the wilderness to see if they can humanely trap the ferocious grizzly bear that has been savaging the locals.  

Unfortunately in the pantheon of movies featuring Mother Nature's angry beasts stalking humans, this one is very average. Which considering the cast list is not only something of a shame, it's also surprising. The stock roll call of characters with various hang-ups, disabilities or troubled back stories, stumble through the wilderness being menaced by the awesome Red Machine (Bart the Bear the best thing in the pic). Sadly director Hackl doesn't have an eye or ear for a good fright, while his blood letting exercises quickly wear thin come the later stages of the piece.

Things aren't helped by the flatness of the digital shooting, which only emphasises the poor CGI segments. On the plus side the enviromental messages hold tight, even if the family traumas threaten to avert the points. The location photography - with Vancouver standing in for Alaska - is pleasing in making the scenery a prominent feature, while the finale is good on action entertainment terms, even if the resolution is a touch hokey.

Ultimately this just isn't suspenseful or riveting on either the ""when animals attack"" basis or the fractured character dynamics. 5/10 || **Forgettable. Honestly, I even had a hard time not forgetting this film twenty-four hours after seeing it.**

Lately, I've seen at least two films in which ferocious wild animals end up becoming the biggest threat to a small group of humans who, innocently or without any ill intention, cross their path. This was one of those films. It brings nothing new or original to a subgenre of horror that, with the growing awareness and awareness of the protection of fauna and natural spaces, tends to become less and less interesting for the public.

One of the film's strengths is the technical aspects, in particular the cinematography, which makes the best of Alaska's magnificent natural landscapes. It is not possible to watch this film without feeling a great desire to put on a pair of sturdy boots and go experience that intimate contact with nature, in its most untouched state. Even the less adventurous will be impressed by the beauty of the locations and landscapes in which the film is set. The fact that much of the action takes place at night or on cloudy days helps to model the tension necessary to make the film work, and there are actually several moments in which the forest seems mysterious, threatening. This is one of the attributes that makes horror films work so well in the forests. The film also features a discreet but effective set of visual and sound effects, which transform each confrontation with the bear into a true spectacle, full of credibility and danger.

The cast is mixed: we have some solid actors, but also many others who add little or nothing to the quality of the final product. James Marsden and Thomas Jane lack a director to guide and help them reach their full potential, resulting in a poor and forgettable effort that neither ennobles nor harms them. Billy Bob Thornton is a good addition, but he is given frankly disappointing material and has nothing more to do than look obnoxious. Scott Glen has even more reasons to complain, since he barely appears on the scene and, when he does, he is so subdued that he has no relevance whatsoever. As for the actresses, they are damsels in permanent distress that the “knights” will save. Young Kelly Curran must feel embarrassed by this film, where the only thing she did was show her breasts in an unfortunate scene without any kind of convincing “sex appeal”.

Still, things can become worse if we add an inept director, called David Hackl, and a poor script, with a story that throws the characters into danger without much explanation. The fight between the two brothers is very poorly explained and unconvincing, the return of the prodigal brother was not convincing, the whole bar story was an obvious pretext to introduce the police brother and the contrast between the two – a cheap cliché of films with brothers – and the attack on the lumberjacks, the first attack by that bear, is reduced to the size of a footnote when it should have had more impact among the public. What happens next is a cascade of clichés and ideas common in films of this type, with the characters trying to survive and the inevitable confrontation with the threat."

Doyle is hopelessly out of his element, hobbling about in his new suit–the switch was the studio’s idea in an effort to broaden Doyle’s appeal, much to Laurentz’s dismay. It’s not long before the two engage in a back-and-forth, Laurentz trying to get Doyle to pronounce “Would that it ‘twere so simple”, and Doyle trying desperately to appease Laurentz. After a lengthy exchange, both are left exacerbated. Much later in the film, we catch a glimpse of the final version, where Doyle and Laurentz compromise with a much simpler: “It’s…complicated.”

Complicated is exactly what’s at the heart of this situation. Laurentz’s increasing frustration with this obvious miscast and Doyle’s confusion may serve to fuel the slapstick comedy on exhibit, yet this scene alludes to so much more. It’s the inner mechanics of Hollywood, where directors are mere technicians and actors are props, all to be assigned and managed. It’s the clashing of proud classical Hollywood traditions of entertainment and escapism with the dreaded rise of message films and sophisticated art. It’s the contradictory nature of unfettered creativity with capitalism and consumerism, where compromise–and perhaps communism–seems to be the only way out.

This is just one slice of the screwball nature that is the Coen Brothers’ latest comedy, Hail, Caesar! There’s also a kidnapped Roman soldier, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney at his dimmest and greatest), a handsome sailor (Channing Tatum) and a beautiful mermaid (Scarlett Johansson). All opportunities–that the Coens gladly take–to simultaneously demonstrate the power and influence of cinema, while mocking its sense of self-importance.

Each scene is allowed to play out, Channing Tatum and his homoerotic musical number or Scarlett Johansson’s hypnotizing aquatic acrobatics. It’s not only an homage films of the Golden Era, but a demonstration of the mechanics that make film such an appealing medium. The Coen Brothers have a firm grasp on the allure behind each piece, using the acting, staging and costumes to propel Hail, Caesar! forward. It’s a simple concept–use filmmaking techniques to advance a theme and narrative, but by prioritizing these lengthy sequences over traditional narrative pacing or dialogue, the Coen Brothers give room for these fundamental concepts to breathe and thrive.

It’s all threaded together through Josh Brolin’s character, Eddie Mannix, studio fixer. And there’s a lot that needs fixing: a pregnant star, a discontent director, communism, threat from the future–the usual. It’s a packed schedule, and the film follows suit with a similarly hectic pacing. An array of symbols, innuendos and subversions are thrown at the viewer: Capital Studios butting with Das Kapital, Mannix being offered a role at Lockheed where they tout a more stable industry– weapon-making, or Whitlock staring at the audience as he addresses God. It borders on bombastic, but there’s just too much wit, and heart, here to discredit any of the ideas presented–fleshed out or not.

Hail, Caesar! doesn’t break new ground in the increasingly crowded sub-genre of Hollywood-on-Hollywood, but it hits a Goldilocks concoction between inside baseball cynicism and endearing love letter. Though all these antics, the Coen Brothers argue, quite convincingly, that everything in film matters, while also making a case for the futility and hollowness of anything produced on the grounds of Hollywood. So is this a nihilistic shrug at our attempt at defining and contextualizing or a fierce exhibition of the inherent power of Hollywood where life imitates art? Well, as Doyle would try to tell you, “Would that it ‘twere so simple.” || I am a fan of the Cohen Brothers, but I will not lay laurels at the feet of a movie simply because it bears their name. _Hail, Caesar!_ is not one of their better efforts.

Unrelated: I also wonder why they felt it necessary to hide the fact that they were making a faith-based film in the trailers.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || **Once upon a time the king Julius Caesar was kidnapped!**

So here's the new film from the Coen brothers. They have become rare in the recent years, I was always checking out what's next for them and now I'm slightly disappointed with this. I enjoyed watching it, it is one of those you want to rate them better, but you can't for some unidentified reasons. According to my analysis why I was not satisfied fully is the story. I mean the narration was rich, performances were phenomenal and music, locations, all were fantastic, but the screenplay was kind of aimless. The beginning, the ending or even in the mid part it had no purpose, but something like a mockumentary about the film industry of the 1950s.

With the average screenplay, the directors have shown their magic. Very cool presentation, you would enjoy it if you're theirs films fan. But I don't think all his fans would be pleased enough. This is truly a multi-starrer film, everybody was at their best in their retro characters. If you share your experience with others who also saw it, they might ask who do you liked the most. Probably many would favour Josh Brolin, because he had more priority than others who comes under his belt. But George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich also have given a good show followed by Scarlett Johansso and Tilda Swinton. The remaining ones as well not bad, but Jonah Hill was completely a waste.

Since it is about the film industry and its people, brace yourself for some good laughs. There is variety in it like different genre/theme and multiple layers in the narration. Like from moving to the western to the historical subject and then to the musical and many more. It did good at the box office against its budget, only because of the star power it has and the filmmaker's reputation came in handy. Though I hope the Coen brothers would come back strong with another product and it does not take another 3 years. It is not an award winning film, just a good entertainer, but praisable quality.

I enjoyed the director's previous works like 'Combat Girls' and 'Wetlands'. Those were young women oriented subjects, yet filled with sensitive topics. But now he turned his focus towards the screen adaptation of a bestselling satirical novel of the same name about Adolf Hitler. Well, this is not his best work, not a bad movie either.

Quite fun to watch, but not logical, especially the basic ones. Since it mocks a most hated person in the human history, there's no issues on portraying him in whatever angle they wanted, because nobody cares. Yet the film talked some serious current issues of Germany.

This is like when 'Borat' meets 'The Dictator'. A man who wanders around a city looking for some answers. That's none other than Adolf Hitler, who wakes up in the middle of where some young kids showing their football skills for a tv programme. Then he embarks to learn where he's and what year it is. Meets a person who helps him and ultimately end up with some tv guy where they begin their journey throughout the nation making videos before landing in an actual tv show. The man who killed millions of people wants the best for Germany and its people, how he turn things around were narrated in a quite interesting perspective.

The initial narratives were like the aimless, that tells us what people think of the Adolf Hitler's return. Looked like most of them were shot like a documentary style, outside the official shooting spots. You can see lots of real people's faces were censored. We know that he wanted to be an artist, but he draws some funny sketches in this. Likewise there are many scenes about his qualities that were dragged in to make fun out of it.

Can people accept the words of one who is considered a villain. He came from a different timeline, but he quickly absorbs the situation and gives some important tips that should come into force. From the common people's perspective, it is an entertaining product, but from the political viewpoint, there are stuffs to consider severely about.

> ""When you have rats at home, it is called not a clown but an exterminator.""

To me there's nothing controversial about this theme. When he failed, the final pages of his history book were written by his enemies. Otherwise, there's no difference between him, Alexander and Genghis Khan. Every greatest kings who ever lived on the earth dreamed of conquering the world.

I think the present world is same, except the form of conquering is changed, like some want to rule the world with their strong economy like the US and some are on their cheap industrial products like China. Like that all the other nations are on the top of the chart with something in what they're good at.

Adolf Hitler was a politician, not a king, but he had his reasons for his actions. So if we go by the rule books, nothing seems rational. To me this film was a decent entertainer, I just wanted to enjoy what it offers and I think I did. I advise the same that you should not mix up this with the reality. Because that might take us to the unwanted territory.

He's the same person who came from the past, but I was keen to know his intentions, especially what the writer intended to draw out of him. Because he's alone, not with his army, so he had no power, but his interaction with people brings up some discussable topics. I'm not a German, but it made me think when he spoke about current issues that Germany is facing. Every nation has to think about its internal affairs to improve it, you can't live forever with the past shame.

This film might be a comedy, but you can't ignore some of the points the main character talks. I felt the movie was a double strike where people can have some laughs and in other side to learn the reality of the state. This the best satirical film about Adolf Hitler I've seen after the Charles Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'.

The goofy-minded family-friendly frightfest does have the ingredients to muster up some interest for the little goblins out there looking for hearty rounds of boos and bumps. The question remains: does Goosebumps have the mindless macabre-related mayhem to sell its scatterbrained scary tactics to the trick-or-treat tykes looking for off-the-cuff jitters on the big screen?

Director Rob Letterman has armed the frivolous Goosebumps with aimless zaniness anchored on the nutty shoulders of the film’s leading kinetic kook Jack Black. Unfortunately, the loose presentation of combined live action and animation imagery put forth in Goosebumps seemed rather strained and misplaced. Sure, it is noted that Goosebumps reinforce a wackiness rooted in nonsensical hilarity…something considered safe and suitable for the kiddie crowd.  Nevertheless, Letterman’s breezy kiddie creepy caper–even with the free-spirited Jack Black at the helm–registers with a lameness that would have some demanding youths rolling their eyes  for something more hip and edgy.

Goosebumps is from the imaginative mind of R.L. Stine who has authored the vastly popular children book series while selling millions of copies worldwide. Stine’s aforementioned Goosebumps book collection for young adults (YA) have led to a successful Saturday morning cartoon series as well. Now Sony Pictures Entertainment wants to capitalize on the craze and tap into the youngsters’ consciousness with outlandish Pied Piper Jack Black heading up the charge in this toothless tale of juvenile high jinks.

One would think that Goosebumps could up the ante a bit with the backers involved such as screenwriter Darren Lemke (“Jack the Giant Slayer”) from a story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Both Letterman and Black collaborated on the dud Gulliver’s Travels thus corrupting the Jonathan Swift literary masterpiece with their big screen bomb. Black, who stole the show with his mini-sized co-stars in School of Rock, would be an ideal choice to appear in another children-themed entry mired in outrageous fortune. Unfortunately, Goosebumps merely chalks up its sketchy existence in being a jumbled ball of flimsy foolishness while never really connecting solidly with a cohesive story that brings the frenzied proceedings together. Besides, what could Goosebumps the movie offer in freshness that the countless Stine books and animated program had not touched upon before in its adventurous skin? The answer: not very much.

For teenager Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette, “Prisoners”) the transition in moving to the bedroom community of Madison, Delaware from the hustle and bustle of New York is quite a letdown. Zach’s recently widowed mother Gale (Amy Ryan) relocates for a new job offer and Zach has no choice but to accept his new less-than-stimulating surroundings. However, the one discovery that is about to make Zach a little more accepting of his new home is the pretty neighboring Hannah (Odeya Rush). The main obstacle that stands in the way of getting to know Hannah, sadly, is her over-protective father in stand-offish writer R.L. Stine (Black). The flustered Stine has some major issues with the creativity process when conceiving his characterizations.

Soon Zach would have to join forces with the Stines and nerdy best buddy Champ (Ryan Lee,”Super 8″) when he accidentally unleashes R.L.’s monstrous creations onto the small unsuspecting town (it turns out that Stine’s fictitious beastly book protagonists are in fact real menaces come to life). Can Zach and company save the day as these bothersome pests roam the unprotected streets at will? Will Zach earn extra brownie points in winning Hannah’s heart as well as her reclusive father’s approval?

It is a mixed bag reception for the scattershot Goosebumps. On one hand many of the ardent followers of Stine’s written work will recognize the inclusion of some familiar notable villainous visitors that feature The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena, Revenge of the Gnomes and Werewolf of Fever Swamp (let’s not forget Slappy the evil ventriloquist too). Plus, some would consider it a bonus in having Black’s unflappable voice-over work earmarked for some of the standby monsters wreaking havoc in random fashion. The CGI special effects register with some semblance of awestruck momentum. Still, the manic moments piggyback one another and the cheap giggles, sight gags and punchy predicaments feel needlessly forced.

Strangely, Black seems somewhat restrained as Robert Lawrence Stine. In fact, Jillian Bell’s off-the-wall Aunt Lorraine is more of an energetic comical force than the usually high-strung Black. Both Minnette’s Zach and Rush’s Hannah are somewhat serviceable as the Romeo-and-Juliet tandem but they could have played up their on-screen chemistry more charmingly than what was presented by them in inexplicable blandness. As for the supporting adult players they arbitrarily pop in and out without a chance to fully realize their contributions in this flimsy farce geared at the indiscriminate pee wees.

Perhaps the tots will get a decent rise out of the jolly emptiness that is Goosebumps. As for the rest of us we will probably get a better result in sucking on last year’s recycled stale Halloween candy.

Directed by: Rob Letterman

MPAA Rating: PG

Genre: Children’s Horror and Fantasy

Critic’s Rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars) || > Not a unique concept, but the rest were completely surprised me.

Technically, this was a another version of 'Jumanji', but a different universe. Originally it was not meant to be like that, because it was adapted from a series of children's book of the same name into a single movie. All the characters from the different books (book series) brought into one place, thus 'Jumanji' effect.

When the fictional book characters come into the life, a group of youngsters team up to save the town from invasion. A tale that takes place in one day, especially most of the narration was a one night adventure. Totally an unexpected movie, but still not a masterpiece than just entertaining product. Maybe the actors were the reason, especially inclusion of Jack Black was the turn out. His second collaboration with the director after 'Gulliver's Travels'. And not to forget the CGI work was very acceptable for a little production like this.

This theme was a very old, but the characters were unique. Maybe it was a box office lucky, but people won't simply acknowledge for useless things. This film's success was the effort of hard work. I won't surprise if they decide to make a sequel. I meant the same team, not the lower grade filmmakers and actors.

6½/10 || She's locked in this house and her dad's a psychopath.
I have to say that being British born and bred I'm not at all familiar with Goosebumps, either the books or TV series etc, so I was going into this film blind as it were. With that in mind I'm not really able to review to fans of the original works.

I went in with the hope of a good time, I liked the sound of the concept, I like Jack Black and I knew it was going to be well produced and no doubt heavily laden with the latest technological effects (ironically I had watched the splendid Jason and the Argonauts prior to Goosebumps, from one extreme to another or what?!).

I got everything I expected and had fun without any frame of reference. If I wanted any more I could dig out some questions that would need to be answered, but why bother. I left at the end, as a middle aged film lover, contented. I would for sure keenly watch any sequel if it surfaces.

Didn't do much for my Automatonophobia though... 6.5/10"

A much better film than I expected. There's everything in it, all the popular folklore characters in one screen. In addition to that the aliens have also made into it, totally something new. Do think only Marvels bring all its superheroes in one place, see this some B movie did it as well. Since you know where this film belongs, I mean like a second string film, you should expect to a same level in order to enjoy it.

First, the writer and director did a good job, followed by the actors. There were three main characters and they were distinct from each other. The supporting cast as well, so good, many decently known names were in that. The story as well had some good twists, since so many concepts was merged, predicting the scenes were kind of impossible. Anytime anything might happen, but overall it was a very well done film. So an enjoyable film with a few laughs.

It is the best year so for if you like B movies, Recent films like 'Cooties', 'Scouts Guide...' and a few others, you won't get a treat like this every year. They all are not top notch, but very entertaining, even if you rate them average. So what I'm saying is, this film is not those big production house's big projects, but it delivered to its capacity and you must keep that in your mind while watching it. I can't suggest it, but I hope you watch it.

Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins and Lili Simmons. Music is by Zahler and Jeff Herriott and cinematography by Benji Bakshi.

Ah, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub-genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! This is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. A society perhaps like the Troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.

Plot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the Troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...

How splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. Bone Tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. However, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? Surely not?. 

So the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. Be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here. And thus comes the horror, characters have been well formed, we know them and are interested in what will happen to them. Like or dislike is irrelevant, we bloody know them, so as the film hits its raging ""B"" movie straps, shouting at the screen or wincing in harmony becomes a requisite. As is squirming...

Intricately paced, beautifully photographed and splendidly performed by a top cast who aren't interested in top billing or walk of fame recognition, Bone Tomahawk is a grade ""A"" culter. Zahler could be someone to keep an eye on. 9/10 || > Meet the most savage people of the American native.

This was one of the three western films I've watched back to back recently. The other two were 'The Salvation' and 'The Homesman'. They all were totally different from each other and I enjoyed them a lot. I did not know what this title means, but I learnt it before going for it which means some kind of axe used by the American Indians. So I have waited for that moment to know why the film's called that and then, omg, I was very shocked, totally uncomfortable to watch that part. I felt like it was a western version of 'The Hills Have Eyes'.

This was a road movie. A group of peoples' journey to rescue those who were abducted by some mountain tribes. The rescue was the third act and the rest of the film was about how they make into that remote place. Obviously a slow pace, makes you sit whatever position you want, but after the 90 minutes you will be more focused than before as the narration gets tense. The best part of the film in any western the audience were looking for finally arrives. It was a simple, but very strong and disturbing.

The cast was the plus point, everyone did their part best. Even the music and the locations were very nice and appropriate. One of the rare western films I've seen, with a mix of horror-terror. This is the cheapest film and shot within a month of time, but a fine production and completely unexpected film. Possible for a sequel, but I think that's not a good idea unless it retains the same crew. If you're okay with a slow narration, then you will enjoy it. Compared to the opening, when it ends, you will feel satisfied. It is not a greatest western of all time, but still worth a watch.

7/10 || _**Slow-burn Indie Western with a quality cast builds to a potent climax**_

In the 1890s, four men in the Southwest -- a sheriff (Kurt Russell), his aged deputy (Richard Jenkins), a gunslinger (Matthew Fox) and a wounded cowboy foreman (Patrick Wilson) -- set out to bring back captives kidnapped by a mysterious nameless tribe that lives several days ride away. Lili Simmons plays the cattleman’s wife while David Arquette plays a trashy outlaw. Sid Haig has a small role in the opening.

“Bone Tomahawk” (2015) has a surprisingly good cast for an Indie Western that only cost $1.8 million and shot in 21 days. It was the first film written/directed by S. Craig Zahler and reveals a master filmmaker in that he was able to make a quality movie on such a low-budget. The film has the confidence to take its time with interesting characters and entertaining mundane dialogues, which is reminiscent of Tarantino. There are flashes of violence, but this is a slow-burn Western that builds to a rewarding climax.

It’s a unique Western that meshes the Tarantino-style with realistically mundane Westerns like “The Homesman” (2014) and horrific gritty Indies like “Cry Blood, Apache” (1970). It’s superior to the latter two, especially “Cry Blood,” but it’s not quite in the ballpark of Tarantino due to lack of funds. Yet it ain’t far off either. 

The movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California.

A stylish Aussie revenge-comedy that is adapted from a novel of the same name. Just superbly built screenplay on a tragedy that occurred some time back, but the movie reveals it only in the third act. About a woman who arrives in a small town where she was born and slowly gains popularity among the young women who seeks her stunning costumes to impress their counterparts. The town divides over her return, but why all the hate is the mystery that the movie going to solve for us in its entire narration.

The location and the settings were fantastic and it brought a western feel because of the Australians hot and humid weather. Kate Winslate was very good, her role simply reminded me Juliette Binoche from 'Chocolat'. I have heard people saying it was emotional, but I did not find it like that. Instead, I had fun watching it, not like I had the open laughs, but felt joy and satisfaction for the time I spent for it. My initial thought was it could be overrated, but after watching it proved I was wrong. This is one of the best Aussie movie I have seen in the recent years.

8/10 || Utterly superb! I wasn't expecting such greatness.

<em>'The Dressmaker'</em>, to put it bluntly, is quality! It has a pulse and then some, I love the feel of the film throughout - with all its quirkiness, silliness and straight up brilliantness. It all starts off very strongly, though I did then feel a (very minor) plateau. However, to my surprise, it shoots straight back up as it culminates with a super ending.

Kate Winslet is top notch from beginning to end with an excellent performance, though isn't alone as the support cast all give very good performances - from Judy Davis to Hugo Weaving. I also note Liam Hemsworth, Alison Whyte and, at a certain point, Geneviève Lemon.

What a great film, full of twists n turns and it has a fantastic score. Loved it!"

I think it was a sensitive subject for a movie, especially to be made in Hollywood. Communism and United States are like two opposite poles. So portraying an American who supports it is a challenging task for any moviemakers. But the director of 'Meet the Parents' did a great job. Yep, you don't have to take sides while a watch. Of course, the movie discussed the issue of conflict over the types of ruling system, but it was only in the initial part that kind of looked strong. While the story advancing, that topic completely weakened and concentrated more on other stuffs. So don't expect it to be a fight for the constitutional, but a wonderful biography of one of the talented screenwriters in the history of Hollywood.

Communism or Democracy, whatever you support that does not matter here to choose whether you want watch it or not. Because this movie very smartly outlined how people are affected when they believe differently from the majority of others around. In the opening, I thought it could be an anti-hero tale, but later it transformed the angle of presentation and indeed in the end the main character turned into a most likeable one.

I liked Dalton Trumbo, not for what he preferred to support, but how he handled it all. The rival group is who made it a big concern, otherwise he is a neglectable for his egoist nature. Bryan Cranston was amazing in the title role. It's his best in the lead role, after only to the 'Breaking Bad'. Hope he's going to make more lead role films now after. Kind of of inspiring flick, of course, from his professional angle. Definitely one of the best films of the 2015 and deserved its Oscar nod.

Most of the ilk, perhaps to necessitate dramatic strength for the film's structure, maybe due to civil unrest from political turmoil worldwide in the late 60's, presented a future extremely difficult to endure and preciously doubtful to either survive or maintain. 'Idaho Transfer' was no exception.

Director Fonda was obviously very talented, and the cinematography is beautiful for such a low-budget piece. The time-travel ideas were uniquely conceived, and though the soundtrack was dated, it worked for me. Fonda realized that like the landscape and the solitary experience the teenagers were facing, one needs to let the ideas have a chance to breathe and reveal their multifaceted meanings. Though the actors weren't professional, the casting works because of the naturalistic, almost documentarian approach Fonda utilized. The pessimism of 'Idaho Transfer' and its bleak outlook--that even though science may be able to, in theory, save humanity, human nature may not be able to handle the idea of a 'utopia' so easily--shows us, two generations later, how interconnected art and politics are, and how important it is NOW to take a stand and support what is truly necessary for mankind, while there is still a chance for us to do so, and a world worthy of saving.

I fervently wish that Fonda had directed more films! =)"

Based on the real life story of a Nigerian forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu who discovered CTE disorder that most of the American football players are suffering from. So he fought for his theory against the NFL who was denying it. I was neutral when #OscarsSoWhite broke out, but for this movie I definitely agree on that. Whether he would have won or not, Will Smith name should have been in the best male actor in the lead list.

That's not at all, this movie did not qualify for any other category in the event which is not unfortunate, but deliberately the Academy chose a wrong side to stand. Felt like they are supporting NFL instead of fact and its own product. This biographical movie talked mainly about one particular sport, maybe there are other sports in the globe that might cause CTE as must as this one. Since Dr. Omalu's research came from NFL players, so it was all about between them.

This is a wonderful movie, I was very surprised for it. In the past, every good thing in the world was always opposed in its beginning, but later accepted widely like the global warming. I hope people aware of such thing is exist and act accordingly. No need to abandon the sport, just change the rules and the style of play. This is one of the best movie you could find from the 2015. I think it is a must see biopic, the credit must go to Ridley Scott who is the man behind for this movie to happen.

""-Only Charlie Brown.""

In the last few years I have not got tired to praise in my review for those my childhood tv favourite cartoons successfully transformed into 3D animations. After 'Tintin', 'Doraemon', 'Asterix', 'Mr Peabody' 'Winnie' and a few others, now this movie joined the club. I'm waiting for many more like 'Garfield', 'Kim Possible', 'Calvin & Hobbes' et cetera to make its way.

'Peanuts' characters considered one of the beautiful cartoon characters, just like 'Calvin & Hobbes'. They're simple drawings, yet very cute and delightful. These are mostly best suited to render in 2D animation, so till I watch them in 3D I always had a curiosity and doubts. This film is still a mix of both styles  - like eyes, mouth, dusts and in the side view, it was 2D drawing, but overall characters and backgrounds are 3D.

It was so good movie, for the 90 minutes I became a child again. As usual, there were two tales, one was Snoopy's fictional account and the others' Charlie Brown's crush on a little red-haired girl. Both of them were great, but I liked Charlie's a lot.

Once the animation was considered only for the kids, but now the world sees it differently. This film had an excellent box office. So definitely there will be a sequel. My only upset is it failed to do good at Annie awards, but anyway, like Disney studio says, that award ceremony is a joke and a disgrace to animation and animation (movie) fans.

8½/10 || I was pretty far from enthralled. However, I do say that we the caveat of, I am definitely not the target audience for this. I am too young to have grown up with the original _Peanuts_, and have that nostalgia, but also too old to be in the demographic for your average kid's movie. And even I must praise the animation style. The blending of the original hand-drawn design with the 3D CGI made for a truly unique visual aesthetic that I found very impressive.

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._"

My last anime movie was 'Giovanni Island' and I did not end up liking much. I thought that was a decent movie with an intense WWII story told through the Japanese children's perspective. Since then almost half a year passed and now I saw this from the director of 'Wolf Children'. That was his career best movie, so I think the director wanted to follow the same footstep. Thus he ended up making this one which was quite similar theme, except the sketches were not as cute as that.

Like one of the discussion topics on this title, it almost connects with the director's previous movie. Maybe something like Tarantino, who tried to connect 'The Hateful Eight' with 'Django Unchained', later dropped the idea for the characters that failed to merge. But here the reason might be the drawings which were somewhat different styles. And this one seems for teenagers and adults for having a little mature content when the narration reaches the second half.

It opened by a brief telling about the monsters and its world. Came back to the human society to focus on a 8-year-old runaway boy named Ren. While tailing a couple of strange creatures, he accidentally enters the monster world through a secret portal. Soon he meets a beast called Kumatetsu who is one of two candidates for 'the great master' title, decides to take him as his protege.

So the quarrelling begins between them for having difference in everything, but as the time passes, they bond well. Then comes a time for Kumatetsu to compete in what he was preparing for, and the boy who finds his own path. But somewhere when they were getting apart, an evil force brings them together to fight against it.

> ""People who work hard sincerely will master it quickly.""

Felt like I was watching a comedy, that was until the first half. All the character intros were kind of normal, nothing grand, but later found a strong connection to each other and each were very unique in nature to remember. This part is where that suits better for children and what comes next was kind of opposite. Feels fun parts are over, introduces a few new characters as the narration takes as big leap as 8 years forward.

This middle section was like a re-launch, like a new story to begin. As a child character turns into a teenager, the movie attempted to fit with adultish stuffs. So there was a semi romance, but feels like the quite friendship track. This is where you think the movie lets you down, a time kill section. Due to the theme that designed to take place between the two worlds, this is very important for moving forward to the 3rd act. I think shortening around 5 minutes would have done good for the pace of the movie.

The final act is even more unlike to the earlier episodes that adds a wonderful special effects to bring the action sequence. Sadly the stunts were not as dynamic as I hoped, I mean it was too short especially if you love fights. The kid and the beast combo were like from 'Ernest & Celestine'. Whenever these two are seen together, that bring so much fun.

Basically the movie outlines how humans are obsessed for power, who can go any lengths to clinch it and one of the ways is to let the darkness consume him. I already saw it twice. For the second time view it was even better and I liked it very much. Still, it is not the director's best work, as well as not a bad movie to just ignore.

After Miyazaki announced his retirement, many anime fans, including me were heartbroken. I never found anyone who can replace him, but a very few names came closer that includes this film director. He already gave some hits, but right now all he needs is to carry on his consistency, and definitely his name would appear beside that legend. I need not to tell you that anime movies are becoming rare these days, so when one make its way and people who watched it says it is a good movie, then must grab it.

Honestly, I was looking for the 7th film in the 'Rocky' series, so this spinoff was totally unexpected. But it is the right thing since the Rocky Balboa is getting old. Besides, in this reboot era, keeping franchise alive and leaping into the next generation was a very smart move. By doing this, they're keeping the original series fans with them to back it. I hope this will only get going like the Bond movies, since the young star, Jordan has another 30+ year potential to continue the 'Rocky' legacy by delivering some hits in his belt.

I don't know how they have done it, just kept everything so simple yet delivered a successful movie. The director of 'Fruitvale Station' and its actor Jordan's second successive run. I wish the combo return for the third time for another grand scale flick. Of course Stallone's presence made a big difference, but the way his character was portrayed, I feel the next film will get more emotional, especially between Rocky and Adonis like Rocky and Micky. And I'm also hoping for a bit better romantic tale on the side.

I grew up watching 'Rocky' movies, so I wanted badly it to be at least a decent, but it is a fantastic flick and I definitely suggest for those people like me. The youngsters as well can taste the new beginning in the Rocky legacy. CREED is the new ROCKY. The blueprint for the screenplay was exactly same as the original movies, even the music was very comparable yet everything was updated to the current timeline. Now I'm looking for a follow-up in the next 3 years.

A bunch of great actors with their very good performances, but the story was merely okay, even though somewhat it was an enjoyable flick. 'Two Rabbits' was a good Brasilian thriller, this is from the same director and his Hollywood debut which is not a spellbinding. I expected a lot after knowing it was his film, it did not disappoint me either, but for the Hollywood standards this was a let down. If it would have been a Portuguese film, then no one would have complained much.

It was supposed to be a sequel to David Fincher's 'Seven', but failed to fuse both the stories. So then it became an independent narration. The title should have been 'Premonition', but there's already a movie with that name. Like I said the story was kind of a mix of other films. The theme was a too much intelligence, so it needed the clever writers for its screenplay. I only say it was a missed opportunity to turn the product like 'Law Abiding Citizen'.

For a concept like this, the scenes were too ordinary and the end has been just alright. The best thing about this was the entertainment it offered, no matter if you feel deja-vu of watching this film, you won't get bored. Top actors, but I still consider it a good quality B movie than an average quality A list movie.

6/10 || Should have been in wide release...

Anthony Hopkins! Colin Farrell! Jeffrey Dean Morgan! A super well paced film with these fine actors and... straight to VOD in the USA.

Oh and Abbie Cornish! Not as well know as the above but she was great in her role as well!

Twenty years ago this film would have been given a wide release and been, if not a huge hit, a modest one. Certainly would have made it's money back and more. Today?? VOD.

So what happened? Too many movies coming out in the theaters to make room for this one? Too many showings of ""Beauty and the Beast"" taking up ten cinemas or more in the multi-plex thus shutting out ""Solace""? Fear that Americans would not know what Solace meant?? Think I am kidding??

Back when Dalton played Bond the second feature was to be called ""License Revoked"" but was changed to ""License to Kill"" because the studio feared too many Americans would not now what revoked meant!! At least the Bond folks decided we were not all idiots and eventually gave us ""Quantum of Solace""! (See? We knew what solace meant!!)

I don't know why this fine film was dumped on the internet and not playing at the nearby 1-105. It deserved a wide audience. || Not half as clever as it thinks it is. Not half as bad as it's purported to be.

I'm glad that this never became _EI8HT_ though. It struggled enough to work as a standalone tale, I don't really see it working as a _SE7EN_ sequel.

I was not overwhelmed by the overall film yet a very enjoyable film for the wonderful direction and the beautiful character displays. The first thing I remembered was 'Paper Moon', but it was when 'Last Ride' meets 'Natural Born Killers'. Clearly, it dealt with its own concept, but I won't deny the influence of those titles this film has. So I believe the writer has been inspired by them.

If you like the road films, then you might enjoy it as well, even though you're not desiring to give high marks. It begins when a 13 year old boy who lost his mother embarks a journey with a stranger to go and live with his grandparents who are on the other end of the country. On their way, the two struggles with their differences, especially in the conflict of interest to take such a trip. But they end up developing a close bond which is at one point comes to tear them apart.

It did not live up to my expectation. Actually, I was not having any expectation because I came to know about it a while ago before finished watching it. Without the character development how much a story going to impress its audience, but this film did by letting them to figure it out by themselves. There is a twist and other turns in the tale, but everything's very easy.

So the film kind of interested me, just for keeping everything simple and telling a tale with a good speed, but obviously not an original or anything extraordinary. Josh Duhamel was amazing, his role along with the kid's make you watch it. Especially after the 'Spotlisght', every a film with priests in it freaks me out like the one from this. Anyway, this is not a must see, but not bad to ignore completely.

This is an English language Spanish road-adventure that was adapted from a book. Takes place in the Yugoslavia during the end of its civil war. Other than that there's no detail about when and where it sets in or is it inspired by the real story. Shot in the beautiful mountain roads and villages. The camera work was so good, I loved the aerial photography that revealed the beauty of those mountainous regions, despite the war atmosphere.

This is a surprise film, because I never heard it before and did not know what to expect from it, but in the end I'm very pleased with the overall product. That's what usually we want in a film than to follow a project from its announcement till it hit the screens, then sometimes we may end in a disappointment after the long wait. So I guess this is better.

A simple theme, but the plot developed into a greater venture. It revolves around a bunch of aid workers who were deployed to help in the war torn villages. When they find a dead body dumped in a well which is the main source for the drinking water in the region, they try to remove it. But it is not that simple, after failed in their first attempt, they look for another rope to pull the corpse out. So the adventure begins to revolve around one mission. In the remaining tale, it reveals theirs unpleasant events of the day, that's why it's called 'A Perfect Day'.

This is not a war movie, but with the backdrop of war the entire concept was developed. It is obviously a comedy-drama, and a very good film on this theme you would find at present. It does have a couple of intense scenes that push us to the edge of the seats. No nudes or the sex, no violence either, not even tortures or the deaths. Still, it is rated best suitable for adults only because of a few dialogues related to the sex. Other than that this film does not deserve uppercase r for the US market.

> ""Welcome to Konopac, the rope capital of the world.""

The international cast was awesome for such a story. Individually, I liked everyone's performances, no one was lesser than the others among the lead characters. The only drawback was the underdeveloped characters, but that does not affect us the tale to entertain. They are not a medic team or any other similar kind, but very unusual characters that you have ever seen in a film. There's no physical stretch like they have done some tough stunt sequences, but they all quite beautifully exhibited their roles as the UN aid workers.

A single day tale, and the mix of both - realism and humours. Just depicted how a day of work would be in the places where it was devastated by war, especially representing the UNO and encountering problem for a simple matter. In addition to that, what happens when some old unresolved issues between two people reappear. All these were narrated very funnily, and sometime the fact of the war takes some of the scenes to the serious.

Like I said I enjoyed it a lot, and I believe it is capable to pull out another film to follow. Yep, like I always say when I like a film, I won't say no for a sequel to this. Because what the film characters accomplished in the end of the narration has looked to me just a beginning of another adventure. It might mean the loop in the tale to end on a high note, yet give an opportunity for another possible venture. I have no idea about the book, but it sounds good to me and I'll pray for it to happen. It was not a masterpiece, but a cute little film, which is kind of unpredictable and that's the its strength. I hope you all would give it a try, because it is worth it.

8/10 || Imagine you're on a small team of humanitarian aid workers sent to help the people of Yugoslavia toward the end of that awful civil war which saw Serbian and Muslim neighbors killing each other. Remember that 1990s war and all the sectarian violence? Well this film follows such a team as they seek to help displaced people survive as the peace talks bring the conflict to an end. 
Tim Robbins plays a worker who goes by the letter ""B"" throughout the film. He and Mambru (Benicio Del Toro) are veteran aid workers and are breaking in a rookie named Sophie (Melanie Thierry). Together with their interpreter, a man named Damir (Fedja Stukan) they work at keeping the basic necessities of life, such as clean water, available to the displaced people of the war torn country. 

I believe this film is an adaptation of a real life account of an aid worker. It shows the maddening interference of bureaucracy as it prevents them performing their tasks, and the delicacy with which they must navigate around the warring factions. 

A documentary might convey these things as well, but would not entertain or hold your attention as this quality cast does."

Sure, why not tamper with a proven formula that guarantees all the right ingredients to tap into the angst-ridden world of young feminine empowerment set against a background of apocalyptic strife and undefined self-discovery? In director J Blakeson’s drippy and derivative dystopian drama The 5th Wave we are introduced to another similar sci-fi serving of a disillusioned heroine out to reflect some consciousness in a boundary of uncertainly and destructive despair. Sadly, The 5th Wave is nothing more than a stillborn alien invasion soap opera that wants to spout off its Hunger Games-esque copycat coating but fails to delve into anything remotely original or bitingly daring.

The 5th Wave is the literary brainchild of novelist Rick Yancey’s printed pages as he brings to life the trials and tribulations of tenacious teen tart Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz from “Kick-Ass”), a timid tyke-turned-guerilla warfare gal whose guts and gumption to find and protect her little brother during a full-scale alien invasion of the planet is put forth in flimsy animated fashion. Actually the young actress Moretz, a veteran of a few films already lodged under her belt, has quite a feisty presence on screen and more than holds her own as the “princess of panic” in the generic doomsday drama that really brings nothing to the tension-filled table.

The material that Moretz is obligated to bring to life feels rather strained and stilted because the YA creative cloud hovers over the proceedings in a predictable, syrupy manner. The 5th Wave lacks the intensity and philosophical fiber that The Hunger Games effortlessly put forth in imaginable conception. Plus, the energy and bombastic buzz of Hunger Games imitator Divergent does not seem to be part of The 5th Wave’s anemic pulse. Incredibly, Blakeson’s lean and lacking futuristic feminine fable incorporates a cinematic stew of film flavors that heavily echoes such solid blueprints as everything from Red Dawn and Independence Day to the WOW-factor of blockbusters in Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers. The sad part is that even with the borrowing of these cinematic ideas The 5th Wave still registers as a limp alien invasion actioner without much punch or promise. The film is well-intentioned in its YA-oriented gravitas but will soon be dismissed as another Hunger Games wannabe going through the motions.

As with the inspired makeup that is at the root of these conventional YA melodramas, The 5th Wave offers its share of youth-minded dire and doom, romantic exploration and the element of military-style redemption and rebellion. As Moretz’s Callie is called into action among the devastating ruins she is determined to reunite with her last surviving  relative Sam (Zackary Arthur). Soon, this mild-mannered schoolgirl has to whip into shape and protect the interests of her deteriorating community as the hard-nosed alien invaders look to wreak havoc and take over the world–or at least Callie’s part of the world that has her fellow citizens shocked and stunned.

Poor Cassie…in addition to her mind focusing on locating her sibling, revving up for her showdown with the alien intruders and shaking of her vulnerabilities she is caught in a love triangle that tests her limits. Should Cassie fall for the dashing and daring Ben (Nick Robinson, “Jurassic World”), a fellow classmate about to enroll into the junior start-up army looking to combat the unwelcomed visitors or should her confused heart throb for backwoods bad boy Evan Walker (Alex Roe)? Also, how would Cassie feel if she discovers that her hunk-in-training may have a thing for the ravaging rough-around-the-edges recruit Ringer (Maika Monroe). Ah, love among the languishing landscape!

It is definitely the consensus that The 5th Wave may not be included in the Mount Rushmore of youth-friendly dystopias merely because it is nothing more than a shadowy reminiscence of the more defining, developed and decisive babes-in-the-woods boisterous actions. Even when not just comparing The 5th Wave to its better conceived contemporaries it dos not feel comfortable in its own mediocrity when standing on its own two feet. It is compelling only for its goal in pushing the conveyor belt of sci-fi YA duds to uphold Hollywood’s attempt to kidnap the psyche of young moviegoers looking for the next big screen teen scene sensation to boost box office receipts.

Sorry but there is no need to take out the sci-fi surfing board for the tepid trappings of The 5th Wave.

(c) Frank Ochieng 2016 || > Another teen film trilogy, alien invasion theme on a roll.

The 80s teen films were different, (like the recent one 'Turbo Kid') especially those I watched when I was growing up in the late 90s and early 2000s. But now most of them are dystopian action-adventure-fantasy/sci-fi themes, and obviously trilogies with high end graphics. I won't blame for that, the time has come for a change, the movies have technical qualities and they know how to render them, but the stories are terrible.

To me this was just an okay film. Felt like the action-adventure versions of 'The Host', but I loved that one, not this. I know it's a trilogy, so, more stories to come with more explanations, but the first film in a series is always important and it failed to impress me. This installment is all about a teen girl and her younger brother. After getting separated during the chaos of alien invasion, she goes to look for him and that's the film.

This might be the finer contents for a book, but for a movie, it is not that any special. I did not like the ending as well, felt like it was so stupid. Even some B films got better conclusion and stunt sequences. I feel bad for Chloe Moretz for taking up this project. She should do more action films like 'Kick-Ass'. I thought she would be the one who's going to replace Angelina Jolie. I can only hope for this series to get better in the follow up and end as a decent trilogy.

5/10 || Here we go again, another female empowered teen movie. HW seem to be literally pumping this garbage out for the last few years. Is it any wonder why movie sales are down with garbage like this on the shelf? Designed to be for all those teens who like the idea of blood, but really don't want to see it (think twilight, hunger games etc). Save your money and 1h50m of your time and skip.
If you really need to see it, in brief it's about a 16 year old girls world turned upside down by an 'alien' invasion when her brother is taken by supposed US army to fight the aliens and father is shot. Befriended by one of 'the others' helps to get the aliens on the run.
Nifty idea, however for me falls way short as you don't see any real 'aliens', mediocre acting and story line is very predicable. Look for it in the bargain bin at videoezy in 12 months."

A surprisingly good film, you can compare it with the Oscar winner 'Spotlight'. But it was not popular as that one, because it was about the American politics, so seems the world did not care much. However, going down in the domestic market was a very sad. It was directed by the newcomer and he did a wonderful job, even for penning a good screenplay. But it was based on the memoir by Mary Mapes called 'Truth and Duty'.

It's a journalism theme, sets in during the months before the 2004 presidential election. It was focused on the CBS's famous news series '60 Minutes Wednesday' where its episodes reveals some of the copy documents how George W. Bush altered them get into the military in the 80s. Soon the producer to the host, everyone who involved in that show receive a backlash. In the remaining parts, it aims to disclose how the claimer decides to fight the issue and would they succeed?

Cate Blanchett was never attracted to me, but I never doubted her performances. So in this, she was amazing and quite physically looked beautiful. One of her great character display, and it should have nominated for the various awards, but I don't understand why it was discarded totally. The other actors too were awesome, Especially Robert Redford was superb as a news anchor. He's a bit old, otherwise I would have expected him to play Don Trump in a movie, maybe a biopic or comedy.

Like the film revealed what happened to Mapes, I think those invisible and powerful men made this film does not get into the spotlight. But as I've seen, I say it's a must see film of the year, if you're interested in the US and its politics. How the story ends is sad, but I've seen other journalism films that highlights their strength, whereas this one was opposite. I loved the lines Cate delivered at one of the final scenes. I hope you watch it at least after reading my review.

The actors are all awesome and characteristic. The rhythm is tight and deeply involving.

I really like the theme -- 2008 global economy crisis. This film explains many technical sides unfamiliar to most of us, including those deeply affected by this catastrophe. Above the technical details, the main four roles have different philosophical insights during this event:

Michael Burry -- Realistic, Objective, Knowing history

Ben Rickert & Pals -- Murphy's Law

Jared Vennett -- Distrust of the Big Corp

Mark Baum -- Belief in the justice, even in against of the money

In conclusion, 100% recommended. || **Overall, Adam McKay somehow found a way to make a movie about mortgage fraud profoundly entertaining while still informative.**

Is it even possible that a serious film this well written, acted, and shot could possibly be directed by the same guy that did Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers?  I know!  Mindblowing!  But Adam McKay pulled it off with an incredible cast and brilliant storytelling that took advantage of multiple narratives to keep the movie moving quickly.  The Big Short was keenly aware that some of its necessary exposition was pretty complex and boring, so it found clever and entertaining ways to give those cumbersome details without losing its audience.  As a guy that generally needs explosions and car chases to keep me engaged, I could not believe how much I enjoyed this film.  The Big Short is an eye-opening film that tells a complex story with a fun, fast pace that keeps the audience engaged and entertained. || This is a fascinating appraisal of the antics on Wall Street leading up to the global economic crash that started with the collapse of the American mortgages market in the mid 2000s. Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell are superb as the three men who identify and appreciate the risks, capitalise on the flaws and who ultimately epitomise the woefully lacking standards of regulation and comprehension by market and government alike; coupled with degrees of avarice that would make King Midas want to blush. The pace of the film is gripping - plenty of parallel threads that gradually conjoin to create a compelling narrative well exemplified by a cast at the top of their game delivering a taut, fast moving adaptation of Michael Lewis' frequently jaw-dropping book. The technique of using real celebrities (like Margot Robbie & Selena Gomez) to illustrate some of the more abstruse aspects of these bewildering processes is effective, and the supporting cast - especially Brad Pitt (who reminded me a lot of Robert Redford), as perhaps the most odious of all: he knew the likely pitfalls for the ordinary people of their scheming, but proceeded regardless - Rafe Spall and Finn Wittrock add marvellously to this. What is does lack, though, is any sort of political dimension. It sets it's sights fairly on the excesses of the businesses, but focusses not at all on the incompetencies of regulators and politicians alike, which does present us with a bit of bias as to the complicity of many, many more than just the bankers in this disaster. It has a degree of thinly woven humanity to it, but sadly illustrates all to clearly how profligacy and greed prevailed in the absence of any real sense of decency or integrity. The last ten minutes is particularly potent - or should that be portentous...?"

Foolander!

Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. Ben Stiller is a good actor, but a fine filmmaker, His directional ventures were awesome, especially after his last film 'Walter Mitty' the expectation was very high on this, but I did not think it'll end like this. It hits the rock bottom, the lowest point in his directional career. His odd film experiment had failed, just for one project and I know he will come back strong. But as an actor, he still got the star value and I'm looking forward for his upcoming project.

It has been 15 years since the original film and I don't remember much of it. But before this, I had a very quick re-view, so I'm to get a clean flow for a better understanding. Anyway, the film gave a brief report about the past events in the beginning, but when I saw the first face in the opening scene I knew it will going to suck and it did.

Okay, the first, the story was decent, but not the jokes. And the next, there are too many cameos that kind of ruined its pace to keep quiet for sometime and to focus on actual story development. From all those, the best part and where I actually had a brief laugh was to see Neil deGrasse Tyson. The second films are always very crucial, because it is a bridge between the original film and numerous follow-ups to set up a franchise status. So clearly this film stumbled and I don't think there will be any more films in this series.

The original 'Zoolander' had its own brand appeal, but with this bad film it got lost. The production was very good and so the performances, but the humours were average. No offense, there are some people who still liked it, but I did not, so I won't recommend it for the 'Zoolander' fans as well as if you're looking for a good comedy. But like I always say who knows you might like it, so think twice in which one is if you're reading this review and the second is analyse it before to decide anything.

3/10 || ZOOLANDER 2 is the follow-up to the 2001 comedy that originally tanked at the box office due to its release just after September 11, but then became a pop culture phenomenon once it was released on home video.

We again meet male fashion model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and his former rival Hansel (Owen Wilson), but both have lived in seclusion for years due to a tragedy that strikes just after the events of the first film. They are drawn back into the world of fashion when they receive an invitation from designer Don Atari (Kyle Mooney) and fashion mogul Alexanya Atoz (Kristen Wiig), but they are perplexed by the changed fashion and social mores of 15 years later, and the fashion world treats them like veritable dinosaurs. Will Ferrell's villain Jacobim Mugatu returns, and the plot is again driven by a conspiracy to commit a heinous crime, which Zoolander and Hansel must thwart with the help of an agent, played by Penelope Cruz, from Interpol's fashion police (fashion police, get it?).

This sequel was savaged by critics, and sadly I have to concur with that judgment. The film's problems are legion. For one, this is one of those sequels that thinks that any gag that was funny in the first film has to be repeated almost verbatim here. But this time, those gags just fall flat. The Zoolander story is too aware of itself as a phenomenon to have the underdog charm and quirky originality of the original 2001 film. The pacing is badly thought out; the unfunny exposition takes so long that the real meat of this comedy has to be compressed into so few minutes that ultimately, it's over almost as soon as it started. And then there are the utterly pointless cameos: Katy Perry and Neil deGrasse Tyson are brought onscreen with absolutely no relevance to the events that are transpiring, and audiences are just supposed to laugh at seeing them? Bizarre.

There are some nice parts here. I think Kyle Mooney is one of the most interesting and versatile comedians working at the moment, and his part here as a tiresomely ironic hipster (""You guys suck, I love you!"") had some laugh out loud moments. To play Mugatu, Will Ferrel again gives an over-the-top performance that you could tell he had put a lot of thought and effort into, and it's so sad that his part was essentially relegated to a minor one in the end. But as I laughed at the good bits here, I kept wishing they could somehow be extracted from this film and placed instead into a much better one. Overall, this is probably worth avoiding even if you enjoyed the the 2001 film. || Not all that far adrift from the original, for me.

I would class <em>'Zoolander 2'</em> as a step below its predecessor, but there's not much between them in my opinion - admittedly, I only found the first film to be marginally passable. It starts off well, I was liking the opening few scenes. That interest of mine definitely waned as the run time went by, though there's still enough there to avoid proper boredom.

Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell and Penélope Cruz make the film watchable enough. Cyrus Arnold does alright as the kid, while the numerous cameos are minorly amusing to see. I can't say it's a film I enjoyed or that I'd rewatch, but I didn't find it be all that bad either."

Another novel based film from the director of 'Love, Rosie'. About the four young women that tells how to enjoy the life by balancing the men and the parties. Very interesting cast, hot ones like Dakota Johnson, Alison Brie and even she's in her 40s Leslie Mann looked so fantastic. The narration had layers to focus on these different people and their different attempt to get the life they wanted. In that, I kind of like Leslie's, maybe the age fact and to be touched by her love tale with decency. But Dakota and Alison led it with their glamorous way and theirs each tale as well not bad, particularly depicting the present world's youngster's culture.

From the all, the biggest surprise was the Rebel Wilson, who I never liked much as I did for in this, definitely she was at her best. The story was good, seems it was squashed with the too many contents, but awesomely managed to bring them all in one direction by linking them to the main characters. So that makes the stories of everyone take place within the circle and delivered a good entertainment, Lots of fun, even though it is a pure commercial film, there are many things from it that makes us to think seriously. Particularly thinking them from the youngster's perspective about the current world status in the entertainment segment.

I don't know those who are complaining about it had they watched the same film, Because it is a fine entertainment, even though it is chick film, anybody, particularly adults can have a great time. In a thin margin, there was about men as well, how they're caught between the women they are in love and those women what they believe in. I'm being a man, I really enjoyed it despite target audience is women. I know this is not a masterpiece, but definitely not the worst film of the year or decade. In the film, everyone wanted to be in the relationship, so I did not get it, but the end clarifies decently about the title. Surely worth a watch, if you want a good entertainment.

We live in a country where minorities have been a subject to police brutality. We live in a country where you must enter debt by taking out a student loan and you are still not guaranteed a successful future. Are you uncomfortable yet? Comfortability won't be found here or in fashion designer turned director Tom Ford's second featured film Nocturnal Animals. The director forces you to become comfortable with being uncomfortable and the result is the most beautiful disturbingly gripping films of 2016.



> From writer/director Tom Ford comes a haunting romantic thriller of shocking intimacy and gripping tension that explores the thin lines between love and cruelty, and revenge and redemption. Academy Award nominees Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal star as a divorced couple discovering dark truths about each other and themselves in NOCTURNAL ANIMALS.

Director Tom Ford starts the film with a close up of a handful of naked older white females dancing nakedly with bodies society would be disturbed by. Ford does not focuses on just one part of the body but every piece of fat, extra skin, crease, scar, and stretch mark to really push your comfortability. No, Ford is not going for shock value, especially not so early in the film because there will be plenty time for that, but he is being nice of enough to give the audience a disclaimer. A disclaimer that nothing will be more comfortable than the opening sequence and if you couldn't handle that then Nocturnal Animals is going to be one hell of a trip for you. Heck, regardless, Nocturnal Animals is one hell of a trip.

Nocturnal Animals itself contains a double narrative strand which consists of Susan's real life and her bringing the book of her ex-husband to life. Ford does not implement a voiceover to let you know that you are now in the world of the book yet he makes you feel that you are watching another film. Ford pulls off a difficult task in making the audience care about both narratives and you want to believe that both are fictional then the uncomfortability levels begin to raise once again as you are forced to remember that one is indeed reality. Tony & Susan, the 1993 novel that the films was adapted from, unfolds how intimate the act of reading could be as an author could tap into the reader's thoughts, feelings and experience. Tom Ford pulls this same feat but just with the act of watching a film.

With his first job being a fashion designer, one would only assume to be blown away by the visuals Tom Ford would create. This is true as various scenes of LA and west Texas are beyond stunning but no one would expect the clash of visuals Ford would create with LA and west Texas. The transition from super cool and grotesque LA to a brutal, violent and revengeful west Texas will once again raise your uncomfortability levels.

After all, this is a revenge film. We learn throughout the film that Susan, who comes from a wealthy family, falls in love with an inspiring author in Jake Gyllenhaal's Tony but would eventually go on to break his art in three different way. First, by telling him to take a step back from his dream of being an author. Secondly, aborting his child. Then, if the first two wasn't enough, she lives him for the handsome and dashing Armie Hammer's Hutton. Susan goes on to live the perfect life with Hutton and 20 years after her divorce with Tony, he decides to quietly place a novel about revenge in her mailbox. We feel Susan's chills as she reads the novel and without ever needing to say a word to her, Susan's perfect little world becomes to crumble

Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams give us exactly what we expect from them. Aaron Taylor-Johnson offers a spine-chilling performance as Ray Marcus and Michael Shannon is fantastic as Bobby Andes. Tom Ford finally takes off his fashion designer hat and puts his fully-fledged director hat on as that was his approach with this film and two narratives. Tom Ford sustains the point that he is not a fashion designer turned director but a full-fledged director as a lesser director would have totally botched this film. || **RE

This was simply awesome. I meant the story, but the presentation was not my kind. I got the story and I enjoyed it. The performances can't be neglected either. Both the lead, Jake and Amy were the film's highlight. But I also happy for Michale Shannon's Oscars nominee. Based on the novel 'Tony and Susan', but for the film adaptation, the title got inspired by the book that appear in the story. From the director of 'A Single Man' which is his comeback film after a long gap. I would say a good attempt.

This is the story of a successful art gallery boss who got divorced and remarried to the man whom she was cheating with from her ex. Her decision was in particular influenced by her mother. Now she thinks she's happy, but one day her ex sends a copy of his latest novel that's dedicated in her name. Reading it, she realises the tough time he'd with their separation. Following the end of the book, she encounters an unexpected truth which could affect her life forever.

A dual layer story. One was fiction and the other one in the real world. But the fictional tale highly influences the main narration and that's what I call the genuine writing. So the credit must go to none other than the original author. I have seen lots of revenge films, even it can be compared to 'Three Colours: White', but the major difference is the sweet revenge. For that alone the film was awesome. The climax was even better. If you understand the narration, you will enjoy it for sure. The filmmaking should have been a bit better. Excluding that the film is not to be skipped.

_6/10_ || A compelling thriller with an open-ended ending that feels far too easy for what it had going for it.

Nocturnal Animals starts out very strong. It feels reminiscent of Lynch's Lost Highway or Mulholland Dr. The main character lives a luxurious life surrounded by some very striking pieces of art (art pieces which, throughout the story, make things even more thrilling and surreal). She reads her ex-boyfriend's novel which quite honestly makes us feel like we're in a bad dream. The way the novel starts out feels like Michael Haneke's Funny Games. Its opening scene with Aaron Taylor-Johnson so brilliantly builds in tension with his character's mind games. The story however turns into a bit of a tame crime mystery held up with a sort of fun performance from Michael Shannon. The potential to be a very cryptic thriller is there, but decides instead to put all the pieces together for us. As a Lynch fan, this movie made me crave something stranger. I really wanted to be left mystified but instead I got an ending that was kind of obvious."

In the past for an action movie, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg came together and now for a comedy, once again the unusual combo returned. Surprisingly the movie was more hilarious than what I thought after listening to those who saw it already. Being a comedian, Will Ferrell was as usual awesome, but Wahlberg contribution had an equally advantageous.

The story was a one liner, but individual comedy scenes made an impact for its grand scale success. Generally, the scenes from the comedy films are easy to predict, so in this I felt similarly, but in the many parts it kept turning in another direction. Tried its best to avoid cliches, but we know that's impossible. Either way, it carried out some decent laughs.

The movie was all about the dad versus the step-dad. When a man thinks he's finally getting along with his step-kids, then comes their real dad who threatens to take aback his wife and children. So they go head-to-head and followed by a chain of life changing events comes a suitable conclusion. But there's a loop in the end, so possibly we can expect a sequel. Knowing it was not the best comedy of the year, I was not upset either for overall movie. I can even suggest it if you are looking for a simple entertainment.

Don't assume it's a high school party movie, but the big girls'. That's where everyone's are wrong and expresses their disappointment. For me it was a nice comedy, but not comparable with other great ones. It might won't work on teenagers, but there's no issue for adults with the open mind to enjoy it. A part themed movie for the grown-ups.

From the director of 'Pitch Perfect' another woman oriented comedy. Both, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were not that funny, hence not a rocking combo, but did not fail either and worked okay on this. They are the sisters with the opposite character. When they visit their childhood home, they decide to throw one final party before handing it over to the new owners.

John Cena's cameo was excellent. In this chick movie he's the only one who gave manly appeal compared with the other men. The story was decent, but most of the movie was a regular party that goes wild. So expecting development of the characters or the story is silly. What I meant was, it is an entertainer, not a biopic or a documentary, so it delivers its purpose.

7/10 || Sisters tries really hard. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler certainly have chemistry and some of the best moments of the movie come from that chemistry. Still, the film falls flat on its face more than once.

The movie is mostly cringe humor. It's filled with one character or another doing something embarrassing. While this can be done really well if used correctly, Sisters seems to hit everything with the cringe hammer until it cries.

This isn't really expected, and neither is the abundant use of bodily and sexual humor. There are some great moments in the movie relating to these, as well.

The real issue with the movie is it feels like the writers went at it with a list of ""funny"" situations and tried to fit them all into a loose theme. Throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks inevitably means there will be a bunch of junk laying on the floor."

It has great animation, great music, and a great story. We loved it. My son, who is 9, enjoyed the story and thought the movie was very funny. The panda theme was adorable as pandas are cute animals. Also, the scary guy wasn't that scary - and was more funny. Jack Black is hilarious and everyone in the theater was laughing. There were some sad moments and some happy moments but you leave the theater feeling uplifted. If you like action movies, you will like this because many things explode but there is no gore. The colors of the film are quite beautiful and lush. Go see it! You will enjoy it. Take your kids. || > This time no Skadoosh, but Chi time.

Three successful films in an animation franchise is a great achievement and according to the production house, yet another 3 films are going to hit the screens in a decade of time. So if you are an animation fan, especially 'Kung Fu Panda' and Po's fan, brace yourself for the future treats. This film was amazing. After two wonderful adventures, now this story has calmed down a bit with simplicity. Visually, it was spectacular with all those fight sequences, but the story was quite dramatised with enough comedies and then the final battle to conclude the 3rd installment on a high note.

I think it was a well designed storyline in advance keeping in mind 5 to 6 films, that's why the flow was very smooth between all the three with those flashbacks placed at the right place. This particular part belongs to Pandas, the furious five were absent in most of the film, but good to see the return of Oogway. The master Oogway comes at the beginning and then during the end, though very happy for presence as he's my favourite character in this franchise. He's not a big player, but like Yoda, he's amazing and tell me who won't like him.

This time no Skadoosh, but a new villain with a battle fought for a new powerful thing called Chi. Now Po got a promotion, so I'm very excited for the next film for how it will going to turn out. This is a beautiful family film and must not miss it. All the cast was returned from the previous two and a few more new were recruited and it is set in a new location for the most of the narration like the most of the animations has done in China. After all made in China is not so bad.

8/10 || Kung Fu Panda 3 is about what you would expect. A roller coaster ride of gags, goof ups and outrageous martial art outbursts.

Po is himself, clumsy, naïve, martial arts master and funny. As usual he is accompanied by his friends from the previous movies including the somewhat reluctant Shifu. The wise turtle Oogway from the first Kung Fu Panda is back as well, kind of.

Naturally there is a big bad villain, General Kai, who it turns out have some past relations to Oogway. General Kai is pretty good as a villain with a suitable maniacal expression on his face. Then of course, a bull in itself is already projecting bad temper and violence so it is a good start.

The main story is of course about defeating General Kai but Po’s reunification with his (real) father and the rest of the, funny and very clumsy, inhabitants in the Panda village is taking up a large part of the movie.

In general the story is quite nice with some nice twists.

It should come as no surprise that Po, as usual, saves the day in a cataclysmic showdown with General Kai. There are some great animation effects in the final battle.

At the end of the day this is a quite recommendable family movie."

If you read the title correctly, you would think it's a little kid's film, especially for girls. Even the title design gives the same impression, more like a fairytale. But shockingly, this film was very different. This is about the gamers, the people who are crazy about video games. It was like a comic con, the film characters decide to create a utopia for the gamer with their favourite gaming characters. So they gather outskirt of the town and when everything was going well, they bump into a series of trouble, especially the founder of it. Coming out of it is the rest of the film to reveal.

It is not my favourite, but one of the best B movies I have seen and a bit refreshing. My appreciation is according to how they managed to give this product with the limited financial support. The quality of the film was so good. The performances were well recognisable. Since it was a comedy, sometimes the flaws are gone unnoticed. Not a bad attempt for the first time direction. Though the story was easy, predictable, but still enjoyable. Surely some people will find it good, even better than I did, so I hope this film reaches them instead of those who criticise it.

58431.0,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"A zombie outbreak has fallen upon the land in this reimagining of Jane Austen's classic tale of the tangled relationships between lovers from different social classes in 19th century England. Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is a master of martial arts and weaponry and the handsome Mr. Darcy is a fierce zombie killer, yet the epitome of upper class prejudice. As the zombie outbreak intensifies, they must swallow their pride and join forces on the blood-soaked battlefield in order to conquer the undead once and for all.",Bloody lovely.,"Romance, Horror, Comedy, Thriller",108.0,2016-02-04,en,6.16,2214.0,2.8273,"Lily James, Sam Riley, Jack Huston, Bella Heathcote, Douglas Booth",Burr Steers,"based on novel or book, dystopia, shaolin, prejudice, zombie, pride, gold digger, 19th century, georgian or regency era, somber, parson, mashup, amused, antagonistic","One thing is for certain: no one can accuse director Burr Steers’s off-kilter version of novelist Jane Austen’s lyrical literary landscape **Pride and Prejudice** as being deemed solely melancholy and manipulative. The challenge of presenting a sophisticated and sudsy exposition while incorporating the ghoulish gimmicky of zombies to elevate the surrealism and cynicism of the British-based costume drama is an ambitious taking to say the least. Thankfully, Steers delivers a halfway decent piercing period piece that accentuates both the elegance and eeriness of Austen’s blossomed universe of early 19th century English femininity dripping with refined defiance and desire. Hence, Steers’s somewhat choppy but inspired **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** provides an imaginative and slightly insane spin on the austere exuberance of Austen’s classic romancer highlighted with the butt-kicking antics of the bombastic Bennett sisters.

There is no doubt that movie and television audiences throughout the years have been subjected to the omnipresence of the Jane Austen Experience through countless interpretations of her treasured **Pride and Prejudice** artistic works. For the most part, the radiance of Pride and Prejudice has always maintained its ravishing romanticism in the various incarnations showcased. However, Steers looks to promote a bloody-thirsty blueprint and enhance the urgent sense of Austen’s femme fatale movement–in this case unite the Bennett brood and arm them with the alertness of sinister-made sisterhood. Instinctively, the premise for **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** gives off a bizarre but refreshing vibe when distributing its wacky brand of subversive feminine liberation.

Austen heroine Elizabeth Bennett has always been possessed in her personalized convictions especially when it came to love and stability. Nevertheless, **Zombies’** Liz (Lily James) has a mission in mind that does not necessarily involve finding that ideal suitor of choice. In this case, Elizabeth and her sisters Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia (Bella Heathcoate, Mille Brasy, Suki Waterhouse and Ellie Bamber) are the sisterly slayers trained to eradicate the unwanted walking dead. The Bennett beauties, all skilled at exceptional swordplay courtesy of intensified training in China, are looked down upon within their elite social circles. Furthermore, the concern over the feisty Elizabeth and her siblings finding their soulmates rests on the shoulders of their worrisome parents Mr. and Mrs. Bennett (Charles Dance and Sally Phillips). What is to become of the vast Bennett estate should their offspring not find the eligible companions to continue the bloodline? The question remains: will the bashing Bennett babes go down in family history as courageous zombie huntresses  or suffer the societal humiliation as available spinsters untouched?

Elizabeth’s preference is to be vigilant in her quest to zap out the zombie presence whenever possible as opposed to obsessing over whether she will hook the grand love of her life. Still, the very idea of meeting Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley) at one of the festive balls may have at least humbled the combative Elizabeth a bit and had her entertain the notion of embracing a romantic feeling. Unfortunately duty calls and the agenda for terminating the pesky zombies as they invade the region is the top priority for Bennett brigade.

Actually, **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a frenetic fable that solidly works because it is able to competently marry two ubiquitous genres–zombie B-movies with prim and proper Austen period piece adaptations–and come up with a quirky and contentious commentary on female-oriented resistance and rage. Steers rips into the convention of womanhood wonderment with a horror flick romancer that has its sheer of nuanced nerve and chilly-minded charm. The gory shenanigans and showy execution of Zombies’  cinematic makeup from Remy Adefarasin’s luscious cinematography to David Warren’s production design and Julian Day’s costume designs all mesh with noted symmetry. The balance of wit, suspense, terror and tirade as the Bennett bunch and their suitors engage in swagger as they eliminate the detestable zombies feels delectable in manufactured naughtiness.

The performances are steady and give substance to the welcomed wackiness that uncannily defines this effectively compelling but twisted treat to Austen’s pretty protagonists dressed up in gorgeous gowns that conceal their blood-laced daggers. As the lead Bennett sister, James is rather engrossing as the impulsive sword-swinging sass as her unique spin on Austen’s curly-haired creation is as credible and creative as say Keira Knightley’s stamp on the Elizabeth Bennett role.  Although rollicking in a zombie B-movie without relying too much on the crutch of high stakes camp, James and her supporting players are quite poised to go with the flow based on what the unpredictable material hands them.

The bottom line is that **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a serviceable spectacle that dares to weave a Victorian-cultured social class romance yarn with an undead creepfest while finding a common ground in the hidden psyche of the young woman’s destined determination for self-discovery. Perhaps introducing the less literate crowd to Jane Austen’s brand of high class sensibilities through the battling Bennetts during the onslaught of an English countryside zombie invasion would make other future **Pride and Prejudice** installments feel more renewed and receptive.

(c) Frank Ochieng 2016 || Better than it had any right being, but still not very good.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **From loathing to romance and zombie hunting!**

I did not know there was a parody novel of Jane Austen's 200 years old classic. This was based on that, a multi-starrer film, but the lack of star value let down the film. This is the film with a familiar plot, in addition to that zombies were there, but that was not enough. The big names from the cast would have pulled the film out of the box office disaster if it had one or two. But still I think this film was okay, an acceptable with awesome production and performances.

It ended like there will be a sequel, but now I don't think there's going to be one. The story was kind of predictable. Well, I did predict, particularly the character Wickham. Though I was more curious about the Zombies, like how it was going to be used in the narration. I must say, they were excellent. I mean they were not given any big preference, but theirs part indeed helped to build a nice plot. Pretty well composed stunts. I mean carefully, without strong blood and gore, so they got PG13 and warning for the violences.

I think the film critics overreacted like usual. They're like the sheep herds, they follow one another and given verdict for this as a bad flick. But as a film fanatic, I don't think it is worth neglecting, especially if you are a fan of the original story. In the todays world, the critics are a bunch of circus clowns. So I hope you make a right choice on this, not because of me or the critics, if you haven't seen it yet.

Anyone as old as me will remember TV's ""Laugh In"" and comedian Flip Wilson's oft repeated line ""The devil made me do it!"" It became, like ""Sock it to me"" from the same show, a Buzz Phrase for the time.

""The Devil's Candy"" certainly fits into ""the devil made me do it"" category as far as character motivation. Here the devil makes one character kill and another paint dark disturbing pictures of which they have no memory of painting. But rather than cliché us or bore us with the same old ""call a priest"" which we have seen a million times, the story plays out as a very human drama of one man dealing with what doctors would call a mental illness, and another dealing with an obsession that is costing him his family.

Yet do not think the film is without chills. Indeed it has some extremely disturbing and violent scenes! However these are done with a modicum of gore and blood so they are not gross out horrors; rather than true horrors as they let you in on what is happening just enough to worry your mind.

The film also makes a subtle statement about how we as a society fail to treat mental patients with violent pasts.

Acting all around is top notch. Ethan Embry, Shiri Appleby (nice to see after not having seen her in a while), Kiara Glasco, and Pruitt Taylor Vince never once drop the ball; bringing us fully into their worlds. || Goes largely unresolved, but still has a good grasp of the technical aspects and some small amount of originality.

Herbie is apprehended by a new owner (Bruce Campbell) who is surprised that the unintimidating Volkswagen can win races and do amazing things.

Kevin J. O'Connor plays the mechanic, Alexandra Wentworth a racing judge and Dana Gould the villain’s associate.     

""The Love Bug"" (1997) is the fourth sequel to the original 1969 film and the fifth entry overall. It’s limited by a TV budget, which can mostly be observed in the studio sets/locations and lack of extras, but the script is more compelling to prior endeavors, with the possible exception of the previous one, “Herbie Goes Bananas” (1980), which I enjoyed more than the first three (even though most fans look down on it). 

Several highlights mark this one above the others: We learn how Herbie was created with a mind of its own (the explanations provided in the first two films were vague theories rather than concrete truths); there’s an unexpected death/resurrection subplot; Dean Jones returns as Jim Douglas, now 65 years-old during filming; there’s an Evil Herbie, called Horace; and Alexandra Wentworth is arguably the best female to be featured in the series up to this point, with Elyssa Davalos from the previous flick in close second (i.e. Melissa). 

The film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.

It is a French production, almost everything shot in England in the English language, but there is a bit of American flavour in it. Based on the speculation on the Apollo 11 mission, but it never took seriously on that topic, other than narrating humorously. Only the theme was new, but most of the jokes weren't. Overall, an average film, directed by some totally unknown guy, but as a B movie, it is acceptable. If you know what kind of film you're about see and anticipate according to that, then the time you spend for it won't end badly, except you're not going to give it a perfect score.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._ || **A dog's lifetime journey with the different owners.**

I am an animal lover, but there's nothing bad I found on it. It was just a film and they did not even harm the dogs that used for, but those, particularly final scene was a graphic. Anyway, one thing is for sure that this is not for softhearted people. Because some of the contents were unpleasant to watch, but in the real world these things happen everyday, everywhere and nobody doing nothing to stop that. So you can't just blame this film for that to portraying the facts. In a recent film, someone was attacked by a bear and later it was killed, but this is not that kind of bad impression giving film for the animal lovers.

I haven't seen the 'Welcome to the Dollhouse', but it is a spin-off of that. Written and directed by a same filmmaker. A comedy drama with multiple layers, but all of them follows a single dog, the journey what a dog makes in his lifetime like with the different owners how its fate hangs. So you aren't going to enjoy all the tale, I particularly liked first one and so do the many others. The second half was not up to its counterpart. It started off well and if it had ended the same way, it would have been considered a good one. But it lost the track during the middle, so now it is an average, maybe just below that.

Don't think it is a dog film like those you loved. The dog is the part of the film, but its contributions were rare. It is just a film and enjoy it as one, other than that it is useless to complain on the depiction. It is R rated, and that tells it might not suitable for families. But it carried a very good message on how the dogs were treated in the different classes, in the different society of people and family. For that alone, it is worth a watch, but still lacks appealness. So I won't suggest it, but it is not bad either like many people claiming. All I would say is choose it carefully, don't believe what some were whining about.

When I liked the first movie, I wanted a sequel and now they made one for it that I liked even better than the original. I don't think Ice Cube's solo performance could have pulled the crowd in, the impact was because of the Kevin Hart's presence, he really rocks. He's doing some awesome movies lately, and he's the best sidekick and comedian available for now in Hollywood, just like Simon Pegg in England.

Once again a movie is totally underrated, especially by foul mouthed film critics. Trust me, this film is much better than what they say. If you liked the first, you'll surely going to enjoy it as well. I'm confident the rating will recover in the later days once the regular people rent it. A simple follow-up story, but it was the comedy that lifted this film. The two cops soon-to-be bros-in-law goes to Miami on a job, but the case they're working connects with others, so they join the local force to take down the gang behind it.

Who needs a spoof film for it, the movie mocks its own characters by saying 'a low budget Jackie Chan' for Keng Jeong. Apart from the comedies, the action sequences were very impressive. Olivia Munn was a great addition and I believe she would hangouts here for the next. Yep, I want the third movie and I'm hoping it to be even more stylish kick-ass action-comedy. So just retain the director and writers, after the first two films, I got high hope on them.

7/10 || Not on the same level as the original, unfortunately.

<em>'Ride Along 2'</em> still isn't anything bad or overly boring, it's possibly worth a single viewing, but there is nothing to remember from the 101 minute run time - which does drag at times. The humour is average.

Kevin Hart (Ben) is probably the best performer here, not so closely followed by Ice Cube (James). Ken Jeong (A.J.) has a few mildly amusing jokes at the beginning, though soon turns into a forgettable character. Olivia Munn (Maya) is meh, while Benjamin Bratt (Pope) is a dull villain. There's a good cameo from a <em>'Fast & Furious'</em> actor though.

I like <em>'Ride Along'</em>, though its follow-up is disappointingly uninspiring."

In the latest indie to set itself out as an ‘intelligent’ alternative to the classic formulaic rom-com, “Maggie’s Plan” aims high, makes a strong effort, but sadly fails. It feels like another one of Woody Allen’s more cleverless films, one that has decent enough writing but struggles to elicit any genuine laughs.(This film is written and directed by Rebecca Miller, adapted from the original Karen Rinaldi story).

Everyone’s favorite quirky hipster actress, Greta Gerwig, is perfectly cast at the titular character. Her charming demeanor works and plays well off of Ethan Hawke, who turns in one of his best performances as a professor of ficto-critical anthropology (if you find his title hysterically funny then you, my friend, are the target audience for this movie), and Julianne Moore (as a brilliant yet cold Columbia professor). The cast gives it their all; too bad these actors don’t have a better script to work with.

This messy and uneven film can’t seem to make up its mind regarding the overall tone. It’s part screwball comedy, part hipster philosophy and part family dramedy. There’s a huge emphasis on a toddler (the admittedly cute Ida Rohatyn) that was lost on me as a non-parent. I think the kid stuff is just too much and is completely unnecessary to the story.

Maya Rudolph and Bill Hader are wasted in unremarkable supporting roles; their characters are never developed and seem to exist solely for a few punchlines (that aren’t very funny). There’s only a shell of a plot and not much ever happens in relation to it. The film is just a bunch of talking and a string of cute incidents that are all (sort of) related to Maggie’s big plan. The film is very strained and the big “twist” ending is something that only a true moron couldn’t see coming from a mile away.

**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com**

I didn’t hate this movie but I also can’t figure out who in the world to recommend it to. Maybe it would make a decent rental if you’re a fan of Gerwig or Hawke. || **Returning a product to the previous owner!**

Kind of a refreshing romance-drama on the cheating/divorce theme. Written and directed by Rebecca Miller. A great comeback after the six years of gap, but not a masterstroke. The casting was very impressive, particularly it was Greta Gerwig's typical film. I mean, if you enjoy watching her films, then you would do the same for it. On the other hand, her signature performance kind of bored to me. I mean all her film character was kind of easy-go-lucky soft-touch and comedic girl, I want her to try the different roles and genres. Maybe that's the reason many people had turned it down. Ethan Hawke and Julianne Moore were in the decent supporting roles, but everybody shared enough screen to call its their film too and delivered some good lines.

I had a good time with it, because it was better than I anticipated. The story was good and its entire narration they have developed it finely. Unfortunately, it is an R film, otherwise it could have been a film for all. Kind of it reminds us the Woody Allen's style of presentation. Because you know even in the tough times for film characters, they calm and coolly deals it. So that makes it is a stress free film, especially if you just had a bad day, it might help you cool down. But don't expect the loud laughs in the comedy parts, then you should not opt it.

The overall film is worth a watch, but don't believe those who are saying it is too bad. It might be bad for them, though definitely not bad to bash it top to bottom. The critics thumbed it up, and if you welcome decent films, then go for it and decide yourself. The film has lots of good qualities, but this could be the last film of Greta I'll be watching if she does not appear in a distinct role in her next, because like I said I already bored of her in the same old. Finally, I feel I want to suggest it, but not to everybody, particularly not the youngster, the grown ups might like it better.

With the help of a rebellious and charismatic coach, Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making an improbable and historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.","Win or lose, always aim high.","Comedy, Drama, History, Adventure",106.0,2016-02-25,en,7.169,2174.0,3.8251,"Taron Egerton, Hugh Jackman, Christopher Walken, Ania Sowinski, Mads Sjøgård Pettersen",Dexter Fletcher,"underdog, sports, olympic games, mountain, ski jump, biography, based on true story, britain, snow skiing, 1980s, dedication, inspirational, adoring, joyful","> Keep dreaming brings nothing, need to go out and try to make it happen!

The posters, teasers did not impress me at all. The thought the film going to be a flop. Surprisingly the film was much better than I anticipation. This is a biographical-sport film and very inspiring. The story of a British boy in the early 70s who dreamt to be an Olympian, but the problem is he has not found his sports. By the time in his 20s, he finally finds his interest and gives his best to make his long pending wish to come true. The remaining narration reveals his journey to the world's one of the big events where he aims to soar like an eagle.

Hugh Jackman was not any terrific, he was awesome like usual, but in a supporting role. I think Taron Egerton will be the next British sensation. This film worth seeing for his phenomenal act. The real Eddie too appreciated that. The whole film revolved around these two characters and I think making it a comedy worked out so well. Nicely shot film in the beautiful places, especially those risky ski jump stunts were excellent and the direction was undoubtedly the best.

This film is not particularly about the sport, it is about one showing his passion towards his undertaking. Eddie can be seen as a role model, no matter what he achieved, his fighting spirit is motivating. I think the youngsters should watch it, especially those who are after their dreams. Not just sport persons, but any field persons. I don't know about the repeat viewing, but watching once is enough for the confidence uplift. One of the must see film of the 2016.

8/10 || Rarely can the Olympic mantra of Baron Pierre de Coubertin have been better exemplified than by this ski jumper. Now us Brits have a tough enough time at the Winter Olympic Games at the best of times, so the fact that this slightly geeky, bespectacled, young man alighted on ski jumping is even more bizarre. You'd have had to side with his somewhat sceptical dad (Keith Allen). He's not to be deterred, though, and so he heads somewhere snowy (Garmisch) and luckily befriends a local hotel owner who lets him work his passage, so to speak. By his own admission, he's pretty hopeless - barely managing to stay erect after a jump of little more than 30m, but a chance encounter with Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) provides the most unlikely of conduits to his improvement and eventual qualification for the Olympiad in Calgary in 1988. I remember the huge spike of interest in his death-defying efforts as the legendary Matti Nykänen (Edvin Endre) regularly and consistently jumped twice his distance but yet Eddie still persevered. It was very much a case of the taking part not the winning and Taron Egerton really does imbue his character with a determination, tempered with just a little eccentricity, that delivers a comedic drama that I think is peculiarly British. The unimpressed suits at the BOA are perfectly summed up by Mark Benton, there's the vaguest hint of romance and a scene in a sauna that could probably only be pulled off by Rune Temte. Like the man himself, it's a little slow off the mark, but once it gets going it's one enjoyably paced and humorously written tale of a man who did manage to capture the heart of a nation despite the fact that a medal was never, ever, on the cards."

If you say it is the worst film of the year, I won't deny that. There are more substandard films than this, but having a big name like Keanu Reeves, it is a great disappointment. It was written and directed by an inexperienced filmmaker. That was a big challenge the production house has taken, and in the end it's a failed attempt. But that was not the actual reason for the disaster.

Maybe the director's cut would have been better than this version. Because the actual film was a bilingual drama that reminds us classic cult films. But the production house decided to turn it into a money generating product. Due to that plan-B it went through the lots of cuts to turn it into a single story. In the end the 'lost in translation' happened. So that's answers why it was credited under a false director's name.

It is hard to give an opinion on the story, because it's a confusing narration due to imbalance in the genres which is originally meant for two different stories. The twist was taken straight out of another film, so that makes the conclusion was very silly. First of all, Keanu Reeves' character was next to nothing. I don't understand how he ended up in this project. If his side story was chopped off, it would have made a decent short film and vice versa. I am sure, 8 out of 10 would feel a letdown and the remaining 2 might like it or maybe fall into a confused state.

I just want to review it as a film, so my take on this is pure based on the entertainment and technical aspect, not historical or the religious stuff.

The story was not bad, which is set in the Israel 33AD where a Roman man tells his story what he just went through. So the flashback begins, just like an unofficial sequel to 'The Passion of the Christ', the story continues after the crucifiction of Yeshua.

Sealed the tomb with the roman mark and guarded it by an armed force, the body of Yeshua goes missing. With the widespread speculation going around and the order from a higher authority, the Roman soldiers led by Clavius attempts to locate the body by following the hints. So the rest of the story is racing against the time where many unexpected and strange events follows.

It was a perfect setting for a tale like this. The characters were good, but in the end it certainly questions their actions based in what purpose. It was told from a Roman perspective and his transformation to what he ultimately believes.

The details were good while depicting the events. A simple narration with not so fancy stunts and others tricks, yet somewhere it loses its realistic approach to the supernatural thing.

Since they did not mention anything related to the real account, it is fairly debatable yet not worth debating seriously. Because different people have different opinion regarding religious, historical and entertainment angle. But absolutely this film is target every one of them.

This kind of films is worth watching, because each writer, filmmaker gives us a different take on the person who is behind the world's largest faith. So 'liked it' or 'didn't like' should come after the view. Though it was a quite enjoyable film.

6/10 || **A film with qualities and realism, and which deserves to be revisited.**

Jesus Christ is the figure to which cinema has given the most attention throughout history. We may or may not be believers, but Jesus is certainly the person with the greatest impact in the history of humanity. There is no one who does not know Him or who does not know how to quote something that was said by Him, or who does not know His face (or rather, the way in which we, Europeans, began to portray Him, ignoring any resemblance to the real Jesus). This film followed the famous “Passion of the Christ”, it is a non-canonical sequel, so to speak. Unsurprisingly, it focuses on the events surrounding the resurrection, and follows the Roman tribune whom Pilate commissions to investigate these reports and eventually recover the missing corpse.

Obviously, this film is not aimed at atheist or non-Christian audiences, as it assumes the resurrection is certain, which confirms the divinity of Jesus and fulfills all the prophecies surrounding the messiah awaited by the Jewish people. However, despite a subtle aroma of implicit religious proselytism, I don't consider it to be a painful film for the most moderate of atheists. The narrative follows “a pari passu” the Acts of the Apostles, which tells the story of these moments between the crucifixion and the ascension of the resurrected Jesus to Heaven, in body and spirit. Being well versed in the text and a devout Catholic, I am reasonably pleased with the adaptation, which tells everything from the perspective of the Romans rather than the Christians.

For a biblical film, it's surprisingly low-key. For some years now, biblical-themed films seem to have abandoned any epic pretensions, so we don't have great effects and million-dollar productions. Director Kevin Reynolds sought to achieve the greatest realism, and a portrayal that felt authentic and historically accurate. I praise this effort and recognize that, in this field, the film has merits. Even the figure of Jesus appears to us devoid of any obvious sanctity for most of the time, and it is the attitude of His followers that most betrays His impact and status. The sets and costumes are very good, they don't look cheap or exaggerated, and the use of filming in authentic locations, in Spain and Malta, increases authenticity. At points where a greater number of doubts arise (for example, the exact way in which Jesus was crucified), the film seeks to follow a portrait that is realistic and respects the official canon.

Joseph Fiennes did a very satisfactory job as a Roman tribune. The actor has a dose of charm that accentuates his protagonism and leads us to follow him in his search. Alongside him, Tom Felton gives us welcome support and Peter Firth doesn't disappoint us in the role of the infamous governor Pilate, trying to turn the character into a bored bureaucrat, who seeks to carry out his mission in a particularly thorny corner of the Empire. Cliff Curtis is a peaceful, serene, charismatic and magnetic Jesus, but particularly human and tangible. Antonio Gil, Maria Botto and Stewart Scudamore make a positive contribution as some of the foundational figures of Christianity.

Surprisingly, the film did not succeed in the long term: it was a moderate success both at the box office and in physical release, and received reasonably positive reviews..., but being a 2016 film, it is surprising that it did not have any visibility in Europe and is, actually, virtually unknown to the European public. I think that, without being memorable, it still has qualities that justify a recap today."

The title reveals everything, but still you must watch this to know how everything going to take place. Life on earth is meant for survival of the fittest, but the human evolution changed that idea and again, what happen when the rules we are used to have changed back to the original? This is a post apocalyptic theme set in somewhere in the Britain and revolves around three people who are fighting for their survival, everyday.

The feature film debut for the director, who also managed the screenplay quite superbly. You can find many similar films, but everyone of those has its own story with the backdrop of various threats and other issues to deal. Also, when the circumstances differ, the following events take a different lead. Thus giving the viewers a new perspective and entertainment.

This is nothing like those I had seen. It was too rough and tough in revealing stuffs to the facts of its state of condition. I mean the humans have lost the trust between one another. You might say that is common in all the post-apocalyptic films, but this is very good at details. A silent film, like background score was almost zero, so the appeal was stronger in every those thrill scenes like it was real or some kind of a documentary film.

A man is living alone in the middle of the forest, grows his own vegetables and always be an extra careful from any outside threat. Then one day a woman and her daughter comes looking for food to trade with their valuables. The deal does not go well between them, but somehow they all manage to gain trust and start to live together. Obviously there's always an issue of food shortage, so how they are going to handle and followed by many other troubles brings an end to the tale.

> ""The only thing I have caught in there walked on two legs.""

A minimal cast film with less dialogues, but totally a visual storyteller. I liked the film, but not my favourite, just a fine thriller. The actors are not very popular, but still they are familiar faces and I liked the film because of them. Critically acclaimed and well received by movie goers, but the common people who are vital for the commercial success let it down. It was nominated for the BAFTA awards in the newcomer writer/director category, but did not win.

The film's main plot is the food. The human population grown so fast during entering the twenty first century and again fallen rapidly due to the shortage of food which is obviously directly affected by pollution and other issues. So the theme was right, but not everybody gets that message. Because most of who watch it expects entertainment and nothing else. I hope that would not be your excuse to ignore it.

The film was shot in Northern Ireland, in a couple of places and its surroundings. It is slow, but steady in what it wanted to tell us. It's not a question about how familiar the theme is, but how different and obviously how different people tackle such situations is what this film focused to tell us pretty dramatic way. 

When I say the poster, I thought it was like a native American or south American's story. Mainly because of the haircut that gave the impression like that I saw from other films. The synopsis gave a different perspective, so I found it more interesting than before. Then I watched, with a low expectation after knowing it was not received well. But I surprised and come to know this is not a bad film as they have said. In fact a very interesting perspective on how these three people struggle with what they have got in front of them. I am not saying it's a must see, but definitely not the worst, so I suggest you to do small research if you are confused to try this title. If you ask me, I would say just go for it.

One might want to upchuck at this mindless ragtag romp that desperately tries too hard to reel in the obnoxious chuckles. Undoubtedly toothless, unimaginative, and aimlessly insipid the degenerative **Dirty Grandpa** has all the cheeky charm and hilarity as a waxy floor in an arthritic nursing home patient's dim lit room.

Naturally, the questionable punchline to this foolish and crass joke-of-a-movie is why a prestigious performer of Oscar-winner Robert DeNiro's caliber doing such silly and offensive sludge as the flatulent farce **Dirty Grandpa** in the first place? Sure, DeNiro has done his share of hit-and-miss comedies in his career as well as some dramas that were lackluster and forgettable. It is true...even the great cinematic icons can gravitate to the usual duds from time to time. However, watching the intense and revered seventy-something veteran DeNiro wallow in this madcap mess is utterly inexcusable. What even possessed DeNiro to appear in such a diaper rash of a juvenile comedy? Did he lose a bet or was challenged to a dare of some awful kind?

As for DeNiro's co-star in ex-Disney Channel dreamboat star Zac Efron one can not be hardly surprised that the big screen boytoy as popped up in this train wreck of a treat seeing as though Efron's past film choices have not been what one might call consistently stellar in his film career thus far. Let's face it...**Dirty Grandpa** was begging for a tongue-lashing and rightfully so. Unless you are an uncontrollable hormonal teen with a locker room mentality attached to your blank psyche then one might find the witless **Dirty Grandpa** a bombastic bore that could not clean up its noxious act even if it ran through several durable car washes.  

Screenwriter John Phillips wants to present DeNiro's crusty curmudgeon Dick Kelly as a walking wrecking ball with no filter whatsoever. In fact, DeNiro's Dick Kelly is a tragic figure that could be misunderstood by some and mistrusted by others. It appears that Dick Kelly is the cursed clown with the wounded soul--no doubt Phillips's ridiculed target for the inside satirical look at aging hardcore has-beens that rail against a world they no longer recognize and allowed to pass them by in the process. **Dirty Grandpa** could have been a dark and impish commentary on maturing quiet rage with snarling senior citizen Dick Kelly's ignorance serving as a red button for panic. Unfortunately for the throwaway **Dirty Grampa** it is not clever or calculating enough to realize its potential as a subversive chuckler while simple resting its guffaws on cheap-minded edgy banality. 

In a nutshell, recent widower Dick Kelly wants to unwind in the aftermath of his wife's passing and head down to Florida where he and his late beloved bride spent their treasured days near their summer home. This means enlisting the assistance of his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to accompany him to the Sunshine State so that Dick can get loose and wild. 

Dick, a retired military man, is not a Golden-Aged Boy Scout by any means. He is indeed a Dirty Grandpa based on his persona as a bombastic bastard of a character. Dick is a proud-minded racist, misogynist and homophobe...and these are his good qualities! Dick is indignant as he incredulously wonders why he cannot utter the N-word and does not miss a beat when drooling over the bouncy babes that could easily pass for his granddaughters. And Dick has his ""gaydar"" gander up when confronted with ""swishy guys"" in his presence. Also, there is no shame whenever Dick feels free to...um, pleasure himself regardless of whether Jason is in the vicinity or not. Dick, to say the least, is a tool in the worst way. 

Naturally, **Dirty Grandpa** eagerly wants to throw into the sordid mix other wacked-out characterizations to add to the clumsy raunchfest. Both Mazer and Phillips get their junk food jollies in presenting supporting players that gleefully reinforce all the staged nuttiness at hand. There is a curious slutty siren (Aubrey Plaza from TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") that wants to ""do the naughty"" with Dick to satisfy her fetish for pleasuring old geezers. And then there is Jason's galpal (Julianne Hough) that seriously needs a stick removed from her no-nonsense butt before she ties the knot. Of course this dumb display tosses a couple of collegiate cut-ups (Michael Hudson and Jake Picking) and Jason's cousin Nick (Adam Pally)--a disabled ""Dick"" wannabe.

So **Dirty Grandpa** marches to its wacky beat without realizing how much of a Grade-A stinker this insufferable session of comatose comedy this shoddy showcase really is at heart? Breezy bathroom-related humor, recycled masturbation giggles, bubbly bimbos and slap-happy drug use high-jinks--all befitting whatever odious overtones this needless and fetid funny fable managed to pull off.

For DeNiro and company **Dirty Grandpa** may have been a quick and profitable payday but for the rest of us the payoff was mere chump change.

(c) Frank Ochieng || > The usual, nothing innovative about it!

Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. This should have been one of the best comedies of the year, but now it belongs to one of the worst. I recommend 'Grandma' instead this which I felt a much better comedy.

At this age, Robert De Niro was unbelievably awesome, though his character needed a good support from another and that's where as usual Zac failed to deliver his part. I would have preferred someone like Taylor Lautner who's desperate for a breakthrough than the Zac who ruins always.

The screenplay was from the 'blacklist', knowing this they should have been more careful while casting for it. The story was okay, because it was not meant for one of the greatest films of all time. It was sort of a weekend getaway or the bachelor party theme, but the film gives its original reason and then those developed plots were too familiar if you have seen plenty of teen films, in the party theme.

It's supposed to make us laugh, but there are lots of outdated humours tried in the unusual route to narrate them. The grandfather-grandson combo was an excellent idea, the main plot revolves around them and it should have remained that way, but the undetermined romance was an interruption. Or they should have developed a decent romance track for a better balance in the genre.

At least it would have been all right if it was a teen film. Many of those who appeared in it were actually too old to represent the roles given to them. That's fine too, because films are fake, everything is make-up and performance, but none were at their best except De Niro and Aubrey Plaza. It is definitely a film to skip, that's my opinion, but they're a few who are defending it, so be careful that I'm not always right and they're not always wrong if you want to choose it.

A disaster drama-thriller based on the true account of the 1952. So much better film than I anticipated. But there are a few things I did not like; like the frequent pauses in the narration where nothing really happens other that space given for the emotional background score to pull the viewers in. In a result, it did not work, definitely not for me. Yeah, in the many important scenes, it froze like it happens in the chess games before anybody move their pawn.

In the crucial part of the narration, when the boat was overcrowded, there was an unnecessary pause which annoyed me. It was surely a remarkable segment of the story, but sentimentally failed to appeal or maybe you can call it a too much of the sentiment. Honestly, I liked the story, but the film exceeded its runtime to slow down the portrayal of the event which is surely a drawback than any kind of benefit.

I loved the performances, everybody was good and so the CGI, which was not a top notch yet acceptable. Especially as it takes place in the dark time, they had the advantage to depict the atmosphere as much as close to how it would have looked 65 years ago and as well to avoid the errors.

I never saw its trailer or the teaser, but I knew about this project and after seeing its posters I though it would be about the offshore oil rig. When I saw the film, I realised I was wrong and surprise do such thing happen in real.

The film was also did not let my interest fall. Thanks to the director who always try different genre yet he's not a mega budget filmmaker. A good film, but like I said should have been even better. Especially should have out classed in the sentimental segments. I don't know how good was the digital 3D version of it, but still this regular version is worth to give it a shot.

7½/10 || First and foremost this film reminds me of Hacksaw Ridge, second and no less important it's just as good as the afore mentioned film in the sense that the main character is just as law-bound as the religious lad in Hacksaw going about his day saving people's lives in the middle of a hurricane, ergo in The Finest Hour's case while on sea - with a life-guard boat, just as feature-some as the soldier saving soldiers in the middle of a war without shooting a f#cking gun!

And, supposedly, this happened in real life! #OhLordy that was a good watch. || Good. Nothing more than that, but nothing less either.

<em>'The Finest Hours'</em> is a little bit too on the nose in parts, I felt like some of the cast were overacting here and there - especially Casey Affleck (Ray), not that he is bad though. Chris Pine is enjoyable in the lead role. Pacing is iffy, but the effects are excellent - from the ships to the water scenes, impressive! The (true) story, meanwhile, is as hearty as you'd expect.

Worth watching."

I like this director, but this is not his best work. I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.

At least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.

I had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.

Well composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.

6/10 || The illegitimate child of _Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen_ and _Marvel's Thor_. One that probably should have been aborted.

I could see _Gods of Egypt_ working in the ""dumb fun"" kind of way, if it hadn't been so bloated and overly long. As it stands, it has some very neat design choices... And that's it. That's all it has going for it. Not a single actor seems to care that they're in this movie, the digital effects are hit and miss at best, and the story is sillier than it had to be, yet not as entertaining as it could have been.

But yes. Some great designs.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Fantasy is very difficult to get right in films.  Audience resistance is quite high, especially when it involves characters with difficult-to-remember names or diverse place names.   Relating to a fantasy world of beasts and magic is often tricky for audiences who may prefer grounded, realistic drama.  There are exceptions though – the worlds of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings captured public imaginations and the complex mass of stories and themes in Game of Thrones also attracted an audience.
This fear of fantasy seems to have informed a slightly tentative approach in the writing and direction of Gods of Egypt.  There are plenty of fantastic creatures present ranging from giant, vicious snake like creatures to Minotaurs in all but name, and an array of Egyptian gods.  However, there has been avoidance of any of the cod Shakespearean dialogue that often permeates works of this type and an emphasis more upon realistic dialogue.  This creates a needless tension between the intensity of the innovative visuals and the prosaic words dropping from the actors, a tension that is never resolved as the linear story progresses forwards but never upwards.
The pleasures with this film arise mostly from the intensity of the visual experience.  Every environment has been precisely designed, full of colour and dimension, looking very different from the landscapes seen in past films based on myth and history.  The benefit of this is that there is always something to attract the eye, from great sky barges to rainbow lit waterfalls and massive monuments.  Like all Alex Proyas’ films the visual ideas add weight and substance that the scripting sometimes fails to.
It is however that narrative which brings the film down with a series of very deliberate events extrapolated in excessive detail, burdened by actors who at times look deathly uncomfortable in their roles.  Only Geoffrey Rush, in a small but notable part, really excels with so many of the others not able to bring life to the dialogue as they intone in front of ever present green screens.
In the end it is a pity that such a wonderfully conceived world at the visual level could not have been combined with a compelling story and acting."

Ciro Guerra es smart to use black and white and the landscapes of the Amazonas to fill all the silences of the movie.

The cast is quite good, specially the 2 actors performing Karamakate; Nibio Torres and Antonio Bolivar. || > In any world, the history keeps repeating itself.

It is one of the last films to I watch from the 2016 Oscars nominees. It was a Colombian production that represented the country in the 88th American Academy Awards. It had all the qualities to win that major international award, but lost the bet to 'Son of Saul'. In my perspective, after seeing all the five, no doubt, but this film's the real winner. The film was loosely based on the real occurrence that was written in the diaries of two scientists on their expedition into the Amazon's deep in search of something what intrigued the conflict between the two worlds.

It portrayed the beautiful Amazon in the black and white pictures and I loved it because, it recreated the world that was over 100 years ago. It would have not affected the viewers same if it was rendered in colour. It is awesome to see a film like this about the Amazon people after a very long time. Because prior to the 80s and 90s, there were plenty of African and South American exploration films made which rapidly reduced its number when comic book films became the frontrunner in the world cinema. So going back to the lost world was really an amazing experience that this film had given to me and you should not miss it as well.

It takes place in the first half of the 1900s that breaks into a two part narration. In the first, where a German scientist Theo, looks for a help from the last surviving young man from his tribe, Karamakate, to explore the jungle for the scientific research. In the second, 40 years later, an American scientist, Evans follows a similar kind of quest who once again seeks help from the aged Karamakate. When Karamakate realises their agenda, concerns for the peace and stability in the region, so goes for the measure that has to be taken.

> ""Ants like money. I do not. The taste is bad.""

It was like lost in translation. During the invasion of the remaining parts of the South America in the Amazon basin on the Colombian side, how the both worlds suffered was the part of this narration and cultural collision was one of the main topics. Most of the film was shot alongside of the rivers Inirida and Varupes, especially the final scene location was so beautiful. The film concept was similar to the 'Anaconda 2', but there's no intense action-thriller, especially there's no fast and aggressive serpents in the act. The scientists are looking for a certain kind of plant which is considered sacred and protected by the Amazon tribes.

It was boring in the initial parts, because I did not know what to expect. So I just kept watching as whatever it was focused on. But during the end of the first act, I started to like it. Because it was not as complicated as I thought and it was not the art film like those without the plot and background score. So at the end of my watch, I'm very satisfied. The actors were stunning as the amazing Amazon basin is. Of them all, the 'Borgman' actor was the only familiar face to me.

It is a powerful film, with a bit of a documentary style presentation. The main theme was about the history repeating itself. In your lifetime if it repeats means a second chance to divert it from the possible future nuisance. So how the one who cares would reach and solve it is what this film was told. The film characters were brilliant and Karamakate will be remembered. A neatly narrated tale that will remain people's favourite for a very long. One of the films of the 2015 and of the Oscars nominees that nobody must miss it.

You know, the movies that you know are bad but you like them anyway. This one is actually, well, good.

It's a legit good film and that is odd for Hopkins.

Anyway, the failing is the Nazi thing. The discrimination in America plays, because that was really the principal challenge that Owens needed to overcome to even make it to the Olympics in the first place. That was a struggle in and of itself.

But, when it came to Germany it should have been more of a focus on him, and how he beat the ""master race"" and, instead, it was a little too focused on the Nazis. And, honestly, everyone knows who the Nazis are and what they did. We aren't watching the movie because of that, we are watching the movie because of what Owens did.

However, despite that, the movie works with a strong opening act that dealt in an albeit heavy-handed but still absolutely dramatically compelling story about Owens. The only fault is that it loses focus in Germany."

Initially it was called 'The Cellar', but later it became spin-off to 'Cloverfield'. It was a regular type screen narration, unlike the first film as a found footage style. But if you the original film fan, especially monster film fan, you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a psychological-thriller-mystery than the sci-fi-action-adventure.

Only the final act determines where and how it actually connects to the Cloverfield universe, yet not very evident other than the clue the title had given and the filmmakers insisted that is indeed from the same franchise. Because I felt, it was very close to other alien invasion films like 'Skyline' and 'Battle LA' or even the latest 'The 5th Wave' than the 'Cloverfield'.

I surely enjoyed this film, like an another crazy bunker hideout theme and something which is quite similar to the recent 'Room'. Since they have revealed its association with the 'Cloverfield', I expected different kind which was actually insanely misled everybody. If there won't be a sequel, then the link between the two films are unnecessary, so I'm waiting for that. But still a very good film without those mix-ups. And I recommend you all to consider it as a one-off film in order to have a great watching experience.

Another limited cast film with barely a four characters in it and shot in a single location that cost just $15m, but earned in multiple folds. All the credit goes to the marketing tactics to tie it up with the 2008 blockbuster. It would have also done great independently, in the end everybody, including fans and filmmakers are happy for what it is now.

The suspense was so good, but it was carried out for too long. The third act picked up its pace like hell which was obviously anticipated since 'Cloverfield' hooked to it. When everybody was thinking of monsters, it is going to delivers differently and that's how the film fairs.

7.5/10 || Though I tend to go for older science fiction, and, on top of that, from proven directors, two things sold this for me (and I ALMOST ended up seeing this at theatres as a result): John Goodman and J.J. Abrams--the first being solid in everything he does and the second with the Midas touch, especially when it comes to my favourite of genres. I really admired its originality. The cloying nature of the antagonist, the ambiguity of the unique situation and the way everything was tied together quite neatly left me both very satisfied as a cinephile and yearning for hopefully its inevitable sequel. || People are strange creatures. You can't always convince them that safety is in their best interest.

10 Cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and collectively written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. It stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Music is by Bear McCreary and cinematography by Jeff Cutter.

Michelle (Winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...

From the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. For the rewards are plenty. Trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards Howard (Goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? If anything? This only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.

A key strength of it, is that it, via Michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. On the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, Emmett (Gallagher Jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. But of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. Which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...

Superbly acted by the three principals (it's great that some film makers still realise Goodman is a major talent), and technically impressive for sound and vision, this coiled spring thriller is a winner. 8.5/10"

The first film was a decent entertainer, I kind of liked that and a box office hit as well. So the producers saw an opportunity to bring another film and yep, this film did slightly better than the original, but the product was qualityless. The graphics were just okay, but overall very poor in those blow-up scenes which were the most essential for a theme like this.

Not all, though some of the action sequences were terrible and the story was very weak. In fact, there's no story, the whole film was an action- thriller just like the previous film. But that's how this theme revolves, yet as a one, it is a bit disappointing follow-up without surprises. Anyway, I'm with the original film director who backed out of the project for giving him a bad script to direct.

So the London is the latest victim of the plot for the US president's assassination. Particularly this 2nd part looked so much more alike a computer game than actors who are exhibiting their roles. Like the London is a battlefield and level after level the story making its progress till the game over, but we know who wins in the end. I don't know whose performance was much better, because I did not find anyone with par to appreciate.

What this film did at the box office was a miracle, so I don't think the filmmakers go for another script anytime soon. But if they do, I'm wondering which capitol would be the next victim of a terror attack. Expecting Tokyo or Canberra, especially Mumbai would be an ideal location. This is not a bad film, you can try it once, but watching it like sitting next to who's with xbox joystick.

6/10 || _If Olympus Has Fallen_ wasn't big enough and dumb enough for you, try _London Has Fallen_!

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **Real name of this film: How to insult half the allied countries in the name of one's own ego.**

Occasionally, American cinema seems to need an injection of idiotic nationalism. “Olympus Has Fallen” did that, but there are still some technical and entertaining qualities there. This film fails to do the same, besides treating other countries (especially the British) like morons. And so, Americans continue to think they are the greatest nation in the world and to compete with others like teenagers measuring their… you get the point.

The film is a sequel to “Olympus” and shows how the American president will escape by a hair (it can't even be considered a spoiler to say this, because the plot is so cliché that we already know more or less what will happen here in the act in which we decided to see the film!) to a terrorist attack which, in fact, is more like an act of war. Yes, a terrorist decides to send an army to kill Western prime ministers and presidents who gather in London for a state funeral and all the police and security agencies in the West were asleep and didn't see them. As expected, God saves the Queen and the entire Windsor family, who are not even targeted by the attacks and continue to have their tea in Buckingham without appearing in the film. On the other hand (or maybe a bonus?) the British still have the unusual pleasure of seeing the French president become food for fish in the River Thames... but, judging by the continued protests in France for a few years until now, perhaps the French are not mourning their loss...

I know I'm being deeply sarcastic, but there's no other way to watch this movie without feeling deeply insulted. The way the film places the USA as the greatest thing in the world and belittles allied countries, (but) direct competitors in defense and economy (Canada, Germany, UK, France, Japan, Italy etc.) makes us want to watch the US committing failure after failure which, in real life, ends up happening. Seeing all the international leaders casually strolling and dating when, in real life, they would be surrounded by security guards on their way to the ceremony is a very incorrect idea of how these events are organised. But it's wrong to expect a movie like this to care about things as silly and puerile as that thing called verisimilitude. When you have tons of action and a world-renowned city being blown up like a village in Syria or Afghanistan, what does it matter if all that stuff is credible? There might even be Mickey Mouse there with a machine gun! Who cares?

As for the cast… what can we say? We can say that, certainly, the fee was good, and that the film did wonders to the bank balance of the actors, in particular Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler, who did not have to make any effort to play the characters and who are here for the money. And if we take into account that Freeman is the most outstanding actor, and even he is far from revealing the enormous talent that we know he has, that says a lot about the overall performance of the cast, doesn't it?

The film tries everything to entertain, but fails. The weakness of the dialogues and the meager attempts to introduce humor would have deserved a punch in the face of the screenwriter who wrote them, who must have thought that we, the audience, don't have a brain. The action scenes are noisy, with the Americans running around London like a bunch of cowboys shooting and blowing things up, but the special effects and CGI are extraordinarily weak. Editing is another problem: unlike the previous film, which practically threw us into the middle of the action without much foreplay, this film drags on in the introduction without it being very necessary. What do we care if the Canadian PM's daughter fails her driving test, or if the German Chancellor likes men in uniform? And if Freeman's character is so fond of fishing, after this film he can go to New Bedford, Massachusetts, and choose the biggest boat he can find there."

Smart plot with a great background topic talking about the differences, stereotypes, prejudices and joining the tendency of giving women more important roles.

It has still several gaps to fill and enhance on the latest point but it is, IMHO, a milestone in the right direction.

The characters work pretty well and it is funny when needed and not too full of cheesy songs. || > Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.

This beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.

Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.

All kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.

So the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.

These days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.

The Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.

8/10 || Zootopia is the latest family animation movie from Disney about a young bunny determined to be a cop at all costs  – in a land where only 'predators' are cops, she would be the first ‘prey’ cop. Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.

Zootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy’s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.

The animation is as good as a Pixar animation – perfectly made  – and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. 

The best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba. His performance should earn him an Oscar this year! No wonder it has grossed 1 Billion dollars worldwide despite little marketing.

The first impression was the reaction to the title abbreviation, and then I thought I saw Jody Foster on the poster, but surprised to find Tina Fey in the trailer. It is a great war-drama, filled with lots of fun and hard to believe it is a biography. This should be the best film for these directors till date. Amazing cast, but Tina Fey totally cracked it. This is one of the best films of the 2016.

I have seen many Afghan war based films, but not quite fun as this one. It gives you a completely different take on the war torn Afghan. It was the story of an American journalist Kim, who was sent to their for the latest coverage. At first she struggles with the new place, then makes a few friends and finds comfortable despite security threat. The rest of the film reveals how her life, as well as career transforms with the experience of working in the dangerous environment.

Apart from starring in it, Tina Fey produced it and this is her best film in the recent years. The first half was wonderful, then during in the middle I felt it lost its track, but it came back strongly to end. This tale focused mainly on the living-style of the reports in the hostile place, besides their tough jobs. The battle scenes were minimised and highlighted the journalism. So don't expect it to be another 'A Thousands Times Good Night', it is refreshing though. It is a well worth, so don't miss it!

One one level, it's a straight-forward action/thriller with a unique and interesting setting. Heroes and antiheroes pervade as we are plunged into what is for most of us a new experience and reality. Of course, one that is fully fictionalized. If you can get the emotional distance to view it as such, the film works fairly well, even though it follows a fairly predictable narrative arc that we have seen in many other contexts. (Boy meets cat, boy saves cat, boy better save cat again and again and again, etc.)

On another level this film serves as a none-too-subtle political and terse philosophical commentary about current disagreements within the United States of America and her southern bordering nation. In this aspect the film uses all the finesse of a sledgehammer meeting a mosquito, with thinly developed two-dimensional characters that later on still seem to betray themselves far too quickly. In this aspect the film seems to fail in changing minds (if expected to engage the ""other"") or succeed in reinforcing biases (if expected to create our oh-so-delightful echo chambers).

I can imagine this film really working well in a different time and place, but in our current historical context--for which it was undoubtedly developed and funded--it just doesn't work all that well.

My advice: watch if you can lay down your ideologies, sink into the experience and enjoy it as an action/thriller. If you can't do that you will likely find yourselves aggravated by the experience no matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum.  (3/5)"

I thought it might be a spin off to 'The Man from UNCLE', but it wasn't. From the action-thriller director known for 'Transporter' films and this is his first comedy, yet it has some great stunts. It is about the two brothers who meets after a lot time separation. Now they're two opposite kinds, professionally and socially. So coming together means trouble is inevitable wherever they go in the world. Against all the odds how they accomplish their task that forced them to do it is the rest of the film.

If you like Sacha's trademark comedies, you might like it as well. Like always his part was excellent in this, especially jokes were very hilarious. Though the story was weak, but the rest of the film was not bad. The overall film leaned on its comedies and that's how the narration somewhat successfully carried out till the end. An enjoyable film, but you might hesitate to rate higher, because this is not the best film of the year, definitely not for me, I've seen a lot better ones.

Besides, Mark Strong was amazing. He was always been a co-star, but here he's equal to Sacha and he did some good stunts as well. I think the film is passable, because it is one of the recent decent comedy. I can suggest it for those who're seeking some laughs. It might won't bring the loud ones, but surely will raise your cheeks. The film is for adults for the R rated jokes, there are some unexpected scenes that I was surprised for them. I enjoyed it and I'm sure I won't remember it for very long, that kind of film it is.

6.5/10 || There are some (emphasis on 'some') good moments in _Grimsby_. I sniggered twice (and would have a third time if that moment hadn't already been in the trailer) and there are a couple of surprisingly solid action sequences, primarily the ones with Mark Strong helming them.

That said, I still didn't like the movie. It's oft lazy and the quote unquote ""humour"" is almost entirely of the gross-out variety. It's like ""HEY LOOK A DICK! HEY LOOK SOME POOP! FUCK YOU GIVE US YOUR MONEY!"".

Must admit, I've never seen a ""football hooligan/espionage/action-thriller/adult-comedy/family drama"" before though.

On the one hand, the feature length format allows us to develop more the Perry/Croft characters, on the other it removes some of the quickly-paced potency of the humour... Either way, though, it's still an hugely enjoyable watch that reconciles great sitcom writing from these two literal geniuses with a cast and scenario that delivers potent reminders of just how those ""left on the shelf"" determined to make a valuable contribution to the protection of their country against the Nazi scourge. It has the same cast as the television series, and depicts the formation of their unit under the command of nitwit ""Capt. Mainwaring"" (Arthur Lowe). The film has a more comically militaristic theme to it - they drill, eventually with firearms (not a great idea in their gas-powered, converted, butcher's van!) before they find themselves engaged in manoeuvres under the watchful eye of the slightly bumptious ""Gen. Fullard"" (Bernard Arched). Of course, just about everything goes wrong - but the humour is genuinely funny; the dialogue subtly enhances what we can not only see, but frequently anticipate - and that adds bundles to the enjoyment of this. Again, it swipes at the pomposity of the upper classes, the aspiration of a newly establishing middle class and of the industriousness of the chancer - expertly epitomised by ""Hodges"" - part time warden/greengrocer and black-marketeer ""Pte.

All five sequences take place in a nondescript desert town and call upon one's own fear to set the scene. As the story progresses, you see how each story leads into the next with connections that are tangential yet produce the notion that the setting for the stories is the source of danger rather than individual and unique experiences of each player. To this effect, the filmmakers do a superb job of capturing the essence of fear as you follow the lives of the players from story to story as the flow one into the next in an semi-seamless flow that keep the movie going. Of particular joy to this reviewer is, as one would assume (at least this viewer), are minimal special effects. The ones that do exist feel so real that you do not realize that they are there without reflection (or rewinding). 

The acting, while not Oscar worthy, is well done. You can feel the fear and terror in their dialogue, their actions as they venture through the tale. Shockingly, gratuitous nudity that is usually prevalent in the horror genre is missing or at least so minimal I do not recall a single scene. There are plenty of moments that will stay with you and are sure to be topics around the water cooler. The 'frights' are memorable enough to make this production worth watching.

The filmmakers remind this reviewer of early thriller producer/director M. Night Shyamalan works with their own twist on storytelling. I recommend renting this feature as it s a must see with potential to be a cult classic in years to come. || Modern Day Southern Gothic Highway-Based is a very specific theme for a Horror Anthology to tackle, and while none of the segments are bad, none of them stand out as particularly good either.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || **The neverending tale(s)!**

Five tales, written and directed by four directors. It was a horror anthology that takes place in just one day and night. Firstly, this film was not bad as it looks. Each tale and its interlocking with one another was very nicely done. The layers are not arranged in a column or a row or a circle. It was just like what you see on the poster, a star. Especially one character from each tale, how they become a victim in another was the highlight. The genre mixing was so good, I mean it was not out and out a horror. Mystery, thriller, crime, all was put together and presented smartly on the screen, particularly the loop was very fascinating.

I have seen some similar kind, but this one was slightly different from those and a better one in some way. Not all the tales were awesome, though there's nothing wrong with them. For every 15 minutes, it keeps developing without giving rest to us and events in the film. So it was a non-stop entertainment, particularly if you like horror, thriller. If you pay close attention, you could find more hidden meanings or messages. So this film can be watched once, but not everyone going to enjoy it. Especially if you are okay with B movie, then there's nothing stops you.

i'm big fan of mr. Donnie yen.
so i like that movie series.
it's a complete Action or Biography movie. || > It gets closer to the legend's personal life.

A few movies about Yip Man were made in the past, but Donnie Yen's 2008 version rewrote the history. Because the craze about martial arts in the last two decades and of course digital world made it to reach every corner of the world. Followed by a sequel and its massive hit, then came many unofficial versions to this series that set in a different timeline of the martial art legend's life.

With this movie, the narration gets lots closer to tell the personal life of Yip Man. But in the first half, like the previous two films, focused on the social issue. Yip Man is fighting for the children's education, when a real estate tycoon plans to replace the school building to a commercial complex. That's it, later the story begins to take us to the random events like a man who's hungry for the best fighter in the town title who end up challenging Yip Man to face him. From there, it's all about Yip Man and his ill wife where the movie switches from action mode to sentimental.

That's not what we expected from a man who's famous for his martial art. Surprisingly, this different approach in storytelling was refreshing. Saving school, the clash for the title and ill wife, so the overall movie was like had three episodes and each dealt on a different motive. Being a biopic and also a martial art movie, it exploited the theme fairly.

I can't say Mike Tyson's acting was so good because it was weird him to speak Cantonese. He was in a minor role, but his presence was a big boost for the movie. If we see him in an action movie, then we all know what to expect and it did not fail to fulfill our wish.

> ""There's nothing more important than the love of those by your side.""

The stunts were not as good as the previous two films and they were too short as well, but technically looked so perfect, especially locking horns between Tyson and Donnie Yen was like head-to-head confrontation between Hollywood and Hong Kong. The other reason to shorten stunts in the movie was to get closer to the legend's personal life. After the survival and fighting the foreign forces, now the time to focus on his own life issues.

The first two films were breathtaking, no one can doubt that. I don't know why it took so long for this third movie, but it still worked. Yet not the best in the trilogy, but remained very close to them with unlike storyline and action sequences. I was disappointed for not continuing from where it ended in the 2nd part. I mean the story has a clean flow, but not what I expected, like, I wanted Bruce Lee and the grand-master coming together.

Actually, I never expected the third installment, I considered it was one of the best duologies you could find in world cinema. But I'm happy they made this one and I'm very much sure there will be fourth. So at least I can expect the Bruce Lee's part in the Yip Man's life story. I was waiting for that from a very long and I believe it won't let me down this time. All the above, I'm looking for the official announcement.

The fourth feature film for the Kiwi director Taika Waititi. I loved all his films except the previous one, despite it was a famous title that the world loved, I'm not. So according to me this is a great comeback after a cheap vampire mockumentary. I was very confident that this would take up the New Zealand's the Oscars slot and then disappointed to find it was not in the initial list released by the Academy. Anyway, it does not need a tag like that, it is really an awesome film for everyone, though the theme has some adult contents in an indirect manner and violence like killing the wild animals. That means still it can be watched by kids with their parents' consent.

Watching it takes you to the location live, so you don't want to end your vacation in the beautiful New Zealand wilderness which feels like untouched. It was nothing like you have seen in 'The Lord of the Rings' that altered with the computer tricks. This is raw and beautiful like the Tasmanian jungle from 'The Hunter'.

This is the story of an orphan boy named Ricky Baker, who is a troublesome. Finally a family from the remote place adopts him where with the initial hiccups, he started to get used to it. But after one of the members dies in his new family, the child service wants him back. This is where it all begins, because he finally found a place where he belongs, but they are trying to take it away from him. So he launches his protest that comes from a mistake which later becomes a national news. What's going to happen to him and the others around him told in the remaining part.

> ""Sometimes in life it seems like there's no way out. Like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves.""

Seems Ricky is obsessed with the films. He always talks about them and compares his actual state of condition to the different films he had seen and admired. Especially about the gangsters, I think that's why he became so rebellious, apart from his struggles in the orphanage. This film was based on the book called 'Wild Pork and Watercress' and I praise the author for creating a character like Ricky. As usual the screenplay by Taika Waititi was amazing. Not without the support from his crew and especially the actors like who played Ricky. So was the Sam Neill in an important role.

First of all it is a fun film, despite whatever they have shown in this like about the feud between the child service and the kid. The film kind of looks like Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' without his signature. Except the initiation, what follows is quite aimless plot. So, not easy to predict the scenes, but somewhat we come to know the ending. It has to conclude either way, like happy or sad ending, or maybe both. But the overall film keeps us in the guessing mode, providing some laughs and thorough good entertainment.

It's really an appealing title and so the equally satisfying film. Especially if you like wild and green landscape, you should not miss it. The story was told in chapters which actually did not require, but those slices were helped to understand each section and its focus. I think it was a direct influence from the original source.

The director is now on a big leap, doing a superhero film in the Hollywood. The third 'Thor' film, that reunites him with Sam Neill for the second consecutive time. I'm waiting for that which is going to be a visual extravaganza. He has done great with smaller films till now, which are mostly the comedies, but what comes is his biggest challenge so far and if he does pull it off successfully, he would be another Kiwi director in the big league after Peter Jackson. Praying to happen that. In the meantime, I recommend you to check this one out.

New Zealand has a long history of quirky movies, and _Hunt for the Wilderpeople_ is a great addition to the fold. Written and directed by Taika Waititi, this 2016 film stars Sam Neill and Julian Dennison. It was a big hit when it came out - off a $2.5M budget, it brought in $23.2M and entertained people all across the world. 

So what’s it all about then? Here’s the description:

_Ricky is a defiant young city kid who finds himself on the run with his cantankerous foster uncle in the wild New Zealand bush. A national manhunt ensues, and the two are forced to put aside their differences and work together to survive._

I love hearing a Kiwi accent on screen, and hearing this and the NZ style humour brought many a smile to my face while watching this. Sam Neill has been a long time favourite of mine, right back from the days of _Reilly, Ace of Spies_. He plays the gruff uncle very well, and really captures the essence of the NZ farmer and bush man.

Likewise, Dennison is hilarious, and for a young kid has excellent comedic timing, which leads to many laugh out loud moments, be they from verbal sparring, or more of a physical nature. He's great, and the chemistry between him and Neill is so good.

Of course, the theme of two people with clashing personalities being thrown together is nothing new, but what makes this stand out as a little different is the NZ twist. Kiwis have a weird sense of humour and Waititi, Neill, Dennison, and all the supporting characters bring this to the fore.

Its a good fun movie that with plenty of laughs, and will be sure to put a smile on your face. || Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

WARNING: Sad dog scene.

Julian Dennison (""Deadpool 2"") and Sam Neill (""Jurassic Park"") give an amazing performance as grumpy unlikeable pair of guys purposely lost in the wilderness.

For an ""foster kid"" trope, this movie really has it all.  I don't appreciate it's attempt to mimic ""Up!"" and that did sour my opinion a bit.  It starts, then waxes and wanes between drama and comedy.

You'll laugh, you'll cry, there is family love, romantic love, plenty of action, and more laughs."

LOUISA SAYS:

What…did I….just watch?

Not for the uninitiated or those with weak stomachs, everyone’s favorite polarizing surrealist director Nicolas Winding Refn is back with the lurid, gory, sadistic, and horrifyingly beautiful “The Neon Demon.” This film makes a bold statement about the shallowness of Hollywood and the fashion industry in the most violent, brutal, bloody and disturbing way possible.

The film’s strength is in its breathtaking visuals. Refn once again establishes himself as a true auteur at the top of the visionary food chain. Even if you are one of the many who see him as pompous and pretentious, there’s no denying that few have quite the mastery of the craft of the visual arts as he does. This film belongs in a modern art museum.

It doesn’t matter that there’s not much of a plot: teenage ingénue Jesse (Elle Fanning) moves to Los Angeles to chase her dreams of becoming a model. She soon finds herself living in a sketchy motel with lecherous landlord Hank (Keanu Reeves) and surrounded by the seductive Ruby (Jena Malone), Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), a pack of shallow, jealous, beauty-obsessed women. It’s hard to evaluate the performances since most consist of nothing more than striking and holding a pose or staring longingly into a mirror, but I do think that Reeves has one of the greatest (if small) roles of his career.

There’s no escaping the true debate this movie presents: is this a shrewd feminist manifesto or is it grossly misogynistic? It’s taken me three days to reflect on this and I’ve decided that it sways towards the former rather than the latter.

First, the film celebrates the female form; the women in the film are beautiful set dressings, designed to be admired (and not treated solely as sexual objects). Yes, the women are one-dimensional but at the same time, that works as a harsh criticism of the narcissism that’s so prevalent in the fashion industry. Refn also artfully expresses the malice that is sometimes deeply hidden in the female psyche. The film is insightful too: women have a dark side and sometimes we do feel like we are in a girl-eat-girl world (a phrase that the film takes a bit too literally).

Refn’s hypnotic signature is all over this stylish, elegantly violent film. Cinematographer Natasha Braier adds a disturbing hallucinatory effect while Cliff Martinez lends a thumping, ear-splitting, ominous score that reflects the overall atmosphere of insanity.

As with the director’s other films (“Drive,” “Only God Forgives“), there are plenty of scenarios that seem to be present with the sole intent to shock, offend or disgust. (Do we really need an extended scene of lesbian necrophilia? I guess you can argue the point, but the scene goes on a bit too long to make it seem relevant to the plot or characters). The extreme last act feels more like a pointless gross-out than a thoughtful commentary think piece. I think this is a good place to mention that this film is a very, very hard ‘R’ rating; I am surprised it’s not NC-17.

“The Neon Demon” isn’t your run-of-the-mill art house film; it’s so far beyond the art house that it’s in another dimension.

MATT SAYS:

A teenage runaway from Sandusky, Ohio steps off a bus into the glittering lights of Hollywood. All of her friends back home tell her that she’s destined to be a star, and she believes them. But Hollywood does not bestow fame and fortune without a price. First it will take her innocence, then it will take all that remains.

So is the story of “The Neon Demon,” the new film by auteur Nicolas Winding Refn (“Drive,” “Only God Forgives”). Elle Fanning is Jesse, the underage runaway that has been lured to Los Angeles by the whispered promises of becoming a famous model. She meets up with another innocent who was been lured to the city: photographer Dean (Karl Glusman), whose attempts at emulating the art he sees in Hollywood through pictures are met with sneering ridicule as “amateurish.” Dean hasn’t sold his soul, and those who have have nothing but contempt for him.

Jesse, on the other hand, makes the bargain readily: after being paraded before harshly appraising eyes and being judged a piece of meat worthy of notice, she willingly trades her virtue for empty glamour and attention. After having reborn on the runway, Jesse quickly learns that she has still not given enough: people continue to want more from her, and what they want she isn’t willing to give.

“The Neon Demon” is not for everyone. It’s not even for most. Even if you enjoyed “Drive,” you may find yourself frustrated and your patience tried by this movie. There is much to appreciate, but you will be challenged in doing so. In this film, Winding Refn has made an art piece that must be assessed, considered, and deconstructed. Those who are literal-minded will likely find their patience tried: the story isn’t about what’s happening on the surface, it’s about what’s happening underneath. You must watch, listen, and observe carefully.

One additional word of warning: “The Neon Demon” is highly disturbing and will upset many casual viewers. Apart from its gore and physical violence, the film pushes boundaries HARD. Terrible things are either shown or implied. I can’t for the life of me understand why the studio and theater chains thought that this was an appropriate film to release in nearly 800 theaters nationwide. One can imagine that of the few audience members who didn’t walk out during the first 20 minutes ran for the exits at its offscreen implication of child abuse.

If you’re still reading this review and haven’t been dissuaded yet, I recommend that you see this movie. It’s one of the most interesting discussion pieces in recent memory and it’s not one that I will soon forget.

**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com** || I don't really foresee _The Neon Demon_ becoming my personal all time favourite film, but from a purely aesthetics point of view, it might just be the best movie I've ever seen.

_Final rating:★★★★½ - An all round great movie and a whole lot more._ || **It's not anymore a competitive world, but jealousy!**

It started off very well and in the half mark, it completely lost. In the initial part, it looked like a normal film and then I think even the writer does not know what could happen, they just improvised with whatever they had. Writing was totally messed up. When they had the great characters, it becomes nothing in the end. I'm not a fan of this director, and all his films are average, but this one is the worst among them.

I'm not an art film hater, though I hate wasting scenes without any developments and this one had many like them. If you trim them all out, the overall film is around 45 minutes. The rest of the film was just music, colourful lights, and sometimes totally idle, which definitely drag the viewers to the boredom.

Whenever there was a scene with the story, like dialogues and developments, I thought it was going well. But then those useless, dialogueless segments turned me off. Especially the conclusion was absolutely crap. Elle was good, like a character made for her. Keanu Reeve was useless, his addition was just a marketing strategy that did not click.

This is the story of a teen girl aspiring to be a model, but surrounded by the jealousy people because of her fast growth. How it all goes between them and in the fashion world is what the film talks. The film is watchable, but mostly the second half onwards it gets boring. In the end, I don't think anyone would be satisfied completely with their watch, maybe very, very few, but if you consider the majority, this does not deserve to be suggested.

A new kind of war. When everyone is worried about robots might take over our jobs, it meant military as well. There was not robots in this, but a war fought from a safe distance and soldiers don't have to be physically trained so well, even the geeks with the gaming knowledge can take over. So a film about the modern warfare where the casualty rate is very minimum and can be accomplished before any major assault take place.

From the South African director of 'Ender's Game' fame. This is slightly a similar theme, but a real world affair and a real time presentation. Initially I thought it was a remake of the Hong Kong film of the same name. We had seen drone attacks in the films, but they won't last for a few minutes. This film was entirely about how drone missions work that told with detail.

""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war.""

This was a very good film and they must make a sequel to it. This film will get a special status going towards the future. There were no physically exceptional performances, the stars' presence and their verbal expressions were stronger. So there many thrilling scenes with great lines, especially Alan Rickman's final dialogue. This film was his final film and he was excellent like the usual. Even the Abdi's role was small, but powerful and so Helen Mirren's, but Aaron Paul and the rest were decent.

The story was good, but I did not like the too much sentimentalised. Because all's fair in love and war. You won't make a film to please the terrorists and their sympathisers. Other than that it is a masterpiece. Surely worth a watch.

8/10 || Eye in the Sky wants to explore the question of drone warfare.

An operation to capture a terrorist cell in Kenya. Helen Mirren plays Colonel who is rather gung ho and wants to take out the bad guys before they do more harm.

Aaron Paul is a drone pilot who is dithering because of the risk to civilian casualties.

The film pursues the human touch of a young girl selling bread in the market place, being at the wrong place as that is where the drone aims to strike.

Eye in the Sky is an oddly structured film, it is tense as the audience wonders of the little girl will be safe. It also wants to have an open and even debate on the morals and perils of drone warfare but it all feels rather undercooked and underwhelming.

This was Alan Rickman's final film, he rightly has the last line: 'Never tell a soldier they don't know the cost of war.' || I was looking for a film to watch. Being a big Helen Mirren fan, I decided to give this one a go. What a great choice it was!

The fact that the entire film is in real time, meaning we watch the event as they unfold in real time, makes it a true edge-of-the-seat stuff. Acting was nothing to brag about but the story was great. As you watch it, you keep finding yourself arguing with yourself, trying to decide what you would actually do if you were one of the characters in the film.

If you’re looking for something to watch and have access to this film, don’t even think for a second and press that play button.

Something is not right for 'Mr, Right'. It is not an event based action-comedy or something like man meets woman romance-comedy, but very random presentation. Where it begins and where it ends, you can't clearly say it is a well written script. The actings were decent, but the scenes aren't overwhelmingly impressive as it should be. Directed by 'Neon Flesh' famed filmmaker, after that film his other projects weren't up to the standards including this one.

It is written by the one who was behind the 'American Ultra'. There's a strikingly similar between these two and you won't deny if you had seen them. Especially Anna Kendrick's character to what the Jesse Eisenberg was in that film. If we go deep, Sam Rockwell as well might fall into the same category to what Kristen Stewart was. At some point, one of the film characters mentions the same secret project. So I think it is the same universe and a spin-off.

Sam-Kendrick combo was the highlight of the film. I hope they would do some serious subject together in the near future. The action sequences were good, other than that it's not funny at all or romantic. That means I did not enjoy it because the theme did not work for me which I felt very common these days. So it failed because of the lack of innovation and proper development, but the overall film was not bad if entertainment is the main agenda. I know there are audience for it and they will back it. I won't stand between you and your watch if you want to try it, I just say be careful, that's all.

5/10 || LOUISA SAYS:

A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com

“Mr. Right” isn’t much more than a half-baked hitman romantic comedy. We’ve seen the concept before (think “True Romance” meets “Grosse Point Blank“), but the idea has never been as messy, sloppy and as ill conceived as it is here.

Unlucky in love Martha (Anna Kendrick) has her world turned upside down when she meets and falls for gun for hire Francis (Sam Rockwell). Their love story blossoms over killings, knives and gun battles. The script, written by Max Landis of “American Ultra” fame, is just too flimsy to work. I expected more from the writer.

Tim Roth and RZA turn in enjoyable supporting performances, but the two leads lend the most starpower. The film features the onscreen pairing of my dreams with Kendrick and Rockwell. The two have an undeniable chemistry, but both actors are completely wasted with this mess. I really, really hope to see them work together in the future in a good movie — they both deserve a far better vehicle than this.

“Mr. Right” is a fun idea that’s poorly executed.

MATT SAYS:

In “Mr. Right,” Martha (Anna Kendrick) has recently broken up with her boyfriend after she discovers him cheating on her. A chance encounter in a convenience store leads her to start dating an unnamed hitman (Sam Rockwell).

If those two names — Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick — are all you need to hear to decide you want to see this movie, read no further. If you want to see the two of them play off of one another, this will be a meal that is mostly satisfying for you, but leaves you just a little bit hungry for something with more substance. There are probably vehicles that would have worked better for the two of them, but basically, it’s enjoyable enough as a choice for a movie night at home.

The highlights: Sam Rockwell’s dancing and dry delivery and the way that Anna Kendrick’s millennial-angsty, world-weary-but-optimistic character plays off of him. Tim Roth’s nameless soldier-of-fortune with inscrutable motivations. The rent-a-thug Steve (The RZA), who is nothing if not pragmatic. The lowlights: a terrible script that tries too hard to shoehorn a hardcore action plot into a film that works well enough without it. It’s readily apparent why this movie didn’t get a wider theatrical release.

I enjoyed seeing it, but ask me a month from now and I’ll barely remember it.

**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com** || Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

This has a very special recipe of madness to it, I honestly don't know how to tell you how this movie FEELS.  Sam Rockwell has a very particular style of acting to begin with, and telling him to turn it up to eleven turns out amazingly.  Anna Kendrick, better know for ""I'm a teen girl"" acting than intense action roles keeps every pace with Rockwell in both action and madness.

While we get whiplash from how likeable Kendrick's character is before Rockwell comes in, the fun of the movie quickly takes off in both action and writing.  As ""Mr. Right"" carries chaos in his wake, it starts to develop multi-threading between the two characters, and while Rockwell is the main focus for majority of the movie, I think it is equal part leads between the two.

There is some funny business in the 3rd act as they do some things that would normally be 1st act establishing events, but one becomes a mini-arc of the 3rd act, and the other just isn't explained at all, unless I misunderstood.

The only other movie that is even close to this is ""Wanted"", and that's pretty superficial, the higher philosophical points aren't presented in the same manner at all, the movies ""feel"" completely differently, but they both focus on the morality of killing and high reflexes.

Definitely give this one a go if you like action movies, it's a lot of fun."

I follow closely what films are announced and what are getting released. Sometimes its common that some films comes out without my knowledge, particularly non-Hollywood English language films. This British film was about a wealthy couple from the New York, especially the husband who tries his best to fulfill his seriously ill wife's dream to be an opera singer. The problem is she's not any good. Not just him, but everybody who is close to them and once laughed at her, try to understand them and give their support. But not all the occasion seems to remain the same. So on one such a big event, the disaster strikes and how it affects the couple is the rest of the tale to disclose.

A very surprising film. I thought it was just a comedy like it brings small smiles on our face, but I laughed out loud on many occasions. This is definitely a right time, because I felt like it was a music and cinematic version of the American presidential candidate Don Trump. Yep, there not much difference, but still this film is some way inspiring, not Trump. It says you must never give up on your dream. As much as you laugh watching it, as much you realise how hard chasing a dream to be if one is very passionate about something, but does not have the talent to reach the height. The message is very similar to the film 'Eddie the Eagle'. Do you think everybody got talent in the world, so I believe you should watch this and you will know why I'm telling you to watch it.

When I read about the film's storyline, I thought it was so silly. But when I learnt it is a biographical film, that interested me to have a look at it. It is truly an unbelievable film, in a sense of humour and overall a good way. The couple was rich, so they could do anything they want just like what Donald Trump believes. But both the things are not the same, especially this one is more about the real life struggle against the odds. In some parts, it gets more emotional and I loved that final line said by the wife. It's always, the participation that counts, not how you fared it.

Oh my god, another Oscars nominee is almost certain for the record holder Meryl Streep. Hugh Grant was equally amazing and this is one of the best of him I have seen, particularly in the recent times. One of the best main roles for Simon Helberg, he was not next best after the Streep and Grant. I still feel this film is underrated. The director of 'Phenomena' was very good at handling the stuff for the film to get its best shape. I think this is one of this year's must see film and surely recommend it to all.

_8/10_ || **One of the best and most elegant comedies I've seen in recent times. Bravo! Bravíssimo!**

There aren't enough adjectives for someone like Florence Foster Jenkins. On the one hand, it's beautiful to see someone who doggedly pursues the dream of a lifetime. On the other hand, the technical incapacity of this well-meaning and friendly lady for the task to which she so wanted to dedicate herself is quite evident. She didn't know how to sing, she didn't really care about it, and she wouldn't allow anyone to try to advise her against. As she said before she died, no one can say she didn't sing. I don't know exactly if the film was faithful to the real Foster Jenkins… I don't know her life and her historical figure that well. However, I want to believe so.

The movie is truly funny, and the script is delicious. This movie had everything to not be very interesting, but it turned out to be a little gem and one of the funniest family comedies I've seen in a long time. Interestingly, it never addresses an issue, which is Florence's poor health, greatly affected by the syphilis she contracted from her husband, from whom she soon separated, and which she never treated properly. The dialogues were very well written and deserve to be listened to carefully.

But what makes this film truly precious is the extraordinary performance by Merryl Streep. I have no doubt that it must have been difficult for the actress, who has good vocal qualities, to sing so badly, but she is deeply committed and gives Florence Foster Jenkins an unusual and extremely pleasant sweetness. In fact, Streep even seems to have fun with this job and her character. Hugh Grant, back in the movies after a break in his career, is also in good shape and does a good job. A further note for the good support work by Simon Helberg, Rebecca Ferguson and David Haig.

Technically, the film relies heavily on the adequate and historically accurate recreation of the entire historical period in question. I really liked the cars, the sets and the costumes, particularly those designed for Streep. The cinematography is good but understated, and the effects do their job without distracting us from the humor, witty and elegant. Alexandre Desplat writes a very competent soundtrack, but the film would not work well without the priceless and hilarious performances of Streep and Helberg, in singing and piano, recreating as far as possible some of the still existing recordings of the true “diva of din”, the which can be heard over the end credits, where some authentic recordings were used."

A sequel after the 14 years, actually it was not bad. It followed a simple story of another fat wedding in the Toula's big family. Great to see them all once again, and I hope the third film as well will be made very sooner than another 14 years. This franchise has a wonderful set of the characters and each one was in a very unique that imprinted its trademark and so the film gave them all equal parts to explore the opportunity.

Yep, it's not anymore about Toula, particularly not in this part or if you're expecting it to be about her daughter, you will be disappointed, but it was a well distributed contents to all the characters and extracted as much as possible good comedies. Beside it was written by Toula (Nia Vardalos) like the previous film.

Most of the stuff was as expected, like the slapstick humours. Not everybody would going love it, but if you had liked the first then definitely you would enjoy it as well. Even the first film was not a masterpiece and so this one yet undeniably a good entertainer. Nowadays, in this kind of theme you won't get a fresh storyline, but this one was very original. From the director by 'Everybody's Fine' fame, who really did a good job. A decent summer film, but a very enjoyable film with the family.

6/10 || <em>'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2'</em> isn't the most imaginative or transformative sequel, but it holds enough charm to be perfectly watchable. One part of the plot does hit the most obvious beat, though alongside it is a relatively different story. Either way, I didn't dislike it.

Nia Vardalos and Michael Constantine are again the film's key two; they are amusing, together and individually. John Corbett's character is better this time out; I felt he was underused last time. Lainie Kazan is good, as are new additions Elena Kampouris and Mark Margolis.

It isn't anything special or overly memorable, though I do think it makes for a sweet fourteen-year follow-up.

This film delayed its release for a couple of years due to the distribution issues. That's not it, the film is no good, the writing was terrible, but a bunch of good actors in it. It is about the recent college graduates who struggles to get a job, even if they do, finds hard to fit in. A very good theme, but they failed to draw a decent storyline for it. I think they knew the film won't get a good response, so they used 'distribution issue' card to hold it back, but now it's out and the result was as expected.

It should have been called a drama than the comedy, because right now it lacks from those two categories. It digs on the topics like workplace bullying, harassment, as well as the youngsters' addiction to drugs and video games. In one of the scenes it emotionally appeals when the father tries to pay the bill in a restaurant. They had the right content, but lost in the translation to the screen. There's no proper flow in the story, they had tried too much, at a time it all remained very plain.

This is the second film to release in this year for Anna Kendrick and both of them did no good for her, especially this film fell short from a long distance. Same goes for Miles Teller and Bryan Cranston. I hope they all forget it and come strong in their next projects. A few people might like it, but not me.

The story was average, like it was inspired by the Keanu Reeve's 'John Wick'. I mean, how far a man can go to avenge his pet animal's murder, but here it was a rescue mission. Maybe that's how they got the title, just kidding. A very interesting theme, but not a well written screenplay. This story lacks the clever scenes and dialogues. The comedies were not bad, but I've seen better one in a similar style.

The two cousins decide to hangout when one of them is going through the breakup thing with his girlfriend and the other one's family is going on a vacation. Seems everything is fine after they receive an unexpected guest, a kitty to cheer them, but when it goes missing, they plan to track him to get back. So the mission begins and they pose as the notorious drug dealers and go through many hurdles, but will they succeed is what the film is to reveal in the final act.

When the film posters released, I already lost interest in this. Because those imitating posters of other famous films were totally unimpressive. Beside, those kind of idea is old, not anymore fun and I'm tired of them. This is a below average film, but a decent B movie. The production was top notch, but the film did not deliver with the same standards. The twist was good, in the end, it was very common. If you are okay with a simple and silly concept, then this would do just fine.

Sure the characters and their tribulations might be a little bit surface-y, but it's still a tight script well shot and well acted that 100% captures the spirit of the era it is set in.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || **On the verge to set a foot into the college, theirs wild side unleashed!**

This is like a lighter and smarter version of 'Animal House'. The story takes place in the mid 1980 and three days prior to the first day of the college. This film follows a freshman named Jake, who is a baseball pitcher, with his first encounter with his new teammates, as well as housemates. And then a beautiful girl who he befriends. So it's all about the girls, party, video games, dare games and what else, these young guys make their footprint before the college opens. A very satisfying film, all the comedies are within the limits. I mean, usually American teen/student comedies are overwhelmed by adult jokes and mostly unrealistic. But this one seems real, yet cinematically very appealing to stick with it still the final scene.

All the actors were so good. Looks like it is the first film for most of them or I'm watching theirs. Many of them are going to be a big star in the future. Another excellent film by Richard Linklater and an awesome screenplay as well by him. According to him, it is a spiritual sequel to both his previous films 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Boyhood'. I've seen one, I'm going to check it out the other one very soon. Because I'm kind of started to like this filmmaker and his signature.

I was very impressed by the way the scenes and characters developed. Like everything was simple and familiar, yet very fun to watch. You know, between the seniors and freshmen, it's not like the film promotes bullying, but an understandable compromise which brings smile among us. The 80s setting was so good, almost flawless. The opening scene freaked me out, and then the rest of the film was completely different. Without the big stars, this film was a box office disaster, but surely it will find its place in the coming years. So I suggest you to check it out this rare comedy.

I seriously thought this might be an overrated film. I knew it was too early to judge it, so I was not expecting anything extraordinary and then it struck me with its progress, I was clean bowled by its style and cuteness. I don't what others think, but this is John Carney's masterpiece according to me. I liked his other films, but this is something I think a perfect dose of contents. In two words to say it is a Golden Touch. I rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one I had enjoyed very much like this. Definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years.

This is an Irish-British film that is set in the Dublin, 1985. It is about a high school boy named Conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy's school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. New school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. During getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. So then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go.

> ""Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy-sad.""

At the end of the final scene, there is a note that says 'For brothers everywhere'. I was impressed by that, because I did not pay attention on that while watching the film. What I meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. I recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. The one who played the older brother of Conor simply looked alike Seth Rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. He's only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story.

Of course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. But there's a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. That is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. It is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that.

In this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one's inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. I don't have any brother, but I felt how it would be to have one. So all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them.

> ""It's like when you don't know someone, they are more interesting. They can be anything you want them to be. But when you know them, there's limits to them.""

I did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and I know how it would feel to be born in that generation. Jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories.

A very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. All the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. They both going have a great future in filmdom. Not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother I talked about in the other paragraph.

All the sound tracks were awesome. I should start adding them to my 'film songs' collection, especially 'The Riddle of the Model' which defines this title and the film's climax song 'Go Now'. So from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. The film had a perfect runtime, I would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour.

The pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. Yes, I loved the ending, it was touching, but I don't know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. A film I watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films. Todays generation might take it as another rock and roll inspired theme, but only the middle aged guys and some old ones would know how to enjoy it. So don't miss it out if you are one of them.

8.5/10 || Take it with a grain of bias, because I too went to a Christian Brothers school and hated it, but I absolutely adored _Sing Street_.

It rehashes a lot of things you will have seen before, but if you're a lover of the 80's, alternative music, coming of age stories or even just good cinema, you could do a lot worse than _Sing Street_.

Jarmusch, known for his quirky and sedated dramas that include the highly underrated 2005 Bill Murray vehicle _Broken Flowers_ and 2009’s _The Limits of Control_, is back to add to his familiar repertoire of solemn filmmaking with an admirable character study of an Everyday man named Paterson (Adam Driver, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”) trying to balance a structured, day-by-day existence with poetic leanings as his measurement of escapism. Remember, this is Jim Jarmusch’s isolated cinematic world where experiencing one of his big screen creations is much like living in an insulated bubble with meditation whale sounds to ease your tension…you just need to go with the slow pacing and appreciate the nuances of its resonance. In fact, the only recent radical submission from Jarmusch is this year’s documentary _Gimmie Danger_ and that is even riddled with mild-like rawness.

Consequently, **Paterson** is the type of off-kilter, contemplative and quaint motion picture that begs one to check their excitement at the door. The flashiness of Jarmusch’s creative overtones is ironically the low-key blueprint of the film’s leading protagonist Paterson (the man) and urban setting (Paterson, New Jersey–the city that shares the same name with Driver’s blue-collar characterization). Dutifully, the film allows the audience to ride the waves of the repetitive conformity of a man seemingly going through the motions in life from the perspective of a married working stiff whose occasional stimulation besides his lovely wife Laura (Iranian-born actress Golshifteh Farahani) and four-legged adorable bulldog Marvin is his need to write poetry in his trusted notebook of eloquent thoughts. It certainly helps that the hometown bearing his moniker that surrounds him as he regularly drives the bus each day carrying the familiar and not-so-familiar faces as they are carted off to their various destinations acts as a steady stream for inspiration.

Some will relate to Paterson’s stillborn existence of repeating his daily agenda for work and leisurely downtime while others may dread the tedious notion of being so predictable and practical as this disciplined city bus driver has mastered so effortlessly. The scheduled outline never deviates for Paterson as he gets up early at the same time, goes to work while cruising the same bus routes, returns home to his fetching spouse Laura for dinnertime then walks Marvin to the local bar for his taste of a mug of beer to ease the tensions of the work day. It does need repeating that Paterson must engage in his passages of poetry–something that he does not miss a beat on for sure.

Interestingly, Laura is also an odd duck whose own sense of head-scratching regimen actually rivals that of her husband’s day-by-day customs. Laura has dreams and does not hesitate in throwing herself into random activities that give her a sense of anticipated rush and reason to follow with faithful conviction. With the obsessive black-and-white coloring schemes in clothing, food and furniture that perversely pleases her Laura longs for the personal satisfaction that feels as therapeutic for her as the reliable quirks does for Paterson as well. Together, they march to the bizarre beat of their own drums. However, the dichotomy in their philosophical lives clash as Paterson is a creature that does not cozy of to change whereas Laura embraces her urges for different challenges whenever they come into fruition.

One may find it quite difficult to celebrate **Paterson** because it is an intimate film with a small-scale mentality that dares to look at the lives of ordinary, married people as they shift through their livelihood tainted with tiny triumphs and trying times. Nevertheless, at the box office office where superheroes, zombies and continuous _Star Wars_ installments reign supreme there can be something said for cheeky melodramas such as **Paterson** that draws its imaginative scope on solid storytelling with the concentration on hard-working, flawed people just trying to take on the day for the moment.

In a sentimental and subtly sharp performance, Driver is effectively potent as Paterson, a poetic pariah that translates the rhythms of his beloved city and people into a notebook that speaks his lyrical language. He is who he is and is unapologetic about his mission to adhere to anything different than what he is already used to that persists. Also, the beautiful Farahani is a revelation in her own right as the free-spirit with various whims that entail baking cupcakes one minute or arranging drapes the very next minute. The supporting characters are refreshingly realized especially when the spotlight settles in on the small tavern where Paterson systematically nurses his one beer all week long. And even the gruff but treasured Marvin (as played by the late canine actor Nellie) fits so handsomely into the saga of these ordinary folks relaxing in their own arbitrary skin. As simplistic as the poet Paterson is at heart and soul Jarmusch is shrewd to suggest that perhaps the hidden complexities of his expressive leading man is more explosive than what is let on throughout the narrative. Indeed, the mysterious nature of Driver’s devoted transit worker is a curiosity worth speculating over.

In conclusion, there is nothing wrong with worshiping car chases, alien attacks or enjoying the occasion teen sex farce. Still, whenever there is warranted shelf room for a sublime, insightful look at under-the-radar celebrations of casual lives, love and checkered eccentricities than the Jim Jarmusches and Terrence Malicks of the cinema world are welcomed to the table of film fodder that moves and grooves on its old-fashioned, unique purpose more relatable than your doomsday delight of resident space invaders.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016 || **A week with a bus driver, a part time poet.**

The time Jim Jarmusch has struck back. He does not make films often, but those he makes are not easily forgettable. I don't think people hate his films, especially the grown ups. They know how hard the real life is and contents this filmmaker use for his flicks are not much different. But the thing is, in his style, adding a slight fun, romantic, poetic, all together works so well. I still remember how I become his fan after watching 'Stranger Than Paradise'.

As usual, he wrote the story for this film. Even if he had to borrow from another source, the screenplay is generally his. For this film, it was original and that's what worked out awesomely. But he had to borrow some poems from his favourite poet, Ron Padgett. A great team work, because when their work came together, the film became a masterpiece. It was nothing less than any literature, for sure. Definitely this film should turn into a book. The readers deserve their own imagination of this tale.

This is the story of a man's life in a week's time. Starts from Monday and ends on next Monday. So, his name's Paterson, a bus driver from the city of Paterson. A happily married man, and love his profession. In the meantime, he's a poet. He has kept a book where he writes his poems, especially during his lunch time, even in the small breaks when he gets. His mind's always filled with thoughts. Chanting words, verses.

His inspirations are the places he goes through his bus and the strangers who ride in his bus. Their each others conversation about their lives and experiences is his motivation. His wife is an interesting character too. Sadly, she was not focused as much as he was. Though there are enough scenes to enjoy the role. But I think she deserves her solo film, from another angle, about her life, her hobby which her husband backs.

It's a simple, normal life. Without much trouble, a peaceful life the most people would ask for. The film is not everything about him. But he's the centre of the story. When other, one time characters enter the screen. It's because of his presence around them. Hence some interesting facts revealed. Just like our life when we ride a public transport where we come in to contact with many passengers coming and going in different stops. But all the above, what they talk, which we, everybody in the bus listen without hesitation. Paterson is a person who learns every day out of that.

> ❝Poetry in translation is like taking a shower with a raincoat on.❞

His other activity is walking his dog out at every night. It's an opportunity for him to mix with some friends at the pub he had made with frequent visits. The place which has its own story as the film progresses. So all these stuffs keeps repeating every day like what we call a mechanical life. But Paterson is neither enjoying it nor depressed over. He usually does best out of the given time and place. The difference is, not every day are same. Even a slight change in order of activity brings a new thing in. His wife insists him to publish his works. But the narration strikes with an unexpected twist before the end.

I have said many times when I liked the films I have watched that they are so poetic. But it's very rare to find a film from top to bottom being very poetic. Recently I saw one, in fact, two from Japan known as 'Little Forest' duology. And now this one. Particularly if you love poetry or if you are yourself a poet, then this is a must see. Surely you would love it. As well as a good film to gift to any such person you know in your life. Believe me, this film is like a wine bottle. As it gets older, it will turn the best. I have already changed my stance twice and rated better every time. I consider it is a bit low rated right now. But only time will answer to that.

For me, it is the director's top 3 films. I have seen Adam Driver in many films, he's not considered a solo lead actor, because of marketing purpose. But he's really good which proved in this flick. So it is his best performance I have seen so far. He really took the driving classes to learn drive the bus to perfect his character. That's the dedication the creator of the film expects from his cast. How much I loved it means, I'm eager for a sequel, despite knowing this kind of films are one-off. Otherwise, I'll be happy if the director and him join the hands once more time for a new project.

Very slow moving tale. But not a boring film. If I had watched it when I was a teenager, I don't think I would have felt similarly. From middle aged people to the older ones, they are the target audience. In order to see and feel what this film reveals, one must have experience in real life. Hence, not all the youngsters, particularly the teenagers would thumb up. In my world, this kind of films is the Oscar worthy. I would have surely nominated the film, as well as the director and the lead actor. So by now you would have learnt what my final word could be. Recommended!

_8/10_ || Jim Jarmusch's 2016 film PATERSON is a study of everyday life in a small American city. Its title refers on one hand to its setting of Paterson, New Jersey, much less known abroad than other towns in the state but a surprising number of prominent Americans hailed from there and it was eulogized in an epic-length work by the poet William Carlos Williams. On the other hand, Paterson is coincidentally the last name of our protagonist, a thirty-something bus driver played by Adam Driver.

The film is a day-by-day account of one week in Paterson's life and in fact each day is rather the same: Paterson wakes up, kisses his wife (played by Golshifteh Farahani), goes to work driving the bus, comes home, eats dinner with his wife, takes the dog for a walk, and has a beer at the local bar. Yet Paterson also has an unusual hobby: for some time he has written poetry during each day's lunch break, and he has filled a small notebook with poems that his wife calls wonderful, but which he has never shown to anyone else.

There is a plot to Paterson, that is, an increasing of tension and a sudden and jarring climax, but overall Jarmusch is not aiming for any grand and intricate storytelling here. Instead, he is intentionally trying to capture the quiet music of one ordinary person's existence. Or should I say, two ordinary people's existence, for the film sympathetically captures this couple's marriage. Their relationship is a simple, uncomplicated one of trust and mutual understanding. Paterson is extremely fortunate to have this, as events around him show. (The script is by Sara Driver, Jarmusch's partner of decades, and one might see the film as a hymn to their own special relationship.) Many viewers are likely to find this heartwarming, while other viewers in more fraught marriages might burn with jealousy at Paterson and his wife's incredible harmony.

Those familiar with Jarmusch's earlier work know that he has always liked to show a great deal of urban blight before the camera, such as vacant lots overgrown with weeds and graffitied walls. For Jarmusch, these backdrops supposedly served as a counterweight to the typical Hollywood depictions of the USA as all glitz, and it helped to underscore the bohemian qualities of his characters. Yet this blight surprisingly absent here. Paterson, New Jersey is instead shown as a clean and fairly prosperous town. Its residents, regardless of socioeconomic status or race, are depicted as rather content people.

In fact, at regular points in the film Jarmusch depicts interactions between whites and African-Americans or between gays and straights as if celebrating our new modern era when all those old divisions don't matter any more. This is definitely the most optimistic film that Jarmusch has ever shot, but this utopian vision does come across as a little heavy-handed and one feels that Jarmusch is overlooking pressing social issues that continue to hold many people back. Watching this film, I couldn't help but protest that this gentrified setting is not all of America, just a privileged few. 

Still, in spite of the film's flaws, the depiction of married life and the way that poetry is worked into the story is very moving, and I do feel this is worth watching, at least for established Jarmusch fans or those comfortable with indie cinema."

This is a sequel as well as a prequel to the 2012 film 'Snow White and Huntsman'. It opened with the earlier story where and how the Huntsman grew up, especially the journey of his innocent childhood to a great fighter that covers in the first half an hour. And then it skips for about 7 years where the original film takes place, but immediately begins where it had ended in the first half, as well as the first film. Actually, not a bad film as I have heard of it, but same as the previous film that stands just above the average and slightly loses some decibel rating.

The actors were good though. Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain and Charlize Theron, wow, super hot women, but sadly they are in fairytale costume. Their performances were great, but the characters, particularly the two sisters resemble the 'Frozen's Anna and Elsa. You can feel how desperate was the filmmakers to avoid such comparisons by viewers, so they developed the story very far from any string attached to that famous animation. In the end these things are unavoidable, since the story is not fresh enough to claim its independent status.

Chris Hemsworth was okay, I hope he won't return for the third film. It is a decent watch, and I think it will remain as an duology, for right now it seems a good idea. The problem is it was being made a dark-fantasy to appeal the grown ups, particularly men. But it should have been a children's film where adults too can enjoy like the Disney's 'Maleficent'. Except the opening the rest of the story seemed very ordinary. Though the action sequences were enjoyable and so the film with a low expectation, or the purpose of the watch is the timepass.

_6/10_ || This is kind of a prequel and a sequel to Snow White and The Huntsman. It is not as impressive as the first movie but quite good anyway. I would call it a nice family movie although probably not for the youngest members of the family.

The story is partly before and partly after the events in Snow White and The Huntsman. It is a good adventure with plenty of magic and special effects and a fair bit of action. It is a fairly straightforward story without much in terms of surprises.

There is a bit of comical relief in particular by the dwarfs, especially when the two dwarfs following the huntsman encounters the grumpy female one and her friend.

Apart from the classical Snow White setting, quite good special effects and quite decent action this is a fairly normal fantasy adventure movie. It is about two hours of good fun but does not really reach wow-status."

I thought the first film was a mistake and now there is another one. I thought only people are reacting negatively, it could be much better than the previous one, but this is really a crap. I'm as a film fanatic hate myself to criticise a film like a film critic does, but there is no other option. I don't know who are the target audience, because it was too sexy for teens and definitely adults won't enjoy unless they are similar to what in the film depicted.

I don't know why, but I disliked all film with Zac Efron in it. Beside, I'm disappointed in Chloe Grace joining this team. A bad decision, she will regret doing it in the future, maybe she's already. Regarding Seth and Byrne, I don't blame them doing this, at least theirs part were much better than the others. Yet there is no laughs, the film ran with totally dry. Maybe the youngsters would enjoy it than anybody else, because I'm sure the grown-up have already seen better ones in the similar style in the 80s and 90s.

I hope this is it, no more sequels. Particularly not to end up like 'American Pie', but nobody can stop that if B filmmakers take over from here on. At least first film was much better compared between these two. If you are an adult, sure you should skip it. Zac and Chloe won the Teen Choice awards, so now you know who should watch it. No offense to those who liked it, but for me it is one of the top five worst films of the year. I never write the reviews like this, but I feel bad for what this film made me to do.

It was so much better than I anticipated, but the end ruined my party. It was the right time I saw it, because I haven't seen any heist films recently. It was not like any genuine heist theme, but still I kind of enjoyed it for being a slightly different, especially the first two acts. It is about the two cops, actually they're part of the police department, but from a different division. When they discover a huge illegal money belonging to a cartel gang after going through the police file, they plan to hit it and disappear forever. But as the title indicates, the trust is what lacks between them. In the third act, the pace picks up rapidly and brings a twist in the tale before the credits begin to roll.

Two wonderful main characters with a decent story, but I don't know about the cast. I kind of felt there was a vast age gap between them, like an old man teaming up with a teenager. Obviously worst chemistry, but that's the point, if you understand the title very well. Both the characters were completely opposite, like one was a very confident person, but a prankster and the other guy were a hopeless, but serious about everything. Just like a wolf and a sheep together planning to rob a farmer. When it was going good, like I said the conclusion spoilt the overall product. Other than that it is an okay film.

5/10 || Has one or two laughs in the first half and one or two moments of genuine tension in the second half, aaaaaand that's about it. A very understated movie to have gotten both Elija Wood and Nic Cage. Just one of them (especially if it was Cage) and I might have expected something like this, but was surprised given the presence of both. He still gets a freakout in of course, but not a whole lot, like... Happened.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Nicolas Cage (""Stone"") and Elijah Wood (""Waters"") team up quite well in this rather enjoyable and quirky crime caper. Both are Las Vegas evidence room cops whose careers are going nowhere fast. Until, that is, the former spots a curious bail receipt that leads them to start investigating just what might be hidden in the most innocuous of locations. Armed with some surprising information, they decide to find out just what is actually in an erstwhile secret vault. Their really quite scientific antics are helped enormously by some decent, quick-witted, banter between the two and the whole plot remains unpredictable right the way to the conclusion which does makes it worth a watch eventually. Yep, that is one of it's snags. It does take way too long to get up and running, and at times it does elicit a ""get on with it"" sigh. Unfortunately, too, the ending is rather hurried - which is a shame because an on-form Cage particularly, but Wood too - don't really get a chance to finish this off anywhere near as entertainingly as it deserved. Passes ninety minutes effortlessly enough, though - but I doubt you will recall it afterwards."

It wasn't the best written film ever but it did the job as a good, stupid horror film.

It was excruciatingly annoying in parts but I think that was the point.

It won't win any awards for acting or screenplay but it was fun and stands up against most modern, boring horrors.

It reminded me of 'Don't Breathe' which was a really good film too as it took modern horror conventions and played with them in a different way as the main characters had to struggle with the loss of an important sense. || “For a thriller this is a very good choice”


It all starts with a story writer, she lives alone also she got meningitis long back and lost her speaking and hearing ability. She left her family which consists of a dad mom and a sister to live alone is solitary place with just one couple as a neighbor and one more thing to point out is that she has not been talking to her boyfriend .so one night this intruder comes along as soon as she finds out that she is not alone it turns out to be a cat and mouse story for survival and the rest of the movie u guys have to watch have not spoiled anything for you. It has been a while since I watched movies like this from the usual haunting by ghosts. There were some parts in this movie which could have been made better but no complains it was a good one.

Kate Siegel 
My Rating 8/10 || **Inside and outside, a cat-mouse game!**

A limited cast film. One night event. The whole film was shot within the three weeks. Minimised dialogues, maximised actions. This film has such a good record those. But apart from the performances and settings, there's nothing special. The same old home-invasion concept with so many flaws. If you are looking for nothing but an entertainment, then this will provide you that. But you should not expect more than that, it will foil you from having a nice time with the film. I enjoyed it too, though when it comes to the rating, I should be honest.

Maddie, an authoress who lost hearing and voice in her childhood is now living in a remote place, somewhat isolated from the people. On an ordinary day, unexpectedly, a masked man who killed her neighbour, is now after Maddie too. When she comes to realise that, the cat and mouse game begins. She locked herself inside. On the other hand the stranger trying to get in. As it goes like that for hours, so many twists and turns take place. How the remaining tale would turn out is should be watched.

Simpleness was the highlight. They did not try too much. Particularly, for a thriller like this, they usually scare the viewers with sudden and loud sounds. This film had those, but minimised. You can't blame for isolated settings too, because such crimes can be easily committed on those backdrops. It's all about Kate Siegel. Her best film, according to me. Nice direction, from one of the latest horror flick maker. But this is not a horror film. It is a terror, a thriller. Short running time and it is worth a try.

Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2016/5/13/money-monster.html || **What if the experts are wrong! And how it affects the common man!**

Jodie Foster did wonderfully as a captain of the ship. She could have acted in it, instead concentrate only on the direction, so that opportunity went to Julia Robers. With George Clooney onboard for one of the main roles, this was one of the best team to work together, as well the film was very enjoyable. So better than what I thought of it and I feel I should have given a better rating. But one thing is for sure that it was made for the people to have a good time, not for the critics morons.

A real time narration, takes place in one normal morning is a newsroom studio where the financial expert Lee Gates, going to give his advice to the investor where to put their money. But the show suddenly got hit by an intruder when he takes the host as a hostage. He demands some answers from him regarding what he'd said a week ago in the same show, which led him to lose all his money. With this kind of complication how its going to conclude was nicely told with some edgy scenes towards the end.

Both, Clooney and Julia was good, but it was Jack O'Connell who hand upper hand. He has done some great films lately and now this, I hope he continues his good work. It was inspired by the real glitch that saw in the stock market, but altered to suit the cinematic, especially turning it into a crime-thriller with some powerful characters to deal such an interesting situation made big differences in its success.

The writing was good, because, it was kind of realistic like what a common man do and his intentions are when he can't understand the terms the experts speak or give the reason for the loss. So there are some pauses like 'what next' kind of stuffs that intentionally did. Despite a serious thriller, there are some funs. Whom you're going to cheer is up to you, but it keeps your head up all the time with its fine pace and developments. This is not the best among you find from this year, but surely a good watch if your purpose is entertainment or timepass,

Whoa! 200 million dollar film, 1 billion box office collections worldwide. The 27th film to do that so and the 5th animation film. This sequel was made after 13 years, surely a long gab, but 'Finding Nemo' was one of my favourite animations, tell me who does not love it those who love animation. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of having a sequel, but I scared it would go to flop terribly. Now, after watching this, I totally stunned. This is not a greatest animation ever made, but the way the screenplay handled, along with other stuffs, this makes one of the best among its kind.

Firstly, when I heard the sequel's title, it made me laugh. Like, whaaaat? Once again the story is going to repeat. I did not think it would bring a big change. Actually, it was a different tale, especially I was not expecting it to be emotional. Tell me how many tearjerker-animation you have seen. Once again the Disney-Pixar jointly did it. I think appreciation must go to the director who also made the original film. Great casting too, I mean the voice- over artists.

We know that Dory is severely suffering from the short term remembory (memory) loss. Now this tale is going to reveal her backstory. From her childhood to till she meets Marlin and then Nemo, there was a series of forgotten events. She slowly regains some of those memories and begins her quest to find out more. This is where she gets lost, but the title defines that she was lost before and now looking a way to get back where she really belongs.

For me, after 'Frozen', this film is what emotionally got me. The value of having family and friends beautifully disclosed. It might be an animation, but still a meaningful story from many perspectives. Lots of new characters were introduced and those were really cool ones. I expect theirs short animations to make its way about their origins, particularly Hank the octopus and his story about how he lost one of his tentacles.

The Oscars is the quarter of a year away, but releasing nominees would come weeks ahead. So it's about time to learn where this one fit in. But I'm anticipating close contest between this, 'Zootopia' and 'Red Turtle'. Coming back to the review, this is a good watch, for everybody, so I highly recommend it. I hope there will be a third film, but like I had felt before this, I desire it and then I'm not sure it would extend its legacy to further. So fingers crossed!

_9/10_ || A tiresome joke in the first movie becomes the central premise and is incredibly over-used. || This has been made almost a generation after the first, ""Finding Nemo"", outing for this annoyingly forgetful fish so it's not really fair total it a sequel. It's really a whole new concept that sees ""Dory"" out on a school trip where she gets a bit of rather unpleasant déjà-vu. This brings to mind the incident that led to her separation from her mum and dad. Determined to see if she can track them down, she enlists the help of ""Nemo"" and his dad ""Marlin"" and embarks on a series of fun adventures that introduces us to the engaging septopus ""Hank"" along the way. The story is quite a poignant little one, here. The young fish gradually discovers enough mnemonics to help them all inch towards their goal, and there is enough in the dialogue to satisfy younger audiences - though not so much for the oldies. I am afraid I still find this particular tang fish a bit irritating, but this is still quite an enjoyable and vividly colourful family comedy with messages of loyalty, determination and perseverance featuring strongly but delicately throughout. It gets perilously close to cheesy at times, but is still worth pitching up to a cinema to appreciate on a big screen."

She has hit the jackpot in a career gone on a whirlwind upswing. McCarthy has just ended a six-year run from her Emmy-winning turn on the popular CBS sitcom **Mike and Molly**. She was Oscar-nominated for her performance in **Bridesmaids**. She has made a slew of hit-and-miss comedies. Her hosting stints on the legendary **Saturday Night Live** are riotous. McCarthy is part of the much-talked about upcoming female version of the wildly treasured 80's cult classic comedy **Ghostbusters**. Additionally, ardent fanatics of the 2000-2007 WB network TV series **Gilmore Girls** recently rejoiced when McCarthy agreed to join the Netflix revival show that previously endeared her to television audience years before. So yes...to say that Melissa McCarthy is on a continued roll with her ubiquitous presence in TV and movies is an understatement.

In McCarthy's latest broad comedy **The Boss** she and her husband Ben Falcone (""Bridesmaids"") collaborate as they--along with Steve Mallory--co-wrote the script with Falcone taking over the directorial duties. In fact, both McCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the 2014 vehicle **Tammy** starring McCarthy with Falcone in the director's chair as well. So it is a relief to see how this Hollywood couple bond creatively over their film projects. However, it is not all that encouraging that the Falcones have subsided over generic laughfests. 

On the surface **The Boss** could be perceived as a wacky female empowerment romp but dig deeper and this lackluster comedy has all the one-note comical deepness of a frizzled Phyllis Diller wig. McCarthy plays the brash and blistery Michelle Darnell, a Martha Stewart-esque CEO financial wizard with a convincing pretty penny that makes up her unbelievable fortune. In fact, Michelle happens to be the 47th wealthiest woman in America. Unfortunately, the law caught up with Michelle so now she is behind bars for inside trading.

After months of doing ""hard time"" (in reality ""soft time"" for the jailed demanding diva), Michelle is released where she learns of her frozen assets and diminutive ex-lover and rival entrepreneur Renault (Peter Dinklage) who has taken over her multi-million dollar companies. With nowhere to turn for support Michelle decides to intrude on her long-suffering former personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). The tolerant Claire is a single mother to 10-year old Rachel (Ella Anderson). As one can imagine the insufferable Michelle is a terror in poor Claire's household with her bossy demeanor. Apparently Claire's nastiness is just not reserved for Claire as she has plenty of scorn to go around for the ones who dare to step in her way.

Soon, Michelle discovers a way to get back into the capitalism game and recapture her status as a wealth-driven Wonder Woman. The agenda involves Rachel's Dandelion troop as inspiration for Michelle scheming to recruit the outcast girls from the Dandelions (dubbed ""Darnell's Darlings) to sell the exceptional brownies based upon Claire's crafty recipe. Naturally, Michelle is hard on the little gals to push her need for reaching success but in her own caring way she wants to educate the Darlings to become strong, independent future businesswomen armed with potential power and poise. With Michelle's sad-sack backstory as a rejected little girl raised in a Catholic orphanage where many foster homes denied her existence it is clear that the seemingly cold and calculating Michelle does not want her hardship to be repeated in the group of girls she is grooming for the kill of conquering the business world.   

**The Boss** has some slapstick moments that are passable and the always game McCarthy is willing to do what it takes to sell the zany goods to ensure the hefty chuckles. Playing hard-nose harlots such as the coarse Michelle Darnell is McCarthy's specialty and she is effective when the material supports her tyrannical pushiness. However, **The Boss** feels lackluster because McCarthy's sketchy bits are slight and the movie's basic follow-the-dots lunacy is never on par with McCarthy's bombastic business-minded bulldog. The movie feels cheaply lifted from the hybrid boundaries of 1989's **Troop Beverly Hills** paired with 1988's **Big Business.**

Thankfully, **The Boss** is not as tepid or forgettable as McCarthy's other outings such as the aforementioned **Tammy** or **Identity Theft**. On the flip side, this toothless romp will never rub shoulders with the more acceptable McCarthy staples in **Bridesmaids**, **The Heat** or **Spy** either. In short, this particular **Boss** ought to be demoted to the unemployment line.

I always liked Melissa McCarthy films when others said they were very bad, but this time it is totally different. I won't blame her, she always gives her one hundred per cent and so for this film. But it was the terrible script that let her down. Actually, it is a watchable film, because of her, but without her completely unimaginable. The trailer looked much better than the film. It is a comedy, but the laughs are too far, not even a little smile in your face easy to obtain.

So it seems there are plenty of negatives about it than the good. I watched it to prove the people are wrong about it, but in the end I was wrong. This is the second time the director and McCarthy together for a film who are the real life couple. But I liked 'Tammy' better, not this one and there will be one more film that I hope they would come up with much more interesting than these two.

She is not a solo type star, her films are always the multistarrer. So whenever I hear about her new films, I get curious about her new partner. Kristen Bell was not bad, even Peter Dinklage have given a nice performance. So The casting was good, but they all did not get the good script or the role. I did not enjoy it means not that I won't recommend it. It did not work for me, but it might to you, so I advise be carefully while choosing it.

Video games to films is an old topic to discuss it now, but the fans from the original source are always in the high hope when they hear news like this. Because 'Angry Birds' game is one of the mainstream games which is originally from Finland. Despite the mixed reviews, it is a box office success and definitely a sequel on the card. After lots of animal themed films, now in the line of underrated animation 'Free Birds', another the bird's quest begins with this.

I'm not much into this game, but I was looking forward to the film since it was first announced. Now I'm here after the watch and I think is a good film, but better suitable for children than the adults. That did not stop me from enjoying it. The target audience might be the kids with those cute film characters, as well as the story, but there are some dialogues that are written keeping in mind the grownups. Anyway, most of the adults won't feel they are in a wrong cinema hall if they regularly watch animation films, especially in the present world animations are accepted as for all ages.

So this is the story about the Red, an orphan bird lives in a small house on the sea shore. The kids from the island loves him, but the adults stay away from him for his bad anger attitude. One day a ship of pigs arrives on the bird's island offering friendship, but their intention was later known once the valuables things were stolen from them. So the revenge and rescue operation begins which stretched with full of action-adventure in the remaining parts.

Filled with lots of fun moments, it was much better than I expected. Sometimes it looked cute, but you know our angry bird, Red with his companions makes it not to stay that way. Peter Dinklage as Might Eagle was one of the highlights of the film and the rest of the cast did well too. It is definitely a great directional debute for the two experienced animators. Makes a bit sad how the film was received, but after seeing it myself I think its fine. Different people have different opinion. In my perspective, it was a good watch so I surely suggest it, especially for animation fans and obviously children.

This attempts action, comedy and romance - none of which pay off unfortunately. The action is OK, though the comedy is extremely forced but not helped by lame dialogue. As for the love story, there is far too much - to quote the film itself - ""sappy shit"" in this. 100% action was needed.

I will say I appreciate that there is at least a male and a female character, both appear a large amount, that don't end up getting together, instead remaining friends. That's unusual with this sorta film. The score is actually alright, too. It also, unexpectedly, includes a blooper reel in the end credits.

Improved writing and acting could've made this work, if only on a minorly serviceable level."
302401.0,Snowden,CIA employee Edward Snowden leaks thousands of classified documents to the press.,The only safe place is on the run.,"Drama, History, Crime, Thriller",134.0,2016-09-15,en,7.106,4431.0,2.7497,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Shailene Woodley, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson",Oliver Stone,"biography, idealism, idealist, national security agency (nsa), surveillance, whistleblower, political thriller, fighting the system, five eyes","**He who became a people's hero by betraying his own nation!**

I had like to begin by saying I'm not an American and I haven't seen the Oscar winning documentary 'Citizenfour'. But I'm very much aware of everything about it through the all kinds of coverages. So my perspective about the film will be true and about the content will be neutral. I have known about what this film dealt since the day it all began. I did not care much, but there are things to concern about it. Like if it is necessary to tap to prevent the serious threats, there's nothing wrong it that. Because, even if they have our private contents, they are not going to publish it or make money out of it. So that makes what Ed did was unethical and betrayal for his own country.

In another angle, NSA's illegal surveillance questionable in many ways, but wrong is only a tiny thing. Because eyeing every single one of us seems wrong, though without examining all, nothing confirms, differentiate between right and wrong. So coming to the film, it was decently made one. The main reason is it was too long and many parts were boring. The theme was powerful like it was a one liner, but the film contents were very weak. Except Snowden passing the security, the rest of the story like why he did, including his personal life, particularly his romance was not good enough to make a film. This is very much suitable for a documentary than a feature film.

But I liked the actors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was good, but not great. If he gets the Oscars nod, that's only because of the issue which the film inspired by, not because his phenomenal character display. The direction was decent, but not the screenplay. The film is not for everyone, but I recommend it to all as a must see. The main reason why you should watch it is to educate yourself. To learn what they are doing and how. Particularly, you will definitely come to know how to avoid being eyed by the government in a simple way. So that's a good thing than whining over what homeland security does to protect the nation. It is not an inspiring biopic, or a masterpiece, but don't miss it for any cost.

P.S. Whatever the form of the governments, the nations won't stop doing what in this film they said was wrong. Because there's no Edward Snowden in every nation to expose it. In that perspective, the US was really embarrassed for their own man letting them down. The China is the number one in this kind of activity. The point is, these things happening right now or not, but should never come to public notice like that happened in here, never should leave the compound. Suppose if we come to know, we will protect, at least in the democratic countries that's what we do. But not to forget it also safeguards us. That means it is like the stars and planets on the sky that we watch and take notes, but they are untouchable. We only monitor them for threats like asteroids and fractionally thinking about the alien invasion.

_7/10_ || JGL plays a pretty convincing Snowden or at least I think he does as I've only seen the real Snowden in video and Citizenfour. I don't know exactly how correct the movie is to the actual story but as most of these things go, the movie will have been created with a slightly exaggerated storyline and version of events.

An enjoyable watch and a big tick for me was that the coding and terminology used in the movie were relatively correct and true to real life! || Although the movie is not perfect, it's flaws are limited, minute and easily ignored. **A must-watch for anyone using a computer!**

This adaptation of Snowden's transformation from a talented programmer working for the United States secret service into a planetary hero really takes the viewer deeper into the true story on which this film is based. It shows the human side of the path towards revealing the truth. Relational tensions, covertly supportive colleagues and the need to stay cool are all part of this film.

Best spy thriller I've ever seen. _Beyond believable_."

This kid-friendly space saga, armed with its beloved reputation in the world of gamer groupies, could be deemed as the junior-sized ‘Star Wars’ for the minor sect. Why would the mini movie-goers not find this big screen adaptation an appealing space-aged actioner worth its weight in innocuous, escapist gold? After all, what is not to like about the roguish and heroic feline-looking creature Ratchet (otherwise known as a ‘lombax’) with the Buck Rogers attire as well as the cute clanking companion in the green-eyed, robotic Clank (channeling the impish and lovable R2D2 from that certain George Lucas-directed worldwide cinematic sensation from yesteryear?).

Our galactic good guys look to save the universe and the avid youngish video game fanatics will eat this fun-loving fantasy up with moon dust soup. Unfortunately, **‘Ratchet & Clank’** musters up a tepid by-the-numbers frenzy that will predictably hold the munchkins’ imaginative attention. As for others, the hyper hairball and his trusty tin can tag-along get lost in the shuffle of this somewhat serviceable but sluggish cartoon pie-in-the-sky popcorn pleaser for the little ones at large.

Directors Kevin Monroe’s and Jerrica Cleland’s spotty spunk captures the loose lunacy and spirited sauciness on occasion where even the movie’s poster promises to ‘kick some asteroid’. It is too bad that the breezily bland storytelling cannot overcome its conventional confines as one may get a more stimulating kick engaging in the actual video game than viewing this kinetic crater kiddie showcase without much distinction or creative plucking pop. Basically, **‘Ratchet & Clank’** is safe and generic but never grabs the challenging aspects behind its one-note presentation in good versus evil–something that may in fact be a clichéd overload even for those tykes out there begging for these amiable planetary protectors to bring something fresh outside of its gaming inspiration.

The youthful mechanic Ratchet (voiced by James Arnold Taylor who also provided the voicing duties in the video game) is a dreamer with heroic plans to join the prestigious glory-seeking Galactic Rangers. Specifically, the Galactic Rangers are known for their courageous crime-fighting activities on Ratchet’s home planet. Ratchet’s lofty ambition to hook up with the Galactic Rangers is somewhat alarming to his boss and mentor Grimroth (John Goodman) who is not too thrilled with his employee’s/protege’s questionable expectations. The Galactic Rangers are currently recruiting for skilled members to collaborate with them and expand the elite unit. For the star-eyed Ratchet this is a golden opportunity to become a starry-eyed superhero reaching for acceptance and self-importance.

In the meanwhile, a treacherous tyrant known as Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti) is the galaxy’s menacing madman and one of the main reasons why the Galactic Rangers are nursing the thoughts of growing their interstellar roster of crime-stoppers. Drek is out of control as he has been destroying planets left and right. Naturally, the dastardly Drek needs to be stopped in his hideous mission to castrate and conquer. Drek’s calculating cronies include his second-in-command robot Victor (Sylvester Stallone) and ominous scientific aide Dr. Nefarious (Armin Shimerman from TV’s “Star Trek Deep Space Nine”). They are instrumental in creating killer robots whose sole purpose is out to eradicate the celebrated do-gooder Galactic Rangers. Of course this begs the question: does Ratchet really know what he is getting into regarding his heralded aspirations to become a Galactic Ranger?

It would take a pint-sized turncoat from Drek’s robotic renegades in the form of defective and rejected Clank (voiced by David Kaye) to escape the mechanical baddies and whisper the devious goings-on to the noble Galactic Rangers. The initial meeting of Ratchet and the British-sounding Clank is incidental but when they thwart the sneak attack initiated by Drek’s tin-plated terrorists the pair are invited into the applauded team’s inner circle courtesy of the tandem’s rescuing efforts. Galactic Ranger head honcho Captain Quark (Jim Ward) has his doubts about the eager talented twosome but the other members embrace Ratchet and Clank with open arms. Still, the common goal is to eliminate Drek and his horrible henchmen Dr. Nefarious and Victor from orchestrating the ruination of their jeopardized universe.

Although showing some spunk and off-balance wittiness,   **Ratchet & Clank** feels notoriously recycled as it obviously borrows from other animated fodder while tapping into the all-too-familiar Star Wars mantra that features a young adventurer from a distant planet thriving to save the galaxy from sinister forces. There are colorful action sequences and gun-toting shenanigans that will entertain the impish kiddies as they engage in the elaborate space battles. Both leading lads Ratchet and especially the merry-minded, metal-plated Clank will come off as an adorable yet oddball duo to behold. The villainy of Drek and his devious drones will probably spark the giddiness in the wide-eyed youngsters. The common sense behind Ratchet & Clank is to arm the movie’s presentation with the feel and feisty-oriented flavor of its video game blueprint. If that is the case then why bother serving up a family fantasy on the big screen if it cannot separate occasionally from its vintage gamer blueprint?

Curiously, the fast-paced hit-and-miss jokes and the spry-looking makeup of this kid-approved cosmic caper is a passable revelation for a movie representing a fourteen-year old video game from yesteryear. Also, the notable names behind the characterizations in **Ratchet & Clank** seem to give some measure of breezy joy to their on-screen roles. Celebrity voices instilled in the fired-up female warriors consist of the likes of Rosario Dawson’s Alaris and Bella Thorne’s Cora which evoke the recent reminiscences of Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ Daisy Ridley’s heroine Rey. Consequently, all these factors mentioned in the rousing yet rudimentary Ratchet & Clank boils down to just another basic and tiresome “good-against-evil” gimmick for the chorus of the kid-watching crowd.

It is a given that **Ratchet & Clank** will be a spell-binding spectacle to the young viewers but for the rest of us let’s hope that a nostalgic rerun of Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space will suffice for our adequate needs blocking out the fire-power crafty cat and his diminutive autotron sidekick.

**(c) Frank Ochieng** || **Space warriors, mad scientist, chosen one and saving the planet.**

I might have heard the name, but seems nothing familiar. So it is very much like my first encounter with these game characters. And this is really a good first film, I enjoyed, but did not like, because I'm not the target audience. I know, many grown-ups liked it, but they had reasons like they have known this for some time. One thing that fascinated me was the production quality. I can't believe, it was not those silly B class animation, it was very much comparable to Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks films. The only thing that did not favour it was the story. If they have got that part right, it would have been one of the best animations of the years.

So the truth is I tempted to rate it higher for the quality of animation alone. The directors, and all artists must be praised for that. If I were a kid, it would have been my favourite. So what I'm saying it, this film will be loved by children. There's not child film critic, otherwise this film would have been appreciated better. The problem is the critics did not like it, and so the adults, but families with kids might have chance to enjoy it.

Some of the big names in the voice-over artist list, but that did not help the film to see its success. There's no innovation in it, everything you see in the film was already exploited in other films. All those the space warriors thing, the chosen one, villain, mad scientist, betrayal, you have seen them from 'Star wars' to 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. That is another reason for not having a good time with it. It is still very much a watchable film.

It all began from this year's Oscars, I saw this pair for the first time and I knew its their film promotion strategy. So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.

It is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.

It was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.

It's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.

8/10 || I've never been a Ryan Gosling fan. No movie ever before has come as close to turning me around in that than _The Nice Guys_.

Director Shane Black is in top form with broad appeal, terrific performances, and honestly more humour than anything I've seen in years.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || Waltons, Poronography, Tricky Dicky, Hitler, Equanimity, Bumble Bees ... And Stuff!

The Nice Guys is directed by Shane Black and Black co-writes the screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi. It stars Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling and Angourie Rice. Music is by John Ottman and David Buckley and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.

1977 Los Angeles and a private detective and a muscle for hire enforcer wind up on the same case looking for a missing girl. Can opposites really attract? More importantly, can they survive not just the perils of a case that gets murkier the longer it goes on? But also each other?

I don't care if Colonel Mustard did it in the study with a candlestick. I just wanna know who he did it with and get the pictures.

How wonderful to have had Shane Black back in his comfort zone and producing such a joyful buddy buddy neo-noir of considerable substance. It was eleven years since the superb Kiss Kiss Bang Bang had reminded us that Black had few peers when it came to blending high action macho twosomes who are also armed with sharp tongues to match, this was after all the guy who also penned Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. The idea for The Nice Guys had sat in gestation for a number of years, finally it was unleashed to reward fans of his work and for those in sync with the style of film making he homages.

Much like his other buddy scriptings, we are in the company of two mismatched guys. Gosling's ex-cop Holland March is a bit goofy, afraid of the sight of blood and morally bankrupt. Crowe's muscle for hire Jackson Healy beats people up for money, but he's a stand-up guy, likes his pet fish, even has a hero streak. What binds them together is troubled family baggage, that they are both men in search of a better world, to be better men themselves, and thus Black - to give them a chance of life improvement - pitches them into the seamy underbelly of the L.A. pornography industry - with some corruption elsewhere thrown into the equation.

As a coupling March and Healy prove to be a riot. Crowe is menacing and funny with it, Gosling is affably flaky but charm personified, and thankfully both men have a knack for visual comedy (see Gosling's Lou Costello homage and Crowe's reaction to a henchman's act of fish murder). Crucially both actors can deliver killer lines, which is an absolute must for a Shane Black inspired production, for here there is never any let up, zingers are unbound. Then there is Rice (superb and actually the third lead in the play) as March's 13 year old daughter, she's got youthful zest and a killer matter of fact skill in reacting smartly to the two men currently dominating her life.

The L.A. of the 70s is expertly designed, all blink blink blinkity blink neon lighting, side-burns and disco music, dubious fashions and protest groups protesting about the most mundane of things. Then you got the pornography angle, the 70s a hot-bed (no pun intended) for the sex sells profiteers, the perfect setting for Black to trawl through it all in noir clobber. As a noir piece it has it all, femme fatales, thugs, conspiracies, voice overs and an array of colourfully odd characters (excitable and troubling henchmen, a porno Pinocchio, a young lad willing to flash the contents of his underpants for cash!). And of course there's mysteries to be solved and rocks to be upturned, all of which is played out in a whirl of stylish violence, situational comedy and fluid camera work.

Black kind of wants it all, to stay cool whilst having wry observations on the Americana of the era, and he enjoys going close to the knuckle when he can, which to some (not me) will come off as a shock value humour tactic just to ruffle feathers. It's also a minor itch that he sort of snatches from his previous works in search of reassurance - note for instance the similarities between the opening to Lethal Weapon and here with The Nice Guys. But itches be damned, so much fun and hidden dramatic depth on show here, a real treasure that makes you wish Black would stroll down neo-noir lane a bit more often. Don't believe me? Then may Richard Nixon come after you the next time you go for a swim in the pool! 9/10"

And it is nice to see the pristine Science-Fiction Future. Star Wars sort of did away with that in favor of the ""lived in,"" Science Fiction sets complete with scruffy floors and filthy walls. And that Lived In universe became so popularized that it is really hard to find the pristine universe.

And I am sort of partial to that. It might even be more accurate. I mean, my wife tried to get a little robot to clean our floors so now I do all the vacuuming because when the machines take over, I'm not getting whacked by a dust buster. I want a T-800 to have to take me out.

A T-800 also took the lived in future to a post apocalyptic cesspool, which was also just amazing on screen and made for a killer story.

I don't really care, I like all the themes, but Buck Rogers was so clean they wore white. It was like they were walking around in the gloves my mother wore to make sure my room was up to her military brat standards.

And I might be joking a little, but that is a universe all to itself, it's a future all to itself, and it actually helps take you to a different world for a little while. It was set in an environment that I could lose myself in, with cheap robots that only hard core Sci-Fi fans could love.

And then they went ahead and they made it fun to watch. Technically it wasn't the fx marvel that Star Wars was, but it had it's own heart, it had it's own humor, it had it's own mythology, it's own world, and it turned out to be pure escapist fun.

Which, honestly, is why I watch movies and what movies SHOULD be made to do. So I'm giving it 10 of 10, because it was pure entertainment...

... but it should be a little lower. I sort of feel that Sci-Fi needs to find a philosophy and cling to it, examine it, use it to set up the rules to the new universe it's exploring, or offer some sort of heavily veiled social commentary... and this doesn't do either. So it misses that mark, it misses that necessary trope.

But it brings entertainment to the table and that is all I ask for in a movie. It's fun to watch, so mission accomplished."

The Russian disaster film, partially inspired by the 1980 film of the same name. One of the film to do good business outside the domestic market, particularly in Japan and China. So there are lots of great stuff about it, from filmmaking to the box office and I enjoyed watching it, but did not like it as overwhelmingly. That does not mean it is overrated, but I liked it less, that's all.

It is set to tell the story of life of pilots, their personal life, such as trouble with romance, family issues and tackling obstacles in their professional line, especially when they were needed the most. So in the first half it was all about drama, an introduction to what comes in the latter half. A pilot father struggling with his troublesome teen son. And another pilot who got fired from the Russian air force, now in a private airline where he meets a woman, but having a difficulty to stabilise the relationship.

When the second half begins, the narration completely flips. Like it is a different film, particularly brings attention to the action- adventure fans. Fate brings them all together in a plane and they decide to evacuate people who are stranded in an airport near the Alaskan region island when it was hit by volcanoes and a series of earth quicks. The remaining is to reveal the heroic acts by the pilots and Co.

> ""He's a pilot gifted by God. My hands are only hands, his hands are wings. I have never seen anyone like this before.""

Visually, it was good. All those crucial parts of the graphics were rendered neatly. Even the stunt sequences were composed so well. But some of them were unrealistic. That's very common, even for a Hollywood film, so I think it's not a big deal. My issue was the film length. It was over two hours long and I did not like much of the first part. The next half was quite good, because of its thriller. When I thought it's over, the narration surprised with another adventure followed by in the final segment.

Like usual this Russian film too has been built on the corruption plot. Not the whole film, but in the initial stage. The influenced people who target the honest employees for going against them. Really a good theme, but when the disaster part takes over, everything will be forgotten. Then it gets edgy, so that's where you will forget the time and sit straight to enjoy it. If you had seen plenty of similar heroic films, then it will be another okayish type. If not, you will have a good time with it.

It took an hour to get into action-adventure, but in those times, it failed to build the romance part to its best. I'm disappointed with that since it had fine actors and situation to build on. The Father- son duo looked much better. In the second half, nothing of these sentimentally appealed as it should have been, not for me. Because it became more a heroic type with sacrifice than family and relationship influence. So overall it's a good attempt, a nice film for the weekend watch.

I'm sure you have seen shark attack films like 'Jaws', 'Deep Blue Sea' et cetera, and yep this another one to add to that collection. But this was something very neatly done, I mean for the most of the parts. Looked so real, so I thought it might end up top among its similar theme. In the end, I was little disappointed, because of the shark. The portrayal of shark was very natural, until the last half an hour. Then it becomes the common film gimmick when the animal was obsessed to kill its target at any cost.

I am a huge animal fan, but I have never seen a live shark in my life and that does not mean I don't know anything about them. Thanks to the nature television networks and what I saw in this film was very disappointing if you love wild animals. I am not supporting the shark here, I'm just talking about its behaviour. It was not right, other than that, I definitely enjoyed the film. In fact, except the final few minutes, since the shark got pumped up, I had no issue and the best shark attack film. But the final battle ruined overall favour I'm going to give to it, what I thought this film deserved.

Great location, and Blake Lively was unbelievably awesome. In the initial part, she was very sexy, but once the narration shifted its focus on surfing and later shark attack, everything changed. The entire film was edgy, I think very nicely written screenplay. It was a limited cast film and nearly the whole film takes place very close to the shore. A good start, neatly maintained mid part, but a below par conclusion, that's what I think about the film. Slightly missed to be a great film in the line of '127 Hours'. In fact, this looks like a sea version of that film. But I still recommend it, because it's worth.

Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.

Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.

The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.

> ❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞

So, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.

But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.

The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.

Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!

_8/10_ || Talk about the best laid plans! This is a cracking, sexy, thriller set in Korea during the Japanese occupation of the 1930s. It centres around the charming, butter-wouldn't-melt ""Sook-Hee"" (Tae Ri Kim) who takes a job attending the wealthy ""Lady Hideko"" (Kim Min-hee). She lives on a grand estate with her cantankerous uncle ""Kouzuki"" (Cho Jin-woong) and is frankly rather low maintenance for her new maid. Pretty quickly, though, we begin to smell a rat! Is she what she seems, and what has the obviously duplicitous ""Count"" (Ha Jung-woo) got to do with things? Well gradually, we find out that there are schemes afoot to rob the lady of her fortune, her liberty - even her mind. What the plotting didn't take account for, though, was human nature. A bond gradually starts to build between the two women, a bond of friendship, of trust - of love! What happens next...? This benefits hugely from having a tightly-knit cast who work well together; a solid and intriguing story that marries the Machiavelian with the mischievous, the sexy with the sordid - and, it looks great too. The characters vacillate from being likeable, kinky, and often pretty loathsome in equal measure, but somehow there is always a sense that right will be done! I loved the ending, and the performances from the two women are engaging and captivating. Some of it isn't for the squeamish, but it flew by, is expertly crafted, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2016/5/15/the-bfg.html || **Little Sophie's giant adventure.**

I did not dislike it, but I thought it was not creative enough. I had seen the British animation and this one retained the same story. Of course, which was originally from the book, but nothing new other than a decent computer graphics. I liked the performance of the little girl who had played the Sophie. She was the only live character until the final stage where more joins her. So she was wonderful along with Mark Rylance's CGI role.

Straight to the point, the adventure begins right away. Sophie, the ten year old orphan girl was snatched by a giant named BFG after she witnessed him wandering on the street through her dorm room window on one midnight. Fearing she might expose the giant's existence, so he had to take her with him to his country. Then there they become very close, but a new threat arises when the other giants suspect of a human's existence in their enclosure. So fighting them, followed by a permanent solution to menace caused by them is what narrated in the rest.

It was like Peter Jackson's 'The Lovely Bones' for Steven Spielberg, I mean the films that did not work for them. I anticipated a major surge in this by the family film specialist Spielber. Because I usually love his film, tell me who won't. From children to adults, his films targets all ages. But if you had seen the old version, then you will lose half the interest. That's definitely won't be the same for the kids, they will love it. There's no harm for watching it once, so go for it.

_6/10_ || The animated '89 version of _The BFG_ was a staple of my youth, so naturally I was excited for a Steven Spielberg redo. Unfortunately, I don't think the tale lends itself well to the live action format. That, or the hands making this piece were unable to concentrate the narrative to where it went. In either case, the end product is a film with many tiny endearing moments of nostalgia that at no point come together to create a laudable whole.

Based on the nearly 150 years old children's book, and a sequel to the 2010 film. Its quite a long gap for a follow up film, but the original cast has returned and directed by 'The Muppets' famed filmmaker. So, I was not expecting it since I considered the first film an average. All I wanted was a normal live-action 'Alice in Wonderland' films, but I disliked this weird make-ups and large head characters. In that perspective, this one was much better. Still, this is not the best, but definitely a lot better than the previous one.

A simple adventure story with nice graphics and performances. The Alice returns to the Wonderland for a new adventure where she has to cross the layers of the present, past and future. So in one word, this is a time travel theme in the fantasy genre. Mia Wasikowska ruled it, she was everywhere. She overran all other characters and takes the toughest challenge to achieve impossible.

Nearly a two hour journey into wonderland might make happy for little kids. Because it did not look like a normal fairytale, but very modern. This is not the Disney's best film, so I don't think there will be any more sequel. I want it to be rebooted, but not any time soon, at least a decade of gap needed. So I hope they won't rush and ruin this classic tale like three 'Spiderman' reboots in less than 20 years. Meantime, this film is okay for watching once, though I'm not in favour to recommend it to anybody except little children.

_6/10_ || A step down from the 2010 film, but <em>'Alice Through the Looking Glass'</em> is a solid film nonetheless.

I enjoyed seeing this plot, largely about time, play out. The film is CGI heavy, but does look great for the vast majority. The cast are good, with Mia Wasikowska leading well and surrounded by the likes of Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.

I do think the film could've been slightly shorter, with better pacing and less emphasis on the 'real world' stuff featuring Alice. The looking glass entry isn't as interesting/magical as the rabbit hole, also.

Far superior to the 1998 adaptation of this 1871 Lewis Carroll novel, that's for certain. || I like sequels when the characters come into there own. Better then the 1st."

How many R rated animated films have you seen? This is not a hentai, but the Hollywood's rare animated-adult-comedy. Most of the big names are here, especially the young generation. The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.

If you check the last two decade's records, the animation films tore apart the live-action films in the box office clash. It is shocking, but the fact that animations make good revenue. This film is a trend setter in animation genre that targets the adult audience. Like Hollywood found its counterpart from the Japanese hentai. It just cost only $20 million to make and the production quality was not very standard, but acceptable. Hope there will be more like this in the future, but I would seek a sequel for this.

Seth Rogen was the main man behind this film. The rest of the cast too was good. Nothing but theirs voice lending made all the difference, especially you would know who were who, while a watch, that kind of familiar it was. The story of supermarket products from all the categories who fight for their freedom.

I really enjoyed, it was short too, as well as a fast narration with some good adult jokes. There are a couple of negatives about it, like the first one was there's no innovation in it, like it is very familiar, but a different kind of comedy. And the next one was all the characters, I mean the supermarket products are American. So if you are a non-American, nearly 90 per cent you won't get what those items are. The adults should watch this, because I don't know when you will get another one like this in the future. So I definitely favour it.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || The plot of this movie is not exactly a new one. Robots created by humans, created to learn, decides to do things their way. The way of robots is usually detrimental to the health of any humans nearby. When the robots in question happens to be combat robots then shit is about to hit the fan … big time!

It sounds pretty good. The problem is that I found the implementation rather mediocre.

It starts off looking rather good with scenes of Mills in the company head quarters and a few cool scenes showing off her eye implants. The movie then moves on to present the military squad that are about to have an unpleasant first hand experience of the “robot way”.  Unfortunately the writer fell for the all too boring and cheap plot element of making the commander an asshole who looks down on anyone who is not a marine grunt. Sigh.

Then it is quickly off to the island training facility. After the obligatory banter between the marines and Mills in the rather bizarre and not very believable transport ship it is time for some action as the marines deploy.

The rest of the movie is pretty much a long sequence alternating between shot outs between the troops and the robots and moments of reflection. The behavior of this so called elite marine squad is amateurish. The robots are underwhelming. What especially ticked me off was that the robots did not seem to be able to hit anything except by pure luck. And these were supposed to be high tech stuff. The marines even use simple smoke to evade them. What the fuck? Advanced killer robots in the future that relies on visual and cannot shoot straight? That is disappointing to say the least.

Of course there had to be a big shootout in the end. Unfortunately it was just more of what we had seen before. Robots shooting, and missing, wildly. The marines killing them off in rather large, but not sufficiently large, numbers. Finally someone thought about using EMP charges. However here the writer comes up with another stupid plot element. Implants that were not immediately hurt by an EMP pulse but would slowly degrade afterwards and, just for good measure, erase the human memories of the implanted person as well. Contrived and stupid as far as I am concerned.

The end? Well about as meh as you could expect from a low budget sci-fi/horror movie wannabe. The movie was not outright bad and it did have some interesting ideas but it was pretty clear that it was on a budget with constraints. The writing, the robot designs which seemed to be done by someone caring only about visual appearance and not if the design actually made sense, dragged down the movie."

This is from a supporting actor turned a director who is just one film old before this. So he wrote and directed this beautiful film. One of the best films of the years that should be in must see list. It was just like the film 'Alabama Moon', only the initial plot that extended for over the hundred minutes. The first thing is the cast, it was the best combination. Lots of future stars are here. It was more like a road movie, except in the opening few minutes.

I did not like the entire film, I found a couple of things uncomfortable. Like the killing a deer in the opening scene and the end part. The conclusion was good, I thought it was the best solution for such a story, not for the theme. But then the final shot gave me an impression that they had got compromised. After all these years hard work, I felt they had given up. That did not stop me from enjoying it and recommending it to the others. Still, it is a very unique film that tried its best to avoid the usual cliché.

This is the story of a father of six kids, raising them by his own outside the society in the wilderness. But the children are not left behind on the knowledge of the world, especially the philosophies theirs favourite topic. They are bright, as well as tough and can survive in any condition. One day when they get a message that their mother died, the journey begins to attend the funeral and during their way all the adventures are what we're going to witness.

Due to the copyright issue the birthday song was altered. Surprisingly, the film was not based on any book. So my utmost appreciation goes to the creator of this wonderful product. Surely it will be a cult classic. It has lots of great dialogue, and bold revelations in a simple way about the facts of the world. Especially like related to the sex and other grown up stuffs clarifying the little kids' doubts.

At some point I thought it was okay for the kids to watch with their parents, but it did not get better on that perspective. I mean having lots of main characters as children, the film is not good for their watch. Though the adults should not miss it, even though you are a religious person or any other kind. So highly recommended by me.

A new film from the writer, director of 'The Chaser' and 'The Yellow Sea'. This time its a horror-thriller that focused on a rural police officer who witnesses a series of strange events escalating fears among its people. The original title was 'Goksung', which means the name of the village where this story takes place. This film is specially for those who like Korean films. But I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it equally. Very typical Korean film yet an engaging theme and thrilling, particularly towards the final quarter.

The opening, and almost the first act were like a black comedy. That does remain same after sometime. Because they wanted to give an impression what kind of person is this story's lead man. He's a cop, but feared of supernatural stuffs. So one day, he gets an early morning call to head where a family was slaughtered by one of its members. In his small village, with a small population, events like this are very rare, but when another similar incident was reported, ruled out what it was considered, but something else beyond humans.

After the strange dreams, he comes to know his family too got affected by it, particularly his young daughter. Followed by when it gets serious issue, the family decides to bring in a shaman and so the ceremony begins to free her from whatever possessed. This is where the film turns more aggressive in revealing following event with twists and turns. The rest of the film should be watched to know how it all ends.

The first thing was the film length. It was too long, nearly 150 minutes, but the screenplay filled with many enthralling scenes and dialogues. So I don't think sitting for that long would be an issue for most of the people. Surely you will be on your seat edge most of the time on your watch. Good story, but very confusing. I mean not puzzling way, but the events and its characters, especially the conclusion which is not exactly a perfect one with proper detail. So you might look for some clarifications after watching the film.

> ""If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch? He's just fishing. Not even he knows what he'll catch.""

The concept was a little confusing like what kind of horror is this. At one stage there comes a zombie, but it follows right after an exorcism on a girl possessed by a ghost. The writer used the time as long as he wants to develop them. So the narration was slow, but very steady on its direction going deep. If you are good at Korean films, the style they make, you might predict some of the scenes correctly. Like I said the final few minutes might confuse you, but really well done part if you understand that clearly.

The film characters wise, I liked how it all connected at the end. But as a story, the solution did not seem right. I think not the fitting one or more convincing. I know who would you root, I mean most of you back what character, so from that perspective, feels it compromised a bit after put up a stern fight with what they had believed. I liked how culturally this story was narrated. I mean as its set in a small village, the ceremonies to fight the evil spirit was conducted traditional way, not the western style, except it opened with a quote from the bible.

The actors were perfect, particularly I liked where it was shot. A fine location to mix horror and cop themes. The suspense keeps the film alive, but you won't always looking at that, because the theme expands quite bigger than you expect. There are some unexpected turns, you might find yourself scratching your head for how deep it could go.

Don't worry, in the end, it all comes together, or maybe watching it twice could help you with that. As I said the runtime might not favour you for the second viewing. Besides, pay a good attention while watching it for the first time, then you will get everything. Particularly if you are an animal lover, that's a biggest clue you could get in this film.

I think it will be one of the best horror you would find around the world this year. It might get remade elsewhere, but the chances are less and it could remain as one of the Korean classics in the line of many others like 'Memories of Murder'. You don't have to be a Korean film fan or this director's, but if you do, surely you will have an advantage in understanding it clearly and like it more than the others. Definitely it is one of the best Korean films, but I don't think so a must see, not according to me. Though I won't conclude my review without recommending it to you. So I say watch it.

_7.5/10_ || Watching ""The Wailing"" is quite an undertaking. With a runtime of almost 3 hours this Korean Horror-Triller is a shear beast. Unfortunately I feel like pretty much more than half the runtime should have been cut. ""The Wailing"" circles around in a seemingly endless ""who done it"" or, to be more precise, ""who is it"" and even though the acting of our lead Do-won Kwak was not too bad, the dialogues bothered me constantly. I find myself repeating this for about every Asian movie and I assume it must be a cultural thing. I mostly find the talk so generic and pointless, that you could reduce some movies to 5-10 important lines and let them be quiet for the entire rest of the runtime. And this movie is no different. The best acting performance was delivered by Jun Kunimura, who not only presented a great play with mimic, but also refused to talk much (I bet he knew I would appreciate that). The cinematography was pretty good and I liked the realistic appearing gore effects. Not so much on the ""possessed zombies"" but therefore on the crime scenes and such. With that many pro's and con's ""The Wailing"" ends up somewhere in the middle and can therefore be labeled average. || I don't often use the word masterpiece. I've seen 1,040 films in my life, totalling 1,549 hours of filmography. There's maybe 7 I would label a masterpiece with full usage and definition of the word.

The Wailing is the eighth film of one thousand and forty films I very willingly, gladly and without hesitation give the title of Masterpiece to.

I'm not too big of a fan of Asian supernatural horror. Whilst I very much enjoy it and give most films a pretty decent average rating, I find a lot of them bleed into one another with similar plots and a very safe view on the supernatural. In Japan it tends to be curses that have people die in mysterious ways, South Korea, a cursed object that has people murder each other are the most common ones I come across.

When I clicked The Wailing was supernatural, I prepared myself for a 6 or maybe 7 out of 10 movie that was good but wouldn't hold its own too well in the vast expanse of horror.

The Wailing gave me some stunning frames. The cinematography in this is beautiful. The gore frames are gruesome, unadulterated and unapologetic. The ritualism and belief of South Korea are shown in their full glory without fear. Na Hong Jin doesn't shy away from racial tension between the Japanese and South Koreans with a slightly historical take with a beautiful twisting story that left me with my mouth gaping open but still feeling just slightly uncomfortable - something I believe Hong Jin did on purpose. I was shown acting that was so well done, no matter what I watch these actors in from now on, I will always know them from The Wailing. The varying supernatural aspects were unique, something that stunned me, unafraid to step out of genre restrictions and lead the way with something new. With a story line that is intriguing, stunning and just raw, this two and a half hour journey was worth watching.

This is a film deserving of the hype that numerous other Asian horrors got but turned out to be predictable messed. THIS is the Korean horror of 2016, the one that should have lead the forefront of South Korean, or even Asian, horror into 2017. This is a film that shows prowess, promise and skill. Hong Jin treats us to such wonderful skills from not just himself but his script writer, his cast, his editing team, his make up team, etc, everyone involved. You can feel the passion and love and pure dedication that went into this movie.

A full 10/10 is just not enough for this film.

A twisting, numbing, horrifying masterpiece."

I had tough time to figure it out what was the thing on the poster. Seeing it upside down, with mirror, name it, I used all the tricks I know, but nothing had worked. On the other hand, I thought it might be a fantasy film with a King Kong like creature. That's the curiosity it created, people to a have different opinions and forget to expect from the film. But it was a simple comedy-drama and only way to solve the mystery is to watch the film. That's what I finally did.

The opening scene was good. But I did not think the whole film would be like that. It was about a prankster and his attempts to reach his workaholic daughter, which was the entire narration. A lifetime trip for them, that's not about the challenges in the world or the nature, but their self-discovery, the meaning of life and purpose. This is one of the beautiful films to open up about a father and daughter relationship. In the grown-up world, the people forget to live the actual life, when they give all the focus to their professional life.

I have to agree, this is a competitive world and you will be replaced by millions of other waiting behind you for such opportunity. But does it all worth doing is the real question. Doubts like that won't arise without those who love us pointing it out. It needs to be asked properly, politely. But some people take an alternate route like in this film. Sometimes it ends in an unexpected adventure to just realise what they are into. And this film was honest, to reveal as much as it can in many angles.

This is the story of Winfried. An aged and divorced music teacher who makes practical jokes to people around him. After his dog died, he decides to reconnect with his only daughter Ines, who is now working in Romania. She is on the cusp to get her desired position in the office. On her one final push for that, is now getting distracted by her father. She who never understood her father's way of life, tries to get an answer out of him about the life. So that's where their journey begins. Some of the bold steps taken by them, the film accomplishes what it wanted to tell us in a unique way.

> ""The problem is it's so often about getting things done. You do this, You do that. And in the meantime, life just passes by.""

The film was actually loosely based by the director's own father. The writing was brilliant. It reminded me 'Infinitely Polar Bear', because these women directors inspired by their fathers to show the world how their childhood was like. The actors were amazing, particularly those two in the main roles. I liked them both equally. From the different angle, they have given different performances. There's no surprise if you liked the film only because of them.

The film had won many prestigious awards around the globe and now its biggest stand off is at the 2017 Oscars which is a few weeks away. Another Scandinavian film, which is also nominated for the Oscar, is also about an old man like this one. But I think 'Under Sandet' is the frontrunner for the golden statue. Because we all know that America's and Academy's sentimental towards the WWII.

When it comes to rating, the film is strictly for adults. It was good in the initial parts, but there are some surprise nude and sex scenes. At that time I thought it lost its path, but actually that was the turning point where you are going to witness a different half of the film. Surely many people going love the second half more than the first.

At first, it looked like it is a German version of 'The Family Fang', but only more realistic with dark humour. It's difficult to understand every scene, especially in the first watch. Because without knowing the film characters, the events involving them look casual. Capable to get the sense of humour is the key here. So if you decide for the second time viewing, you will learn more about it. It is one of those films that second time watch necessary for some people.

Frankly, I did not think it was a great film, just after finish my watch. But thinking back about all those film events, made sense. By the time I decided to write this review, I was in its favour. That's the reason I won't write about the films right away. This is a great film, but you have to focus closely and understand everything, then you will have a great time. But remember, it is one of the longest film in the recent time, particularly for a comedy-drama, yet enjoyable. Recommended!

_7/10_ || Hmmm. I think it may be a testament to the skill of Peter Simonischek here that I didn't like this film very much, but in any case - I didn't. His daughter ""Ines"" (Sandra Hüller) had made a decent life for herself in the corporate world and the two have become largely estranged. He decides to try and rectify this by travelling to Bucharest where she is working with boss/lover ""Gerald"" (Thomas Loibl). He fancies himself as a bit of a practical joker, does ""Winfried"" but his attempts at humour merely irritate his daughter as they embarrass her and poke fun at the nature - sometimes the quite ruthless nature - of her work. This is just putting even greater strain on their relationship so dad comes up with an even more far-fetch solution. He invents the eponymous character who purports to be their boss's ""life coach"". Donning an ill-fitting suit and the most unconvincing of wigs, he proceeds to trample across her working life. She has two options - and she decides that fighting back is her best and what now ensues sees the pair spat and spar towards a denouement that I felt entirely predictable. There's no doubt that Simonischek's portrayal does get under your finger nails, but it's all just a bit too preposterous for me. He's the diametric opposite of her - his eccentricities and foibles contrasting so starkly with her career-minded focus that it all just came across as overly and sometimes quite cringe-makingly contrived. For some reason, she spends a fair chunk of the latter stages of the film naked whilst he's in gorilla suit. Surreal? Yes - but what's the point? It isn't funny and for her character to have achieved half of what she is portrayed to have done here, she'd have shown him the door (or a police car) ages earlier in the proceedings. Sometimes you have to be on the right wavelength to appreciate something quite this eclectic - but I wasn't on auteur Maren Ade's for this. It does show that Hüller has many strings to her bow, though - there's little she can't turn her hand to and this is just about worth watching to see that skill in action."

Most moviegoers weren’t clamoring for a follow-up to 2013’s smart magic heist thriller “Now You See Me,” but here’s one of the rare instances where the sequel is actually better than the original. While viewing the first film would be helpful before seeing “Now You See Me 2,” it’s not necessary. Even newbies can follow along with this slick magic show.

The Four Horsemen are back, this time fighting the powers that be with even greater illusions. Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt (Woody Harrelson) and Jack (Dave Franco) are now joined by Lula (Lizzy Caplan, a welcome replacement for Isla Fisher as the “girl Horseman”). Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) plays a tech nerd who forces the Horsemen to steal a chip so he can control all of the computers in the entire world — but who is really pulling the curtain? Mark Ruffalo is back as FBI agent and magician Rhodes. Here he still aids the Horsemen (and seeks to find some closure with Thaddeus (Morgan Freeman), a man Rhodes blames for the death of his father). Yes, there’s a lot going on in this convoluted plot, but it is exciting from beginning to end.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie is the elevated performances. I love the trend of casting accomplished actors in fun summer movies; I think audiences get a better movie for it. These are talented actors who visibly enjoyed working together; they play off each other with an effortless believability. Their repartee is lively and their visible enthusiasm for their roles (and the film) is contagious and as a result, I was smiling throughout the whole movie. Harrelson will probably be taking some jabs for his partially silly turn (I don’t want to say how because I don’t want to spoil it), but I thought he was ridiculously amusing. No matter how you feel about the film, you have to agree that these characters are a hoot to spend a few hours with.

As with the first film, this one is packed full of entertaining twists and fun “gotchas!” A lot of it is, of course, ridiculous, but interspersed throughout the flashy trickery are some truly funny and memorable moments. Most of the stunts are CGI animation but even though they are fake, they’re still pretty damn cool. The big finale may be predictable but that makes it no less fun. I love the all of the misdirection this film includes (it’s the perfect homage to real magicians and tricksters), and it’s done in a witty and skilled fashion. Is this film as clever as it thinks it is? No. But so what? It’s a fun, wild ride.

A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com** || **Not seeing what's coming to them, but overcoming is their task to complete.**

I never thought a sequel would be made. Now it seems this will going to be an unstoppable franchise, we could expect more, the next one was official, especially after considering how this film fared at the box office. All the main cast returned with the new ones. I think Daniel Radcliffe was good, first time I had impression like that on him after Harry Potter series. So good to see the two legends, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The rest of the cast was good, but nothing to praise like they have pulled off the impossible. Overall, this is a good follow-up, but not best I was looking for. Though, the writing and direction were decent with some nice Chinese locations.

The story follows after some time where the first one ended. After the biggest heist, now they are back with the new public shows. A new member was included, a female to balance with the existing ones. While performing a show, they had to abort it in the middle when the cops raid them. This time they are tricked by some unknown people and land in a foreign territory. In order to escape from there, they had to play what was instructed to them and so they comply with it. When their boss comes to their rescue, the things around them begin to change. So how it all ends was another twist.

The film was two hours long, but not bad to hook for that long when pace and the story looked better. I'm not fully satisfied, particularly about the China. I know Hollywood found its second home, but that does not mean they have to add China flavour all the time to just make money in China. They might succeed from it, particularly from earning Yuan, but I'm the not happy, the world is not happy about that. You can make full length China subject film, but this kind of altering script is becoming sick. Because all the major films trying to do the same thing. I disliked this from that perspective. So sorry Hollywood, better luck next time.

_5.5/10_ || **Now You See Me (but why would you)**

Stage magic and movies are very much alike. The more convincing, the better. Unfortunately the action in this film, magic tricks, sleight of hand, hypnotizing people, is simply unbelievable - in a bad way. This is not an alternate universe with different rules of physics. This is not a group of super heroes using their powers, this is not a tale of magic becoming reality, this is simply unrealistic garbage.

As for the actors, most notably we have Mark Zuckerberg (played by Lex Luthor) trying to take away the leadership of the ""Horsemen"" from ""Jack"" (played by someone without any screen presence whatsoever). Then we have a new person in the crew, an obnoxious girl, replacing someone from the prequel who I can't remember, because they were just as forgettable as the whole drivel that makes up both stories. We have Woody, Morgan Freeman, Caine, and Harry (Potter). In other words no one likable, unless you like them. Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) also shows his unlikable side.

I tried to keep this on to help me sleep, but during the action scenes they cranked up the volume (as is customary in movies for some reason) so I ended up switching it off.

The extra star I gave is for production value.

If you are a film fanatic or a film critic, then the year never comes to end without watching a film by Woody Allen. He's just a Takashi Miike of the Hollywood, but the thing is he always delivers. He had created his own style of screen presentation like in the line of Wes Anderson and very few others. Uniqueness define his works and so this another romance twisted tale where the first half of the film sets in Los Angeles and the next half in the New York.

A young Jewish American wants to try his luck in the Hollywood seeks help from his uncle who's a popular an busiest agent in the film industry. He falls in love with his uncle's personal assistant, but she reveals she already has a boyfriend who's away now. After some twists in the tale, it becomes a romance-triangle. Who gets who and how it all ends brings the curtain to the film.

Like usual Woody Allen's background narration had an important role in the storytelling and all those romance troubles were quite nicely told. It opened so well, developed at its best in the middle, but it did not end on a high. I did not like the conclusion, or the last 10-15 minutes. But thankfully it avoided giving out the usual stuff and the end credits rolled up before clearing the situation in the story. That's one of the way to finish it off, which is obviously not clever like lots of films does that same trick. Whatever, still the film is worth a watch, because of the decent story and great performances, and obviously for Woody Allen.

My initial thought was this is a new version of 'Weekend at Bernie's', but very soon I realised it is not. This film is a bit disgusting. Watching alone makes okay or with the close buddies, but not good for beyond that. I totally appreciate the effort and obviously the fresh idea for a film from the Hollywood, but the film is not a masterpiece or entertaining. Because a plot like this is not worth for a 90 minute stretch. It should have been a short film or the story should have developed to a better one.

There are lots of questions regarding the film. The film did not detail everything it showed, so that's the first negative about it. It opened with a young man stranded on a tiny island who tries to commit suicide, but abandons the plan and takes a weirdest ride in the sea seeking land to get rescued by its people. Though he's not alone, a strange young man accompanies him. So it's like theirs journey of self-discovery, but how it all ends is the crucial final segment.

Both the young actors were good in theirs very challenging roles, particularly Daniel Radcliffe. The directors too to be praised for managing to pull it off so well. But it was the screenplay that did not deliver as I anticipated. The film was different, but nothing impressive at all, so I think it is good for watching at once. Maybe if I understand or get the answers for my doubts, I might change might stance. For now this is an average film.

_5/10_ || <em>'Swiss Army Man'</em> is bonkers, but then I expected it to be so having seen this directing duo's most recent flick; 2022's <em>'Everything Everywhere All at Once'</em>. It does, at least to me, feel a little thin in parts, though it all ends up coming together nicely.

I only knew that Daniel Radcliffe was in this, Paul Dano was not someone I was expecting to see make an appearance. The casting is great though, both of them are excellent all the way through. At no point was I wishing to see any other characters, those two are perfectly enough.

A movie that makes fart jokes work - if that's not the best compliment to receive, then I don't know what is. It's absurd, but fantastically so. Oh, and its got neat music, love ""A Better Way""."

It's true that Sandler had lost his Midas touch, but last few films suggest he's back. Still, he's not the same old what he used to be. The time has changed, so he has to adapt to it and I think he's doing okay. Only haters/film critics keep hating him. This is a Netflix production and Sandler in a mysterious role. He teams up with his old school friend and they fake their deaths to begin a new life. But the identities they have borrowed ones are even in the bigger troubles which begins to haunt them as well. So coming out of it is the remaining film to tell.

The storyline seems just okay. Since it is not fresh enough, they did not even overuse the concept to build plot with clichés. Kind of guessable twists, but it will work for most of the people. Better stunt sequences for such a comedy flick. Good performances and it was a smooth sail according to the film's pace. The director and Sandler had given a few good comedies back then, and this fresh collaboration was decent. So don't believe the film critics (Rotten Tomatoes & Metacritic), elsewhere it is rated much better, but still somewhat underrated. If you are seeking a decent action-comedy, this is worth a try.

Another great addition to the franchise, I completely enjoyed. The first thing is the pace, it was so fast, from opening to the end, non-stop actions and comedies. I regret that I was not able to watch this in digital 3D, other than that, this is a wonderful film for TMNT fans. I know, some people downgrading it, but don't believe them, it is just a fine film if not an awesome as I'm praising, particularly keeping in my mind the common people. So watch this for entertainment and it will deliver for sure.

There are some flaws, but I did not care about them, because it was not a documentary film or even a sci-fi film, it's just a fun-action film. So everything was aimed to bring laughs and it did successfully. If you go with science, then this is a nonsense film. Anyway, the vfx was very impressive, the CGI characters looked even better than the previous one. Don't compare it with the DC or Marvel's films, it is setting up its own trend. Like those new additions, Rhino and Warthog characters were seems more like reading a comic book, straight outta from the sketches.

Excellent follow-up and expecting another sequel in the next two years. The director of 'Earth to Echo' did a great job, and also all the actors. Little disappointed was the villain. I expected some strong confrontation between the heroes and the bad guys which was a let down. Though, all the stunt sequences were well designed. Those clichés like a mad scientist, alien invasion, hole in the sky et cetera, did not stop me from having a good time. Surely I would watch it one more time, just for entertainment, that's what this film is good at. I suggest you as well to watch it if you're seeking the same.

_8/10_ || I cannot say that I had high hopes for this movie. It was a must buy for my collection since I had the first movie already and the kids wanted to see it anyway so yesterday when the kids where at my place we sat down to watch it.

It is definitely a movie for the younger audience. My two youngest kids had quite a few laughs while watching it and there was one ore two that entertained even me.

Otherwise this movie is a rather messy concoction of loads and loads of CGI, action, stunts, cheesy comments and silly acting. It borders on being a slapstick movie. It is rather unbelievable but Megan Fox was the one of the main actors that did the most serious performance in the movie.

The enjoyment of this movie is pretty much the CGI action, ludicrous stunts, primarily by the turtles, plenty of explosions and gadgets. The turtles garbage truck was rather fun for example. Silly but fun.

As an adult be prepared to leave you brain in idle and try to enjoy the cinematic magic that went into this movie. Then you might find it slightly enjoyable or at least not a total waste of time. || *** This review may contain spoilers ***

I was indifferent to the first TMNT movie. It was okay; it could have been better. It could have also been far worse.

So, there was some apprehension going into TMNT: Out of the Shadows, because, traditionally, sequels were worse than their parent films.

Well, Turtles wasn't. The second film is actually much better than the first. It still has hard- to-digest action sequences right out of Michael Bay's wet dreams, but this one also had some heart. It had a theme. 

Being a teenager is difficult enough without, one, having to shoulder the burden of saving the city from an evil ninja, and, two, being forced to hide from the very society they are protecting. The TMNT concept practically begs to touch on things like teen angst, and the feeling of being an outcast that almost all teens feel at some point. But, because they're mutant turtles, this would of course be magnified 10 times. 

But the franchise, in its various incarnations, hardly addresses this. But the new Turtle film does. It appeals to the sensibilities of people who recall the awkwardness of being a teenager. This movie actually says something.

There are some flaws, however. Shredder and Krang meet for the first time, Krang proposes an alliance, Shredder accepts. At no point does Shredder flip out while a talking brain rambles on about his plans for world domination. At no point does Shredder question Krang. He is a banished evil warlord. Why would Shredder trust him?

Megan Fox, unfortunately, is still a thing.

Would have been nice to have Casey Jones truer to his original character.

But where the film works is in the script, and, particularly, the scenes with the Turtles, sans their human friends.

And then there's Rocksteady and Bebop. We 80's kids have been waiting 26 years to have them on screen, and, when it finally happens, it doesn't disappoint. There's an interesting dynamic at play with them: While the Turtles yearn for acceptance and to be human, Rocksteady and Bebop, former humans, are happy to be monsters.

I guess the ooze is always on greener on the other side.

But a pretty good Turtle movie overall, and a lot of fun."

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._ || **A fun film, but also very sensible.**

The title clearly says it is a parody of 'Justin Bieber: Never Say Never'. I haven't seen that, but this film was so fun. Just like another 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story'. If you like the combination of music and comedy, this is for you. I think the writing was the best thing, even the lyrics of the songs. The directors did their part very well, but in the end it was the actors who saved the film. Andy Samberg was splendid.

The film was narrated in a documentary style like a series of interviews which also includes behind scenes, I mean unedited clips like the live recording. It is the story of three members of a famous band in America. When everything was going well for them, the split happens unexpectedly. So the main singer decides to go solo and sees some success. But he struggles through his girlfriend and their marriage plans, and also he finds some issue with his manager. You know the makeover begins, how he comes back to his normal life was the remaining film.

It is not anybody's biography, but you should still watch it. The storytelling is not preoccupied with the drugs and sexes, though there are some amounts, which makes it is good viewing for the adults. Don't think it is some silly comedy, lots of things from it makes sense. You can enjoy the music and at a time you would have some laughs. Well balanced contents and overall it is a rare comedy.

259693.0,The Conjuring 2,Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits.,The next true story from the case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren.,Horror,134.0,2016-06-08,en,7.293,8658.0,15.9949,"Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Lauren Esposito",James Wan,"london, england, england, 1970s, spirit, single mother, demon, paranormal investigation, demonic possession, ghost, christmas, valak, the conjuring universe","**This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.**

First of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.

A family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.

The one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.

_7.5/10_ || I know I'm in the minority on this, but I actually preferred it to the original.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || I'm giving this half a star more than I gave the first movie. As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background ""monster"" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.

Ultimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.

Again, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story. Take it with a massive grain of salt."
245913.0,Pelé: Birth of a Legend,"The life story of Brazilian football legend, Pele.",A boy with nothing who changed everything.,Drama,107.0,2016-05-06,en,7.344,1105.0,1.8761,"Kevin de Paula, Leonardo Lima Carvalho, Seu Jorge, Milton Gonçalves, Seth Michaels","Jeff Zimbalist, Michael Zimbalist","sports, biography, football (soccer), inspirational, биография","A straightforward, hearty sports biopic, is <em>'Pelé: Birth of a Legend'</em>.

I love football, if I'm not watching films I'm watching the beautiful game, so was looking forward to checking this 2016 flick out, as it portrays the early years of the late, great Pelé. The film isn't quite as amazing as the Brazilian baller himself, but I think it just about creates a pleasant enough 100 minutes or so. It does have the usual biopic clichés, but if we're being honest that's to be expected.

Kevin de Paula and Leonardo Lima Carvalho do well as the titular character, though the standout from an acting standpoint is, in my opinion, Seu Jorge. I, to be honest, did not know of him until just over a month ago when I watched 2019's <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/marighella-2021/"">Marighella</a>'</em>, I was thoroughly impressed with him in that and sames goes for this - a very capable actor. Elsewhere, Vincent D'Onofrio and Colm Meaney are involved too.

My only main criticism of this is the fact that it's told in English. That obviously makes it that tad bit more watchable to English speakers like myself, so I wouldn't complain too hard, but it does slightly irritate me when the whole story is rooted, in this case, in Portuguese-speaking life and yet everyone speaks Anglais. Nothing major, granted. || **How to be Brazilian through Pele's movie**

One of the wonderful movie that are classified in the biographical category. When you watch Pele: Birth of a Legend, you feel a sense of belonging to Brazil because of everyone's love for the legendary star Pele. The director and screenwriter made us feel that we belong to this story that is told through the film.

The story revolves around a person named Pele, and the difficult experiences he went through in his life, including hardship and poverty for him and his miserable family, until he reached the Pele we know now. What impressed me more about the film than Pele's directing is that the director was able to produce impressive sports clips. The performance of the actors was good, especially the little Pele, who was skilled in his acting performance.

A great person like Pele Many people don't know that Pele went through harsh experiences until he reached Pele who we know now. He grew up in a poor family, and the film showed us the extent of the suffering that Pele was in until he arrived from Santos to the national team. I liked the Brazilian samba music, which gave the viewer stimulation and made him feel that he was Brazilian.

I felt the passion watching one shot after another. I was hooked from the first shot."

Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2016/7/12/ghostbusters.html || Filmmaker Paul Feig's **Ghostbusters** reboot pretty much followed the characteristic aspects of his previous films (""Bridesmaids"", ""The Heat"", ""Spy"") all incorporating a self-awareness of female-oriented friendship and the estrogen-driven escapades rooted in inspired goofiness. So given this familiar foundation of Feig's big screen blueprint one would expect that his creative input into the continued Ghostbusters franchise for the millennium moviegoers would result in the heralded hype his film project is now enjoying at large. Sure, the feminine-charged **Ghostbusters** seemed like a radical concept and would obviously trigger the nostalgic sentiments (and comparisons) of the classic 80's comedy spearheaded by beloved on-screen paranormal hucksters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Nevertheless, singer Ray Parker Jr.'s lyrical catchphrase ""Who you gonna call?"" within the Ghostbusters theme song needs to be addressed accordingly. The answer: the handlers behind the original **Ghostbusters** film that could uplift the disjointed high jinks and synthetic silliness of Feig's current comedic ghostly she-power schlockfest.

It is only natural that **Ghostbusters** had high expectations for Sony Pictures to perform well given the aggressive marketing tactics, early release of the Ghostbusters movie trailer (which was heavily panned online) and the aforementioned cinematic legacy of the original film's fanatical following and reputation. However, this third installation of **Ghostbusters** feels curiously flat and strained in its stillborn witticism. The creep factor borders on campy and cheesy (although this effectively worked for Ivan Reitman's 32-year old spook-ridden farce in the eighties) for which in today's cinematic circle is inexcusable due to the edgier and challenging special effects that could have played up the whimsy and wonderment of this breezy, bubble-gum colored romp with seemingly low-grade spark and sizzle.

Feig's interpretation of the **Ghostbusters** universe could have been fresh and favorable especially with the colorful casting of his capable four female principals in the Emmy-winning and Oscar-nominated Melissa McCarthy along with Saturday Night Live personalities Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Unfortunately for these noted funny ladies they were saddled (or slimmed if you will) by a transparent script almost as invisible as the pesky ghosts they are trying to pacify. The recycled by-the-numbers hilarity and hysteria does not make this brand of ghost-busting quite distinguishing. Chemistry-wise, the Ghostbuster gals seem to revel in the collective merry-minded mischievousness and genuinely try to bring energy and outrageous antics to this flaccid frightfest. Still, the mixture of Ghostbusters' gooey gumption with a dash of egghead feisty femininity never seems to translate into anything beyond the tired gimmick of promoting another excuse to tap into yesteryear's profitable fun and frolic that made the wise-cracking Murray and his klutzy cohorts so amusing and welcomed in their rollicking ghostly gem from the Reagan-era.

Quite frankly the notion that **Ghostbusters** is unfairly being knocked for its misogynistic overtones fueled by bias Internet-based fanboys not accepting that nerdy womanly scientists cannot fill the shoes of their revered male counterparts from the previous two predecessors is somewhat misleading. Sure, the decision to cast an all-female **Ghostbusters** team turned some curious heads but for the most part many thought this to be rather intriguing and experimental. The actual disdain can be pinpointed to the fact that Feig's flimsy boo-spewing fable is grounded in cliched and forced chuckles, weak-kneed jokes and gags, lazy writing and uninspired visual neon lighting techniques that look like a cheapened explosion from a vintage late 70's New York discotheque.

Unfortunately, **Ghostbusters** wallows in mediocrity and fails to capture the acquired giddiness and imagination so pronounced in the prior entertaining installments. Even if the original actors in Murray, Aykroyd, the late Ramis and Hudson had decided to reprise their roles under Feig's problematic production the results would be the same--an aimless reboot without any definitive bite or backbone for a cobbled comedy that is slight and stretched thin to its toothless core. Amazingly, **Ghostbusters** cannot decide if it should remain faithful to its humble roots (it does help trivially that iconic Ghostbuster notables make scattered cameos--sans Rick Moranis--including that glorified scene-stealer in the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man as well as hot dog gulper Slimer) or venture off into something resembling its own goofy identity and distinction. Either way the third time around simply meanders in over-produced, noisy emptiness.

The so-called plot in **Ghostbusters** focuses on college professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig presumably in the Murray/Dr. Peter Venkman role) and her fascination with ghost activities that end up costing her an academic career in the process. Specifically, Erin's controversial book that she wrote along with co-author Abby Yates (McCarthy) served as the basis for her firing. Abby's obsession with ghosts still has her invested with this spirit phenomenon that she researches defiantly with her kooky associate Jillian Holtzman (McKinnon) in tow. Eventually, it would take the trio's status of joblessness (not to mention a run-in with a slim-spewing ghost that loves soaking humans with its sticky green goo) to collaborate on going into business as paranormal exterminators out to showcase their expertise in ""busting ghosts"".

In the meanwhile, there is something brewing in the twisted mind of supernatural-loving freak Rowan North (Neil Casey). After all, he is the lost soul responsible for unleashing the onslaught of riff-raffish apparitions upon New York City courtesy of his miserable, lonely existence. Now it is up to Erin, Abby and Jillian to eliminate Rowan's sinister agenda and eradicate the spooky pests that he has manipulated to cause the city-wide panic. As Internet sensational darlings, the Ghostbusters are committed to step up to the plate as the sassy saviors they were meant to be since going into the ghost-busting industry.

The later arrival of street-wise transit worker Patty Tolan (Jones) completes the Ghostbusters' quartet. Patty, whose run in with one of the slimy ghosts in the subway tunnel was pivotal to joining the three scientists, has something to offer the ghost-chasing brainiacs--a.) her knowledge of the city's whereabouts and b.) her funeral director uncle's hearse that serves as the official transportation for the Ghostbusters.

Overall, the third outing regarding this toothless entry **Ghostbusters** notoriously lacks the robust impishness and rapport of the male character counterparts that were devilishly drawn together and cemented by Murray's droll humor. Here, the ladies come off as bland and indifferent--at least for the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the team in Wiig's Erin Gilbert and McCarthy's Abby Yates. McKinnon's Jillian Holtzman is the only truly spry Ghostbuster who is credible as an off-kilter genius ditz with off-the-wall likability. Some may gravitate towards Jones's stereotypical brassy black chick with the brash quips and animated overreactions. Although Jones brings in the high-wire urbanized smirks in contrast to her quieter, geekier counterparts it is cringe-worthy watching her play an over-the-top, towering, mouthy cultural exaggeration that is woefully embarrassing for the sake of this dismissive. hedonistic hoot.

Ironically it is the hunky Chris Hemsworth that fares decently as the handsome himbo Kevin, the dim-witted **Ghostbusters'** male assistant that serves as the doltish eye candy for the cerebral lasses, particularly for the smitten Erin. Another SNL alum, Cecily Strong, checks in as the menacing mouthpiece from the Mayor's office that tries to discredit the popular ghost-busting technicians as ""sad, thrill-seeking women"".

Feig, serving as both the film's director and co-screenwriter (along with ""The Heat"" scriber Katie Dippold) has no cohesive vision for the listless **Ghostbusters** and could have used some critical pointers in studying the proven anatomy of what made Reitman's nostalgic vehicle so engaging that still thrives after three decades since coming into the movie audience's consciousness. From the lame and limping laughs dipped in cartoonish crudeness (i.e. a male ghost gets a rousing jolt to his ""junk"" courtesy of his heroic ghost-busting detractors) to musical acts Fall Out Boy's/Missy Elliott's relentlessly unrecognizable, erratic and choppy remake of the aforementioned Parker's infectious **Ghostbusters'** theme song in this regurgitated comedy that has no excuse for catering to a lackluster rebirth while die hard and casual fans patiently waited for a festive follow-up from Murray and crew for thirty-plus years.

To randomly quote a classic **Ghostbusters'** lyrical line: ""I ain't afraid of no ghosts"". This may be the case but one should be very afraid of this heavy-handed banal boofest for wasting their time, anticipation and consideration.

--Frank Ochieng (c) 2016 || I was determined to see this movie on opening day. Female cast, Paul Feig (a Michiganian who included a Michigan line in the film), a couple fistfuls of ridiculousity on social media. When the movie started, I was one-eyeing the screen. Waiting for it. Oh oh. Fart joke. Oh oh. Kristen Wiig still can't make her eyes look interested. Then Charles Dance shows up with his serious comic tongue stuck in his cheek to admonish Prof. Gilbert that if she is serious about tenure, she needs to find a more prestigious university recommendation. ""More prestigious? Than Princeton?"" Now I know the deadpan eye comic genius of Wiig, too. From that point on, I was in love with the story. Katie Dippold cowrote the film. She has a bit part as the real estate agent showing the team the 1984 movie's fire station to rent. I want more of her screenwriting. The dialogue is witty, sharp, real. While I liked the 1984 Ghostbusters, it's a buddy movie. Dudes in the treehouse with no girls allowed spelled wrong nailed to the door. Smug, chirpy, guybonics. Venkman electrocuting rivals in the lab: using paranormal research to get dates. Annie Potts drooling over Spengler. Sigourney Weaver in a diaphanous dress, draped on a parapet waiting for the Gatekeeper. The sore spots in 1984 are sprayed away in 2016 without gender disrespect. Gilbert gets to drool over the pretty doofus administrative assistant. When you see this movie, watch all the credits. Chris Hemsworth is a clearly confident actor - he dives pelvis-first into the Kevin role, and it's hilarious. I'm still searching for the creator of the titles and end credits. Excellent art. The poster? Not so much. Hemsworth needs to be behind the four leads. Geez. Casting hit a lick with Kate McKinnon as Holzmann. She is fantastic bringing Harold Ramis' genius back to life. Leslie Jones as Patty: so good, and she has some of the juiciest lines, delivered with haute sass. There are really well-placed cameos by 1984's cast, including birthing one of the movie's best lines ""safety lights are for dudes."" 2016 Ghostbusters is a great fun movie, and I'll watch it more than once again. One of the brilliant visuals that I was thrilled with - the stream from the proton packs tied up the ghosts. Wrapped, pinned, contained lassoed. Genius analogy for what to do with obsolete stereotype. There's a lassoed line in the film while the Ghostbusters are reading the internet reaction to their first catch. ""Ain't no bitches gonna catch no ghosts."" Yeah. Watch this."

This film had the potential to be the best comedy of the year, it opened so well, but did not conclude on high. Like everything suddenly halted, the story came to an end with giving clichéd reason. Though the actors were amazing, and many jokes were awesome. The lead two combination was among the best Kevin Hart worked so far like in the recently with Ice Cube and Will Ferrell.

The opening scenes set off the tone for the rest of the film. Twenty years later, an adventure begins, but that part was so familiar, except the influence of the opening part that carried till the final scene. Even though slightly unpredictable scenes, because the diversions were neatly done against what viewers could expect. The focus was largely on the lead pair, so theirs undertaking was kind of faded away.

There's a guest role at the end, also some behind the scene clips during the end credit cheers us. I think it is a good comedy than it looks, but definitely not the best. Its not the narration, but the actors that makes worth a watch. The stunt sequences were just okay, but utilised according to what the story required. Overall, an enjoyable, time pass film.

_6/10_ || **Central Intelligence might not do anything special with its story, but what makes it special is the genius comedic pairing of Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson.**

Central Intelligence is exactly what you have come to expect of any film with Kevin Hart - a lot of fast-talking, dramatic arm-waving, strange faces, and hilarious antics. But Central Intelligence is probably the best of Hart’s catalog of buddy comedies because it marks the beginning of his entertaining friendship with Dwayne Johnson. While the movie is ridiculously goofy, the chemistry between these two reduces the film and leaves the audience wanting more of this fantastic and dorky duo. Central Intelligence also surprises with all the talent on its cast, including Aaron Paul, Jason Bateman, Melissa McCarthy, and more. It might not be a masterpiece, but Central Intelligence is a funny and entertaining film that will make you smile and make you happy that Hollywood has brought Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson together to bring the laughs again and again."

I felt the title 'Genius' was not appropriate for how the story revolved in the film. It was more like a commitment and priority given to those undertaking than any other stuffs and that's why it looked like a genius from others eyes. Though I won't deny the experience always comes very handy. This film tells the story of ant editor and how he meets one of the best writers of his time. But they two together give the literature world some masterpiece works and that's the tale the film very genuinely presented to us.

This story takes place around the 1930s. An enthusiastic writer and a genius editor develop a strong bond, especially from their professional, but it goes beyond that. When both the families struggle while these two men completely dissolved with their works. So the takes from different angles about the different issues nicely revealed.

This biographical film is nothing short for any inspiration if you are looking for some. If you are a book lover, then this is not to be missed, especially if you have read the books by Thomas Wolfe. It's unbelievable that the film was made by a first time director. The actors, including the Colin Firth and Jude Law in the major roles was exceptionally good. We have seen many great films about the authors, so for a difference this film focused on an editor. It stands on the line of Bryan Cranston's 'Trumbo'. I hope you won't miss it, because it is so good if you appreciate the real life achievers, even those standing behind someone's achievements.

_8/10_ || The genius of Genius is that, although it revolves around the publication of Thomas Wolfe’s novels Look Homeward, Angel and Of Time and the River, it’s not a film about writing but about editing; accordingly, editor Max Perkins (Colin Firth) is devoted as much time and importance as is Wolfe (Jude Law) himself.

Both have significant others, and we know, because they are played by Nicole Kidman and Laura Linney, just by looking at them that both Wolfe’s lover Aline Bernstein and Perkins’s wife Louise have a major presence in each man’s life – these are truly the women that stand behind great men, if I may use a non-empowering figure of speech. Perkins’s greatness lies in his ability to recognize greatness in others; prior to Wolfe, he ‘discovered’ Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald, the latter played briefly but solidly by the always effective Guy Pearce).

Aline and Louise are not muses, however, and Genius is only a love story in that it chronicles Perkins and Wolfe’s, for lack of a better term, bromance. Their marriage is perfect because Wolfe believes, like Picasso, that inspiration should find you working (a belief which becomes apparent when he strolls in Perkins’s office with Of Time and the River’s 5,000-page first draft), while Perkins is a staunch proponent that less is more.

The film’s greatest insight is that, whereas writing is a lonely one-man endeavor, rewriting is ideally a two-person job because you need at least one other set of ears to listen, and another mouth to provide that invaluable commodity known as feedback – but it can’t be just anyone either, and it’s Wolfe’s good fortune that he finds in Perkins his, to borrow Stephen King’s term, ‘ideal reader;’ the one who will encourage him, to borrow another Kingian tenet (who in turn borrowed it from someone else), to ‘kill your darlings’ (“even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler’s heart, kill your darlings”).

Thus, the movie’s best sequence has Perkins and Wolfe whittling a paragraph from 232 words down to just 25. I especially liked how Wolfe uses onomatopoeia to illustrate his character’s falling in love, and Perkins asks him, rhetorically, “The whoosh, the clatter. Is that the point?” – and of course it isn’t, considering that “So quickly did he fall for her that no one in the room even heard the sound;” if no one heard it, who cares what kind of sound it was, right?

Now, I don’t know how faithful to the actual events Genius is (my guess is not much; moreover, one wonders how the literati might have felt about a movie wherein Perkins, Wolfe, Fitzgerald, and Papa Hem are all played by British actors), but that’s beside the point; unlike most biopics about writers in particular and artists in general, this film is faithful to the creative process. || This is one of Jude Law's better characterisations as he plays troubled writer Thomas Wolfe. His almost biblical tomes don't exactly excite most literary agents but the well established Max Perkins (Colin Firth) bucks that trend by giving him a chance. Now there are some editorial caveats to this commission - not least some substantial shaving of hundreds of the pages, but the two start to work together building a relationship that sees Wolfe focus and succeed. That success, of course, is a beast with two heads and when the next book comes along - weighing in at some 5,000 pages - the pair must take a hatchet to the work and that starts the writer on a spiral of bitterness and resentment. Perhaps it's only his adoring ""Aline"" (Nicole Kidman) who can stop his inevitable path to self destruction? Meantime, it falls to Mrs Perkins (Laura Linney) to ensure that her husband doesn't follow his friend into the emotional doldrums - no easy task. This is quite an interesting, if speculative, biopic of a man obsessed. With success, yes - but also with his own ideals of poetry and storytelling and it's that compulsion that tests every relationship he ever has. Law exudes some of that frustration effectively here, well foiled by an understated effort from Firth. There are few cameos from Guy Pearce (F. Scott Fitzgerald) and Dominic West (Ernest Hemingway) to put a little more meat on the bones and to help illustrate just how fickle their success could be whilst John Logan's screenplay keeps the dialogue tight."

**LOUISA SAYS:**

“Jason Bourne” is a spy movie for imbeciles. The entire film feels like it’s written using nothing more than the vocabulary of a 12 year old and consists of two very tiring hours of repetition. Bourne gets chased, throws some punches, and gets away. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Shoot, bleed, run, escape. Repeat to infinity.

I actually felt bad for the actors having to deliver such dreadful dialogue; their onscreen characters literally describe everything that’s happening as it unfolds (“It’s Bourne!” and “I’m going to shoot!” and “He’s running upstairs!” and “The files are downloaded!”). At some point it started to get funny.

Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and it feels like he’s sleepwalking through the entire movie. Even the talented Alicia Vikander phones in her questionable performance (is she supposed to have an accent or not?) and Tommy Lee Jones plays yet another scowling caricature of a sinister government official. There’s little in the way of character development and the only actor who’s enjoyable here is franchise veteran Julia Stiles. What a pity that she’s not given much to do.

Even the action sequences are inexcusably incoherent. Paul Greengrass is one of my least favorite directors, mainly because he loves that fast cutting junk where I can’t tell what is going on in the movie. It’s a filmmaking style for those with short attention spans and it’s a sign of extreme laziness.

Greengrass sucks all the fun out of what should’ve been a spectacular car chase down the Las Vegas strip. Instead of taking his time and showing off the pageantry of stunt driving with a steady hand (see the legendary cinematic car chases in Quentin Tarantino’s “Death Proof,” William Friedkin’s “The French Connection,” Peter Yates’ “Bullit,” Justin Lin’s “Fast Five,” or hell, even Michael Bay’s “Bad Boys II“), Greengrass once again opts for the lazy way out and gives us a messy commotion of three second snippets that seem to be edited together in a blender on the high setting.

None of the elements work: the film covers no new ground, it lacks any energy, and it simply feels tired, making “Jason Bourne” the lamest of all in the series.

**MATT SAYS:**

“Conversation” with 5-word sentences using spy and techno-jargon. Quick cut to person typing on computer: Beep, boop, beep. Quick cut to shaky cam conversation. Another five-word-sentence conversation and more shaky cam. Cut to shaky-cam motorcycle chase with no sense of geography. Cut back to computer.

Cut, cut, cut. Shaky cam, shaky cam, shaky cam. “Jason Bourne” might as well have been shot and assembled by a seven-year-old with ADD that hasn’t taken his Ritalin. It wasn’t so much edited as jammed together. So little artistry went into making this movie that it’s hard to even call Paul Greengrass its “director.”

One of my recurring rants is on the use of quick cutting and shaky cams in action films: it’s the hallmark of lazy filmmaking. When your action sequences are constructed by using cut after cut after cut, you don’t have to worry about storyboarding (contrast “The Raid: Redemption“). You don’t need actors who have any training in fight choreography (contrast “The Raid 2“). You don’t have to concern yourself with geography or spatial relationships. In other words, instead of having to WORK at creating a compelling action sequence, you can hack your way through it. And boy, there is NO ONE working in film now that loves hack action better than Paul Greengrass. And nowhere has Greengrass’s hackiness been on display more than in “Jason Bourne.” It’s his masterpiece of hacketry. I can continue making up new word forms using “hack” to describe this movie and director, but I think you get the idea.

In addition to the bad direction and editing, “Jason Bourne” stinks because it’s a poor excuse for a spy thriller. We are subjected to scene after scene of dreadful acting. Julia Stiles (Nicky Parsons) is the worst of the lot, but Matt Damon (Jason Bourne), Alicia Vikander (Heather Lee) and Tommy Lee Jones (Director Dewey) are only marginally better. The script is abysmal, with the characters not so much dialoguing with one another as speaking spy techno-jargon while they type on computers that are constantly beep-bloop-bleeping (no computer I’ve ever used makes so many noises when scanning files). Using words that sound cool does not make a scene interesting. And the plot? It’s barely even there.

I found only three things enjoyable about this movie. The very first fight scene between Bourne and some nameless guy — the one you see in the trailer. The story thread featuring the Silicon Valley billionaire that refused to screw over the public in the name of national security. And the final vehicular chase scene down Las Vegas Boulevard — which I liked in spite of the terrible editing (which, incidentally, got the geography of the Strip all wrong).

Please don’t make this movie a hit, because then we will get lots of imitators (like we did after “The Bourne Supremacy” and “The Bourne Ultimatum“, when quick cuts and shaky cam were used in 95% of all action pictures).

Demand more for your money. There are so many movies that do it better than this one. Do you want an engaging, twisty techno-spy thriller? Check out the “Mission Impossible” series. Do you want a well-written story of international espionage and intrigue? See “Our Kind of Traitor.” Do you want well-choreographed fight sequences? Watch “The Raid” movies. Hell, even this summer’s “Warcraft” did a better job with its fights and action that this film.

**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com** || **New officials, new operations at agency, but the same old Bourne!**

I thought the original films are meant to be a trilogy, but when filmmakers saw money, they went ahead with the fourth in a new direction. So now with this, it has returned to the original storyline. The Jason Bourne, whose quest to find the answers was over. Yet, a new chapter begins with this like another trilogy is on making like the 'Star Wars' with a new storyline and adventures.

Still the theme remains the same, like running and chasing. So the story was just a one or two liner. But if you like the action sequences, this has got plenty of them to entertain you. That's should be a main reason, if you want to see it, other than that the film was average kind. Matt Damon's return for the title role was the best thing happened in here with the director of 'Supremecy' and 'Ultimatum'.

I think Alicia Vikander's role is yet to exploit and that would be in the next two films. Looks like an interesting combo between her and Matt, so waiting for the official news. The same formula for this is what disappointing, though not a bad flick. After all, that's how we know Bourne series. So go for it if you are up to date with this franchise, because there's going to be at least another two films if my guess is right.

Recently the Indian jungle boy, the live-action Mowgli film was made and so its time for Africa's. This is not a Disney film and that's one of the disappointments for the Tarzan fans. Because this film is for the grown-ups only. It is rated PG13, but still I don't think the children would enjoy it like they did for the recent 'The Jungle Book' film. So it is like a DC film, I mean, DC makes superhero films for the grown-ups, unlike Marvel's. The bottom line is, don't expect it to be like a Disney film. Like the director said before the release, this is not the Tarzan from your father, grandfather's era, but an updated one with strong graphic violence.

So the story skips all the Tarzan's earlier life like from his childhood to adulthood parts. The film commences with Tarzan being settled in the UK. It's the second half of the 19th century, where the European colonies in the Africa are expanding for its rich natural resources. So in the Congo savanna, the natives welcome Tarzan for his short visit, but the things get ugly when his wife, Jane was kidnapped. Now he must fight back for her safe return and also avert other threats in the region from the foreign power.

There are many CGI character films were made at the recent time, it is a trend, but not all of them are impressive. This film looked average when it comes to vfx. The story was acceptable, the performances were decent, the casting too not bad, but Samuel L. Jackson was completely useless. He's one of the greatest sidekick Hollywood ever produced, but I don't know why he's in this project, his role was very silly.

In other hand, Alexander Skarsgard was good in the lead character and so Margot Robbie as Jane. The action sequences were not good as I expected. The film had a good runtime, but in some parts, it was slow or maybe you can say nothing interesting thing happens. I liked the idea, to update the theme, but they should have given more focus on the story. I hope if they plan another film, it should be a prequel. Because I feel there's lots to learn about the past than going forward. This is a one time watchable film, there's no surprises, just plain and partially entertaining.

_6/10_ || This was the most underwhelming Tarzan movie that I have ever seen. A typical product of some Hollywood producer trying to make a ""modern"" take of Tarzan not really knowing or caring for the Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created. 

In particular it was the palest and most underwhelming Tarzan character yet. He never radiated the strength nor the intelligence that Edgar Rice Burroughs attributed to his character. He spent most of the movie going around with a bland look on his face.

The story itself is pretty much an out of the box standard Hollywood story about slavery and abuse of the black African population. Not truly bad but nothing to write home about either.

There is a lot of CGI in the movie and although quite a few reviewers seem to consider it bad I personally though it was pretty okay. One of the few decent bits of the movie.

I truly do not understand that they had the nerve to call this movie The Legend of Tarzan since it really is pretty far from the legend of Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created. This movie would perhaps have been okay as a one hour episode in a Tarzan TV-show but as a high budget feature movie it simply does not cut it. I was quite disappointed. || **_The true 'sequel' to ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan,"" 32 freakin' years later_**

""The Legend of Tarzan"" (2016) stars Alexander Skarsgårda as John Clayton (Tarzan), Margot Robbie as Jane and Samuel L. Jackson as Tarzan's American friend. The events take place a decade after Tarzan & Jane leave Africa for England with brief flashbacks to the ape man's origins. Christoph Waltz co-stars as the villain, Rom, who enslaves blacks in the Congo to mine the diamonds of Opar. Tarzan, Jane and Willliams (Jackson) aim to set things aright.

""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" (1984) was the best modern Tarzan movie, and one of my favorites despite a somewhat lethargic second half (and an irritating overuse of the ""Ooo, ooo, ooo""ape vocalization, which this movie thankfully only does once). Unfortunately, they dropped the ball with the sequel, 1998's ""Tarzan and the Lost City"" with Casper Van Dien in the title role, as it was half-baked, a quickly-thrown-together ""sequel"" to presumably steal some of the thunder of Disney's animated version that was coming out the next year.

This one comes across as the true sequel to ""Greystoke,"" albeit with an altogether different cast and understandably so, seeing as how it's 32 years later. The portrayal of the lost city of Opar is different from the books. There's no ravishing High Priestess La (a blonde white female) or ape-like denizens. The Oparians in the movie are just an intimidating black tribe covered with white body paint, but this is no big letdown because changes are to be expected when transferring to a different medium and, besides, Opar doesn't play that big of a role, at least not the city itself.

In any case, I found this to be a solid Tarzan flick with a serious adult tone mixing drama, jungle adventure and unbelievable action. I was thankful for the thoughtful lulls in the story, which shed insights on the characters or conveyed the wonders of nature, like when Tarzan communes with an elephant at night or when Williams honestly confesses about his past mistakes as a youth where he feels he's not so different from the odious Rom. Moreover, Margot expertly brings Jane to life and is easily one of the better Janes in the movies. The CGI animals are great, especially the powerhouse apes.

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot, believe it or not, in England with aerial shots done in Gabon (West of the Congo).

Whereas most franchises are characterized by sequels that degrade in quality over time, “The Purge” is one that continues to improve. The first movie was a good premise in search of a story. The second in the series, “The Purge: Anarchy” was a marked improvement, and “The Purge: Election Year” is clearly the best one yet.

In case you’ve been hiding under a rock, the concept behind these movies is simple: the government of America fell after mass unrest and crime eventually led to revolution, and out of the rubble a new party rose. They call themselves “The New Founding Fathers” party and they have discovered a way to dramatically decrease crime and placate the populace: for one 12 hour time span each year, all crime — including murder — is legal. This annual bloodbath is known as (wait for it) “the Purge.”

In this newest installment, the annual Purge has been in place for two decades. When she was younger, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) was forced to watch as her entire family was murdered in front of her during the Purge. Having survived the horrors of the Purge, the Senator is running for President on an anti-Purge platform that is gaining popularity. Threatened by Senator Mitchell, the New Founding Fathers use the Purge as an opportunity to wipe out their competition by sending a squad of assassins to hunt her down. Protected only by her head of security, Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo, reprising his role from “The Purge: Anarchy”), the Senator must go on the run to survive the night.

In “The Purge: Election Year,” the annual bloodbath is used as a platform to talk about the growing tension between the haves and the have-nots. Because they lack the financial means to protect themselves, the poor are disproportionately victimized during the Purge. In this world, legalized murder is a way for the wealthy and political elite to ensure a placated populace and control the poor. When the victimized start to realize that they are pawns in a game played by the privileged, they start to fight back… by any means necessary.

The elite in this world are typified by ultra-conservative hypocrites who are quick to subvert religion and re-shape their displayed and false piety to advance their own agenda. Murder tourism is encouraged, and the powerful are quick to espouse the wisdom of permissive gun laws. Sound familiar at all?

My chief criticism of the movie is that it got perhaps a little too heavy-handed in its messaging at times, and the horror aspects of the story suffered as a result. At times, the film more closely resembles an action movie than a horror flick, which is a little disappointing for a franchise that excels in displaying inventive — if horrific — kills. Those kills are the moments that stay with you the longest and the ones that keep you up at night. The imagery that we do get is powerful, but it becomes increasingly scarce as the movie progresses.

While it’s not a perfect movie, “The Purge: Election Year” is that rare horror movie that is both entertaining and has something interesting to say. Whether or not you agree with its politics, it’s an interesting vehicle to use for a message that has resonance in our current culture. I just fear that the message will be lost on most.

Cohen","hawaii, wedding, wedding date, satirical, joyous, ambiguous, amused, antagonistic, disheartening, dubious, sarcastic","Director Jake Szymanski’s fictitious siblings Mike and Dave need more than wedding dates in this baseless and brainless raunchy comedy. For starters, it needs to wipe off its monotonous mediocrity as a lame laugher laced with empty-headed vulgarity and cheap chuckles straining for manufactured amusement. The genre regarding raunchy comedies had always had that miss-or-hit gamble about its cockeyed presentation. For the tedious and tepid **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** it is safe to say that it will not be on the Mount Rushmore of classic naughty farces in the tradition of _Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Porky’s_ or the _American Pie_ film franchise anytime soon. 

Banally sluggish and lazily crass, **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** tries desperately to register its juvenile high-wire impishness as inspired lunacy but the profane randomness of Szymanski’s (along with screenwriters Andrew Jay Coleman and Brendan O’Brien) jiggle-and-giggle romp is about as riotous and inspired as a drippy diaper. Thankfully **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** does not entirely sink to the forgettable levels yet of say the earlier released fetid raunchfest Dirty Grandpa (although both films features principal players Zac Efron and Aubrey Plaza in the cast) but that still is not saying much for its feeble defense.

The problem with most modern youth-oriented sex farces is that ready-made mentality of delivering shock value debauchery that have no sense of coherence or irreverent purpose to support the so-called funny, bouncy rhythms of the movie is sloppily realized. Instead, filmmakers focus on promoting outrageous and recycled ribaldry without arming the unconventional story with something more serviceable and solid. Essentially Szymanski tosses the stilted zaniness against the wall hoping that anything sticks as proposed hilarity.

The Stangle Brothers in Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) is a couple of mischievous misfits that attract mayhem whenever possible. They revel in the sordid good times and are proven to be a handful for their exasperated parents Burt and Rosie (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy). The only ray of hope concerning Burt’s and Rosie’s success regarding offspring comes in the package of daughter Jeannie (Sugar Lyn Beard). Jeannie is preparing for her upcoming wedding and appears to have something concrete going on in her life more so than her “party-hearty” bone-headed brothers.  

Anyhow, Mike and Dave are subjected to the ultimatum set by their frustrated parents to “straighten up” and grab some semblance of maturity. The source for getting this dim-witted duo to shape up involves their baby sister’s Hawaiian-based wedding. If Mike and Dave were to attend Jeannie’s exotic ceremony they must grab respectable dates otherwise reject the notion of becoming part of their sister’s life-changing, special occasion. One of the puzzling aspects of this toothless plot is to ponder why these sibling screw-ups would seriously care to change their wayward ways by a parental threat of not showing up at their precious sister’s island-based nuptials? Oh please…

In any event, Mike and Dave get busy trying to fish for formidable escorts but this proves futile until an Internet ad seeking “nice girls” for a Hawaiian getaway draws considerable attention as loads of women take notice.  As the many female applicants react to Mike’s and Dave’s sensational date to the scenic 50th state for some gorgeous sun and fun there are two tarts in particular that pop out of nowhere in Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick  from “Pitch Perfect” and Aubrey Plaza from the aforementioned “Dirty Grandpa”).

Although they are stimulating as eye-candy for the brothers to drag to Hawaii both Alice and Tatiana fail the required prerequisite as being goodie two-shoes companions for Mike and Dave. In fact, Alice and Tatiana are quite the opposite but must hide their true nature as bombastic bimbos with acid tongues if they are to take advantage of the golden opportunity to travel to picturesque Hawaii. Predictably, the devious dates fall into their genuine selves as rambunctious chicks…something that Mike and Dave must deal with concerning this clumsy deception by the riff raffish Alice and Tatiana.

No doubt that **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** intended to be some throwaway chuckle-minded showcase searching for its titillating temperature of off-kilter jocularity. Sadly, this moronic movie is reduced to going through the run-of-the-mill tactics of broad jokes falling flat, lightweight sight gags, silly-minded pratfalls and attractive profanity-spewing undesirables that are somehow supposed to tickle our collective, indiscriminate funnybones. Consequently, everything in this callous concoction of a comedy feels relentlessly artificial, overwrought and forced. 

Sure, the off-the-wall characterizations in the main foursome of the Stangle sibs and their tag-along traveling trophies are expected to be a fine hot-mess. Nevertheless, the whole production unintentionally strives to be that same hot-mess but for totally different reasons. Efron, a veteran of a string of painful cockeyed comedies that some of his most ardent female fans might have trouble recalling, channels his familiar wild pretty boy persona from Neighbors…one of the very few flicks worth mentioning on Efron’s flaccid filmography. Devine’s Mike comes off as achingly overbearing as the brother with the showy awkwardness to match the synthetic obnoxiousness.  Kendrick’s Alice does not seem remotely convincing as the phony “decent date for hire”. At least Plaza’s Tatiana shows some modicum of plausibility as the bad girl grounded in rawness.

It is unfortunate that **Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates** could not have added anything fresh or subversive to the trivial table with the noxious material and other regurgitated clichés that bombard these notoriously flimsy R-rated spectacles with a pseudo-provocative pulse. It is safe to say that watching the eye-rolling shenanigans of Mike and Dave Spangle on the big screen is enough to call this whole exhausting affair beyond a dating disaster.

Frank Ochieng © 2016 || **Sorry Mike and Dave, it's an Alice and Tatiana's free vacay.**

I should be honest that I had some good laughs, but not the overall film was impressive. For me it was a chick film, and Anna Kedrick and Aubrey Plaza are the lead actors. I really loved their parts and that's the reason I had no issue watching it, but like usual Zac Efron ruined it. I won't blame him completely, but he and Adam Devine's roles did not deliver as what the title expresses. I mean they get their wedding date, but the title should have been 'Alice and Tatiana Goes for a Free Vacay' or something like that.

It was like a 'Brideamaid' kind of film, but there are too many adult jokes. The story was sort of based on the real, and that's just a joke to begin the narration. The advertisement was real, but the remaining story was fictional. From there, how the plot developed was totally makes no sense, but it does not matter because it is a comedy. Especially the initial parts, but later on, it gets better, only the comedy wise. In some way it was not bad, and not good either to recommend to others. So it is nothing more than a decent timepass film, but some people might find it most annoying.

_6/10_ || A great cast and amusing humour, but man does it take itself too seriously.

I think I can just about consider <em>'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates'</em> as a good film. The lead stars do respectable jobs and most of the comedy is funny, the fact that it tries to be heartfelt on too many occasions almost derails my feelings towards it though.

Zac Efron (Dave), Adam DeVine (Mike), Anna Kendrick (Alice) and Aubrey Plaza (Tatiana) all connect very well together, the chemistry in their respective cliques isn't always there but for the comical stuff they work.

Efron and Plaza would be my picks from the onscreen talent, especially Plaza who commits to the role nicely; despite an iffy accent. Elsewhere you have Sam Richardson (Eric), Lavell Crawford (Keith) and Stephen Root (Burt) appearing, they have relatively minor roles though it's cool to see them involved.

It's the attempted heartwarming story that lets this down, I guess it does leave with a positive message but none of it comes across in the film itself - I didn't connect with any of the characters on a proper level, Jake Szymanski & Co. should've just went for the 100% pure comedy. Being earnest is OK but you simply have to make it click, it doesn't here.

It was handed over to the two new directors and the result is not so good. This is a most simplest film in the 'Ice Age' series. For the first time, the franchise is in real trouble. Though it managed well at the box office, which is a below par compared to the previous installments. It looks like a short film or it should have been a short film. From the adventures to the locations, everything shrunk in this sequel. Except Scrat, who goes for a lifetime journey into the outer space.

As usual the story continued, but this time Manny and his family and friends do not go anywhere, the trouble comes to them. So they have to find a solution to escape from it. At the right rime, Buck returns from the underground and teams up with his old friends to tackle the situation. Besides, Peaches getting married and all the fun adventures from the earth, as well as from the space in the solar system aims at one direction.

Nowadays the space adventure is a big thing in films, and this franchise always extents its boundary for its new sequels, so this time it was something bigger than ever. I think it won't get bigger than this in a concept wise. Particularly Scrat who has been the backbone for this series donned with a spacesuit. Like Minions and Penguins, I too want Scrat's stand alone film. But I think that would not happen, not anytime soon, since those two films did not deliver the expected result.

If you are an 'Ice Age' series fan or not, it does not matter, you will be slightly get disappointed for sure. Now it has overtaken the 'Shrek' franchise with this fifth film and they are already thinking about the sixth. This is not that bad, just a watchable average film and you need to be updated if you want to continue the series in the future. So that's the reason I suggest to watch this. Other than that, it is totally ignorable one.

_5.5/10_ || What is it about these Ice Age movies that don't seem quite right? I think I just don't like the sound of any of the voice actors... its like some kind of torture having them all in the same place and the same time. Of course, the kids don't mind, and like all the other Ice Age movies, this one is quite watchable and entertaining for them. The weasel never fails to amuse and I look forward to his antics every time (this one also happens to be a nice compliment to the PS4 game). Disclaimer: I did not pay close attention to this one while on. || Another hilarious Ice Age. These are definitely my favorite animation series. I normally hate animation movies.

Well worth checking out, if you're in for this sort of thing. || Although a simplistic and familiar theme is explored involving sinister forces tormenting a child in distress, Swedish director David F. Sandberg brings something chillingly fresh to his horror/psychological offering **Lights Out**.  Sandberg, making his feature film debut, delivers an adequate amount of tension and trickery for all things considered ominous in the edginess of darkness. Lights Out is a reasonable chiller that demonstrates a decent measurement of depth without tripping over its cliched feet. The characterizations that go “bump in the night” in **Lights** are not as disposable as one is routinely used to experiencing in produced over-indulgent, generic boofests.

The construction of **Lights Out** feels atmospheric and sparse at times but the manufactured thrills somehow add the necessary alarm factor in a psychological thriller that boasts solid performances particularly by actress Maria Bello as the tortured soul at the center of the CGI creepiness. Sandberg’s adventurous direction and screenwriter Eric Heisserer’s spell-binding script works in part because Lights Out never extends itself beyond its lean and claustrophobic confines. The storytelling is taut and the scare tactics create worthy jolts without further monotony.  There are predictable jumpy cuts and the movie never fully deviates from the conventional suspenseful landscape that populates countless fright fables. Still, **Lights Out** manages to shine some shady brightness on this effectively drawn hair-raising spectacle.

The premise introduces the long-lasting notion of childhood fear and despair on the jeopardized shoulders of young insomniac Rebecca (Teresa Palmer) who has long since left the haunting homestead where the evil vibes of a dastardly spirit had tortured her relentlessly.  Rebecca is now concerned that the tawdry tradition of this shifty spook is now about to terrify her little 10-year old stepbrother Martin (Gabriel Bateman). In fact, Martin wants to split his hellish household and escape to Rebecca’s place for some guaranteed safety. After all, who can blame the poor kid for wanting to abandon his doomed domicile.

Enter the problematic Sophie (Bello). As the nervous-wreck mother to both Rebecca and Martin, Sophie has had her share of disappointments, heartaches and breakdowns in the past and present. It was revealed that Sophie had spent some critical time in a mental institution many years ago which explains her current complicated issues with men/relationships not to mention the strained connection with her disillusioned children. More important, Sophie faces the dilemma of encountering an assortment of deceased figures that randomly pop up from time to time within her expansive, worrisome walls. But nothing is more arousing or concerning than Sophie’s run-ins with the devilish Diana (Alicia Vela-Bailey), her troubled off-the-wall pal and fellow asylum inmate from yesteryear.

What is so jittery about Diana’s presence in the house is that she is so clingy and protective of her precious Sophie. The key to Diana’s horrifying existence is when the lights are turned off, Thus, it allows the deranged feminine entity to roam the house in a blanket of blackness while staking the beleaguered Sophie in the process.

**Lights Out** (originally Sandberg’s short film competition entry years ago) acts as a symbolic mirror reflecting the echoes of mental illness and inherent self-destruction concerning the fragile psyche. The film percolates convincingly when Bello’s Sophie is scarred constantly by the harried ties that bind. Sandberg demonstrates a wounded woman on the edge of insanity. The suffering of inner conflict and outer self-doubt has consumed Sophie to the point where she has personalized her self-inflicted poison with baggage ranging from a couple of deceased husbands to the harsh reality that her children are weary of her toxic nuttiness. Bello displays the brokenness and confusion of her portrayal with applauded conviction. The sister-brother tandem of Palmer’s Rebecca and Bateman’s Martin is both comforting and intriguing as they are joined at the hip in their fright night delusions. Vela-Bailey’s Diana is deliciously shadowy as the intrusive Diana applying the statically gloom.

The nightmarish special effects are challenging and imaginative and cinematographer Marc Spicer’s experimental lighting gives **Lights Out** its gripping sheen. Overall, Sandberg’s menacing mechanism of a movie certainly forces the shaky hand of its skeptical audience to snuggle up to the nearest light switch.

To his daughter, Grace, who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales... until she meets Pete, a mysterious 10-year-old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, green dragon named Elliott. And from Pete's descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham's stories. With the help of Natalie, an 11-year-old girl whose father Jack owns the local lumber mill, Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs, and the truth about this dragon.",Some secrets are too big to keep.,"Adventure, Family, Fantasy",103.0,2016-08-10,en,6.369,2234.0,2.7513,"Oakes Fegley, Bryce Dallas Howard, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, Oona Laurence",David Lowery,"feral child, remake, dragon, orphan, 1980s, live action and animation, live action remake","The infectiously whimsy and adventurous **Pete’s Dragon** undergoes a polished millennial-style rebirth for today’s kiddies not fortunate enough to be alive when the 1977 live-action animated musical blueprint made its charming, impressionable impact for youngsters of all ages back in the day. The festive and frolicking Disney flourishes are applied to co-writer/director David Lowery’s re-imagination of an impish boy and his devoted dragon. There is an even balance of refreshing nostalgia and modern-day spryness and magical sentiment that hovers over this engaging family fable remake from the polyester period. Lowery (2013’s “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints”) and screenwriters Toby Halbrooks and Malcolm Marmorstein pack some vibrant punch of wonderment into this children’s tale of gentle mischievousness. Sure, the simplistic approach to the storytelling feels like a step-by-step progression experienced in a majority of child-friendly escapist entertainment. Still, **Pete’s Dragon** is steady in its gentle precision for homespun high jinks. 

Whether appreciating this Disney classic from four decades ago or relishing in Lowery’s current contemplative spectacle one will agree that the heart and soul of this sweet and uplifting narrative remains true to the main factors involved: the runaway (now orphaned) boy Pete and his trusty creature companion Elliot. In fact, it is just as instrumental that the adult presence in **Pete’s Dragon** make an impacting impression as well because this exposition should cater to the delicate sensibilities in us all whether as a curious tyke or reflective grown-up.

Orphaned and alone, 10-year old Pete (Oakes Fegley) had become a wild child in the deep woods. What was looking pretty grim for Pete in terms of loneliness, abandonment and despair was soon cured when he ended up befriending a giant green furry high-flying dragon named Elliot. For the most part the imposing Elliot served as Pete’s surrogate parent while ensuring protection and friendship for the parent-less prepubescent. There is no question about the dependency that Pete and his dragon Elliot share in loving dependency. The scenic wooded haven serves as the treasured playground for the playful, nature-loving tandem.

Enter the father-daughter duo of Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) and Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard). Both strangely have an eerie connection to Pete’s and Elliot’s existence without realizing it. Meacham had been telling engagingly colorful stories to the local children about a mysterious dragon existing in the Northwest Pacific woods. As for Grace she happens to be employed as a Park Ranger for the site of the mentioned woods her father constantly references in his repetitive stories. Soon Grace will encounter the disheveled Pete who is more than willing to share his adventures of living in the thick woods with his massive dragon buddy Elliot. This all seems rather intriguing to Grace because Pete’s description of Elliot is curiously similar to the fictional monster that Meacham cites to the spellbound youngsters. Whatever the case may be regarding Pete and his personalized plight this is something that Grace must investigate.

Grace is not the only one who finds the wandering Jungle Book youthful clone intriguing. Both Grace’s fiance Jack (Wes Bentley) and 11-year old Natalie (Oona Laurence from “Southpaw”) are in awe of Pete as well. In any event, Grace and Natalie are determined to find out what lies beneath the surface with the boy and his behemoth sidekick dragon that recalls Meacham’s exaggerated tall tales.

**Pete’s Dragon** dutifully follows what amounts to be the on-going formula for escapist children’s storybook gems as recently told on the big screen. The reliable source of pathos and warmth wisdom stems from a vulnerable child in search of belonging especially when trying to locate, recognize, reunite or reminisce about the absence of parents. Thankfully, **Pete’s Dragon** is in formidable company with animated treasures such as _Finding Dory_, _The BFG_, _Stranger Things_ and even the aforementioned _Jungle Book_ that follows such a playbook. The realism behind the idyllic childhood is having that sturdy foundation of family and support especially in the impressionable stages of youthful innocence. Among other things Pete’s Dragon solidifies the magnitude of growing pains and a sense of isolation and quieted despair. This is an important message although embedded in the confines of an innocuous juvenile fantasy.

The young Fegley resourcefully carries the breezy heartfelt material on his capable little shoulders as the enchanting Pete. The adorable Laurence is equally effective as Natalie whose bonding with her imaginative partner-in-crime Pete is admirable. Elliot the dragon is nothing more than an overgrown affable beast that would make for an amusing act at a neighborhood children’s birthday party. Both Redford’s Meacham and Howard’s Grace are essential as the older elements bridging the mysteries surrounding the mischievous moptop and his humongous hairball confidante.

There is no need to critically slay **Pete’s Dragon** as the thrills and life lessons in resiliency should prove instrumental for the enthusiastic kiddie crowd watching from the sidelines.

**(c) Frank Ochieng** (2016) || **For Pete, home is where Elliot is.**

I saw the '77 film prior to this so that I'm not going to miss anything if the upgradation was done in this new version. That was a quite okay film, so do this one. The difference between two was mainly the technology, but there's a major surge on all departments. Somewhat this looked more enjoyable than the old one. Visually very good, all the actors are great and so the locations, but the story was too short, not the film. It was over a 90 minute long and the entire film looked like an introduction. So there were no developments, everything was just like a beginning. That means the sequel could become a great adventure or it should be.

The five year old boy Pete, who lost in the wood after the car with his parents met a mishap, is raised by a dragon named Elliot. Now, eleven, meets some people from the nearby town who came with an agenda. It's like he got everything back what he had lost 6 years ago. Followed by misunderstanding and the human interference in the Elliot's enclosure, the chaos unleash and thrilling final act proceeds before the narration concludes in a style.

The kid who played Pete looked some kind of related to Sarah Snook, but he was good and so the others. The film was not good as I was expecting. The box office success was not that great comparing with other Disney films. So the sequel is in doubt, yet the story had ended with a wide open. I am sure you will enjoy watching it, because everything was so pleasant, but only a few people would like it at the end. I don't know if you are one, but definitely worth a try.

_6/10_ || Disney's retelling efforts post-Maleficent continue to be worthwhile. Does what the original did only better, and though it's not a brilliant movie, it is well made for the most part, and I found myself quite endeared to the titular dragon.

The film certainly defines two things, the life is unpredictable and the college life in the 1950s. Based on the book of the same name, made by a producer turned director which is his first attempt. A pure drama that follows a Jewish American student who is pursuing a degree in a small Ohio college. The film reveals his social skills, confused romance with a troubled girl, having differences with the college dean and many more.

Definitely a better film than I anticipating. Initially I did not get some parts of the narration, but there are more details in pieces and we have to put them in the right places. For example the editing was a bit confusing, particularly about present, past and future events. But at the end you will understand everything, I think. The twist was average, though very good, it totally altered the entire perspective. Logan Lerman is getting better and better in his every new film and Sarah Gadon as well getting more sexier every day.

Whatever it narrates us in the mid part, in the end it sticks to the point on what it opened with. So it is more about life like how a small mistake can change everything forever. But it's also how a big mistake can lead to preserve some sweet memories till life continues in whatever state. A practical subject dealt in a thoughtful way as much as possible. For some people it will be a must see, but surely worth a watch by everyone.

Since the Hollywood upgraded to the 3D animation, the rest of the world took over and given some incredible films in the last one and half decades. The Japanese animes are undoubtedly the best, but the European animation, particularly the 2D animation started to boom in the recent times with special mention goes to Tomm Moore. So basically I might miss some Hollywood animations, right now, but I'm very watchful over this kind of films. That's how I watched it, but anyway I would have seen it.

This is the director's first feature animation film, but he was known for his awesome short animations which one of them won him an Oscar. It was jointly produced by three countries, including Japan's Studio Ghibli. It's their first non-Japanese production and a great beginning and timing to expand the production in other continents. Especially after their legend, Hayao Miyazaki retired from the filmmaking.

The film was short like the 80 minute stretch without a single word spoken in its entire narration. There's no even sign language used, everything's actions and reactions. So you would find empty in the film's cast section which is kind of weird. I mean there are characters in the film, but all were imaginations without names and what year it takes place, where with so many questions like that. Basically to say, a film without the cast, but the crew members managed to give the best to the viewers to get it without any struggle.

One thing is for sure, that the film is very enjoyable. It is a fantasy film, so whatever you see, you have to accept it. Because that's how things happen in a theme like this, all fictional. Though, the first thing you have to keep in your mind is not the entire film was an hallucination event. There are some dreamy events and that's fine since the film character is coping with loneliness.

A man who had lost at sea, wakes up in a small island. It's a life supporting land mass with fresh water and fruits, but he also has to put some effort for fishing. His notion is to leave the island as soon as possible to go back to where he had come from, the civilised world. In his every attempt to sail with a raft he had made using bamboos, fails to cross after a certain stretch of the island coast. He later comes to know what stopped him and with an anger reaction he commits a mistake. So now he has to come out of the guilt and to do that he chooses what seems the right.

It was like a simple story without any meaning about everything that's shown in it. So in my entire watch I thought the same and said it was an okay film with great animation. But the ending changed my stance. That twist, I don't think everybody would understand. But one thing I want to make sure if you yet to see it, that it was about the purpose. The man always looks for a reason to do things and even to live or die. That's where the red turtle comes in.

Although my biggest question is, is this film a follow-up or in any way connected to the director's previous short animation 'Father and Daughter'? Because it seems the man who got lost in the sea is from that short film. But it never revealed the reason why he was stopped by whomever from return home. Also, both the conclusions syncs. It's just a my theory, so only the director can explain that.

I'm very sure this film is in the Oscars race. If it fails to make, then its not my prediction was wrong, but the Academy Awards people got it all wrong. I'm also sure it won't win as 3D animation dominated world, particularly 'Zootopia' 'Finding Dory' and 'Moana' are taking the first three frontrunner spots. Except the technical differences, only the grown ups can say this one has a better and meaningful story. It is very similar to 'Ponyo', but a grown-up's version. Anyway, it is a must see film, especially the adults and in particular those who always think animation is for children. If they see it, they might change their mind. Highly recommended!

8/10 || The Red Turtle is a dialogue free film. That may turn a lot of people off. However, it fit the mood of the movie perfectly. It's a fantasy film that is filled with pure undefiled love. You will find yourself wanting your own family after this one. The ending is left open to interpretation but only makes the plot seem that much more interesting when you try to unravel who/what is the Red Turtle. A definite watch for those looking for more than the typical Hollywood blockbuster. || A young man finds himself shipwrecked on a tropical island with only the coconuts and friendly, mischievous, fauna for company.

Because the script SUCKED. It had a ton of potential, it really did, but it didn't add anything to the genre, it didn't push any boundaries, and it wasn't really frightening.

So what you have is a meh B-Horror saved by good acting and a direction that needs to really work on how to frame a scene while it relies heavily on competent lighting...

... and that is really the only thing you can sing out praise to production wise, the people that lite the scene knew how to light a scene. Especially at night.

And if they knew how to frame a scene it would have been visually more entertaining and less bland.

But the fault really lies on a script. If you can't re-work it to be something new, don't film it.

10 of 10 though because the actors need a bit of a call out, they saved it and made it watchable."

With that out of the way, the movie itself: Just okay.

The plot isn't quite solid. The acting is usually on par, though does occasionally slip. Many character interactions are overtly clichéd, and the filming style, while moderately original, is distracting.

Bt it's still fun, and a little warming. I don't regret paying to watch it in cinemas, but keep in mind that's only because I did so at the ""Movie of the Week"" discounted price.

KAMI MELAYANI 24JAM UNTUK ANDA! || Filmmaker Clint Eastwood is certainly no stranger to overseeing exploratory biopics and his latest effort in **Sully** definitely supports his cinematic vision for spotlighting an unknown everyday aviation professional into an overnight national hero. Thus, airline pilot Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger became an inspirational savior courtesy of the potentially fateful day on January 15, 2009 when US Airways Flight 1749 morphed into the celebrated newsworthy incident dubbed ""Miracle on the Hudson"" 

In **Sully** Eastwood and screenwriter Todd Kormarinski presents Captain Sullenberger as an understated hero in the unconventional sense. Indeed, Sullenberger had his personal demons and doubts about that critical day years ago when his quick decision to land the doomed aircraft in the icy waters of the Hudson River in the aftermath of a freakish occurrence when a flock of birds managed to disable the engine's operation shortly after takeover from LaGuardia Airport. The label of ""hero"" may have been somewhat flattering for the veteran pilot in light of his accomplishment in saving the lives of his 155 passengers and crew courtesy of a risky landing that could have been their hellish watery graves. However, the burdensome christening of ""hero"" weighed heavily on Sullenberger especially when insulting suspicions arose questioning the pilot's actions. Sure, Sullenberger basked in instant adulation but his private torment was almost as haunting as the near tragedy he prevented when ensuring the airborne safety of those jeopardized on board.  

The challenging task in **Sully** was to create the tension and psychological strife behind an infamous 6-minute flight headed for disaster. Thankfully, Eastwood's steady direction and Komarnicki's adventurous script captures the tense and anxiety-driven moments that fuels **Sully's** soulful foundation. More important, two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks diligently fits the bill as the beleaguered Captain Sullenberger whose personalized battles with heroism caused pressured ambivalence and self-inflicted guilt. It has been an awful long time since Hanks was tapped for an Oscar nomination so let's hope that his solid work in **Sully** warrants Academy Award consideration. 

Some may be rather cynical about Eastwood's daring narrative as the self-explanatory story has been interpreted in so many news accounts, documentaries, the personal accounts from the Flight 1749 survivors and to a certain extent Captain Sullenberger himself. Still, **Sully** sets out to examine a conflicted and confused man second guessing his aviation skills and instincts as an individual thrust into the national spotlight with a combination of hope and hesitation. 

Not only had the quick-thinking Sully and co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart in a welcomed, absorbing supporting role) dodged a major catastrophe when accidentally flying into the cluttered Canadian geese that caused the ice-cold water landing in the Hudson but they were actually scrutinized by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding Sully's decision not to return the malfunctioning plane to LaGuardia Airport or toward a nearby airport therefore opting to gamble using the Hudson River as the immediate surface available to land.  

Naturally, the sudden media attention anointing the heralded pilot as a heroic soul coupled with the mixed reception of the buzz-killers in the NTSB speculating that foul play may have been involved for the piloting tandem of Flight 1549 understandably heightened the self-doubts and generated Sully's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In the meantime, Sullenberger's wife Lorrie (Academy Award nominee Laura Linney) as well as other close family and associates are constantly being hounded by intrusive reporters in their attempt to get an exclusive piece of the cherished ""man of the moment"" in Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger.

Granted that **Sully** will not go down as one of the flashiest biopics to cross our paths on the big screen in recent years. But Eastwood does deserve credit for showcasing the somber and beleaguered Sullenberger as a low-key, loyal isolationist dealing with the newfound fame and appreciation he is awkwardly at odds with facing as the Hudson River landing/rescue still chomps at his tainted psyche. Hanks's portrayal of the extremely likable but reluctant hero with lingering reservations is a stark contrast to contemporary cinematic heroes that routinely defeat monsters and aliens, parade around as slick and resilient super spies, wear superhero masks and capes, solemnly walk the mean streets with ready-made badges and firearms or are war-torn warriors from ancient historical times. Quite frankly, Chesley ""Sully"" Sullemberger is a flawed yet conscientious man urged to question his own courageousness and professional conviction.  

Eckhart's Stiles is effectively drawn as Sully's ardent supporter whose disbelief is tested when the NTSB has the nervy gumption to place his capable colleague under the dubious microscope after his amazing endeavor in protecting the sacred lives all on board the panicky plane destined for its doomsday fate. Conveniently, Eastwood inserts Anna Gunn (from TV's ""Breaking Bad"") as one of the perceived NTSB interrogating ""baddies"" trying to pin the wrap on Sully's numb shoulders in reference to his troubling flight methods. Linney, always the talented and involving actress, is merely reduced to displaying the commonplace hysterics of Sully's concerned spouse. 

Perhaps **Sully** is not the most thoroughly in-depth biopic one would have imagined because we are working with the perplexing man whose heroic actions made us aware of this seasoned phenomenal flyboy glorified in our living rooms nearly two decades ago. There is not much to ponder about Eastwood's fictitious Sullenberger from his past that gives insight to his current-day characterization as the media-praised hero-in-healing. In all fairness, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's claim to fame was his hasty option to spare the endangered existences of his passengers and crew so Eastwood allows his problematic protagonist's questionable heroics to paint the picture as the incredible individual whose January 2009 resourcefulness spoke more truthfully than any miscellaneous flashbacks could do to justify Sully's angst-ridden tendencies.  

Overall, **Sully** establishes a different kind of turbulence for an introspective yet gently intense wounded wonder tip toeing on the borderline of deserved and deceptive worship.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016 || **When a real human bravery wasn't appreciated till the computers confirmed it.**

Another excellent biographical drama for Tom Hanks in the title role. He has transformed from captain Phillips to captain Sully. Another great addition to Clint Eastwood's filmography as well, he never disappoints us. This film was based on the real event of the January 15, 2009. When a US passenger plane got hit by birds just after the take off, losing both the engines, landed on the New York's Hudson river. So the film reveals the heroic event, as well as followed by the investigation of the crash landing.

As it is a Hollywood film what should I expect, another American bravery? Yep, but still a good film, very engaging plot. It's not all about the plane event, because I thought one of the film poster is a spoiler. So the film covers more story, about the drama surrounding the main event. Especially saving the lives, that inspires even for the outside Americans. The entire narration is about two-three day affair, but most of the film was about the crash landing. From the actors to the visuals, all were top class. One of the best biopic that's not based on one's whole life, but one heroic attempt which will be remembered him and this film for forever.

An undercover theme based on the real event. In the 80s when the drug trafficking was so high in the United States that came from the Latin America through the southern border, the US customs service sent its members to infiltrate among them to bust red handed. So this is one of the events where a married man with two children takes a most challenging assignment that might end up badly if he makes a single mistake. In such a tight spot how he and his team are going to achieve the one of a biggest crack in the history revealed in the remaining.

So now we know the story, but this is not an easy game. There are many scenes that would pull you to the edge of your seat. After the wonderful performance in 'Trumbo' that got him an Academy Awards nominee last year, now he's back with another great character display. I'm talking about Bryan Cranson. Another Oscar's nod is quite possible in a second year row, but lets wait and see. This story mainly focused on him, but John Leguizamd was also impressive in an important supporting role and so the Diane Kruger.

I think it was a most realistic undercover film among others I have seen. The drugs were not shown much and so the sex and nudes, despite the plot revolved around that. Even the stunts were minimised, but those rare action sequences were so good. The majority of the film was drama with lots of thrill scenes. The two hours long film, and the story were narrated with a good pace. Not to be missed if you like cops and thieves game.

Ten years ago a similar film was made with Nicolas Cage in the lead called 'Lord of War'. This was based on the two youngsters who got into arm dealing, but many events were fictionalised. War is a business and these two made lots of profit out of it. So it all begins when financially struggling David clueless about raising his unborn child. At a right time he meets his old friend Efraim and decides to partner with him to supply arms to the US army abroad in a small scale. But when they saw a big opportunity, they decided to give it a try. From the obstacles, they go the extra mile to achieve it. But not knowing how serious the consequences are, finally they step into a dangerous turf and from there, what follows is revealed in the remaining parts.

This is really amazing film. Obviously a slow start, but like after 10-15 minutes later it gets better and better. For these actors, this is something big and they have done it excellently. Jonah Hill was simply unbelievable. Kind of good, as well as negative, totally unpredictable character. Mile Teller was superb, he narrated the story with the opening scene, gun pointed at him, the flashback begins. While the story keeps developing, it only gets crazy and crazier. Nearly two long was never been an issue, because of the good pace, as well as for the off beast storyline.

Lately I have been seeing lots of Ana de Armas, quite a coincident to watch some many films of someone in a short time. Anyway, her role in this was small, but she was decent. From the director of 'Hangover' trilogy, I think one of his best films it is. If you like the American Dream themes like 'Pain & Gain' and 'Wolf of Wall Street' about making dollars in a fast way risking everything, you would enjoy it as well. Like those two, it was also a comedy, despite inspired by the real. One of the film posters imitates the 'Scareface', but there's a strong reason for that, so you should watch it. Definitely worth a watch, so I suggest it!

http://www.hweird1reviews.com/allreviews/the-killing-joke-movie-review || Shares the few weaknesses of the short comic it is based on, but adds a bunch of its own new weaknesses to try and get it up to a theatrical runtime and justify its cinema release.

I think part of the reason the reception for _The Killing Joke_ has been so overwhelmingly negative is that the expectations were so high going in. But that wasn't without cause. It sees the long awaited return of both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill to their famed DC roles, and the comic it's based on is widely regarded as one of the better stories ever published by the company. And of these lofty expectations, _The Killing Joke_ falls short.

Hamill is great, and Kevin Conroy usually is as well. There are a couple of occasions that the latter slipped though. I don't know if he's rusty or just didn't care, but his voice performance is not 100%. The story essentially meets that of its source material, but rather than expand the existing story, they chose to awkwardly force an entirely different one in beforehand, to the point that this is essentially two episodes of two different shows, rather than a single cohesive movie.

_The Killing Joke_ is a little gross and is not the return to form for DC Animation that we all had hoped it would be, but the final sequence is fantastic and I don't know that the movie overall deserves quite as much vitriol as it has had.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || The first 30 minutes was wasted with Barbara being so annoying! I just didn't see why that whole bit was thrown in when the movie itself is meant to center on the Joker.

Even with Mark Hamill's final bow out as the iconic villain couldn't save the film. Still, at least that joke at the end was a little amusing!

Other than that, they could've done better with the story."
376659.0,Bad Moms,"When three overworked and under-appreciated moms are pushed beyond their limits, they ditch their conventional responsibilities for a jolt of long overdue freedom, fun, and comedic self-indulgence.",Party like a mother.,Comedy,100.0,2016-07-28,en,6.5,4146.0,3.8269,"Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith","Scott Moore, Scott Moore, Jon Lucas, Jon Lucas","infidelity, alcohol, mother role, hit-and-run, single mother, divorce, family, bathroom humor","**Moms don't quit! Quitting's for dads!**

It was more like a middle aged women's version of 'How to be Single'. So most of the younger audience won't get it, as well as the older people, because of the generation gap. I enjoyed it, but you know this is nothing close to any classic on the similar theme, just a decent entertainer though. From the director of '21 & Over', about the three moms whose children are in the high school, but it depicts those moms struggles over maintain the order in their professional and personal life.

Mila Kunis' character is the centre of the story, but I liked Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn as well. Basically, these three ruled the narration. Some of the comedies were good, though there are too much of sexual references in that. Not good as 'How to be Single', but definitely better than both the 'Bad Neighbours' films.

It got a mixed response, but a box office hit. Most of the story is predictable, though decently developed all the scenes by keeping them simple. I mean cliché wise, but at some parts it gets loud and out of control. So make sure you are not watching for any inspiration, but the middle aged people feel more familiar with this than anybody else. Therefore, I think they're the target audience, and mostly the women.

_6/10_ || I found <em>'Bad Moms'</em> entertaining.

Mila Kunis carries it I must say, without her I think I'd be rating this a fair chunk lower. She is amusing and keeps the film chugging along, helped by the pacing and music which also move the film along nicely. There is a good amount of gags, I certainly enjoyed watching it.

Away from Kunis (Amy), you have a whole host of recognizable faces. Kristen Bell (Kiki) and Kathryn Hahn (Agath..sorry, Carla) are pleasant in their respective roles, Hahn is borderline irritating but I'd say she sticks to the right side just about. Christina Applegate (Gwendolyn) and Jada Pinkett Smith (Stacy) also feature, as does Wendell Pierce (Daryl). Shoutout, also, to <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> alum Ann Mahoney.

There are also sweet end credit scenes. It's a lot better than 2017's <em>'Fun Mom Dinner'</em> too, no doubt about it. Interested to watch the sequel. || Pretty good movie. Was really funny. Probably the best chick flick movies I've ever seen."
338766.0,Hell or High Water,A divorced dad and his ex-con brother resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's farm in West Texas.,Blood always follows money.,"Western, Crime, Drama",102.0,2016-08-11,en,7.304,4601.0,3.4826,"Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Gil Birmingham, Marin Ireland","David Mackenzie, Taylor Sheridan","brother, texas, bank robber, road trip, gun battle, police officer killed, criminal, held at gunpoint, car fire, cowboy, small western town, neo-western, divorced father, bullet hole, audacious","**Early bird gets the worm.**

From the British director of 'Starred Up' fame, it was like another 'The Place Beyond the Pines'. Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.

It has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.

The people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.

_8/10_ || A strong neo-Western that gets everything right, with good pacing, a simple but effective screenplay, great cinematography, sneaky humor and a solid cast.

8/10 || The first ten minutes of this film did not inspire me. Chris Pine (""Toby"") and brother ""Howard"" (Ben Foster) rob some small town banks and attract the attention of the soon to retire, curmudgeonly Jeff Bridges as Texas ranger (""Hamilton""). Well, as it pans, it turns out much better than I had expected: the characterisations are strong; the pace and writing keep it interesting and although the story is riddled with holes and inconsistencies the thing flows along well as the ranger homes in on his increasingly reckless quarry. Bridges' persona is a little similar to his ""True Grit"" (2010) but Gil Birmingham plays a good foil as his cohort (""Alberto"") and the four create quite a lively and enjoyable cat-and-mouse action adventure that had me undecided as to whose side I was on until quite near the end... Largely uncluttered by soppy romance, it's even got a slight Robin Hood spirit about it too."

It is an unfortunate collision of several popular titles and left me wondering if its writers had just binge watched a weekend of thriller films that made a few bucks before looking at each other through a bongy haze and declaring ""Dude we can totally write a screenplay!"" 
The result is a film that is average at best. Perhaps the audience could also benefit from a little pre-screening bongy haze of their own. || There are several contemporary horror showcases that could certainly benefit from co-writer/director Fede Alvarez’s (“Evil Dead”) edgy home invasion thriller **Don’t Breathe**. For starters, Alvarez taps into the suggestive elements of tension without the overextended need to go overboard. The chills and thrills seem almost organic and unassuming. Sure, there appears to be a simplistic approach to an otherwise conventional premise of a house break-in at the hands of opportunistic thugs. Nevertheless, **Don’t Breathe** captures the claustrophobic spirit of its inherent creepiness with stylish cruelty and cleverness.

Inevitably, **Don’t Breathe** may inspire cinematic comparisons to the 2002 David Fincher-directed vehicle _Panic Room_. Understandably the theme is somewhat recognizable to movie audiences as ominous strangers invading your domestic private space is a recipe for paranoia and persecution. However, **Don’t Breathe** takes this precarious situation to a whole new scare tactic level of horrific proportions. Consequently, the executed violence and terror-driven tempo is definitely worthy of its suspense-driven objectives. **Don’t Breathe** is a macabre masterpiece in the making that sets the standard for a current-day stillborn and repetitive horror genre that thrives on pressure cooker predictability.

The set-up for **Don’t Breathe** is quite ambitious and challenging thus forming an interesting spin on the home robbery scenario. The sordid story centers around three upstart small-time crooks making the rounds of thievery in the suburban surroundings of Detroit. Rocky (Jane Levy) and her two male companions Money and Alex (Daniel Zovatto and Dylan Minnette) are able to carry off their home invasion scamming courtesy of Alex’s connections to a home security firm owned by his father (where there is all kinds of access information to private residences and local businesses).

Alex’s stipulation, however, is that these home invasion robberies need to be less flashy without drawing too much attention. Plus, all the stolen items confiscated much not be too expensive otherwise their illegal activities will be exposed much sooner than later. Unfortunately lovebirds Rocky and Money do not see eye-to-eye with Alex’s brand of careful and cautious home-robbing philosophy. In fact, the romantic couple wants to reach for the sky and steal as much stuff possible to make their dreams of living on East Street an immediate reality. So what will it take for Alex to get on the same page as Rocky and Money in terms of all of them benefiting on a big score without suffering the dire consequences?

The consensus is reached among the law-breaking trio that their next target for viable riches is in the form of a blinded Iraqi war veteran (Stephen Lang). The word is that the personally troubled and sightless ex-military man is about to be awarded a whopping three-hundred thousand dollar cash settlement involving the wrongful death of his beloved young daughter. So the home invasion task seems quite self-explanatory to the young heist-happy hooligans as committing theft against a seemingly vulnerable blind man emotionally and psychologically down in the dumps should be a piece of cake so to speak. Well, Rocky and her two boytoys were sadly mistaken if they thought that they could take sole advantage of this savvy yet disturbed disabled war vet with visions of sorrow and sacrifice.

The realization that the home-invading crew has picked a tricky trap of a house to pillage while underestimating the capabilities of its handicapped owner seems like poetic justice. In fact, the irony of the criminal threesome trying to escape the boarded-up dark and dingy household makes them look like the victimized three blind mice at the mercy of a crazed trigger-happy, sight-deprived ex-soldier that can see all too well that his cherished castle and belongings are being jeopardized by these punkish intrusive violators. Strangely, the audience is left wondering whether or not they should root for the blinded bombshell protecting his homestead of secrets or the clueless crooks that talked themselves into this caustic cat-and-mouse game of gloom-and-doom.

**Don’t Breathe** is uncharacteristically compelling for a horror showcase because it relies on genuine scary jolts and jumps…or at least the anticipation of the jolts and jumps that have convincing dramatic weight behind the build up of intensity. Alvarez crafts an arousing narrative that brilliantly displays the mounting nervousness that awaits. Lang’s belligerent blind man patrols every spacing and crevice in the darkness with the will of a rabid dog in heat as he points his explosive firearms at the slightest movements of his trapped guinea pigs in despair. Creatively nerve-racking and nauseous, **Don’t Breathe** makes dutiful usage of its instinctual delivery of shock value as this potent pot-boiler never settles for any sense of false or mechanically manufactured hedonism. The haunting aura that exists in **Don’t Breathe** is gasping in visceral authenticity.

As the menacing misfit saddled by wartime mortar fire blindness but blessed with tactical tenacity drenched in borderline villainy, Lang’s portrayal as the sightless hunter tracking down his vulnerable prey in his tortured domestic playground is solidly digestible. His inner madness was already established by personalized heartbreak but the arrival of his uninvited guests devilishly unleashed more demons within his off-kilter psyche. The moving targets at the other end of the deranged blind man’s intimidating gun are thoroughly convincing as the harried catalysts for their sightless tormentor’s frustration and escalating rage. Levy’s Rocky, Zovatto’s Money and Minnette’s Alex are plausible as the frightened specimens caught in the maniacal maze of their aggressor’s clutches.

The very thought of a psychotic blind man enforcing his brand of warped justice on the youthfully sighted self-indulgent saps is deliciously manipulative and wonderfully inventive. The creepy corners concerning the backlash blackness in **Don’t Breathe** is explored with grand naughtiness and the atmospheric vibes certainly will not disappoint in this percolating peek-a-boo primer.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016 || 2016 has been a great year for horror. With the addition of _Don't Breathe_, 3 of my top 5 movies the past 9 months are in the genre. I'm a pretty huge horror fan but even for me that is crazy unexpected.

In fact I'm yet to be anything other than impressed by his work (not that notable an achievement, as he's only directed two films, but still). _Don't Breathe_ flips a lot of modern horror conventions, and I love it for that. The use of silence and barely audible noise to bring the scares instead of some cheap blaring-ly loud audio. The fact that there is really no one wholly good or wholly evil.... Plus that puppy is really bloody cute...

_Final rating:★★★★ - An all round good movie with a little something extra._"

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || **Nothing is frustrating than losing a best friend!**

There are lots of stupid teen films in the recent time. But don't confuse it with them. It is a fine, sensible drama with some fun. It's a dream debut for the director. Being a woman and making a film on the same subject, especially teenager issue, really well investigated and turned into the beautiful film. Yeah, it is now one of the cult films and by the years pass on, it will gain more popularity with a certain group of people.

A teen girl who lost her close friend to her brother after they both falling in love which she did not approve. It's only the beginning of her worst life in her mid teenage. So now she has to find a way to turn her life around, or she can live her life as it is, but with complaints. The second half of the film is to cover her attempt to recovery, if she achieves one.

The surprise was, I anticipated normal teen comedy that targeted teens only. But it is almost for all ages, excluding the little ones for its strong thematic contents. Kind of inspiring and entertaining film. The casting was awesome. Hailee nailed it just like Ellen Page did for 'Juno'. Yeah, the people were comparing it with that film already. Very satisfying film on this particular theme and definitely a must see.

I had no thought before the watch, but while watching it, I felt it was overrated. That's for a moment, once I finished watching it, realised it's a better film. I mean I changed my stance, after over and over thinking about the film. So its the patience you need, wait till the film to end to decide how much you liked it. It was too long, but every space was filled up with the best parts. It took time to understand the characters, and with multiple angle events in one woman's life. Isabelle Huppert was amazing. Despite so many characters in the film, she ruled it. One of her best films I have seen.

The film focused on the boss of a video game designing firm. It opens with as she's been sexually assaulted in her home by an intruder. Followed by one of her employees morphed her face to an animated character as a sexual explicit material for the game they are working in. So she begins her investigation to find both the culprit who might be the same person. This is where the suspense comes into play to develop interest in us. Besides, facing family troubles takes some extra development. Subsequently, all the mysteries will be solved and to know how it ends, you should watch it.

It is official French submission to the 89th American Academy Awards. But as per the latest news bulletin, this film is out of the Oscars race, despite made into the Golden Globes. From the director of the original 'Total Recall' and his first French film. Based on the book named 'Oh...'. But I felt it was developed from a small part of 'The Little Death'. Basically, there's an understanding being it is the story of the adults, despite the sexual violences and that's how this story was built. So you must compromise on a few things that is shown in it if you really want to enjoy it.

I did not like it all the sudden, though looking back all the film events and joining them together made me see the film was decent. Especially that final line said by a woman who was evacuating her house makes whole thing sense. Maybe that's the real twist in the tale. Initially I did not think to write a review, but surely it deserved one from me, so I wrote this short and quick. This is the film for the grown ups, but not for all the grown ups. So I hope it will meet your expectation if you decide to try, but according to me definitely it is worth.

_7/10_ || Ass-wiping-piece-of-crap-movie glamorizing rape, violence, mutilation, stalking... It is not doing any good for anybody! NO woman (with brains) would ever find this movie sexy!

A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.

Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.

But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.

> ""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""

This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.

In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level.

There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.

I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!

_8/10_ || With a couple of the zombie movies I've watched recently, I've found myself able to go so far in my reviews as to credit the films for some modicum of surprise originality, alongside a rating of four of five out of ten. But it has been **years** since I've been able to say that I saw a zombie movie I genuinely and wholeheartedly **enjoyed**. Or I should say, it **had** been years, right up until last night when I saw _Train to Busan_.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || Fantastic watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend for those looking for a new zombie movie to watch.

This one really had me yelling at the screen: I was heavily invested....until I was basically emotionally exhausted.  I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.

This is a fascinating premise.  A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""World War Z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies.  I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.

There is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4).  The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses.  There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act.  Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.

The one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die.  I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times.  It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.

This movie is honestly so good, I really feel like I'm reaching on any of the complaints."

Recent dusty trail ditties such as David McKenzie's modern-day _Hell or High Water_ or Quentin Tarantino's _The Hateful Eight_ have proven to be recent saddle-tested gems that enthusiastically put cowpoke enthusiasts in movie theater seats. Furthermore, what would Hollywood do if it did not predictably invite yet another remake of a classic film into the moviegoers' mindset? Hence, director Antoine Fuqua takes a challenging stab at generating interest in his latest workman-like western shoot 'em up in the millennium-made version of **The Magnificent Seven**. 

Naturally, Fuqua's chaotic and calculating gun-toting actioner is an updated remake of director John Sturges's 1960 film that starred late iconic box office big stars such as Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach. Of course in return Sturges's borrowed his artistic gun-for-hire gumption from legendary Japanese auteur Akiro Kurosawa's vintage and influential _Seven Samurai_. Fuqua, whose gritty urban police drama _Training Day_ secured a Best Actor Oscar for his **The Magnificent Seven** leading man in two-time Academy Award winner Denzel Washington, takes on the retelling of his particular _Seven_ with feisty fury. One would not necessary anoint Fuqua's outlaw tale as a superior successor to Sturges's borrowed blueprint from Kurosawa. However, Fuqua's array of blazing bullets from his bunch of rag tag bad boys has its own distinctive sense of decorative dare and destruction that feels authentic.

Screenwriters Nic Pizzolatto (""True Detective"")and Richard Wenk deliver an unapologetic script that calls for high body counts, old-fashioned showdowns and a wild west waywardness that swaggers courtesy of Fuqua's corrosive crew. The popcorn entertainment in **The Magnificent Seven** is strictly in guilty pleasure territory so there is no need to tighten up your holsters for all you little buckaroos that are eager to wallow in Fuqua's cutthroat corral of gunslingers.   

Mustached bounty hunter Sam Chisolm (Washington) is the all-dressed-in-black avenger whose mission is to provide protection for the town of Rose Creek, New Mexico. In his ambitious bid to save the jeopardized Rose Creek he must assembled a group of skilled gunmen able to stand up to the diabolical powers-that-be that look to foster the on-going havoc that prevails. 

Specifically, Rose Creek is under the dastardly control of the diabolical Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) that rules the town with an iron fist. The opening scene demonstrates how nefarious Bogue is at heart because he has no qualms about seizing land from its vulnerable owners or quieting down his critics with intimidating force. Basically, Bogue and his hideous henchmen are not to be reckoned with at all--unless you are willing to match wicked-minded wits with the raw and rough Chisolm and his gun-wielding renegades.

Rose Creek resident Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett, ""Music in Lyrics"", ""The Girl on the Train"") steps up to the plate in her effort to confront the nasty Bogue the only best way she knows how--hiring the capable and crafty collection of the Seven to contain this intimidating menace.

Joining Chisolm in his bloody quest to rescue Rose Creek from Bogue's disturbing clutches are explosives expert gambler Josh Farraday (Chris Pratt), and conflicted sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke reuniting with his ""Training Day"" director and co-star Fuqua and Washington). The rest of the tag-a-longs include the outlandishly bearded Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio from TV's ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent""), Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee), Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and Red Harvest (Martin Seinsmeier). Together, the anti-heroes known as the Magnificent Seven hope to meet the expectations of Emma's (and the town's) cause and eradicate the villainous Bogue by any means necessary.    

**The Magnificent Seven** certainly does not have any pretensions about posing as a conscious-minded, revisionist western as it definitely does not have the prolific pedigree such as Clint Eastwood's _Unforgiven_ for instance. Nevertheless, the film does have a devilish impishness as its main function is to echo an exaggerated rustic feel to its throwback acknowledgement when westerns of yesteryear were just plain frivolous and furious without any particular rhyme or reason.

Sure, the characters have really no inside depth beyond their taste for roughshod recklessness and wild tumbleweed theatrics. This is not necessarily a bad thing to consider in Fuqua's **The Magnificent Seven** because the name of the game is serving up an escapist need for its giddy-up rush for the senses. Indeed, Washington and company will not make anybody forget the aforementioned Brynner and his squad from nearly six decades ago. Still, this particular _Seven_ has its own kind of favorable punch to savor. 

The notable names in _Seven_ do rise to the occasion within the context of this otherwise basic story of the wannabe borderline good guys versus the bombastic bad guys. Washington's Chisolm is solidly smooth as charismatic as the leader of the pack. Pratt's Farraday is a charming hoot as the roguish gambling cad. Hawke's Goodnight does a decent job portraying the talented gun handler simply trying to get his groove back due to his shaken confidence from a prior incident (yes, the catchy movie moniker of Goodnight Robicheaux is a keeper to say the least). And D'Onofrio's amusing Horne is deliciously irreverent. The always adventurous Sarsgaard comes to life as the vile wonder whose presence inspires the Seven to tap into vengeance mode. 

At the end of the roundup it is quite clear that **The Magnificent Seven** wants to lasso its penchant for resembling a showy Hollywood western even if it is at the expense of lifting its rowdy roots from the likes of its highly regarded predecessors from golden cinema's treasured past.

Basically, people watch it for either those actors and the director or for an entertertainment. But we all know the story, how it begins and how it ends, since it was the remake of the 1960 film. Actually, it was a successful remake, but not as magnificent as the original. Maybe the youngsters might like this one better.

The director's favourite, Denzel Washington in one of the main characters. Not much change in the theme, except the screenplay was little altered, especially diversity in the film characters and their developments. Because nowadays that's a big issue in Hollywood cinema. So it was led by Denzel and possibly there will be a sequel like the 'Ocean's' trilogy.

The people from a small mining town decides to hire men with guns to fight the villainous businessman who slaughtered their loved ones. The unusual seven men come together and form a team with a plan to defend the town. So what comes next is the battle between the good and the bad that lasts for the whole final act.

The setting was completely refreshing, but slightly disappointing action sequences. All the seven characters were unique and awesome, but the film lacked the great battle scene that defines each one of them. Surely I favour it just for once watch that told from the todays imagination of the 1870s era. Feels like it should have been better, but in the end it is a satisfying film.

This is an exceptional film, but only from one perspective and that is, LGBT. I totally respect that, because I'm a big supporter. But apart from that, particularly from the filmmaking aspect I did not like it. I felt like this film took place somewhere in Africa, but the accent was American. Because I could not find a single white or any other race people, even in the background.

The happy parts are, it is surprisingly a very interesting theme. I loved the storyline. The three phases of a man's life. How things around us can influence to build a personality. Sometimes in a good sense, but according to this film, there are some dramatic turns. Though the end was very simple, but I liked the first episode. It had potential to be a message film, but the later parts turned differently. Most importantly realistic narrative.

More like it is about the life cycle. Feels like a short and suburban version of 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring'. All the actors were so good. The screenplay was adapted from a book. Looks like it's a breakthrough for the director. I hope he keeps up the momentum and gives us the best products in the future. This film is not for everyone, mainly because of the theme. Initial parts were okay, but the latter developments were unexpected. It is one of the good films of the year, not the best.

_7/10_ || It's the third segment of this that's the most interesting but the preceding two are essential in helping us to understand the situation in which the young ""Chiron"" (Alex R. Hibbert, then an effective Ashton Sanders as a troubled teenager before finally, by this latter point, Trevante Rhodes) finds himself. Initially we see a young boy living in Miami with his crack-addicted mother ""Paula"" (Naomie Harris). He grows up being shunned and bullied at school with his search for some sort of stability and guidance through life coming largely from his pal ""Kevin"", neighbourhood dealer ""Juan"" (Mahershala Ali) and his generously spirited girlfriend ""Teresa"" (Janelle Monáe). It's these people that put him on a path - a twisting and uncomfortable path - to his own self-discovery and a start in believing in himself and in his own identity. It's a coming of age drama, sure, but it carefully and delicately looks at the life of a young boy who evolves amidst an environment of indifference, confusion and intolerance. Of a lad who is coming to terms with his own sexual identity with little if any peer support to assist with this complex process of maturity. His grasp on decency and integrity is sorely challenged all through his life, but he never loses a sense of what is right and the last half hour is as poignant a tale of manhood as you're likely to see on screen. The acting across the board is pretty top drawer, as is the powerfully delivered but sparingly written dialogue. This is not a festival of endless chatter, but a presentation of scenarios that we can assess as ""Chiron"" grows up and we share in his life choices. It's emotional and engaging, not without a little humour to lighten it at times and we maybe even get the start of a love story? Well worth a watch a few times, i'd say."

The film reminded me 'Pain & Gain', only for inspiring from the real and being the comedy flicks. Other than that there's nothing in common between them. I have been expecting a lot from Zack since 'The Hangover', but it was always the near missed opportunities. I'm not saying this was his much needed breakthrough, but quite enjoyable film.

An honest man who worked long enough as a guard for a bank, was approached by his ex colleague and her men with an offer. Since he was madly in love with her, he could not say no to it, despite he already got engaged to another woman. As planned the heist goes on and once it was done, he was ditched and ratted out. Now on the run, how he responds to it and the following events decides his fate.

Not a great comedy nor a heist film, but it had its moments. The casting was good and it was Zack's show. The rest of them were not into that much, except in the final act. Jason Sudeikis was a bonus. His appearance added more fun. Now I know why Jim Carrey opted out. Owen Wilson's part was not good enough in such a small role, he did good though. Watching it for timepass is fine or even for beyond that seems not a bad try.

As with the majority of adventurous and challenging narratives that seek the high-minded exploratory vibes in its execution, **Kubo and the Two Strings** is about the creative coming-of-age quest of a young boy and the spellbinding encounters that materialize as a result. Knight and screenwriters Marc Haimes and Chris Butler oversees a profound and aesthetically remarkable production highlighted by notable voiceover performers (such as Academy Award-winners Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey), stylish and glowing animation and a hypnotic showcase that is an exquisite treat for moviegoers from all walks of life.

Importantly,** Kubo and the Two Strings** is aided by its heralded association with the Oregon-based studio Laika whose treasured reputation in the stop-motion animation process is tremendously noteworthy. Among Laika’s previously outstanding cinematic samples include 2009’s _Coraline_, 2011’s criminally underrated _ParaNorman_ and 2014’s _The Boxtrolls_ so indeed Knight’s superlative **Kubo and the Two Strings** is among exceptional stock. The detailed imagery in **Kubo** is indescribably luscious and the brilliant artistic manufacturing of Laika’s refined flourishes only elevates Knight’s enticing animated vehicle as a compelling journey into the ancient Japanese Edo period mythology.

One can tell that the coveted **Kubo and the Two Strings** is destined to stay true to its mystical leanings especially when the beginning film’s sequence features the caustic quote: ““If you must blink, do it now” …because “if you look away, even for an instant, our hero will surely perish.” As previously mentioned the story takes place in ancient Japan where we find the gifted 11-year old Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson from “Game of Thrones”) existing with his ailing mother on the outskirts of a nearby village. The young Kubo’s talents is such that he is a natural story-telling magician that can skillfully convey his expressive communication through origami. Kubo enjoys the gesture of entertaining the local villagers. However, his mother advises that Kubo must be home before nightfall. Unfortunately, Kubo does not heed her advice but that is not due to his personal defiance or negligence.

In fact, Kubo’s no-show at home is large in part cue to the dubious agenda of his grandfather Moon Father (Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes). In instructing his dastardly daughters to track down their beleaguered nephew the stakes are high especially when Moon Father was instrumental in the demise of his slain samurai father. Hence, Kubo must locate his late father’s magical armor-related belongings and reclaim a sense of honor. The tag-a-longs at Kubo’s side include the woolly-looking snow Monkey (Theron) and buff warrior Beetle (McConaughey). Together, the travelling trio is confronted by beastly specimens and other deceptive supernatural forces en route to the ultimate showdown with his sinister grandfather Moon Father. Armed with resiliency and determination Kubo and his crafty companions face uncertainties that are quite unimaginable to say the least.

**Kubo and the Two Strings** is an astonishing offering that taps into its pulsating pulse with its mild intensity that should not deter the youngsters from fully experiencing the escapist vision of young Kubo and his offbeat sidekicks. Parkinson’s Kubo is idealistic and has a fearless approach to questioning the unassuming world around him. The combination of roguishness and wide-eyed innocence is certainly appealing to the intrigued tots that may view Kubo’s wily exploits as exciting and surreal in the name of his heroic daddy’s destiny. Theron’s acid-tongued Monkey is inspired in grand impishness with snarky flair. As for McConaughey’s flippant gung-ho Beetle he is an odd serving of comical relief and well-intentional courageousness. Fiennes makes for an ideal unctuous rival as his Moon Father is the Darth Vader to Kubo’s impressionable Luke Skywalker blueprint. Also, Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara is wickedly delicious as the scheming aunts–the twin sisters of Kubo’s sickly mother. Rounding out the supporting cast are the supplied voices of Asian contributors such as George Takei’s (“TV Star Trek’s original Sulu”) Hosato, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa’s Hashi and Minae Noji’s Minae among the Kubo personalities that populate Knight’s dazzling display of a transcendent Japanese-flavored Grimm fairy tale.

Naturally the real selling point for **Kubo and the Two Strings** is the standout computer-generated technology and other incorporated genres of animation that gives this polished fantasy fable its magnificent sheen. Knight, a first-time director whose background as Laika’s primary animator is evidenced in the celebrated animation studio’s first three films, demonstrates the authenticity of his amazing craft courtesy of the stop-motion precision that defines his sensual cinematic landscape.

Overall, **Kubo and the Two Strings** radiates with sweeping charm, boldness, curiosity and depth as it exemplifies the epitome of the awestruck construction of an enlightening, sophisticated feature length animation. The mixture of humor, thrills, drama and tragedy is decidedly triumphant allowing **Kubo and the Two Strings** to flex its reflective, throbbing mysterious muscles.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016 || **A boy, a monkey and a giant beetle team up for a quest.**

This is not an old fashioned stop-motion animation. This is a very modern, a hybrid of multiple techniques that includes 3D printing and digital special effects. The directional debut for the producer of 'ParaNorman' and 'The Boxtrolls'. The tale is about a one eyed boy named Kubo, who has been hiding in a seaside mountain cave near a small village from his grandfather, the moon king, ever since his birth, protected by his mother. He grew up listening the stories of a legendary samurai warrior Hanzo. But one day after he himself exposed to the moonlight, the troubles follow. Now his only chance to survive is to find his father's armours and so the quest begins where he teams up with other two.

This is a Japanese story, takes place somewhere in a fictional ancient Japan. Technically, this film was so good, very pleasant for viewing, especially the framerate was higher than normal stop-motion animation. The character models, music, the length of the film, the pace of the narration, all were so brilliant, but not the story. It was average, I mean very, very simple and familiar. Still, it is a very likable film, particularly the children would love it. I'm going to repeat again like I always say while reviewing stop-motion animation films that this kind of films are rare, so when they make one, that automatically goes to a must see list. Whether you're going to like it or not, I hope you won't miss it.

_7/10_ || Great, creative story.

<em>'Kubo and the Two Strings'</em> is a fun film, I enjoyed it all. I love the animation style that Laika use, they also tend to get the vibe of their stories pretty bang on. This is my favourite work of the studio's so far, at least before I watch <em>'Missing Link'</em>.

The casting could've been more appropriate, though I'm a believer of anyone playing anyone when it comes to voice roles. Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey make for an undeniably strong trio. Parkinson and Theron do particularly good jobs, though McConaughey is my standout. Elsewhere, Ralph Fiennes and George Takei are, minorly, involved.

The lovely story and top animation are the biggest takeaways from this. Recommended."

Unlike the first two films, this was not based on the book. Instead, it is an original screenplay that fills the gap between the second and the third book. So reading the third book before watching this film is a spoiler. Most importantly the fourth film is on, only officially have to be announced.

The original director returned to this, but I appreciate the story and the screenplay and people behind it. I did not think this sequel would work, but it exceeded my expectation. A simple story and very familiar settings, but developed so well. There's no Bridget's diary in this, instead an iPad.

Renee Zellweger was totally unrecognisable. Actually, I said that in my 'The Whole Truth' review. But she was good to return as Bridget. Colin Firth looks too older than his actual age, but was great in his part. No Hugh Grant, but a new competitor was introduced which is none other than Patrick Dempsey.

This is not the same kind of narration that we saw a decade ago. Because all the characters are aged, so according to the situation this story takes place. It's a two hour long film, but it had some good jokes. Those who enjoyed the first two would surely enjoy it as well. So choosing it to watch is not a bad idea.

_7/10_ || <em>'Bridget Jones’s Baby'</em> is a good sequel, a much better movie than the 2004 follow-up without a doubt. This one has an actual plot, for one, and is a much more rounded effort - the ending is rather cute too. Despite being the longest entry of the trilogy, this is paced well.

Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth reprise well, while Patrick Dempsey is a good addition. The films merges the new characters with the old (minus one obvious absentee) positively, e.g. Sarah Solemani is one of the better supports from any of the three flicks. The musician cameo is amusing too.

You have to wonder where they are going to go with 2025's <em>'Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy'</em>, kinda mad they've managed to create four of these to be honest - two (one?) would've sufficed. Still, this 2016 release is, all in all, a good one; if still narrowly shy of the original, naturally."

It is still watchable. The dramatization is fairly well done and the effects are believable as well as enjoyable. If you watch it as a disaster drama and special effects movie it is definitely okay.

As a documentary, well I would say that it falls short. The movie only covers the initial explosion. Once the platform is evacuated the movie stops. I am somewhat disappointed at that. I would at least have liked to see the attempts to put out the fire. Where are the scenes with the boats trying to douse the rig with water for instance?

I would also have liked the film to cover the attempts to close the well, the technical challenges involved and the fight against the oil spill. This is not at all covered.

I feel that the film attempts to ride on public opinion, pretend to be a action/disaster movie as well as a fact telling one and cash in on the accident. The action/disaster parts were well done but the movie left out a lot of the, perhaps less spectacular, drama around the accident. It is a shame because now it became a rather ordinary movie as well as giving a distasteful feeling they were just trying to make some quick bucks on the disaster.

That also made the factual parts somewhat in doubt. I feel the movie is making a strong effort to portray BP as willful criminals. I am sure there is plenty of blame that should fly BP’s way but at the same time one can read that “On November 8, 2010, the inquiry by the Oil Spill Commission revealed its findings that BP had not sacrificed safety in attempts to make money, but that some decisions had increased risks on the rig.”. As always, things are not black and white and oil drilling is risky business after all.

Anyway, enough ramblings, I found the movie okay, nothing more and nothing less. || **To remind us our errors and limits.**

It was a surprising film. Because it was based on a real event, but there's nothing much about heroism which is essential for most of this kind of film and its success to inspire the viewers. I liked that. They just wanted to tell the story. Not to create a hero nor a villain. But due to the casting, Mark Wahlberg looks the centre of the story. And also points out a negative character without confirming anything properly. But if the film is depicting the real incident correctly, then it was no man's fault. It should be a technical error that led to the man's push over the limit.

It's April 20 2010 about 60 kms away southern coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico. A new batch arrives to continue drilling in the deep sea as part of oil exploration. When they felt they have got it, but it's only a back foot. Small small errors, following a big blow, the entire crew with the greater effort to stop it ends in vain. Finally, it is a matter of saving their own life than the drilling platform. With lots of action, how one of the biggest man made disaster in the recent time comes to end covered in the remaining part.

From the director of 'Lone Survivor' and his part in the project was appreciable. It is another sea disaster theme like the recent 'The Finest Hours'. The film was mainly developed from the articles and also got nominated for the Oscars in two categories, but did not win any. Visual effects were the key for such film and I liked those parts. I appreciate for recreating the event for the world know what really happened. It is a must see, not for entertainment purpose, but it will work for that as well. Recommended!

_7½/10_ || **Very well-balanced, the film does not tire us and provides good entertainment.**

Disaster and accident films are common, although I feel that, for the last ten years, this has been an underexplored genre. The film is based on a true incident where a massive oil drilling rig suffered critical safety failures, eventually catching fire and collapsing. After investigations, the inadequate operation of a team that was supposed to place a cement lining in the hole opened by the platform was responsible for what happened, as well as the lack of maintenance of the equipment, all situations that would have been avoided if the company contracting the platform, BP, had really been less avaricious in relation to the costs and delays of the undertaking.

The film is quite good, it offers us quality entertainment without major flaws, but this does not mean that it is free from important criticism. In fact, the script could be better if there wasn't such a long delay, at the beginning of the film, to reach the platform. I got the idea that the film takes a long time to gain interest and wastes time, in this initial phase, with aspects of lesser relevance. I also felt that it ends very abruptly, without much consideration being given, beyond the statements in the later process.

Observing the way the film was structured and thought out, it becomes quite obvious that Mark Wahlberg was thought of as the protagonist, the main actor of the film. However, the truth is that the actor erases himself throughout the film and seems to avoid appearing or doing anything that makes him heroic and worthy of this role. Personally, I think it's one of the weakest and most uninteresting performances by the actor, whose merits, abilities or talent – ​​caveat – are not up for debate. Much better, stronger, more impactful and more present on screen, Kurt Russell deserves praise for a job well done. He steals attention whenever he appears or says something. I also enjoyed the contributions by Gina Rodríguez and John Malkovich.

The film had the competent direction of Peter Berg. He was not always successful in his efforts, there are actually some issues of rhythm and editing that should have been worked on better, but it ends up deserving a very positive note, especially if we take into account that he managed to prevent a film so susceptible to eventual CGI overdoses to be turned into an avalanche of effects and technical resources without script support. This is a recurring flaw in disaster movies, and we've seen how much it hurt other productions, like “2012”, for example. The resources are here, the CGI is very evident in the film, and it is, in fact, striking and imposing, but it is not absorbing to the point of making us feel like we are watching something fictional. Another point of success in the technical aspects of this film is the subtle harmony between the construction and development of the characters and the tension that, gradually and unhurriedly, builds up until the accident. A truly realistic scenario and good costumes and soundtrack complete the technical composition of a film that does not tire us and entertains us without being a masterpiece."

I understand that the lead is our door into this fantastical world, but a character can be relatable without being downright boring. Not an outright bad movie, but certainly not the one to put Tim Burton back on track.

Eva Green is golden but under-utilised, Sam Jackson can barely talk through his fake teeth, the creature designs are fantastic but pulled off with some very poor CGI. There is a little stop-motion to counter this, but again, it's not used to the degree it should have been. Which is really an apt description for the whole thing. Over an over, _Miss Peregrine's_ hints at a great movie buried somewhere within it, but what we end up with is an ill-paced mess. The only truly engaging character momets of the whole story are dropped as soon as they crop up in favour of the ""Good VS Evil"" rhetoric you've seen a million times before.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Well one certainly cannot accuse filmmaker Tim Burton from straying away from his trademark bizarre movie-making playbook. Perhaps Burton’s best asset when it comes to his brand of distinctive cinema is to faithfully maintain that solid sense of oddness in the manner for which he presents his randomly spry, off-kilter narratives? There was always this consistent understanding that Burton enthusiastically embraces the whimsical peculiarities of his colorful, cockeyed characterizations. Naturally, the eccentric Burton would be drawn to yet another off-balance project that is right up his weirdly imaginative alley. Hence, in **Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children** the notoriously quirky director is true to form as he presents another delightfully macabre and freakish showcase that will definitely appeal to the darkened nature of the kiddie crowd.

**Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children** is the big screen adaptation of Ranson Rigg’s popular young adults trilogy. The film is an instant magnet for Burton’s off-the-cuff style and standard of warped whimsy. The Sci-Fi enhanced children’s fantasy is highlighted effectively by visually arousing set decorations, breath-taking CGI special effects, eye-popping costumes and an overall wonderment of interestingly deformed yet capable super-powered youngsters with unusual gifts that define their unique identities. Screenwriter Jane Goldman (“Stardust”) dutifully captures the misguided magic of Rigg’s best-selling novel brought to life that is very reminiscent of an atmospheric _Harry Potter-esque_ universe where one can easily detect that stimulating Hogswarts vibe bursting at the seams. The only viable knock on **Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children** is that Burton has explored this twisted territory before thus giving the familiar illusion that he is making the same movie over again but with some updated dressing. Still, the surreal stamp of Burton’s animated movie mindset is enough to recommend the erratically conceived **Miss Peregrine’s** as a frolicking fun-filled fable riddled with perky-minded naughtiness.

The construction of **Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children** is a strange brew that brings together the assembled working parts of a previous Burton Gothic-looking spectacle with similar elements meshed in the movie-related mechanics of such ditties including Mary Poppins, the aforementioned _Harry Potter_ film franchise, _Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory_ with a touch of a junior-sized _X-Men_ sentiment attached to the proceedings. Basically, Burton encourages his kooky kind of whirlwind escapism where he wants to transport the audience into a hazy maze of unstable, creepy hedonism embedded in indescribable gaudy chaos. It is no secret that Burton looks to incorporate his known ingredients of strangeness, endearment, gentle terror and slight wackiness. The majestic concoction, for the most part, works on the welcomed senses.

In the title role of **Miss Peregrine** is the fetching Penny Dreadful star Eva Green (one of Burton’s featured actresses from his 2012 film “Dark Shadows”). The nostalgic backstory of Miss P. and her mixture of rejected orphans is recalled in detail by a Florida-based retiree named Abe Portman (Terrance Stamp) who revels in enlightening his teenage grandson Jake (Asa Butterfield) about the remarkable wonder woman and her special orphanage stationed on a Welsh island. Clearly, Jake thinks highly of his grandfather’s fascinating vintage storytelling but feels like an outsider especially when his own parents think that he is in need of serious counseling. When Jake is not engaged in Abe’s recollections of his old pals from Miss Penegrine’s orphanage (complete with handy black-and-white photographs for proof of his proclamations) he works at the local supermarket in uneventful fashion.

As legend has it poor Miss Penegrine’s Victorian orphanage located on the island of Cairnholm was demolished by Nazi bombs that rendered her and the kids vulnerable during World War II. However, we are also informed of the supernatural tendencies of the resilient lady and her “peculiar children”. For one, Miss Penegrine can turn herself into a…wait for it…penegrine falcon at a moment’s notice. As for the bird beauty’s charges they too possess noteworthy specialties in appearances  and spellbinding prowess as well although not as accepting as Miss P’s accentuated tricks.

Jake had always viewed his grandfather’s accounts of Miss Penegrine and her peculiar children in question as a compelling revelation especially when he was younger. Jake, courtesy of his indifferent folks, saddle him as the caretaker for the ailing Abe. However, when he uncovers his dementia-ridden, dying grandpa Abe babbling endlessly about monsters and everything connected to the Miss Peregrine universe this sparks an immense curiosity about Jake wanting to further explore Abe’s whispered claims of seemingly exaggerations. Jake is convinced that Abe was murdered–no doubt by the so-called monsters–and wants to further the cause by visiting the mysterious European island that planted so many adventurous memories in his grandfather’s childhood back in the early wartime forties. Additionally, the concept of time bubbles known as “loops” figure into the suspense. The loops are a designed invention by Miss Penegrine to keep her endangered wards safe from the period’s on-going harm.

Since Jake is already in therapy and everyone thinks that the troubled kid has a screw loose in the aftermath of the trauma regarding his deceased beloved grandpa Abe it is suggested that maybe a visit to the Welsh island would put to rest the inner conflict within the young man. So Jake’s father Franklin (Chris O’Dowd) accompanies his son to Cairnholm where he can sort out his lingering angst. Can Jake successfully locate his grandfather’s old-time orphanage and come to his own elusive conclusions? Soon, the modern-day Jake will experience his own time-traveling warp where he will at firsthand encounter the captivating kids that were included in youthful Abe’s existence including the lovely Emma (Ella Punell) that strikes his fancy–the same gal that his grandfather crushed on back in his heyday.

**Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children** is a jumbled gem that does not quite separate its eerie realm from other Burton-oriented fare that shares the same branding of visual makeup found in entries such as _Beetlejuice_, _Edward Scissorhands_ or _Dark Shadows_. Nevertheless, **Miss Pelegrine’s** is stunning although the half-baked plot bounces aimlessly at will. When Jake is transported back to 1943 and witnesses the peculiar-looking children we are truly in awe of Burton’s tangy taste for the cartoonish craziness. Children that are cursed (or blessed) with head-scratching anomalies not to mention the haunting images of Hollowgast monsters and Green’s fetching but crafty spellbound diva in Miss P all establishes an intriguing off-balance children’s Sci-Fi fantasy that hits more than it misses its nightmarish target.

Burton assembles some notable names that fill the circus ring surroundings in **Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children**. The explosive Samuel L. Jackson is on board as the villainous Barron looking to feast upon the peculiar kiddies’ eyeballs. Veteran performer Stamp is convincing as the aging Abe whose descriptions of his 40’s-era childhood inspires Butterfield’s Jake to make this disjointed journey into Burton’s devilish and daring vision of eccentricity. Other supporting players include the magnificent Judi Dench’s Miss Avocet, Emmy-winning actress Allison Janney (from TV’s “Mom”) as Dr. Golan and Rupert Everett as the resident ornithologist.

Surely, **Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children** won’t entirely disappoint avid Burton fans as he delivers what amounts to be a safe serving of sideshow cinema ready to please the entertaining palates of gentle grotesque-loving moviegoers everywhere.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016 || **The innocent peculiar children versus the monstrous peculiar adults.**

I thought it should have been a Steven Spielberg film, but he would have compromised on the visually frightening negative characters. Particularly from the little children's angle who are the regular target audience for a theme like this. Even in his recent 'The BFG', you know how the giants were portrayed. So Tim Burton was the right choice and he did his best. But not everybody agrees on that, even I was slightly disappointed. I mean technically it sounded so awesome, but the story was not that impressive. Because of too familiarity, except the peculiar characters.

It was based on the young adult book of the same name. The story of a boy named Jake. After his grandfather's murder, he goes to Wales to find the children from an island home about the stories he had heard when he was a little. He discovers they are intentionally stuck in a time loop to avoid their enemies from striking them. But what they feared is about the come true, so now how they plan to defeat after half a century hiding from them is to be told in the rest of the segment.

As a children's film fan, I wanted to like it, but not fully satisfied. It was a two hour long film, the first half was an introduction that we saw everything from its trailers and teasers. So I lost interest in those parts, but once the clash between the good and bad had began, the film started to give something new. Again the final battle at the fair should have been designed better. I thought Samuel L. Jackson was not untilised well.

The major issue with the film was the narration not trying to take a big step in the story development. Felt like they are aiming for a sequel, so they are avoiding to give out everything in here itself. Similar to the first 'Twilight' film, which was too boring drama. It is almost out of the big screen now and the rating further going to drop. The film critics bashed it, but seems most of the people and film fanatics enjoyed it. I hope they will make 'Hallow City' and I'll be waiting for that.

It is one of those films that I thought I saw everything from its trailer. Not just me, many others said the same. Those we were never read the original source. Yes, it was based on the book of the same name. I really liked it. Unpredictable, but once it reveals its secret, it feels so simple that we'd missed. Straightforward storytelling. No flashbacks. Great characters, but that's where the story had a strong grip. Especially when the suspense unveiled, you might say all the earlier events were in the wrong direction, which were intentionally done to divert viewer's envision.

An alcoholic woman who daily takes the train to work, witnesses out of the window a woman happily married and living the life of her dream. When one day she sees a mysterious man with her, the tale takes a twist. Following the suspense, what she finds and how the film ends are the remaining part. Emily Blunt was very good. There are other characters, but it was Emily's story, told from her perspective. Recognisable role with an award, but the film's theme was an adult. Not like sexual exploration, but the basic outline was drawn out of such concept. One of the finest crime-mystery in the recent time, so surely worth a watch.

IMHO Ben Affleck has the ability to stink up the screen and has done so on a number of occasions, thankfully this was not one of them.  The premise was good, the characters interesting and the action worked within the story. None of it felt forced which was a nice surprise. Worth a one time watch. ;) || **He's not the same man inside out!**

The film was powerful, one of the best of the year I have seen. From the director of 'Warrior'. The story of a freelance accountant who was hired by a company to find the financial frauds. But when he's on the verge to uncover the names, the company rolls back over one of its member's death in the following day. It does not stop there, the life threat tails him and all who were involved with him. Now the film reveals his real identity going back to disclose his childhood days, like how he grew up. In the meantime, he has to find those people who are after him before they do and so with a twist the film comes to an end.

Coming from a DC film, now Ben Affleck proved he can be like any other top actors from the industry. His physique was great for the role he played. Thanks to Batman role. This is like his version of 'John Wick' or 'Jack Reacher'. Definitely we can expect a sequel here. Anna Kedrick was great in the recent time with all her films, particularly the box office wise. In this she did not get bigger role, but one of the main and in the follow-up, she might get more opportunity. The film was almost perfect for a crime-thriller. Especially the characters make the finest film of its kind. An outstanding film, so recommended for those who seek entertainment fullest.

_9/10_ || **Overall : A fresh action standout with unique characters and excellent fight sequences. The Accountant's numbers just add up!**

The Accountant was an unexpected action thriller with unique character choices. Ben Affleck's Chris Wolff is a highly capable and efficient hitman with high functioning autism that leads a double life as a forensic accountant-not a typical main character in an action movie and is handled brilliantly well. However, the true highlight of this movie is the writing making each moment and character feel fresh and memorable. Fantastic action sequences and an outstanding cast, along with the exceptional writing, elevates The Accountant well above average action flicks to a special must-see action standout."

The post Harry Potter series, apart from awesome in 'Horns', Daniel Radcliffe struggled to find his character, where he fits in. I mean he tried many different ones, but I think in this he was so good. Initially I thought 'whaaaat?' Because with his physique, he did not qualify to play an FBI agent. He was like when the Captain America first came to the army recruitment. And then when the story progressed, I realised the character was designed that way. So I found it kind of fun, though the topic it was dealing, especially knowing it was inspired by the real, this is definitely an eye opener.

The first 5 minutes reveals the film's whole plot. Though the opening was the end part of some undercover operation taken by the FBI. It does not show us how it all had happened, but with a new mission, another similar kind of event follows which is what this film.

Some people call it a propaganda, but I think it was a good message film for the common people. For how misused the homeland security force. I mean they were doing their jobs, but for achieving big within the force, they take the risks which unfortunately transforms the barking dogs into the biting ones.

So basically the infiltration means, they are the one to encourage those bad guys to act, in order to get them red handed. If it was for a good cause like if they nab the real culprit, then it's okay, but the innocents should not be turned into evil and punished. Like there are no bad guys, but they make one and take into the custody. If you watch it and think about it, you would relaise what I meant.

It was a better film than I anticipated, and the performance by Daniel Radcliffe was the highlight of the film. Some newcomer directed it and decently done his job. Not a must see, but surely I force you to watch it to learn the good, the bad and the ugly sides of the FBI force.

But this sequel, adapted from another of Lee Child's bestselling books, has the misfortune to bear a title which may provide its epitaph.

Reacher does come back, on a similar mission to last time: that is, to clear someone's name and run around (he does a lot of running) dodging those who would rather see him hand-cuffed and out of their ill-intentioned way. || **...but he did go back and got into a trouble!**

The original source is a long book series, so they did not do it in order. Like the first film, which was based on the ninth book, this one was on the eighteenth. It was a stylishly made film. The actors were good, and their stunts were excellent. But not the storyline. This is a very familiar theme. You know, someone framed you and you go on to dig the truth while everyone trying to hunt you down. There are lots of close encounter, which give great thrilling entertainment. So, other than the story, everything looked fine.

Jack goes to meet one of his ex colleagues at his old headquarters. But soon he discovers she's behind the bars and now he's too for the crime they did not do. So escaping from the prison and looking for clues, who framed them and why, all one by one disclosed with some excellent running-chasing action sequences. The film almost as good as any timepass action film. But like it was the new wine in an old bottle. So it won't work for everyone, especially those with greater expectations.

The 55 year old Tom Cruise on the edge to become a veteran actor, but still he got that action hero macho in him. Probably another 3-4 films, including the upcoming 'Mission: Impossible' sequel. So this franchise could replace his cast with younger one in the future. Because another 20 books to go. Though, I'm thinking about the television series. Cobie too was awesome. The film justifies to its original, but not more than an above average. So good for once watching it.

_6.5/10_ || A suitably entertaining sequel, even if it is a downgrade on the very good original.

<em>'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back'</em> sees a whole new cast, with one obvious exception, and that does affect my enjoyment - not a fan of major cast changes, myself. Still, the newcomers all add a decent amount with their performances. The premise, meanwhile, is less interesting than that of <em>'Jack Reacher'</em>, but it still makes for solid action.

Tom Cruise (Jack) is, as you'd predict, the clear best part of this follow-up. That man does a lot of productions in this genre, in that regard his performance doesn't feel majorly different from his other work but the film is at its highest point when he is onscreen. Cruise is joined by the pleasing Cobie Smulders (Turner) and satisfactory Danika Yarosh (Samantha). Elsewhere, you have the underused duo of Aldis Hodge (Espin) and Robert Knepper (James).

In conclusion, this may not match 2012's effort but there is still fun to be had."
331313.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"**Curiosity led them to involve in a greater danger.**

It was the other Zack Galifianakis film that I watched back to back. 'Mastermind' was a fun crime film based on the true event, but this one was purely fictional action-comedy. Once again the casting looked so good. Particularly Gal Gadot, her involving in it after becoming Wonder Woman is a hype. So anyone to anticipating some great action sequences is normal, but it was average on that section.

First of all, it is nothing to do with the 2009 film 'The Jonese'. The characters seem quite resembling, like between and about the neighbors, but totally different plot. When a new couple move into a vacant house, the one in the neighborhood suspect there's something going with them. After all the efforts, when they come to know the couple's true identity, they're already involved in their undertaking and now cooperating is the only way out. So how it ends with their entanglement takes the film to its final stage.

Comedy scenes were good. Not that much clichéd, so one can have a decent fun watching it, especially with a low expectation. Both the lead women were hot, despite not much cleavage in the film. There are some unexpected parts too, but as a comedy, it was much better. And as an action & spy film, it doesn't do much to impress. Overall, a passable film, particularly comedy wise. So if you prefer it, then it should be on that merit.

_6/10_ || **Keeping Up with the Joneses isn't bad, but isn't anything to get excited about either.**

The cast of this film drew me to this movie. Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot as spies was an excellent decision. Not to mention, Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher are hilarious in any movie. But somehow, even with the directing of an experienced comedy director, Keeping Up with the Joneses couldn't impress. There were some funny parts, but the movie overall was predictable, unimaginative, and at times just plain annoying. That might be a little harsh, but the quality of star power keeps the movie from slipping entirely into disappointment, but overall, Keeping Up with the Joneses is a forgettable comedy with a spy twist."

This was one of those occasions where instead of entertainment it was a chore to watch, I didn't find the actors performances anything special or the context of the story.

Overall very boring and if I am going to score this it would be a 1 out of 10. I did stick with it to the end and gave it its best shot, but not for me. || American dramatist Kenneth Lonergan’s third feature, after his career has been punishingly stalled by the ill-fated MARGARET (2011), made in 2005 as a much-anticipated follow-up to his sterling debut YOU CAN COUNT ON ME (2000), then embroiled in the lawsuit purgatory with the film’s producers and only would be permitted for a limited release 6 years after, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA impacts as a resounding comeback and it is as good as you can get while toiling away with thumping grief and inconsolable guilt. 

Lee Chandler (Affleck), a building janitor in Boston, he is the dour and withdrawn everyman type who distances himself from rest of the world and occasionally courts unwarranted bar brawl to unleash the smothering anger, so routinely the film will slowly mine into his profoundly buried tale-of-woe which would explain how he has fetched up to the current walking-dead state, and in this case, it is a helluva calamity, the most heart-rending accident could ever happen to a parent, and he has no one but himself to answer for. Receiving the news that his brother Joe (Chandler) died in a sudden heart attack, brings Lee back to his hometown, the titular Manchester-by-the-Sea where flashback adroitly interleaves into the narrative to refresh Lee’s memory (edited with pellucid correlations with what he experiences now) where the concealed secret incubates, and would eventually unfolds in the murky, snow night accompanied by Tomaso Albinoni and Remo Giazotto’s ADAGIO IN G MINOR, a sublime sequence transmits a synesthetic frisson which can knock dead its armchair viewers. 

In Joe’s will, he names Lee to be the guardian of his son, the 16-year-old high-school jock Patrick (Hedges), which takes Lee aback, a resultant, seemingly life-affirming uncle-nephew bonding process takes its spin sensibly on veracity and wrestles with both Patrick’s suppressed grievance toward his father’s demise (Lee’s heart condition has been long diagnosed, so that it is more like a time-bomb ticking situation), and Lee’s attempt to re-settle in the town on the face of aghast memories and unrelieved penitence, in a pivotal scene, when Lee’s ex-wife Randi (Williams) pleads him for forgiveness and reconciliation after she has been finally capable of moving on to form a new family and embrace a new life, but feels obliged to proffer some extrication for him too, but things are different for the culpable party, not everyone can make peace with the past, however rational it might sound, some pain can be alleviated through time but other stays, thus one must brave himself to live with it for the rest of his life, that is the affirming life-philosophy Lonergan tries to pass on to his audience through studiously delving into the realistic double-bind based on an über-dramatic back-bone, which appears to be an abiding mythos in all his three directorial works to date. 

Casey Affleck finds his footing in inhabiting Lee with a simmering intensity underneath his alternatively inscrutable/apathetic/distraught veneer, a performance is so aptly up his alley (a combo of hang-dog frustration and whimpering elocution) and to call it the performance of the year wouldn’t be such a stretch. Michelle Williams, shoe-horned in a peripheral role, but manifests herself as a sniveling and imploring scene-stealer just in one scene, she dangles us with immense curiosity about how her character has gone through the catastrophe, but essentially this film is Lee’s story.  Lucas Hedges gets a windfall for being cast in a plum role and nominated for an Oscar, which could be a double-edged sword for the future of his budding career, but as credible and affecting as his portrayal is, the credit should mostly given for Lonergan’s well-rounded script of a rather bratty teenager; also Kyle Chandler is virtually next-in-line for a renaissance on the big screen after starring a string of high-caliber Oscar-baits, from ARGO, ZERO DARK THIRTY (both in 2012), to THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), CAROL (2015) and now this, all in small roles but his presence looms larger each time. 

The cinematography is bracingly crisp and un-showy, a modest production design and an unobtrusive score borrows many classical pieces, MANCHESTER BY THE CITY is a contemplative continuation in the aftermath of a latter-day Greek tragedy, which elevates Lonergan’s status as one of the most outstanding cinematic story-teller currently from USA soil, and one can bet, co-producer Matt Damon must secretly rue the day that he couldn’t commit himself to Casey's role which would have earned him a coveted Oscar statuette as an actor, and in hindsight, his preference to star in Zhang Yimou’s Chinese monster fantasy THE GREAT WALL (2016) now looks like a dumb decision. || **The life doesn't reflect how we want.**

First of all it was not based on any book, but you can see that book kind of effect in the storytelling. One of the best original screenplay, I won't be surprised if it wins the Oscars for that. I actually struggled in the opening to catch the storyline. Because the past and present overlapped while sharing the presentation alternatively. But it was about the present with flashbacks popping out regularly to join the tale by comparing/revealing the earlier events. So after few occasions, I got used to it and enjoyed my rest of the watch.

I always love good drama films. But not all the drama films I have seen are the masterpiece. So despite it was received so well from all the quarters, I kept my expectations low. The initial parts were okay, but its only during the final stage I begin to like it more. Especially the Casey's performance. I have seen him in many great films, in the big roles, but I think this one is his best, particularly from the positive perspective of the character he had played. Looks like the decade belongs to Affleck brothers. They have given great performances recently and acted in the great films that will be remembered for a long time.

This is the story of the Lee, a man who works as a janitor. One day he receives a call that his brother had passed away as he was suffering from the illness for a some time. Since his brother got divorced, all the responsibility comes under his belt, including his teenage son. Now those two struggles to join the force, but somehow manages all. Meanwhile, till the conclusion, the Lee's life before that point were disclosed to us, like how he struggled in his own life before coming to end in the current situation.

I could be wrong, but Casey Affleck's going to win the Oscars for his performance. Andrew Garfield is the other guy standing between his chance. I'll be happy whoever wins between them. I like Michelle Williams, but her Oscars nominee is meaningless. What, she appeared for 10-15 minutes in the entire narration which can be tagged as a guest appearance than a full fledged role. This is a fine drama, one of the year's best, deserved all the Oscars nod it got. Surely worth a watch and I recommend it.

Quite boring in the middle of the film, which is a shame since the young actor was excellent. || **Lost in India, found in Australia!**

Based on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.

Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.

I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.

It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.

Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year.

_9/10_ || **A film of great quality, although marked by the duality of the script and by an excessive emotional appeal.**

This film, for me, has one big point for it and one big point against it. The point in its favor is that it is consistently based on a true story, and as far as I can tell it has been relatively faithful to events. The downside is the fact that it is one of those films that constantly appeals to the public's emotions in order to have some ability to capture our attention. It's not particularly pleasant having to watch a movie that almost forces you to have a box of Kleenex next to you from start to finish.

The script tells the story of an Indian child, very poor, who likes to play with his brother by the train tracks. It so happens that, one day, things go really wrong and Saroo – that's the child's name – ends up trapped in a train that starts moving, taking him to new places, and separating him from his brother and family. Lost, not knowing how to get back in touch, he ends up in an orphanage. There, he will be adopted by an Australian couple, and raised with all the sweetness. But he never forgets his mother and, as an adult, he decides to return to India to find her.

After the success of “Slumdog Millionaire”, it seems that Western cinema is permeable and open to what is best done in Bollywood. This film is not Indian, but it has actors of Indian origin and was well received, with good reviews and a good box office. The film “cleaned up” the Australian film awards and won some BAFTA awards, but lost the Oscars for which it had been nominated and was categorically ignored by the Golden Globes. By the way, while we're at it, it's quite difficult to understand how Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman – the film's protagonists and its main actors – ended up being nominated for Oscars in the Supporting Actor/Actress categories! The only reason I see for this “disqualification” is a possible attempt not to put them on the path of “favorites” to the two figurines, namely Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Casey Affleck. In any case, the film was one of the “losers” of that year's Oscars.

The film is solidly starred by Dev Patel, an actor who thus consolidates his status as an international star and who guarantees him a place, if he wants, in American cinema. He only appears near the middle of the film because the story begins in the character's childhood, yet he didn't hesitate and confidently embraced his character with charisma and talent. For her part, Nicole Kidman also does not miss the opportunity to do another job very well done. Less interesting, David Wenham and Rooney Mara did what they could with two rather underdeveloped characters.

One of the film's problems is its duality: developed in two halves (the first focused on the main character's childhood, and the second on her search for her mother, already in adult life), they are quite different from each other. I'm not going to say which one is the best, I think that's something relative and that says more about the viewer than the work, but I can say that I liked the second one better, even if it seems less coherent than the first one, more solid, but also more melodramatic. In this regard, it is necessary to praise the work of the young Sunny Pawar who, with an interpretation of demanding characteristics in which he shone, sustains a part of the film that, without him, would be much less interesting.

Technically, what I most appreciated and feel commended for is the quality of the cinematography, which is clean, sharp, excellently framed and in magnificent colors. The sets and costumes are also very good, and the careful choice of filming locations allows for the inclusion of a beautiful set of landscapes. On this subject, it is worth watching the beginning of this film with attention. The soundtrack and the visual and sound effects complete all this with subtle touches, of great quality."

I did not expect this sequel, especially not after 13 years. Even the first film has been just a good for me. I won't say it was an unnecessary follow up. They retained main cast, well, only lead two plus the boy who is now in his early 20s. A similar pattern storyline. If you have already seen the previous one, you would know what to expect from it, but not how much and that was the main issue with this. So anyone would predict the scenes, as well as the twist. Like most of the sequels, it indeed weakened. Though somewhat enjoyable for the good performances.

R rated comedy. That's another advantage for the grownup audience. But if you aren't a fan of that thematic, then it is even worse than what it's rated everywhere. The length was good, a simple plot, yet the characters had not seriously developed, particularly the new ones. The big excuse was it is a comedy film. They all just came in and straight away displayed whatever they were up to as if we knew them very well. Despite an average film, it can be watched once, even if you liked or not the first part. And it is mainly because of Billy Bob Thornton.

_6/10_ || A massive drop in quality compared to the first _Bad Santa_ movie, and although Kathy Bates was a welcome addition to the series, based on this entry, I don't think we're likely to ever see a _Bad Santa 3_.

This is the next best anime in the recent time after 'Your Name'. Not that you know this director very well, not at the international level. But with a film like this, she's going to be. This is another teen romance. Well, romance is not exactly a word that matches with what this film is about narrative, but there's no other way to describe its theme. It was like before romance, that mean before committing to a relationship and after you had started to like someone while fixing the mistakes made in the past.

It's a high school tale. Before that, it opened with a brief flashback of the elementary school events, where Shoya Ishida bullied a new admission Shoko Nishimiya for her hearing impairment. Soon after that, she'd transferred to another school. Now, a few years later, they meet again in the high school, where Ishida tried to fix what he had done wrong a while ago for her. So a relationship develops, despite people around them does not understand their commitment. At some point, it will be tested, which might lead to uncover their true feeling to one another.

This is surely aimed at the teen audience. Especially, the romance and sentimental parts are intended for the youngsters, but anyone would enjoy it. So, I felt them, but not like I'm still young. Otherwise, I would have said it is a masterpiece. That's only from the story perspective. The sketches and animations were not bad. The film characters were awesome. Each one was very unique and different people pick different characters as their favourite. I liked Yuzuru as I always like tomboyish type roles. But obviously Ishida and Shoko make this film.

> ❝Please don't make such a serious face. And, let me say... I am sorry.❞

Smooth animation. Technically comparable with any big names (anime titles). That also means the director is now in the league of the best anime-maker. She's young and I hope she keeps doing more films. As I said many times before, that after Hayao Miyazaki retired from making films, we need more people like this filmmaker to fill that empty space. The film won many awards for its great achievement, as well as box office success in the domestic market. Expecting the rest of the world and anime fans to receive it at the same extent.

It was originally based on the manga of the same name, and a television series was made before this feature anime. As I collect film quotes, the best ones, I was disappointed on that context. There were many emotionally and romantically appealing lines, but not on the moral perception. That does not mean the film lacks the social consciousness. In fact, the film highlights the bullying and its severe consequences. That alone is enough, this is a must see for the school kids.

Surely kids, teens and some youngsters would love it, but as far as the adults, this is not an ideal thematic, yet you can't ignore its artistry and the intention of the film. Sometimes it might help you to like it in the second viewing. Because this is one of those kind. My issue was understanding the Japanese sign language. Besides, the subtitle for that was not much helpful, as it was exactly translated as what the hearing impaired character babbled which is an alternate spelling for every word and sentence.

I had lots of fun watching it, as well as other moods like romantic, touching, annoyance, but overall it leans towards the good side. Just over two hours, it never looked too slow or hurried in the story or the character developments. Could be the best to pick as a date flick or get together with your school friends, particularly opposite sex friends. My final saying is, it is not to be missed for many reasons I've mentioned in this review and the other one is it being an anime, a quality one.

_7/10_ || A Silent Voice: The Movie (2016) is an absolute gem! 🌟 This beautifully crafted anime film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, touching your heart and leaving you with a sense of hope and understanding. The characters are so well-developed, and the animation is simply breathtaking. Prepare to be moved and inspired by this poignant story of redemption, forgiveness, and the power of empathy. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a touching and meaningful cinematic experience! || **A film that changed my vision of the life**

""A Silent Voice"" is a film that has changed my vision of the life, understanding better the importance of the human communications. Including profound reflections related to empathy, self-esteem, redemption, self-improvement, and the importance of understanding and listening to others.

This film was truly made with love. Because it has a Sound-Track, thought and composed as if they were simulating the stimuli that a deaf person can feel throughout his life, such as the touch of someone or the vibrations of a cup of water.

Also, the way that it is made the animation and the camera angles, reflecting the feeling and the evolution of each character. Giving a unique impact because of the way it is well-thought-out.

Making me love this film even more for these details, feeling a unique and nostalgic experience when watching it, leaving it definitely one of the best films on a personal level. I don't understand how this film hasn't won any Oscar."

The title itself a short and sweet synopsis. What happens in the film is a chaos during partying and with the crazy twist and turns, the story head for the conclusion. There's no any difference comparing it with other Christmas party films you had seen. Just the cast and scenario changed, that's all. While the setback for his company branch, the head of the office decides not to compromise on the Christmas celebration thrown to his employees. At the same time, he has to pursue a big client who could save the office from closedown. So his intention turns to impress him at all the cost.

Seasonal films like this should be watched when it comes out, which is during the Christmas/December. Because it will achieve a better result with us since we're set for the mood. I missed it then, but watched off the season and even though, I quite enjoyed it. Yeah, this film is not any good, yet nothing stopped me from having some fun. The comedies are cliché, but the actors were good. Fast paced narration, over hundred minutes long. Shot most of the film in a building, there's a little outdoor adventure. Overall, worth a watch, even though a below average film.

Okay, I shocked when I heard this film did not get the Oscars nod, except for a song. Now I have seen the film and I come to know why. This is a one liner, but developed into a longer version Except the initial parts, this film is like a limited cast/character film. Most of the film takes place in the sea sailing around fighting evil force to break the curse. But at the end, you would feel this kind of story is not worth for a feature film. It looks a perfect short animation theme.

Disney never disappoints its fans, well, for me. So I enjoyed it, it was fun and entertaining, but too simple. The characters were cute, this is a wonderful film for kids and some grownups would too enjoy it. But this is not for all, unlike most of the Disney animations are. Dwayne's voice lending for one of the lead characters was good, but the girl steals the show. Especially if you are a kid and/or a girl.

The best film since 'Lilo & Stitch' on the similar theme about Pacific islands' people. But it reminded me 'Whale Rider'. Overall, I think the story should have been improved a bit, in particular by including a few more characters at least for the partial appearances. This is not the best animation of the year, also definitely the bad one to skip. If your purpose of the watch is entertainment/timepass, it is good at that.

_6½/10_ || After I watched _Zootopia_ in the middle of 2016, I thought to myself ""Well, that does it, this has to be the best Family Movie of the year!"" I was ready to call it right then and there. It wasn't until December rolled around and I got the chance to see _Moana_, that I realised I had spoken far too soon. For in truth Moana deserved that title!

Mostly I'm just happy that I managed to enjoy two whole Disney movies this year.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || Good fun.

I wasn't expecting <em>'Moana'</em> to be quite so goofy and silly, in that sense the more serious ending doesn't quite fit, but I still felt suitably entertained throughout. The animation is nice, while the music is solid - even if Maui's ""You're Welcome"" is the only memorable song to me.

Dwanye Johnson plays Maui, he is top notch from start-to-finish; obvious casting, but still a welcomed pick. Auliʻi Cravalho (Moana) and Rachel House (Tala) are also up to the mark in their respective roles.

Thought it would be greater, but that doesn't stop the fact that this is an enjoyable film."
365942.0,The Space Between Us,A young man raised by scientists on Mars returns to Earth to find his father.,What's your favorite thing about Earth?,"Romance, Adventure, Science Fiction, Drama",121.0,2017-01-26,en,7.063,2489.0,2.2367,"Asa Butterfield, Britt Robertson, Carla Gugino, Gary Oldman, Janet Montgomery",Peter Chelsom,"future, planet mars, space colony, fish out of water, scientist, teenage love, search for father","Somehow Hollywood continues to search for different outlets in conveying young love at the box office. Sure, the goal is always the same in terms of tapping into the youth market by promoting yet another transparent teen weepie but this time among the planetary stars. Hey, youngsters need catering at the movie theaters as well, right? However, one is not so convinced that the Young Adults (YA) genre is convincingly elevated by a flimsy frontier sci-fi romancer among the Clearasil crowd. Hence, **The Space Between Us** fits the bill as a scattershot and schmaltzy pimple-faced love story that has all the emotional stability of moon dust in front of a heavy duty oscillating fan.

Writer-director Peter Chelsom (“Funny Bones”, “Serendipity”) and fellow screenwriters Allan Loeb and Tinker Lindsay delve into the conventional cliches of a lame star-crossed lovers theme that wreaks of saccharine-coated simplicity wrapped in scientific triteness. The awkward mixture of lightweight sci-fi drama, pandering gooey-eyed overtures toward teenage girls still nostalgically embracing their _Twilight_ fixation and space-age elements as filler exploration makes for a paper-cutter potency that creates unwanted space between us or any other species watching this cosmic claptrap. Give Chelsom some credit–at least his young protagonists are not another incarnation of obligatory hairy werewolves or fanged vampires, right?

The adolescent pen pals in **The Space Between Us** are truly from different worlds although this does not stop these particular kids from bonding deeply. Advanced academic in sixteen-year old Gardner Elliot (Asa Butterfield) is having a time of his life in corresponding with the edgy Tulsa (Britt Robertson) in the chat rooms. Whereas Gardner is a whiz in robotics and comes from prestigious stock (his late mother was a pioneering astronaut) his object of affection Tulsa is a motorcycle-loving wild child that had bounced around in the foster care system. The glaring differences between the unlikely young couple is that the scientifically gifted Gardner is located on Mars and Tulsa is a gritty gal living on Earth in the state of Colorado. Geez…talking about long distant relationships, huh?

Poor Gardner has always entertained the thought of traveling to Earth–the home planet of his deceased explorer mother who died giving birth to him during her mission to colonize Mars. So now there is more of an incentive for Gardner to yearn for visiting Earth now that his curiosity and fascination with Tulsa has heightened. At this point all Martian Gardner has going for him socially is his guardian/”second” mother in astronaut/scientist Kendra Wyndham (Carla Gugino) and his robotic pal he built to provide him companionship. The cruel reality for Gardner not being able to take a trip to Earth has something to do with his sensitive Martian-bred bodily functioning not being able to withstand the atmospheric gravity settings on our planet (huh…is he not half Earthling?). All Gardner wants to do is come to terms with connecting to the planet Earth and finding some self-discovery about himself and self-fulfillment with his Colorado-based crush in the leather-clad Tulsa.

Of course the film figures out–in convoluted fashion no doubt–how to place the inquisitive Gardner on earth-related soil through the far-fetched means of a billionaire Nathaniel Shepherd (Gary Oldman) funding the experimentation and expedition of the Red Planet-raised tyke whose dream of reaching the planet that houses his unknown father and his precious Tulsa. Soon, the inevitability of Gardner meeting up with his dreamgirl comes true as the teenage twosome take off and find liberation in each other’s company as the authorities are hot on their trail. Look out Romeo and Juliet…you have a cheesy carbon copy coupling seeking to steal your familiar thunder.

**The Space Between Us** produces more sappy substance than a row of Vermont trees. The fish-out-of-water routine that Butterfield’s Gardner undergoes when reaching Earth is mechanically clumsy and predictable. Butterfield does what he can to portray Gardner as an alien just not from another planet but from his own skin and this notion is philosophically ambitious to pull off for an interstellar teen tearjerker that has all the complexity of a sofa cushion. Robertson’s Tulsa is the typical rebellious chick but her and Butterfield’s Gardner become tiresome as they engage in manufactured chase scenes, teen-angst lovey-dovey lameness and the dragged-out space travel drivel that beleaguers this simplistic sci-fi yarn.

The results in **The Space Between Us** is alarming more than charming because once the payoff is realized where Gardner and Tulsa draw energy from each other’s worldly vibes as they cuddle in zero gravity one will be left wondering where the next asteroid is coming to act as the needed wrecking ball to obliterate this toothless sci-fi saga aimed at the indiscriminate teen targets.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2017 || **What's your favourite thing about Earth?**

You might ask that question for yourself while/after watching this film. This is not a great film, but surely different and enjoyable. This kind of storyline can be acceptable for the todays space ambition by the humans they have to accomplish. A couple of decades ago, it was called a fiction, still it is, but quite close to realistically possible.

So we had seen many films based on human connection with the red planet, Mars, but this one was a little different. It is romance theme, though not like east meets west. It is Mars meets Earth. The story of a boy from Mars and the girl from Earth. That's how it ends, but not that how it was initiated. It was the boy who searched for his connection with the Earth, and doing that, all the usual things happen, like some people come after him, like running and chasing.

Well made film. It was not a complicated screenplay, but the twist was unexpected at the end yet I did not think it was strong. Explained everything with details, as well as intentionally added some of scenes to cover up later parts when the narration takes the unexpected route. Best cast for sure.

Britt Robertson played the role ten years younger than her she is. But it does not matter, she still looks like a teenager. And Asa Butterfield was quite good too. The only usual thing about the film was the road adventure, though it did not take the usual route. Nothing was like you have already seen them. That's where it hand upper hand. The end was good, yet I felt it softened to bring a certain type of ending than a relevant one. Because it is a PG13 film and they wanted the conclusion that satisfy their target audience. So, it is a nice film and once watchable.

No opening crawl at the start for a change and a great score by Michael Giachinno, but still includes the original end credits with John Williams' original music.

I'm gonna skip right over all of that and talk purely about the movie itself.

Anya Taylor-Joy is good, but McAvoy is what makes Split worthwhile. The heavily touted twist/reveal was all but a non-event, even to a M. Night alum like myself. Though it is certainly (in my opinion) the best work The Shamhammer has brought out since at least Signs, it's hard to say that its successes rest on his shoulders. Again, it is for McAvoy that we really owe praise, who, with the exception of his role as the lead in Filth, gives his career best performance.

Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go. || Split was a movie that I was a bit weary to see, I had been bitten by M. Knight before and I wasn't sure if this movie would be worth while. But the trailers looked great and I had always thought James McAvoy was a seriously underrated actor. 

Split surprised me. I loved this movie. Ann Taylor-Joy was decent in the film and the Dr was great, but McAvoy knocked it out of the park. Being able to portray all these different personalities with no props such as wigs or makeup shows his talent. It was amazing how one personality made you feel uneasy and perplexed and the next had you smiling and feeling like you were really staring at a strange child. Bravo McAvoy.

The twist at the end made me love this movie even more. Though I'm not sure if you can really cal it a twist. A ""reveal"" might be the better word for what the audience learns. Whatever you want to cal it, the reveal at the end made me excited to see what's next!

The only thing I didn't like about this film was  the unresolved conflict between Ann Taylor-Joy's character at the end of the film. 
Besides that, I loved it. Definitely worth watching. || **Didnt see the review section at first so,I posted on the forums**

Not a fan of The director since Unbreakable. It was slightly above average but no whee near the quality of The Sixth Sence. I don't know why I keep watching his movies, probably hoping one will be the same extraordinary quality. With all the pre-release buzz I thought this was finally that movie. 

I was so disappointed. I rated it slightly lower than Unbreakable. I don't know exactly where it where it went off the rails, but it never held my attention (and I'm not ADHD- I sit though theee hours of a good bio pic. 

A good part of this was the girls trying asinine ways to escape; at other time we see McAvoy play several personalities half heartily. After all the award talk I expected a much better and diverse McAvoy. Sadly, just like the majority of Night's films he has his actors perform methodically. It actually felt McAlvoy was pushing his talents against the brick wall of what the director wanted.

He wasn't the only actor who underplayed the role. So did the doctor and the three teenage girls. First, after all these late night calls for extra appointment why didn't she get upset earlier or pull a personality up (which she has stated she can do) to discover the emergency instead of A casual bye--you-leave when another dominant personality shows up to the appointment.

I rate this in the same category of Nights's films except the quality Sisth Sense and Devil, which he did not direct and only wrote the original story,

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Some things will never change within the tedious and surprisingly long-running sci-fi/horror saga **Underworld** film franchise. The vampires will still feature sharp fangs that can pierce a hardened leather sofa with one bite and the werewolves will be hairier than the local women’s wig shop. Of course the curvaceous heroine of this Gothic gumball machine of a flick–_Love & Friendship’s_ Kate Beckinsale–will predictably wear leather-clad attire that will cling to her shapely body tighter than a preschooler hanging on to his mother’s leg because he is scared to enter the classroom for the very first time. What also is expected not to change anytime soon is the sluggish intrigue, overblown supernatural creatures acting more obnoxious than your drunk Uncle Jake wearing a bra at the family cookout and Beckinsale’s womanly warrior Selene acting as the badass bloodsucking babe out to mediate the conflicting forces that persist. Yes folks…you heard correctly that this is the fifth installment of the **Underworld**  universe that sits there and makes its presence known with all the force and feisty relevance of unwanted luggage left at the airport.

First-time feature director Anna Foerster (from TV’s “Outlander”) takes a crack at instilling some frolicking freshness in the turgid, cheesy **Underworld: Blood Wars**–a banal B-movie confection that Dracula would refuse to acknowledge even if there was a free showing at the local blood bank. Relentlessly flat, unimaginative and woefully recycled, **Blood Wars** offers nothing inviting or challenging for its aforementioned fifth time around the block and should have resisted the need to go beyond its 2003 Len Wiseman-directed release nearly fourteen years ago. Nevertheless, the devoted fanboys gave battleground beauty Beckinsale a theatrical movie gig (along with the rising popularity of the vampires/werewolves craze in cinema) that has lasted for an impressive long time as inexplicable as that sounds. However, lasting power does not necessarily mean a hill of beans with the one-note notion of a former orphaned vampire gal transforming into a beastly butt-kicking wrecking ball as the fatal feuding between the Lycans (a.k.a. “lycanthrope” or werewolves) and vampires escalates to a new level of chaos. Sure, Selene is not exactly as convincingly clever or calculating as Aliens’ Ripley (then again who is, right?) but she certainly is cut out of the same generic cloth as _Resident Evil’s_ Alice (for which pre-dates the **Underworld** experience as well as offering a longer string of sequels).

Foerster assures that **Underworld: Blood Wars** wastes no time in getting to the punchy antics of its silly-minded action sequences–some mired in empty-headed fun while other takes are needlessly monotonous. Screenwriters Cory Goodman and Kyle Ward stock up on the fluffy cliches of this toothless tease of a frivolous fable as the thin plot flies every which way more than Beckinsale’s golden locks during a heated scuffle. Sophomoric dialogue, formulaic confrontations and the dullness of opposing fierce factions set aside **Blood Wars** does make reasonable usage of its lethal leather-wearing lass Selene/Beckinsale in eye-rolling combat and the CGI visuals are engaging when not looking choppy in some instances. The fact that Selene has to negotiate some compromise for either side does introduce some slight sense of tension amid the roguish warfare and Beckinsale sells this quite accordingly to a certain degree. However, **Blood Wars** will definitely serve as comfort junk food for those legions of followers that have familiarized themselves with Selene’s jolting journey as she maneuvers through the manic mess that involves her blood-thirsty species taking on the hellish hairballs that are the defiant Lycans.

For first-time **Underworld** viewers or the casual crowd they will witness an under-cooked, ridiculously trite terror tale of an actioner that is sure to leave **Blood Wars** as nothing more than a false sense of second-hand stimulation. A generic exercise in the making, Foerster’s brooding bombshell in Beckinsale’s Selene is serviceable for a fifth go-around but that is really not saying too much given that the material never seems to revolve her from some of  her past misadventures through the four previous **Underworld** entries. The supporting players–such as Charles Dance’s elder vampire Thomas, Theo James’s David (the male Selene perhaps?), Lara Pulver’s Semira and Tobias Menzies’s Marius–are accomplished performers in their own right but they add little atmosphere to the hackneyed hedonism that toils within this supernatural stupor.

No need to put the stake through the heart of these returning vampires and werewolves because they have proven time in and time out over again that the sultry Selene and her creature feature bickering buddies are not budging anytime soon after almost fifteen years of conjuring up surreal nonsense. Kinda makes you consider putting a stake through your own chest, huh?

(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016) || You know what to expect by now.

This series has been going on so long now that this movie almost comes across as a throwback, since it's still drenched in all the post-MATRIX visual cliches.

Beckinsale is as remarkably photogenic as ever, but the camera never lingers on her face for more than about two seconds. The running time is as tight as her costume, and it feels rushed.

We have a few decent fight scenes but the gunplay is just a mush of noise with very little in the way of cool choreography.

Still, there's fun to be had watching the gore and all the scenery-chewing that's going on."

Another American politics, why should I care! If you are saying like that, then you are missing out something wonderful. First of all it was not based on any real, except the gun control theme that rocked the US recently. Nor it was adapted from a book. That's really got me. This was a beautiful screenplay and I could not think how flawlessly someone has written just for a film, not for a book. Secondly, in todays world where the voices were raised for the equal rights/opportunity for women, this film became a great example to head on the right path.

It opened with a court scene, then went back to flashback to reveal everything that happened in between period. There's a voting is to take place in the parliament for the introduction of a new bill. The miss Sloane's firm splits over differences and hence two teams fight for one another in the same matter, but to achieve the opposite result. Pursuing the MPs and all other dramatic events takes place, while they are ready to go any length. Then the story comes to an end with a twist with one of them victorious, but a heavy price has to pay it.

You might won't like the politics, but this is not one. This is something like the story of an election campaign team. How they work to achieve their goal, particularly keep checking their rivalry. So it was more or less a cat-mouse game kind, but the perspective was not shared equally. The majority of the film was from miss Sloane's angle. Just like from 'Zero Dark Thirty', Chastain has been simply awesome. One of her career best performance for sure. I don't get it how this film had missed the Oscars race. She should have won the best actress award. I might a little late to watch, but I did not miss it. So I hope you too as well not to miss it.

But when one commits a crime against the other, there is no society and no judicial system that can handle the offense.  How can they work it out the ethics of punishment, penance, and rehabilitation between them?

The movie is marred by some scenes that look impressive but aren't scientifically accurate, particularly where gravity is concerned.  Probably added by studio suits who wanted to wow the audience but didn't understand or care about the underlying science.  But that's par for the course for most science fiction movies. || **A space-travel tale!**

I was going to watch it, but not expecting it to be a masterpiece. It was not, yet surprised to be a lot better film when it comes to todays film overcrowded with space themes. The entire story takes place on a spaceship. It's a space journey tale, when the mankind with 5,000 on-board heading for a new home planet, but one of them unexpectedly wakes up from his hibernation pod. It's supposed to wake him and everybody a few months before their destination, so now he's up nearly a century early, and what he plans to do is what the adventures covered in the rest of the film.

There's no connection to the 2008 film of the same name. Initially I thought it was like a live-action version of 'Wall-E'. Not entirely, only a few scenes and the main two characters remind Wall-E and Eva. It is also a limited cast film and I loved the simple screenplay, but strong enough to be one of the best in its kind. The actors were very good. The visuals were beautiful, a perfect film for the late night to watch alone peacefully.

From the Norwegian director of 'Headhunters' fame. This is not his Hollywood debut, but previously he had got an Oscar nomination for the film 'The Imitation Game'. The concept was like 'The Blue Lagoon' or kind of the space version of the Eden Garden tale. I had predicted a few scenes, those were too simple to do that. The real big thing came in the later part, especially when all the focus shifts to more than the initial narration. Scientifically, not everything believable, but cinematically, anything can be possible. So with a such concept, the film headed to the conclusion where a twist came into play. Entertainment is guaranteed. One of the year's best that should not be missed. Recommended!

8/10 || Crusoe and Girl Friday.

Pretty much reviled by professional critics, Passengers has overcome that to hold affection with a good portion of the sci-fi loving public. More safe sci-fi footings than anything remotely ground breaking, it ends up a a tidy romantic piece that's laced with pertinent questions involving man and his/her reactions to extraordinary scenario's.

Although the viewer is for the most part hankering for action to explode off the screen, it's only when - in the film's last quarter - you realise that it was actually working fine as a character study without the fireworks.

Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have bunches of charisma, in fact more than enough to carry the story through its more shaky elements. They in turn are aided by Michael Sheen who is perfectly cast as the Android (not Robot!) bartender Arthur.

The effects work is impressive and director Morten Tyldum stitches the set pieces together admirably, the highlight being a rather superb gravity loss sequence. While the sound mix is also to be applauded.

Newcomers should expect a Robinson Crusoe love story in space as opposed to a sci-fi actioner, though one with more cerebral strains than at first hinted, because then the pic delivers a good time and adds to what is turning out to be a rather great decade for sci-fi fans. 7/10"

This is not the theme something you could see for the first time. I have seen many classics, probably you would have as well. But the difference is it was a different cast and a bit modernised. Modernised means just the story set in the todays technological trend world like almost everything that related to AI we use in our daily life. It's yet to be a lifestyle, I mean new norm. So you can see a few people who had already progressed like we say Silicon/IT guys. That's the background and with the same old concept that the parents, particularly the father of the girl meets her boyfriend. When they do, those misunderstanding, generation gap and what else, all hell breaks loose.

The comedies were okay. In some places it was too much. Instead of a laugh, it only annoyed. Though there were some good jokes, except I hardly had any good laugh in my entire watch. I remind you again that it was an okay film. Some people might find it good, some won't. Still a watchable film for the good performances. It's a face-off between James Franco and Bryan Cranston as expected. Elon Musk was a surprise. It had several opportunities to be better like turnaround its narration, yet they stuck with the same concept for the whole film. So other than mild entertainment, there's nothing in it to laud. I hope it all had ended here. Please, no sequel.

310307.0,The Founder,"The true story of how Ray Kroc, a salesman from Illinois, met Mac and Dick McDonald, who were running a burger operation in 1950s Southern California. Kroc was impressed by the brothers’ speedy system of making the food and saw franchise potential. He maneuvered himself into a position to be able to pull the company from the brothers and create a billion-dollar empire.",He took someone else's idea and America ate it up.,"Drama, History",115.0,2016-11-24,en,7.134,5120.0,6.5518,"Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch, Linda Cardellini, B.J. Novak","John Lee Hancock, Robert D. Siegel","greed, ambition, biography, family business , based on true story, salesman, corporate greed, fast food, corporate power, 1950s, burger, mcdonald's","**Veni, vidi, vici!**

I anticipated another inspiring biopic about a man who built an empire. That's partially true, because this was inspired by the right kind of wrong thing. I mean it was not actually about the McDonalds' story, the McDonald brothers, but the fast food chain McDonald, how the franchise got rapidly spread across the globe and the person behind it. With the film having both good and bad side, it stayed mostly neutral. But due to the main character, you would see too much lean on what seems the reason behind the McDonald's today's popularity.

So it's like another typical American founders' story like Apple, Facebook. I mean not the one who found the company with all the hard works, but the one who dived in and took all the credit. Ray Kroc was a traveling salesman and he's not doing any good. But one day he meets the brothers who had started a modernised kitchen and its fast food service. He shows lots of interest in it and so he joins hands with them. With his new ideas, how he makes a fortune out of it and the future of the company, all revealed in the later part.

An enjoyable film. Particularly for Michael Keaton. Well directed film as well. Film wise it was a good one, but the story wise not morally right. It was about the flaws in our society, our system. Some men can do anything like pulling others leg to climb the success ladder. It's not them to blame completely, because they had struggled enough to understand their future path. So definitely for some people, this film would inspire. If you are a regular McDonalds' customer, you should watch it. Otherwise, just to learn the truth, it is worth a watch.

_7/10_ || **A decent film, although the story told is substantially stilted and made more tense than it actually was.**

We all know that the business world is not for boy scouts. As the film's protagonist himself assumes, you have to be prepared for the toughness of competitors and moves that are often disloyal. However, this is precisely why great businessmen are usually people worthy of our disdain: they associate coldness and calculation with intelligence and the cult of the ego, and not infrequently they see other people as numbers or as means of business.

McDonald's is undoubtedly a huge, very powerful multinational, and the film reveals how the company was born, at the hands of Ray Kroc, who takes over the company, taking it from the control of the founders – the McDonald Brothers – and transforming it into something that is very different from what they dreamed of, although they were satisfied with the money they received for it afterwards, and that the relations between the three, in real life, were not as tough as the movie makes us think. The screenplay, cleverly written but very bitter and unpleasant, inflated the situation and made it more tense. Like _Social Network_, the film shows us the controversial origins of one of America's most flourishing companies… and makes us dislike whoever built it. And interestingly, contrary to what I initially thought, the McDonald's Corporation seems to have kept a certain distance from this film… why is it?

Michael Keaton did a very good job with the main character and knew how to embody the controversial figure of Kroc well, both in voice and in ideas and mannerisms. The actor deserves, in fact, a praise for the way he gave himself to the work. Also, John Lynch and Nick Offerman are in excellent shape and give us very convincing performances, turning the two founding brothers of the company into a harmonious duo in which one thinks and plans, and the other carries out and executes everything on the ground. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast just doesn't do anything of value and sticks to the most basic.

Technically, the film is very low-key, although I have to commend the effort made to recreate and bring back to life some of the company's early restaurants, most notably the one in San Bernardino. The effort to be faithful to the original design was very pleasant, as was the use of very appropriate sets, cars, filming locations and costumes, which take us back to the 50s. The cinematography does a discreet but effective job, and the editing is good, not allowing the film to waste time on unnecessary things or lose its rhythm. || **Overall : A brilliant telling of a bleak story that left a disappointing flavor in my soul.**

I remember the plaque in our McDonalds growing up about its founder, Ray Kroc, but this movie tells a much different story. Suddenly, I am questioning whether or not I should let my two-year-old eat McDonald's anymore! Michael Keaton's relentless portrayal of the opportunistic and duplicitous Ray Kroc is so spectacular that I questioned whether I even liked Keaton. Yet, he is one of my favorite actors! That is just how disheartening the true story of McDonald's' meteoric expansion is. The Founder does an excellent job telling a dispiriting story and does such a thorough job that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth at the end (pun intended 😉)."

This film did not just represented the black people, but the women as well. Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.

The film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.

The others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!

_8/10_ || Do not at all think that by my feelings I attempt to diminish the achievements of those who made _Hidden Figures_ nor the real women around which the story revolves, this simply just wasn't for me.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._ || This is quite a compelling story of three ladies who played a crucial part in the NASA operation that ultimately put John Glen into space. All three were mathematicians drafted in to provide their skills but unlike so many of their colleagues, they were subject to prejudices surrounding their race and their gender. The women adopted the best solution to combat this bigotry, though - they decided there are more ways than one to skin a cat and so let their astonishing talents do their talking for them. Luckily, Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) had a boss in Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) who was essentially a practical and politically motivated man who cared far less about segregation and much more about beating the Soviets into space. His attitude, that swiftly builds into a considerable degree of respect, enabled her to step up and demonstrate she was every bit as good, if not better, than those white men around her - all rather uniformly dressed in white shirts and ties. Across the corridor, the equally adept Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) was fighting her own battle for recognition as the supervisor of a crack team that was charged with installing, programming and validating the workings of a brand new IBM computer. Finally, the triumvirate was made up by Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) whose skills were going to be crucial if the heat shield on the module charged with getting the astronaut (Glen Powell) back to Earth safely was going to work properly. Director Theodore Melfi manages to delicately marry these three threads together keeping the story interesting and investing us not just in the struggles of these women but also in the excitement of the practical science unfolding before us. Henson and Spencer are convincingly understated with their performances and though Monáe is less prominent, the three characterisations still resonate well and informatively. I knew nothing of those people before I watched this - I'm glad I did."

It took nearly a decade for Denzel to direct another film and this time it sailed through the Oscars with four nominations and one won out of it. Yeah, it was Viola Davis, who snatched the most prestigious award for her supporting actress role. Originally the film based on the stage play of the same name. It is a drama takes place in the 50s about a hard working family man, Troy. His past was not very good, which makes him a little arrogant when it comes to raining his boy. Marrying Rose was the best ever thing happened in his life. Though it was not a perfect family. The differences between them is what later bring twist and turns in the tale before heading for the final of the final act.

A very simple drama on the fine topic. Most of the film was just a conversation or arguments. And most of the film was little slow moving with the very long overall runtime. If you can manage that, you can enjoy it. If you are a drama genre fan, then you will be more than happy for giving it a try. One of the best drama films of the year, yet not the greatest. It's all finger points at the performances. Those magnificent actors displayed magnificent show. Nearly 35 years old screenplay and 70 years old timeline, still looked the same and powerful. Despite the film's success and poured praises, I don't think it is for everyone. Definitely young generations won't enjoy it. It is mainly for families.

Featuring appealing covers of hit songs and an all-star cast, this cute animated comedy capitalizes on the craze for both talking-animal adventures and talent competitions. The movie may not have the substance of Inside Out or the overt messages of Zootopia, but, like Trolls, it's simple, with catchy pop music and jokes that are likely to make kids laugh. (Unlike Trolls, its take-aways aren't quite as thoroughly positive -- see below.) The musical numbers are by far the best part of the movie, including Jennifer Hudson-voiced renditions of ""Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight"" to the piggy duet of ""Shake It Off"" (by Witherspoon and comedian Nick Kroll as a German boar called Gunter) to Kelly's show-stopping version of ""Hallelujah.""

The music is what makes Sing worth the price of admission, because, story- and theme-wise, there are a few missteps that keep it from greatness. Like, say, the depiction of Rosita's home life. She does everything for her 25 piglets, and her burnt-out husband (Nick Offerman) barely registers her. He's so checked out that he doesn't notice when she sets up a Rube-Goldberg contraption to keep the household working when she can't secure a babysitter to participate in the contest. And then there's poor Johnny, who desperately wants his criminal father's approval. A child wanting a parent to see them shine is wonderful, but did they have to make the father in question a bank robber? But if what you want is a bubbly diversion you''l find yourself singing along to after the credits roll, then Sing hits the spot. Just don't think about it too hard. || **Music is the key!**

It was one of the most watched trailer by me. Yeah, I liked the trailer and teaser, those beautiful songs and characters made me watch this film. Maybe because of that, I thought the trailers looked much better. I enjoyed the film, it had depth in characters than what I saw in the promotional videos. Though it is a simple story, and that worked so well.

Its neither Disney or Pixer, but awesome. The good thing is the others as well getting there with par. It got nominated for the Golden Globe, but missed out the Oscars. A film for all ages. The musical is very common in animation, especially from Disney. This was a little different, a music genre. And the characters are the very special to this film to clinch the success.

It could have been easily added to 'Zootopia' universe, since the two films are from different productions, that idea was ruled out. The selection of voice-over cast was excellent, particularly in the singing perspective. Recently Dwayne Johnson sang one for 'Moana'. I know the real life actors brought in for the marketing purpose, but anyway they all were so good.

I liked a couple of tracks, but most of them are not original. Even the theme song from 'Zootopia' by Shakira had a small part in it. So this film is surely suggestible for anyone to try at any time in any mood. It only cheers, definitely worth spending time for it. Now bring it on a sequel. As per the latest news, they have announced which is going to hit the screen in 2020. That looks too long, I need it even before that. Meanwhile, you guys enjoy it if you'ven't watched it yet.

_8/10_ || Sing is about as good or bad as you would expect it to be. For me, it was a disposable yet entertaining flick where cartoon animals sing Glee-style renditions of popular songs to a plot that is pretty much American Idol meets The Muppets (2011).

I might a bit overrated it, but it's well deserved that. It has been a long time since I wetted my eyes for a film. Especially for being a tearjerker fan in the early days. This looks like a sequel to 'Fluke', though it justified to be an independent film. Based on the book of the same name, directed by the one who made 'Hachi: A Dog's Tale'. A perfect family film, but entirely a fictional account.

Do you remember those films about a human being trapped in the time- loop, not knowing why and takes a quest to find the purpose? Yep, this is same, but with a dog and not a time-loop, instead, the rebirths. The tale was told from a dog's perspective, his life from puppy to growing old with his owners. The lives he enjoyed, struggled, loved, and not understanding why the life circle keeps repeating. After all the things film wanted to tell us, the story ends with an explanation. Just a simple one.

The dog's the hero, he's found in every frame. The rest of the characters were well designed. Especially the sub-stories to blend with the dog's. All the dogs who acted in the film were awesome. This is one of the best dog films. As I said, it is not great, but surely enjoyable by everyone. Especially in the today's CGI dominated and/or superhero flicks, this is something close to our heart, despite a fantasy tale. So, go it!

After taking a week off from the films, now I'm back with this one. It is a British film based on the book of the same name, which is inspired by a real person and his cat. Well, it might be wrong to say 'his cat', because according to this film, I learnt that they have found one another. So nobody belongs to no one, except in human perception its 'his cat' and that's how this story goes.

The title reminded me a classic film, but this is nothing like that one. If fact, it is a very suitable title name. How many people do you think gets a chance to represent themselves for the film version, excluding documentaries. Here Bob the cat had got one. He was so perfect. I'm not really a cat person, but when I was small I lived among lots of them and they all are nothing like this Bob. So if I want one, I need exactly like the Bob.

The story is about a young man, James, who is a drug addict. Living on the street, singing to get close to enough money to feed. Sometimes frustratingly short to buy a meal, leads back to the needles at the time he tries his best to free from them. Having no friends and family for support, that's how he meets Bob. Bob is a stray cat who snuck into the James house and instantly they had become friends. All Bob wanted was a safe place and an owner to feed him. And for James, to divert attention from his issues.

Humans and animals won't talk, but all those great relationships are built with wonderful understanding. I have seen many films based on man and animal bond, and there's nothing new from this, yet very inspiring. This tale was told from James perspective, having Bob alongside, but very nicely revealed how things change when we start to commit to something with a great support.

> ❝You got yourself a lifelong partner there. Better friends than people, they are.❞

From the outside, it looks like another 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. A man with no future, having a guitar in one hand and a cat in another, roaming the city. Other than that it is totally a different film. Well cast and made a film. The female lead looked like on cosplay. There's a little romance, but the focus always has been James and Bob. Even there are many scenes from Bob's perspective, like through his eyes how things look. Going after a mouse, travelling on the bus and bicycle, performing on the street, the camera literally on the ground to reveal that angle of the story.

In a country like India, all domestic animals including pet animals roam casually everywhere without bothering about any threat. But elsewhere, like as in this film in England, one must get a license to have a pet. What I meant is, people are not used to those animals on the street and when they see one, they go like 'oh, so cute', 'so sweet'. Anyway, Bob and James won the many hearts. When they get on the street, it will be a spotlight. Crowd throng to see them, the rare partnership led them to fame. That was not their intention, but it helped them to overcome poverty.

The pet lovers would love this film. Despite the original theme is darker with drugs, the film was fun and friendly for almost all ages. Seems like a holiday film, particularly to watch during Christmas. Well, it came on that season, but I saw it only now and I'm happy I did not give it a miss. This is a good film for families, so recommended it to them. Meanwhile, there's a follow-up book and I'm hoping that they would turn it as well a film. I don't know the book, but after watching this one, I feel it is worth it. So waiting for any official confirmation.

_8/10_ || A great and hearty - true life - story.

I watched <em>'A Street Cat Named Bob'</em> back when it was released at the cinema (remember them?) and thoroughly enjoyed it; something that hasn't changed just over four years on. It's a very touching story, crafted together very nicely. I also love cats, so I felt all the cuteness that this offers in that area.

The cat(s) steals the show, but big credit also to Luke Treadaway who plays lead character James. He is superb in this. Ruta Gedmintas, Serafina herself, and Joanne Froggatt play their part too.

Interested to find out what the, I have to say very unexpected, sequel has to offer."

The first feature film for a television director. He did not get the best cast, but best among the second string. Charlie Day's first lead I'm seeing. I mean not like, among other big stars he used to do the roles. Yes, there are like Ice Cube in the film, but the whole narration was presented from the Charlie's viewpoint. This story needed strong voice, but he had none. You may get annoyed for that, but that's the first fun side of the tale. Charlie Day versus Ice Cube! This kind of combination is not new, but decently used to tell the story. I like Cube in comedies than the serious roles.

Well, it's not about the story, it's just a one day event. The final day of the school and a tough day for all. Because some of the staffs were fired from the job, the students' misconduct peaked, it's totally a messy day. The English teacher, Campbell, gets into a fight for going against his co-staff. So the day goes on as the countdown begins for their most anticipated fight at the final bell of the school. The preparation for that and all other craziness take place before the finale.

When the film started, it was like any other B movie, very familiar atmosphere and predictable. Once the second half kick-started, I felt it was getting better. And the climax was even better. So, it ended strongly, after a so-so opening. Till that end, I did not think it deserved a decent respect, but at the end a better one. With this kind of cast and thematic, the film was much better. Really a well made, nothing more than on the entertainment perspective. So, if that's your sole purpose to watch a film, then this is the right one. Go for it. A much better film than the rating it had received. #TeachersFight

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || DA DA DA DA BATMAN - I MEAN: LEGO BATMAN
Not only in the fun style of the recent Lego film but the 1965-1068 TV show from Fox and Greenaways with DC with Adam West and Burt Ward, and which was produced and narrated by Bill Dozier with bat gusto, this is the second Lego film and the first real fun Batman film and treatment since that 1960s series (which, by the way, had its OWN 1966 Batman movie!). Susan ""Pewter"" Bennett, btw,also is Siri and is billied as such. Also another unique female voice:Jenny Slate (""Bellwether"" in Zootopia) is Harley Quinn. Numerous funny song references make this an excellent movie.. || **All important movies start with a black screen...**

As the new millennium began, alongside the LEGO films born, but it all started with the song, the breakthrough song 'Everything is Awesome' a couple of years ago. Since then, we all thought LEGO was a new format in 3D animation like Anime in 2D Animation. So I was expecting very eagerly what could be the second LEGO film. When they had announced it was going to be 'Batman', many 'Batman' fans were elated. So here we are.

It took a longer time than expected to hit the screen. I'd lost hope in this, because all the sweet memories of the firs LEGO film were fading away from me. So I could not say or think anything about it. That's all changed once I watched it. While watching it, everything was restored like waking up after I was knocked down with a big blow to the head. That reminded how badly I missed it. One of the best animations. It can't be compared to the normal animation. It is more like a jerky type, similar to stop-motion, but done in softwares.

Anyway, it was not about the animation. It was the story and dialogues. The best Batman film was a very serious film, but this one was so fun. For all ages, a non stop entertainment guaranteed. The surprise was all the villains coming together in one place. When the Batman ignores his arch-rival, the Joker, he is set to redefine his position to fight the Batman. His comeback endangers the whole Gotham city. Then the black clad, the Batman, with the support of his sidekicks, fights to save the city from devastating. The remaining is how it all ends.

The voice-over artists were awesome, but first, my praise goes to the screen and dialogue writers. As I said, nothing was great in animation, especially if you had seen the previous LEGO film. All one can see is LEGOS everywhere, the world, the city, the characters made of LEGOS and then even the explosives and other special effects are kind of LEGO brick style visual. But top to bottom a very enjoyable film. An animation that should not be missed. Probably it could contest in the upcoming Oscars. Now all my eyes are towards 'Ninjago'. Bring it on.

This movie essentially starts right after the first one ends, right at the top-down view of New York City. Dark humor abounds,
bullets rip through head and bodies, and Wick is unstoppable.

This film should be held as the gold standard for action movies. There is very little camera shake during fights and Reeves clearly has spent a lot of time preparing for this role. You can see nearly every take-down, every gunshot, and Wick has to reload at inconvenient times in a realistic fashion which also adds to the hilarity of the following kills.

Overall the acting performances were solid. Reeves isn't known for having an extremely wide range, but his devotion to making this movie a kick-ass martial arts production is second to none. I felt the villain was a bit on the weak side though, but he did his role justice. Ian McShane's character remains the strongest especially combined with the last film.

The lighting is superb! There's a red-blue theme that is in nearly every nightclub and darkly lit areas and its absolutely lovely to look at. Overall cinematography is very good.

Definitely worth seeing! || Grows the world. Grows the legend. But the story itself and the man himself remain firmly retreading the steps they took in the first outing. Not too harsh a criticism though, 'cause that one was damn good too.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || I was really hoping I would like this movie. I so enjoyed the first one. However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering “What the fuck happened?”.

Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.

One thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one,  that it was a no bullshit, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden “shops” for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.

In this movie he is forced onto a job by a real asshole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said asshole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same shit no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more “permanent” setback than the other).

Worse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some crap drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.

There are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a’la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood’s entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is … unbelievable.

I did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.

Having said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.

Overall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars."

This is an extremely impressive film from Peele. Its smart and knows it-- teasing you along the way of what is to unfold at the film's climax.

The main character is a photographer goes to visit his GF's house and all-white family. Things are not as they appear at first glance, and as the film progresses it becomes even more disturbingly obvious that the family is hiding a secret. As time goes on, cracks begin to form in the sticky sweet facade of pleasantness surrounding the home. Beyond this I can't spoil it, but the third act of this film is very satisfying. I don't think there was any part of this film that overstayed its welcome or felt weak. 

The acting performances overall are superb, the cinematography is excellent, and the lighting is also well done. 

Please go see this movie if you are into horror/comedy, its worth supporting. || **Opening Remarks**

I went out to see this film armed only with the snippets I watched in the form of television commercials and YouTube ads. The film had a very interesting look and  that really caught my attention. I noticed that the film focused primarily on race, which seemed like an interesting concept for a horror/psychological thriller. I also saw that Jordan Peele (of ""Key and Peele"" fame) was the director of the film and I was thrown completely off about what type of movie I was going to get.

**First Impressions**

To start off, this film is gorgeous and this presents itself fairly early into the film. Gorgeous quality, gorgeous scenery, gorgeous people. Added with the minimal soundtrack, the film seems very open. Many horror movies try to go for a claustrophobic approach, while ""Get Out"" uses its spacious atmosphere to bring out the unnerving fear of the unknown.

**Going Smoothly**

Other than a few moments of ""How exactly is this scientifically possible?,"" you do not have to suspend your belief too often throughout the film. ""Get Out"" has an easy to follow, coherent story line that is aided by its pacing. Honestly, this is some of the best pacing have seen a modern horror film in a long time. Every sequence in this film seems to take the same amount of time and keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace. Every scene is refreshing and contains a new bit of information, instead of lingering on unimportant details. Every sequence is shot with purpose.

**Getting to Know the Cast**

The acting in this movie is very well done. The interactions between characters seemed genuine and characters reacted to situations in appropriate manners. This isn't your average horror movie where the characters make stupid decisions to continue the plot; it all seems very organic. The characters act in a manner that you really connect with and do things that you could see yourself doing in these situations.

**Further Considerations**

As I mentioned earlier, the film was directed by Jordan Peele, who has almost exclusively worked in comedy. As a fan of ""Key and Peele"" skits and their major film, ""Keanu,"" I thought I had this film figured out before going to see it. With its subject matter about race, I figured this movie would be more of a joke than it was a straight-up horror film. And while the film is a very witty satire on race relations in America and features some very humorous dialogue and situations, the film drives the horrors of racism to the furthest point. The humor stems mostly from the absurdity of the films premise.

**That Ending**

I do not have any major complaints about the movie. It didn't drag on, it mimicked reality, and gave me some very uneasy feelings, which is a plus for a horror film. The only problem I have with the film is the ending. It wraps itself up way too quickly and throws everything at you all at once. Luckily, the ending does resolve itself and doesn't leave any glaring loose ends. The film does end a bit too abruptly for my taste and it would have been nice to see what happens afterwards.

**Closing**

I would recommend this film to anybody looking for a different horror experience. It is tasteful and tame compared to other films, but it certainly doesn't distract from its purpose."

READ THE FULL REVIEW AT SBS MOVIES: http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/review/logan-review-wolverine-gets-super-send || There may be some fine performances in this movie, but I honestly think the critics overrated this latest entry in the X-Men saga. The performances of Wolverine and Prof. X by Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are extraordinary. They create a believable and loving father-son bond between their characters, with Logan caring for the ninety year old leader of the X-Men after a horrible event occurs at the Xavier school the year before. Stephen Merchant takes over the role of Caliban from Tómas Lemarquis, who played the character in X-Men Apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to Logan and Charlies. Merchant is quite good in the role. But what really dragged down the movie is its nihilism. The other X-Men are completely missing from the film and mutants have been wiped out almost completely. A sense of doom and hopelessness looms over the film. This movie completely upends the warm and hopeful epilogue of Days of Future Past, where the X-Men were restored to life and glory and mutants weren't extinct after all. Death seems to stalk Logan and Charles wherever they go. There is also a conspicuous lack of significant female characters in this movie, too. The only female of note is Laura/ X-23, and she spends most of the film mute. There is also a complete lack of any strong or memorable villains. No one ever reaches the level of greatness like other X-Men villains such as Magneto or William Stryker. So, despite some good performances, this film is a bit overrated and also a little too bleak and depressing for my taste. || One of the best and most mature Marvel movies to date.

The first half of this movie is a huge delight and a huge thrill. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are so entertaining to watch as characters they've known for 17 years. They've taken their characters a step further here in a script that allows them to explore themselves emotionally more than ever before. This movie is strictly part-drama. Yes, that's right. Finally, a Marvel superhero movie you can confidently stamp the drama genre tag on.

The effects, stunts and gore are really quite shocking. You can really feel the weight of each character's immense power, and more importantly, the struggles that come along with them. This further fleshes out each character.

The movie starts to lose the enjoyability of its ensemble halfway through, and what happens after is what you might expect from a typical X-Men film. Action, sci-fi and more action/sci-fi. The villains are as interesting as they can be I suppose. They lack much development but are there to fuel the real story. Anyway, I can't say much else without spoiling the plot. I'll just say that I wish the movie would have taken a different direction."

In that sense it brings something new and fresh to the series, and is also very much a period piece--a period that all too recently seemed to be contemporary history, not the distant and unfamiliar past in which the film takes place.

After a prologue set during WWII, the current setting of the film opens in the waning days of the Vietnam War. While plenty of films have explored the war in Vietnam, Kong eschewed using combat or anti-war demonstrations on the homefront as the focal point. The Draft, flag burnings, use of the term ""Charlie,"" etc are all absent from the film. Instead, it takes the unique perspective of war from an elite group of soldiers contemplating going home--back to ""The World."" While some characters look forward to reuniting with friends and family, the contempt for the army and the war that is seen in other Vietnam movies is also absent. These guys are soldiers and they are proud of that; it means something. Their commander is portrayed as an old war horse who is contemplating a future with no war to fight. 

In the midst of all this, two scientists named Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), lobby to have a military escort assist them in exploring an uncharted island. Randa and Brooks assemble their team which consists of tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddelston) photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) a geologist San (Jin Tian) and a few other scientists not fleshed out enough to even remember. 

They meet up with Lt. Col. Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and the the soldiers we met earlier in the film. With all these convenient characters in place, the movie really begins.

The film shifts gears from being a period piece that goes out of its way--sometimes with distracting effect--to showcase outdated technology (a scene in which the camera pans to a table of rotary phones and then lingers for a few seconds comes to mind), to a Tarantino-esque homage to Vietnam War movies. The cinematography is excellent. Jordan Vogt-Roberts makes good use of the physical environment (coincidentally, Vietnam) and made me realize just how in need we were of a beautiful Vietnam War movie in the age of 4K and Real 3D. 

Complete with Credence Clearwater Revival and Jefferson Airplane songs, equipment-laden soldiers marching through swamps, dogtags clinking together, their helmets advertising what they decided to scribble on them, the jolly Green Giant presses on through the jungle--the director's love of Vietnam War movie visuals on full display, the movie moves along with great fun.

However, when the titular character first shows up, the action-packed visuals begin to detract very quickly from the mood Jordan Vogt-Roberts established in the first third of the movie. In the excessive age of more is better, the movie stumbles a bit, threatening to collapse under the weight of its title monster. 

Thankfully Kong is reigned in and the human characters are able to command some attention. At this point, the camp is divided in two: Military vs. Civilian. While the Army soldiers are on a rescue mission to bring back one of their own, the civilian folks meet up with the island's native population--including a downed WWII pilot (John C. Reilly) who's been on the island for 30 years. Through him we learn that Kong is a protector of the island. That he is, in fact, not the monster at all. 

Packard is not having any of this, of course, because Kong killed some of his men. This is where the movie makes its statement. Kong is the combatant that fights to protect the natives--much the way Packard and his men are portrayed. Packard mentions that soldiers do the dirty work so our friends and family back home don't have to be afraid. In this, Kong and Packard have a kinship--common ground shared by all soldiers: They do the dirty work so you don't have to. Unable or unwilling to see this, Packard decides to wage a personal war against Kong.

This is unwise as Kong protects the island from ""Skullcrawlers""--massive lizard-like creatures who would eat any living thing on the island if not for Kong's presence. 

The civilians begin to see Kong as not only necessary, but as compassionate and humane. He saves a trapped water buffalo, marvels at the sight of the aurora borealis, and has a brief but tender moment with Conrad and Weaver. He is the soldier whom, during a lull in the battle, is shown as a well-rounded individual, a reminder that being a soldier is something one does; not something one is. This is also true of other soldiers in the film, such as Cole and Mills. Packard, however, has gone off the deep end. A showdown between he and Kong is inevitable, and with Kong out of commission, the Skullcrawlers are able to run amok and create problems for our heroes.

At this point Kong is miraculously resurrected to save the day because the scrip said so. And he does. And the film ends on the sappiest, corniest, and most contrived of happy Hollywood endings.

Where the film works, it works well. Its commentaries on soldiers and soldiering are interesting without being heavy handed. Despite the Vietnam backdrop, Jordan Vogt-Roberts avoids making a commentary about the Vietnam War specifically, avoiding political controversy in the process. The actors make good use of what material they have to turn in decent performances. In a movie with Brie Larson, Tom Hiddelston and Samuel L. Jackson, it's John C. Reilly, Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham who steal the show. Also, Kong looked terrific. The CGI work is better than what the Peter Jackson remake gave us--though the Skullcrawlers looked laughably cartoonish.

But, the movie has its faults as well. Its parallels to Apocalypse Now can be distracting at times. As is common with ensemble pieces, there are too many characters on the screen for any one of them to get enough screen time to become memorable. Hiddleston in particular had the least material to work with. His character--such as it was--had no depth or personality. He was simply action movie trope. The interactions between Larson and Kong only work because we know that King Kong has always been a Beauty and the Beast tale. It's forced. Giant ape and pretty blonde get along, because it's a Kong movie. For the uninitiated, it could just feel jarring and uneven.  

All in all, the film succeeds as a blockbuster to eat popcorn to. Yet it tries, with varying degrees of success, to reach beyond that. While Kong deserves an A for effort, a B- is all it achieves in its execution. Also, the interesting and unique aspect of combining Vietnam War movies with the Kong mythos is highly rewarding for the audience.

Better than average, but still far from perfect. || Thought that Peter Jackson's _King_ _Kong_ movie could have done without the entire first act? Though that the _Godzilla_ movie set in the same universe should have shown their big beastie a whole lot more? Well _Skull Island_ fixes those problems, and replaces them with a whole bunch of new ones!

I had a lot of fun though. So it passes into the realm of a positive review by the skin of its octopus-riddled teeth.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || I really wanted to give this movie a better score but I just could not bring myself to overlook the stupid and crappy story.

Okay, let’s start with the bad. The movie is about a group of explorers exploring this Skull Island. No surprise there. They are accompanied by a military detachment. Somewhat okay still, there is a half decent explanation for that. One of the main characters in the movie is Lieutenant Colonel Packard. At first, I quite liked him, especially when he told off the journalist informing her that they did not loose the war, it was abandoned by the politicians.

However, from then on it goes really bad. Warning, spoilers ahead!

Once on the island Kong is revealed rather quickly. Something that I felt was a bit of a shame. There was no suspense building up for the reveal of the mighty ape. Okay, I could live with that. What I cannot live with is that these total dumb-asses, having discovered a scientific find of unprecedented magnitude, goes straight on to shooting off their guns. What the fuck? Not only that, they just keep shooting and circling around him while he trashes them one by one. That scene, while sporting some impressive action and CGI, was just so fucked up that one wondered if the author deliberately wanted to insult the audience.

From then on I just cringed every time Colonel Packard was in the picture. He was clearly mentally unstable. He doggedly continued to want to kill Kong and used retrieving his men as a poor excuse. This is just the kind of shitty, overused and cliche’d Hollywood script that drives me nuts.

Now, with that over with, the movie was technically quite good. The actors are doing a decent enough job of their roles. The story, excluding the Vietnam references and general let’s make the military look bad old bullshit, was actually not to bad. It was a different take on the King Kong history for sure.

The CGI, the action and the various monsters were very cool. Not surprisingly King Kong was not the only threat on the Island. This time they did not just throw a few dinosaurs in but was rather creative bringing in creatures from all kind of animal (and insect) families as well as some home cooked ones, the skull crawlers.

The scenery is also very enjoyable. Apart from my gripes mentioned above I did enjoy a lot of the movie. However, the military clusterfuck that the script writer threw in there severely diminished my enjoyment of the movie and I cannot really bring me to give it more that a 3+ out of 5 score."

Okay the first film was good one. Then I thought it was unnecessary to make a sequel for it. But someone clarified that it was not made outside the novel to make money. It's indeed adapted from the sequel book of the original film's source. Though coming out 20 years later was the disadvantage. Except some praises it had received, particularly by its hardcore fans, it was average at the box office and I thought same as well.

I did not like the story. It was just a random drag, not knowing what direction to head. That's until the third act, and once all the three main characters come together, so it gets interesting with something. Like surviving from from a revenge threat. It was the actors who saved the film. Otherwise, it is not even an average as I consider now. I don't think retaining the title was a good idea, but I think it was just for its fans. Or else, a new title name would have done a decent justice to what it had narrated.

As I know, this is the director's first ever sequel and he's not getting better since his Oscar win, a decade ago. Especially the last two flicks, despite based on the very good subjects. Definitely no to the T3. Instead, I want another Oscar nod film from him. This would have been ever worse if somebody else would have made it. Yet, a watchable film, only if you had liked the first. So just think about it before going for it after seeing only positive words from a few people.

_5/10_ || OK...it may be bias, Trainspotting was one of my favorite movies, and one of the better, if frustrating, books I experienced in High School.

And, I really want to avoid any hints towards the plot as....it might kill a lot of the humor for those that haven't seen it. So excuse the vagueness, but after watching it, you might see where its necessary from an entertainment not a twist standpoint.

So...the bad: It is NOT ""Porno"" which breaks the heart because, well, ""Porno"" was absolutely hysterical, right down to why it had its title.

That being said, the draw is the cast. Trainspotting was one of those ""how the hell did they make this book into a coherent movie"" movies and in many aspects ""Porno"" would have been easier, but would certainly still fit into that mold. So it's likely better that T2 didn't follow the book.

Anyway, the joy is just seeing the crew back together again, the chemistry is still there, it's totally an ensemble cast and that was really the principal draw to the first film as well.

I don't want to give away the plot, but the cast just works so well together, they know their characters and live them. And the characters are delightful to watch.

I sort of feel that they could have thrown any script at them, and so long as the cast and characters stayed the same...the film would have been thoroughly entertaining.

It doesn't hit as hard as the first film, but everyone has aged and it's still....brilliant.

Really, you're watching it for the cast and characters, and it pays off in sheer entertainment. || A rather good sequel!

<em>'T2 Trainspotting'</em> is exactly what I expected it to be. Turns out, it was also exactly what I wanted it to be. I thought it was great! I mentioned in my review of the original that I didn't like the characters, at all. Whilst that is indeed the case for that film, in this follow-up it does a grand job at making you care for the main bunch more; well, aside from Franco but we don't talk about Franco.

It probably is missing out on as much substance (pardon the pun), if only when compared to the 1996 flick, but evidently I'd argue it makes up for that with improved (harsh/wrong choice of word, perhaps) characterization. Even though I only watched the other movie for the first time a mere few hours prior, it was still cracking to see Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle back together in their respective roles - aged 'n all.

I appreciate both films, albeit in different ways. This one I actually 'properly' enjoyed, whereas before it was more an appreciation of how effectively it was told. Terrific productions either way, really."

It's actually not fair to compare this to any other film because the story here is wholly real and not fabricated for the screen. This is Kumail Nanjiani's real life story about how he met his wife and it's incredibly moving.

While Kumail and Zoe are both really great, the heart and soul of the movie is Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. They are truly superb and every scene they share with Kumail while Emily is in the coma is spectacular. I would watch this movie from start to finish again right now if I had it in me - it's incredibly taxing as it's an emotional ride; I cried maybe 4 times throughout the movie.

It's amazing how reliably brilliant Holly Hunter always is and I hope she garners some awards attention for this performance. It truly moved me. Her delivery of ""_Do you mind?_"" before she gets into bed with Romano at the end was such a beautiful character moment. || FULL DISCLOSURE: I saw this while I was working my ass off in a foodtruck at an outdoor cinema. I missed whole chunks of it, and it certainly didn't have my full focus. I'll give it a proper chance at a later date, and alongside that, another review. What I did see of _The Big Sick_ certainly held potential for me, I even had one genuine laugh, but American comedies rarely if ever resonate with me. I know this one plays it at a very different angle to your standard Sandler-esque faire, and I appreciate that, but I wasn't brought in enough from what I caught to get on board.

The live action remake of ""Beauty and the Beast"" was good, but it failed to capture the magic of the cartoon version. There were somethings that they got right, and others that dragged on.

I thought ""Be Our Guest"" was done beautifully. The 3d made it even more enchanting. The main characters' backstories also added some depth to them. However, there were some scenes that I felt added nothing to the story. Such as the search for Belle by Gaston and her father. The ""No one is like Gaston"" scene didn't have the bravado or arrogance of the original.

I also felt that Luke Evans was miscast. He wasn't the handsomest guy in town, nor was he the strongest. Which is why it was hard for me to accept him as the character. Emma Watson was serviceable. Her voice was fine, but it wasn't strong enough to carry Belle's songs. Dan Stevens was the best part of the film. I felt that he should have had more songs, because he has a beautiful baritone. Although his beast costume should have been more frightening. 

Overall, it's a fun film to watch. Though, I wouldn't call it a classic. || Disney's done a great job with Gaston and The Beast, the two aspects that I always thought would be the most important, and the most difficult, to nail.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || **Only beauty would conquer the beast!**

This is not the first time screen adaptation, that means every one of us have seen either version of the films according to what generation we belong. Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story.

Like the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up.

Excellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed.

I did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted. Definitely recommended for at least once watch it.

If you ask anybody from the pre 90s, they would say their love for animated feature started with 'Toy Story'. But mine was DreamWorks' 'Antz'. So this production house might not be as good as Disney or Pixar, but still a better one than the rest of those who are in the same business, except Sony who comes equal. I wanted this film to be good, yeah, it is a box office hit, but not critically. The regular animated film goer accepted it. And I think as well, it is entertaining, so much fun in parts, if not the entire film.

The story of a boy whose happy life being an only child has taken away from his newborn little brother. Then one day he discovers the baby could speak and came to the house with a bigger plan. Knowing what it is and joining hands with him to tackle is what the remaining narration covers. Quite fun film. Animation, story and all the adventures were good. The voice-over was great. Alec Baldwin was awesome, but it's fair to praise the technicians, the animators.

At first, I thought some of the jokes were rude, if the film is for families, particularly for the kids. But when I watched the rest of the film, it did not look going anymore worse. A simple story and predictable, but it was enjoyable, that makes you forget yourself for a while. Despite the mixed response in acceptance, I've heard the sequel is on, in a couple of years. I think it is a good decision, even the storyline, how it ended encourages that. It's not going to be your favourite animated film, but surely not to be missed if you love animation.

_7/10_ || **An elegant and well-made film, but with far-fetched, forced ideas and a certain lack of “soul”.**

I am aware that my generation, “Generation Y”, is the first in the history of my country where the majority of us are only children. With the increase in education, health and food costs and low salaries without corresponding increases, for most families it has become insane to have more than one child. And the truth is that many of us will prefer not to have children, or we will become parents late (I think this helps explain the issue of “love for puppy dogs”, in the film and in real life, after all they're cheaper and aren't indelible bonds that connect us to others, ex-wives or ex-husbands). I can speak for myself: I'm close to forty years old, and I have no idea of ​​starting a family, I have no conditions and I feel that my future has been mortgaged by the financial crises that society has been experiencing since the beginning of the millennium. I'm sure I won't be the only one who feels this way.

This film, in a joyful and naive way, is a portrait of all this by showing how a seven-year-old child finds the birth of his brother strange. I already understood that love and rivalry are contradictory feelings that are part of what it means to have siblings: they may compete for their parents' love and attention, but they often come together when necessary. And the film shows us all this by creating a whirlwind story in which the new member of the family is also a disguised executive with authoritarian tics and who behaves like a “Donald Trump in diapers”: giving orders, grumbling, shouting, firing everything and everyone like the worst CEO we can imagine.

To be honest, I only saw the film now because, at the time, it seemed so uninteresting and forced that I didn't pay to see it in the cinema, contradicting the success it had at the box office and joining me with a mass of suspicious people who thought that the critics could have been right in the way she bombed the film in the media. And, in fact, we have to agree that DreamWorks has already done better things and seems to be in an inspiration crisis. The quality of the drawings and animations, the vibrant colors, the good character design and the technical refinement are still visible, but there is a lack of good ideas and some soul. This film makes an effort, appeals to fraternal feelings and the public apparently responded well, but it is not a film at the level of past successes. As for the soundtrack, which features some notable songs, it's reasonable, but not so good as to be worth it on its own, and the humor is suitably sarcastic, although the jokes can, at times, be more aimed at adults than children. (I doubt most kids know what a memo is).

The film, being an animation, does not have a cast, but features the participation of several well-known voice actors, with particular emphasis on Allec Baldwin (who gave the voice of Baby) and Steve Buscemi, who gave the voice of the story's villain. Still worthy of mention and a positive note are the contributions of Jimmy Kimmel, Lisa Kudrow and Miles Bakshi. || Well here we don't even bother with the gooseberry bush, let along the maternity ward, as the young besuited baby arrives to join mum, dad and elder brother ""Tim"". These kids don't exactly hit it off. Is that because ""Tim"" is jealous of the love his parents smother their new arrival with? Or is it because he doesn't behave like a baby at all, just a diminutive business executive who speaks and acts like someone forty times his age? At his most confused, ""Tim"" also discovers that this rugrat has a more sinister objective and that the boss of the global megacorp ""Puppy Co."" has instigated a plan that will forever change the loving dynamic between people and their favourite pets. It seems that the only chance he has to thwart this dastardly plan is to work together with his duplicitous and bossy but incredibly astute sibling. Loads of escapades now follow as the pair have to do some intrepid detective work, risk life and limb, and even join an Elvis impersonators convention. Now had they just left the scenario with a degree of obnoxious baby menace, then this might have worked better for me. Sadly, though, they hadn't the courage of the original conviction of the film and so it drifts all too readily into a cheesy world of sentiment and predictability that neuters the whole thrust of the thing. It does take a bit of a pop at the corporate world and at it's approach to monetising children and pets so shamelessly, but the fun is sucked out of it simply by relying on a mediocre script and a soundtrack of adapted ballads whilst the sense of mischief just peters away. It all just goes too goo goo ga ga in the end, and though I get I'm not the demographic, I still thought it an opportunity for something a bit different just wasted."

Truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.

The performances in this are so mesmerizing. I've never liked Armie Hammer as much as I like him in this. He really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. Timothée Chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. I've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.

There are so many phenomenal scenes, but the one that stands out above the rest - and the one that made me cry in a theatre full of festivalgoers - is Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue. It's one of the most honest and real moments I've seen in any film and one of the best father and son moments too. Crossing my fingers so hard that this becomes a huge critical darling and garners some attention come awards time (specifically for Guadagnino, Ivory, Chalamet, and Stuhlbarg).

Oh, and bonus points for that final shot of Chalamet's face as the credits roll. It's the best of its kind since Glazer's _Birth_ in 2004 when Nicole Kidman shattered all of our souls. Chalamet does the same thing here and it's overwhelmingly stunning. || A near-perfect, timeless movie which will be responsible for many tears and yeast infections. Languid small-town living is captured perfectly, as is the tentative romance between the leads. I can't think of any substantive criticism until the last 25 minutes, when the movie becomes sloppy, less of a climax than a dissipation. (And personally, I'd have liked to see a sliver more of sexuality, which is oddly lacking.) Still, it's good. Watch it. || Amidst some beautiful Italian rusticity, we are introdcued to the ""Perlman"" family. It's the father (Michael Stuhlbarg) who has employed American ""Oliver"" (Armie Hammer) to help out with some research, and that involves living-in with his family of wife ""Annella"" (Amira Casar) and teenage son ""Elio"" (Timothée Chalamet) at their villa. Initially, they just call him ""later"" as that's his most often used expression as he takes his leave, but gradually they take to this man who appears to have depths that bely his slightly friendly but diffident attitude. It's the young ""Elio"" who seems most smitten. He's only seventeen but has a maturity that seems beyond his years as he uses his own substantial polyglot intellect to engage with their visitor. Though he's flirting like mad with his childhood friend ""Marzia"" (Esther Garrel) it's quite clear that his relationship with ""Oliver"" is passing the infatuation stage and heading into uncharted territory for both men - and the onlooking parents. With the sun shining, the wine flowing and the swimming tempting, Luca Guadagnino now takes us on a beautifully crafted story that is more than a rite of passage, or a typical ""coming of age"" drama - it's a love story that I felt at times was joyous and optimistic and yet, ultimately, somewhat cruel. The outwardly confident ""Elio"" has been raised in a loving and tactile family environment and so finds this emotional exposure he now faces both exhilarating and terrifying, and the sylphlike Chalamet really does deliver that vulnerability - and playfulness - like an experienced hand, whilst Hammer walks a path that I was never quite sure of. Is he just playing games with the young man, does he really care? Is it all just to pass the time during his visit or it it more? The location settings are gorgeous and the combination of a sparing script from James Ivory and some poignantly mixed musical themes ranging from Bach to Giorgio Moroder contribute to an aesthetic that is both ideally sheltering and yet hot-blooded at the same time. This is a film that seems to get better with age, and for just over two hours we are immersed in something that's really quite natural."

I have also been very critical of the whitewashing of this film. With that I aside, I went to see it with willingness to give it the benefit of the doubt. ""Ghost in the Shell"" is well...a beautiful shell. 

The visuals were absolutely breath taking. The action scenes flowed so beautifully with special effects. But that's all the movie had to offer. Take away the spectacles and you have a basic run-of-the-mill action movie. 

The acting was fine. But honestly, the leads didn't have anything to actually sink their teeth into. Scarjo, and everyone else, was serviceable. 

If you're looking for some mindless, yet stunning entertainment, then go see it. || I've watched Ghost in the Shell at the cinema 3 days ago, knowing
beforehand about the controversies that have surrounded this movie for
the last 6 months or so. Science fiction movies are probably my
favorite genre and I also enjoyed most of Scarlett's movies for the
past 8-9 years so those two factors were a plus for me going in. 

Regarding the whitewashing business, I think its been blown way, WAY
out of proportion by social justice warriors with nothing better to do
than drag media attention over whatever they're feeling insecure about
this month/year. For those of you who might be on the fence about
watching a Caucasian actress in the role that (supposedly) should've
been reserved to an Asian actress, please consider this a NON-MATTER
and watch it anyway. The character she is portraying is SUPPOSED to
look Caucasian/white. It was the same in the source material and even
the creator of that anime said so in interviews.

Now, is the movie any good? In my opinion, yes. Yes it was. It wasn't
amazing but at the very least entertaining. There is a good amount of
people who score this a 1/10 because they are butt hurt that the story
was changed a lot. Please ignore them and see for yourself even if
you're a fan of the anime and are able to keep an open mind. I think
maybe I was able to judge it more objectively because I had zero
knowledge about the story in the anime going in, but, if nothing else,
the movie actually made me want to watch those old ones to compare.

The acting - 7.5/10 - Since Scarlett Johansson is the only big name
that the movie is being marketed alongside, I'd say she did a good job.
At no point in the movie could I say she didn't belong there. She
played the part of cyborg who had difficulty belonging in a human world
very well. The cast is diverse enough in my opinion, though some of
them get pretty little screen time.

The visuals - 9/10 - If there is one point most critics/viewers are in
alignment concerning this movie, that point is definitely the visuals.
The movie both looks and feels spectacular, with the futuristic city
looking like a close-future mix of Blade Runner and TRON. The
combination of CGI and practical effects looks organic, the movie's
powerful themes of excessive self-augmentation and technology almost
running amok represented very well visually.

Soundtrack - 8/10 - Sometimes pretty subdued, sometimes
almost-but-not-quite in your face, I found the soundtrack to vary
between decent and very good in some moments. It didn't MAKE the movie
but it enhanced a good deal in my opinion.

Story - 7/10 - Here is where the good points of the movie kinda start
to run dry. A lot of other people would probably rate it a lot lower,
with 5 or 4's if they're at least trying to be objective. Yes, the
story is fairly predictable, and the fact that the movie is only around
100 minutes long doesn't do it any favors either. Here is probably
where most of the legitimate hate towards this movie stems from. The
creators adapted a story that had a lot more depth and philosophical
insight and turned it into a somewhat generic cyborg coming of age
story mixed with an evil corporation doing questionable things. The
villain is also very cookie-cutter and has almost zero depth. HOWEVER,
I do think that concerning this film's particular themes and narrative,
a weak villain doesn't hurt it so much since its more about
losing/gaining your humanity through technology than any bad guy trying
to shoot you.

Writing/Dialogue - 6/10 - By far the movie's weakest aspect. In fact, I
believe if some more meaningful dialogue and character interactions
were written into this film, it could've easily been 1 or 2 points
higher on anyone's scoring system. As it is, the dialogue is shallow
and fairly run-of-the-mill for about half the movie's length. Some bits
of good interactions are sprinkled here and there, and thankfully
that's enough to preserve the soul of the movie's central theme of
human souls surviving in machine bodies, BUT not enough to give Ghost
in the Shell the depth it should've inherited from the source material.

Overall - I gave this movie 3.5/5 stars here, mostly because I
couldn't give it a 7.5/10 which felt more appropriate to me. My advice
would be to not listen to the whitewashing nonsense, because that's
exactly what it is, nonsense. Also don't listen to the haters who rate
this movie a 1/10 or call it shit because those people should not be
reviewing anything to begin with. It is a decent movie, with great
visuals and a theme that might get you thinking for a couple of days
after seeing it. The acting is decent, with an above average
performance from Scarlett and a good soundtrack that might hit the
right spot on occasion. The only bad aspects, like I mentioned, are the
film's rather short running time and weak dialogue/writing which hold
it back from being truly great. || I know I wasn't supposed to love it but I accidentally did.

The film was not received well as the book was. Just like the first film, it has been another below average. Might be because of its theme. Usually this kind of films do great business, but ratings and reviews does not praise or encourage the film. So I doubt anybody will be bored of it, which means watchable film and instead it won't be their favourite.

The story continued and this time it was not based on experiment or any kind of agreement, but mutual understanding. So the billionaire Grey and Ana's erotic adventure sustains. With the small-small developments the film goes all the way to the ending. That means, those who are watching it for the selected scenes, will surely would have a nice time. But nothing was strong as any European film on the similar theme.

Apart from the weak storyline, there's nothing wrong with it. As to what this film is about, it served better. That's what I say to you not to expect full storied romance-drama. As usual the actors were good and another two films to come in the 'Fifty Shades' franchise. I hope they can be better than the first two. Overall, it is only for the selected audience, but curiosity makes everybody watch it and they all pour they perspective which is flooded with average to negative. Otherwise, it is an acceptable film.

_6/10_ || Ok, my fiance loves these films (but she's worse than me when it comes to sex in movies, and I'll sit through some serious crap for it) so we went to go see it on Valentines Day.

And I am going to point out the problem, and I will do it by quoting the synopsis:

""Anastasia must confront the anger and envy of the women who came before her.""

Yeah, that takes all of about 5 minutes of time in the film. It's the plot of the movie...and it takes about 5 minutes total. The problem is solved really quickly, in the middle of the film, and never comes up again.

It's like an after thought....but it's the plot.

I've seen movies based on T and A in the past that have actually more plot focus than this.

But let's be honest, you are only watching it for the BDSM (which it is also light on) so I can't even give it 10 stars for that, and I am an easy grader when it comes to most movie reviews. || <em>'Fifty Shades Darker'</em> is a surprise small improvement on its predecessor, though admittedly not anything worthy of describing as good. It felt like this one had a touch more meat on the bones, it's slightly more digestible anyway; if ignoring events last time out.

The film does take the cheap way out mind you, focusing on two 'worse' characters which allows you to look past the iffy questions regarding the leading pair's relationship. I didn't cringe as much for this 2017 flick, which is a decent sign that I had a marginal better time.

Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan remain a fine pair as actors, I don't have anything against those two to be honest. The side of the story involving Bella Heathcote's character did honestly interest me a little bit early on, of course it doesn't end up delivering but still.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **So innocent, imaginative young kid, and then there's an adult world full of complications.**

A thriller from a debutante writer, director. Obviously she did not get support from a big production house, but within the small scale, she has given a nice film. Of course, there were a few flaws. Particularly in the writing section. Overall, the film is very intriguing. The music, locations, performances supported the narration so well. This could be one of the under-noticed film, due to unfamiliar cast and crew. But surely a decent film.

The story of a farmer family. In a small rural America, where farmers are surrendering to death for unable to pay back the loans, a 11 year old girl is not disturbed by the adult's way of life. Her best friend, a chicken named Happy, roam all over surrounding places. One day she finds a man trapped in her silo. They two becomes friends and help each others needs. But the girl never knew there's a complication behind meeting him. And when that breaks loose, drastically things changes and brings an end to the narration with a twist.

The storyline was good, but kind of reminds 'Pan's Labyrinth'. This was more a thriller than a fantasy, yet a few scenes defines it could be influenced by fable as the title say. It had a philosophical touch too. The timeline of the tale was 1980s and in the eyes of adult, it is a perfect thriller that focused on the farmers' issue. But, since the story was narrated from the eyes of a kid, that's where magical perspective blooms. So the mix of both these things makes the film very special.

> -xX] Important people don't have to say they're important. [Xx-

When it comes to the film's drawback, the curves of the storytelling, the scenes were not smoothened enough. I mean the ideas were awesome, but small-small thing had hard time to get away with a perfect blend. For example, the girl could have broken the door/lock from the outside or given foods and other items through the window, instead of climbing up. But the major parts of the film had nothing wrong and can be enjoyed. What it all says is the rookie mistake, but surely the filmmaker has talent and hoping her next one would be a top notch.

The little girl was very impressive. It reminds many big stars of the present who once did such a wonderful film as a child artist. So I wish her future to be great. She was all over the film, the rest of the cast had little scope, but they all did good as well. Predicting the story is not hard, but there's always one thing bothers is that the doubt between reality and fiction. You know it's not usual for one to find a man trapped in a silo. It has to be one way or the other as I've said. For that, you have to wait till the commencement of the third act. Because sometimes, the could be the film's greatest twist.

As I've said, it was not a perfect thriller. Nor ignorable! Most of the scene seems intentional, because they were initiated in the early stage like an intro, only in the latter half, once again, they were brought into the narration with the following consequences. How such things were used to complete the storytelling was well planned design. On this, don't believe the film critics. Me either, if you are not a film fanatic. But all I say is, it is not a bad film as you see on the internet. Those who takes chances and appreciates small scale films should try it. But generally, I recommend it to all!

This is one of those films, you won't properly get the notion. Too random, surreal, but at the end somehow all connects. The narration has multiple layers, that's what confusing at the initial stage. Though I liked the character nicknamed, 'the last free man'. If I had watched this film successfully means, that's the main reason. But I felt they have under-used it or missed a great opportunity. Because it was a wonderful film character. Tens of stories can be created using such role. But why did they go for a dry story. In my opinion, it should have been in the line of 'Captain Fantastic'.

Rami was okay. He did justify the role he had played. But not like a performance of the year. I understand why this film was very dark, and partially being a dark comedy. The overall storyline looked good. The man with ambition, and to meet that end, he had dedicated his life. But he did not know what he's becoming. It was like 'Split' meets 'Bad Santa'. From all, the boat scenes were a bit of out of context. Yet it brought distinct perspective to the character who was struggling with reality. A film for a few selected people.

REVIEW FROM ROGER EBERT. || Buying this movie was of course pretty much a request from my kids although I have to confess that I, as a Science Fiction geek, was at least a tiny bit interested in seeing what they had managed to cook together on a big budget. For the record I find the television show absolutely awful. Therefore I am quite surprised that I found the movie to be not exactly good but at least watchable.

Make no mistake, it is indeed a silly and simple plot, teenage wet dream, stupid and illogical kind of story that you would expect. However, it was actually mildly fun to watch. Most of my enjoyment came from the special effects and action sequences of course. The dialog and behavior of the teenage heroes were as stereotyped and generally awful as one would expect.

This of course means that the first half of the movie is less interesting than the second half when the action picks up. Actually, although there are some fun moments during “training”, I felt this entire idea of them not being able to use their powers before they had gotten into the right “mental state” to prove that they were actually Power Rangers was just a rubbish one.

Once things started to pick up speed it became more interesting. The different means of transport of the Power Rangers was absolutely silly but still great fun to watch.

Well, I really do not have that much more to say. The last parts of the movie was one big special effects feast with a few comic elements in it, most of them rather … teenage. Fun to watch for a science fiction geek like me.

So, the verdict? Was it a fun movie to watch? Yeah, it was pretty okay. Was it a good movie? Well, that is probably stretching it. || I grew up on Power Rangers, I always loved them, even as an adult I re-watch _Mighty Morphin'_ about once a year. But it's never been ""good"", so for 2017's Hollywood go-over to even come across as well as it did is impressive, but still, in keeping with history, _Power Rangers_ is not ""good"". And where it fails hardest is in its most _Power_-_Ranger_-iest moments. Before Rita Repulsa, and the Ranger suits and the quote unquote epic showdown at Krispy Kreme (which by the way is probably the most heinous example of product placement I've ever seen), I was actually pretty on board, sure the acting was hit and miss at best, but as characters I was interested to follow their dynamic. Unfortunately, this is at best half the film, and even this half isn't perfect.

Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2017/5/8/alien-covenant.html || Alien Covenant marks the third Alien movie directed by Ridley Scott and the second prequel to the franchise after Prometheus. They also seem to be getting worse with age.

Prometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers, ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life, but human life as well. However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism.

Especially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost.

He of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clichés that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt's stomach.

We're dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members.

Reluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship's upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet.

That's where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender's David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender's soft-spoken performance continues to haunt.

I also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.

We also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn't have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool.

Just it's at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage.

The biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says ""we never should have come"", final alien chase.

The aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make.

It's also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let's just say those looking for more info about them will get angry.

The promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it's hard to get re-engaged.

The characters don't help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain's widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here.

Billy Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation.

But at least those two have some background. I'm so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration. You're not supposed to make us root for the alien, guys.

Finally i'm no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary. It's easy to tell what this movie wants to do and it's even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comes.

There are a few nice kills here, I will give the movie that. If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender (he also plays an android named Walter) have a philosophy conversation, you might find some interesting stuff there too. But overall not enough action or thought to make this overly drawn out series seem necessary.

So I go 5/10. For more reviews, check me out on Youtube here- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY_IvAm1bJADConJhDCuq6A







 || I had a few reservations going in to _Alien: Covenant_. In my opinion there hasn't been a truly great entry to the franchise since _Aliens_, so I was worried that the statistics were against it. I thought _Prometheus_ was incredible from a technical standpoint, but not a very engaging movie, and I was worried we might get the same here. The trailers had been mostly good but I was worried I had seen too much of the third act in them, and I was worried this would spoil the experience for me a little.

What I was not worried about was within ten minutes of the damn thing starting I would think to myself: ""Wow, this movie is really poorly made.""

Well I guess I'm an idiot because that is exactly what happened. And that feeling never entirely abated over the course of the whole thing.

Don't get me wrong, it's no ""_AVP: Requiem_"", but I was still very disappointed.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || **The night of bullet business!**

This is one of the surprise films of the year. A limited cast and a one day event film. Except the opening few minutes the remaining film was a crossfire event. It's about two groups caught up in a firing from each other from one mistake to another leading the confrontation. In an abandoned warehouse, with a big amount and the cases new weapons lying in the centre, there's no way in or the out. The only way is to fight them all. So the surviving game begins. Whoever wins at the end can take it all with him.

A very nice concept. With a simple storyline a nice gang fight was drawn out. If you like gangster films, this should watch it. But what bothered me the most was the common logic. You know, they all entered the building after checked for if they are armed, though it can be believed they hid their weapon somewhere and proceeded in. That's not it, the ammos for their gun, they kept firing many rounds like in the army conflict or a video game. That's why it is average to me. Otherwise an unexpected awesome film.

The casting was good, but the surprise was Brie Larson. To see the Oscar winner in such kind of small scale film. Also disappointed her role was very small. But there is still hope! All others were good. With their unique characters, nicely used to share the screen equally. The reason for the conflict is not well explained, so it is hard to say who's good and who's bad guys here. But behaviours and further development give out where the story is heading. The end was predictable, and also we can expect a sequel. If they have one in their mind, surely it would only get bigger.

_6.5/10_ || One of those films that becomes difficult in giving a fair judgement. On one hand, it is very engaging when the action is on. On the other hand, there are questions that arise when it is not. 

The narrative is an uncomplicated stage play. The arcs come and go as expected and characters and plot details are re-/introduced accordingly. The characters have distinct roles and sides but little history more than what is immediately presented. The violence is grisly and more graphic than common in action movies but still glorified and not really a shocker in realism. It is still a suspense flick, so there is much crawling about after multiple gunshot wounds though there is the flesh wound in the arm that is a smart reverse take on seventies action movie tropes. The set and aesthetics are beautiful and so are the facial hairs. It is hard to not refer to Tarantino, but that is what you get when you do a retro gangster shoot out drama that drops pop cultural references. Thankfully it stays on a grounded level and does not try to be more clever than it is. Then again, there is not much development either but for the strenuous progressions of the positional wars of the battlefield.

There are other details that I will not mention for the sake of spoilers that I find worth discussion, which are not necessarily good or bad but they are still there. 

In conclusion, I'd say it is a movie worth watching for the bullet ballet in itself. That is if you don't let the analysis get in the way."

To say about the story it’s not that great as we have come across lots of movies with this kind of stories and the comedy element really works out for this movie so if we want to keep all the seriousness aside and have a good laugh this movie is the choice 
When talking about the action in this it does have those elements here and there with a pinch of laugh always as it involves bikes cars helicopters etc.
So the plot involves quite a bit of action, lots of funny scenes especially Dax shepard when he says jokes without knowing its funny makes us roll with laughter and I even like the combo between Micheal and Dax.
This movie is an 18+ as there are some nude scenes,

My Rating: 7/10 || **A tale of two motorcycle cops!**

I haven't seen the 70s series from where this film got inspired by. But before that, I had in my mind that it could be a remake of 'Electra Glide in Blue'. Anyway, it was directed and starred in one of the main roles by Dax Shepard. His direction job is not going anywhere. Though all his so far attempts are appreciable. In this film, it was Michael Pena, who led the rest of the characters. He'd done similar roles in other films like 'End of Watch'. But literally, he ruled it by sidelining everybody else in the film, including Dax.

Two motorcycle highway patrol cops team up. They are not an ideal match for the job, but they are assigned in that way by their superior. One of them was an ex-motorcycle stuntman and the other one who had lost his partner recently. They begin to investigate a highway robbery that leads them in the right direction. But can they handle those gangmen who have overpowered them in many ways is what brings twist, before ending with a big action sequence.

A stylish cop flick and a quality presentation, but messed up by its screenplay. The story had a purpose, but the film scenes looked not arranged properly in order. There are many unnecessary scenes, just to bring some comedies. Yeah, some of them were really fun, but the film overwhelmed by bad jokes and random action sequences. The actors were good, though it was only the lead two who were the bright spot in the narration. If you forget all the logics, you could enjoy it. It serves a decent entertainment. Yet when it comes to rating, it won't deserve any big number.

(SPOILERS TOWARDS END!)

I don't always agree with (or heed warnings) from movie critics; perhaps because I used to be one myself in a nation wide magazine many years ago -- but if a movie has a 40% rating on Metacritic, I admit it rarely bodes well. Still I watched this, largely due to the involvement of several favorite actors and the script having been written by the Duplass brothers.

I found it almost instantly both funny and moving, and the longer I watched, the more confused I became as to why most critics had been lukewarm or downright dismissive of it. I figured it had to be mostly due to the genre blend of comedy and more dramatic issues, and that probably most of the criticism had been along the usual lines of ""can't make up it's mind', etc. But even so, that didn't add up to a meager 40% rating, with such a clever script and great acting.

When the credits rolled, I knew instantly why: A happy ending...

It all mostly works out in the end for the oddball protagonists. Critics in general can't stand it. If a movie has had a degree of realism and/or several dark or borderline dark-ish issues brought up along the way, critics tend to go ******* unless it all ends in misery, or largely unresolved, or at the very least in ambiguity. God forbid you walk away from such a movie actually feeling good; that equals 'cheesy' in most reviewers book. Was it realistic that most of the people involved got a happy, somewhat romantic ending? Of course not, but though the movie tackles several 'real' issues within the comedy, I found the ending perfectly fitting with the tone of it. Critics often use the word 'predictable' about anything that has a hint of romantic comedy in it, but I'd say, there are few things as predictable as movie critics in general.

If you want to read what I consider a spot on review for this, check out Empire Magazine, who went against the stream and gave it 4 out of 5 stars. || **It was not a table of honour!**

I thought it was some B movie. Expecting anything from it is like a total waste. But that was not the case. I was surprised how simple it was, yet very entertaining. Not all the small films like this would do the same magic. Everything in the was like I already seen in other films, even though I enjoyed it thoroughly.

It was a one-day event tale and in the backdrop of a wedding. In that, the film focused on one particular table, the table number 19 on the outskirt the dining hall. They all came from different background and never met before. They learn about each other, and their personal issues open up during the cerebration. Apart from that, they mess up a few things and later try to fix it, that all comes into play before it reaches the end.

From the director of 'Rocket Science', which came a decade ago, also starred by Anna Kendrick. I think he is a fine director, at least in small comedies with the good quality screenplay. So he should be doing more feature films than the television series. I was impressed by Kendrick. Her choices of films might not be the greatest, but she's almost there and very soon going to give a career best for sure. The remaining cast was funnily good.

I think this film deserves a sequel. Because the film characters are very distinctive and has left behind a lot about them which need to be revealed. Sequel or prequel, it does not matter, but I'll be surely looking for one. Look at its cost, just $5 million. Big production houses can give away such tiny amount without expecting any returns.

You might see it rated low everywhere, but for me, it is a good comedy. One of the best small budget films. Yeah, the end was very clichéd, but acceptable for such film. I would definitely suggest it for those who won't anticipate in films they watch. Particularly if you prefer simple storyline and a few laughs, it is the one.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **One's fighting for the child and the other's for her gift!**

Films about battle for child custody is a very familiar theme. There are lots of great films you could find. This is just another, but another great among them. There's actually nothing special about it. It's simple and emotional. The characters were slightly different, and agenda for courtroom drama is interesting aspect of the film.

A single uncle who is a by-default guardian for his niece since her mother had died. But the seven year old kid is a math prodigy like her mother. He wanted her to live a normal life like everybody else in her age. That's what her mother wanted as well. When her grandmother learns about the gift, is now seeking a court intervene to provide all she needed to nurture her gift, since she's very rich. So the kid caught between adult's fight, how the rest of the narration folds are emotionally told.

I'm not a fan of Captain America, because he's not the Captain Earth or Captain my country. Other than that, Chris Evans is not a big marketable star. But this was a pretty cool performance. The kid too was awesome. The last time I saw her was from 'Mr Church'. Well written and directed. Easily one of the best drama films of the year. A good message film as well. Families should watch it.

And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years andlittle known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii.

The movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard.

And like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?

But all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.

Where the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success.

There's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective.

The movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with ""There's Something About Mary"", just with not as good a payoff.

Hannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though.

The women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine.

The whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels.

So I go 6 out of 10 on this one. For more reviews, check me out on Youtube at- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY_IvAm1bJADConJhDCuq6A

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **When lifeguards turned homicides!**

In the 90s, when the original television series was aired, I was just a kid. Then it was too sexy, that I was not allowed to watch. The world has changed so much all these years. I always wanted to see that, but never had a chance. Now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. There were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that. Yet they have already announced a sequel.

The bay security team is now recruiting new members. Three joins as the trainee after the tryout. Within a few days, a couple of suspicious deaths happen in the bay. The cops are not worried to solve it, but the Baywatch team jumps in and starts their own investigation. That leads them to a dangerous territory. From there, how they deal with it was revealed with some action-thriller.

Pumped up body, starring alongside a current top star, nothing is working for Zac Efron. He's just an accidental actor, won't survive long, unless he turns it all his way like Ben Afflect did. On the other hand, Dwayne was awesome. All the other actors too. Priyanka was not ideal for such role. Because an Indian in a negative role for an American film, nah, it does not work. India keeps all the thugs and sends only engineers, doctors, scientist et cetera to the foreign lands. A Chinese or a Russian villain works better.

No suspense. Everything was open from the beginning itself. Some of the comedies were good, but some were most absurd. Especially, I did not like the storyline. The Bay security force not doing their job, but police work. It goes completely out of the frame. It's okay doing same within their enclosure, but the film entered beyond that. Thus, the film missed to cover the beach events as what the title had promised. I hope the sequel would fall in line.

People have reason to dislike it, but I'm not on the same page. Of course it was not the best kidnap-adventure I've ever seen. But I enjoyed watching it. Because I felt it was being truthful. I mean Amy Schumer neither a beauty queen nor a sexy devil. Her role was much better than the last time I saw her in a romance-comedy. Except the familiar storyline, this film had a better narration with honest dialogues. So don't criticise me for saying what I felt about her.

Another South American based clichéd theme. A woman goes on vacation with her mother after breaking up with her boyfriend. Soon the paradise becomes a 'behind the enemy line' hell. When there's no one is coming to their rescue, the surviving and fight back begins. In an unfamiliar territory, how they plan for their escape and other adventures follows till the last sequence of the film.

Both, Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn was good. It was a perfect casting, because the chemistry was good. The pace of the narration was the advantage. A decent direction from the filmmaker of some of the finest comedy films. Surely there's nothing wrong to watch it at once. An average film, or maybe slightly above that. But there's nothing laudable. If you are looking for logicless time pass film, it will do just fine.

Now before I begin to tear this film into shreds, let me give you some background. I was excited for this movie. I love Tom Cruise. I love Sofia Boutella. I love Russell Crowe. I love the Universal Monsters. 

Lets just say I was disappointed.

This film has some of the worst tonal problems in a film ever. An inconsistent tone is my biggest pet peeve. Sometimes it's scary. Sometimes it's a huge action blockbuster. Sometimes it's trying to be like Brendan Frasier's ""The Mummy."" It doesn't know what it is.

The female lead (who's name I can't remember) is incredibly bland. Not her acting, she's actually quite good. It's the writing is what makes her bad. 

Jake Johnson's character is one of the most annoying characters in a movie ever. And I mean that. I hated almost every scene he was in.

The few high notes: Sofia Boutella kills it. Russell Crowe is delightfully campy. Tom Cruise gives another solid performance despite his character being super unlikable.

Alex Kurtzman is what hurts this film. The direction is quite bland. Kurtzman is a bad screenwriter and a just as bad director.

This film is a mess. Tonal problems and bland writing. Some fun action scenes and performances can't keep this film from being a boring trainwreck.

1.3/5.0 || Honestly, this film screwed up big time and it's not as good as the 1999 film, most people are going to compare this film to that and I don't blame them. Tome Cruise was like a walking joke in this and while I saw this in the cinema, people were laughing during an action scene that was actually badly put together and I didn't realise this until now. This is pretty much a mix bag of a film which is a shameful way to start off a new cinematic universe of the Dark Universe. || Remember when _Dracula Untold_ was supposed to kick off Universal's Monster-Movie franchise, but then they canned that because of how poorly received that movie was? Well get ready to go straight back to the drawing board Universal, because _The Mummy_ isn't even half the movie that _Dracula Untold_ was. Sofia Boutella as the titular Mummy is the movie's one redeeming feature, but she far from salvages this train-wreck.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._"

Dom (Vin Diesel) is honeymooning in Cuba with Letty but married bliss does not last for long. A cyber terrorist called Cipher (Charlize Theron) has something on Dom, enough to get him to turn his back on his family and go rogue.

Hobbs ends up in jail because of Dom's betrayal. Even worse he is the same block as Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) the man he put in jail in the last film.

Mr Nobody (Kurt Russell) manipulates both Hobbs and Shaw to team up, together with Dom's crew they go after Cipher.

The film has several big action pieces the best of which are auto-driven cars being hacked an causing mayhem in the streets of New York. The Russian set action scenes on ice being a bit dicey.

It is still a loud, dumb action picture. Popcorn entertainment. || Might be the dumbest of the franchise to date, and if nothing else, that's an achievement. More importantly, _Fate of the Furious_ continues the tradition that the series has upheld since all the way back in the... half-way point: _Fast 5_. That was when these movies actually got bearable, and _Fate of the Furious_ delivers on the promise of that fun.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || **Fast + Eight = Fate**

We all miss Paul Walker here, but the franchise has grown bigger with more new casts from a couple of previous installments and with this, still counting. Yes, it marks the arrival of Jason Stathom as hinted at the end of the previous part, as well as Charlize Theron in the negative role. And guest appearance of veteran actors. This is where the bald guys rule. One of the most unique franchise.

This is the costliest film in the series, but did not earn as much as 'Fast 7' did. At least it stands second out of the eight. Now the billion dollar club becoming normal. The best thing about this series is, the race days are over. It's now more a cop-thief kind of cat- mouse action-adventure game that moves all around the globe. It opened in Cuba with a small race, which is what it's known for, but soon falls back to the manhunt.

Yep, Toretto abandons his family and disappears. Soon he'll be found on the wrong side of the battle between the security/secret agency and the international criminal gang. Now it is the clash within the family that involves outsiders too. A new recruit, Deckard Shaw joins the team, alongside Scott Eastwood as Little Nobody. Finding what they're up to and striking them to avert their plans are followed in the remaining film.

The original films had awesome automobile stunts, but what was missing is the fist fight, which came to life with more masculinely since Dwayne Johnson's entry. Now add Stathan as well to it. I hope he stays in the series, rather just for one film as a guest appearance. The regular cast was good as always. The story had a small twist, but mostly predictable. A good film compared to a few earlier films, otherwise a decent watch. Now its time to wait for Fast 9 or is it called Fine!

It seems the Americans desperate, deliberate hate towards Adam Sandler, Michale Bay et cetera never going to calm down, even they have started to give good films. That's an unfortunate mindset from the west. While the rest of the world enjoying these guys films without prejudice. This is not Sandlers best, but a better one. Initially, it annoyed me to see the Sandler with the same old accent. But seeing the some of the scenes, it actually made sense. I especially thought it should have been a serious drama, but then it would haven't worked out with the kind of characters it had. Particularly the Kevin James.

It is a 90s tale about a Hollywood manager. Narrated as a flashback as the film stars recall his legacy. His latest find, a young woman with a golden voice, is an upcoming sensation. He always stood for her in all the good and bad situations. But time comes he to back off and focus on his other clients. The remaining is about his job, how it shapes are told. I have heard that it was loosely based on Sandler's own manager. I also liked cameos, particularly Rikishi! A long film. But I liked it at the end. It is an okay film. Those who hate Sandler should stay away and let the rest of the guys enjoy it.

But _Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie_ is pretty bad. Not in any unexpected ways, it's reasonable to expect a certain level of humour from a film whose titular hero has ""Underpants"" in the name, but in my honest opinion, _The ""First"" Epic Movie_, should probably be the last one too.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || **A new superhero has born.**

Based on the children's comic book. It might look silly for a film, but all the animations are. From the director of 'Turbo', it tells the story of two best friends and their little secret. The secret of keeping their school principal under their command, after a mysterious power gave them an opportunity to enjoy the life as they wanted. But when a mad scientist started wreck the school and the city, they have to come up with something to stop him. The remaining story is full of fun action-adventure.

The concept of the superhero was funny. But sure kids would love it. At least would make them wear underwear. I still watched it knowing it is for children, and I liked it. But I watched mainly for Kevin Hart. Because his fantastic voice-over in 'Secret Life of Pets' saved the film, and so here. Little short film, the story too was very simple, though the animation was good. I don't know there will be a sequel, but it should be, or else I would like to see a television series like most of the feature films in the recent time transformed into.

_7/10_ || Alright, buckle up, because I just saw Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, and… wow. Just wow. Seriously, this movie is like a giant, hilarious, super-powered wedgie of awesomeness!

From the very beginning, you're thrown into the crazy world of George and Harold, two best friends who love pranks, comics, and causing a little bit of (harmless!) chaos. Their friendship is so real and funny, you instantly want to be their buddy. They're creative, they're goofy, and they're just trying to have fun.

The animation style is absolutely perfect. It's like the movie jumped right out of a flipbook, with all these cool, hand-drawn elements that make it feel super unique. It's bright, it's energetic, and it's just plain fun to watch. Every scene pops with color and silly details that keep you laughing and engaged.

And the humor? Oh my goodness, the humor! This movie is packed with jokes that hit on so many levels. There's slapstick, there's wordplay, there's visual gags – it's a non-stop laugh riot. I was literally crying with laughter at some points. And it’s not just silly jokes; it’s clever and smart humor that kids and adults will both appreciate.

The story itself is surprisingly engaging. It’s about friendship, creativity, and the power of imagination. George and Harold’s love for their comics really shines through, and you can’t help but root for them. Even when things get totally bonkers, the movie never loses sight of the importance of being true to yourself and sticking together with your friends.

The characters are all fantastic. From the teachers to the villains, everyone is memorable and hilarious. The voice acting is top-notch, bringing so much personality to each character. You can tell the actors had a blast making this movie.

The pacing is perfect. There’s never a dull moment, and the movie keeps you hooked from start to finish. It's a whirlwind of crazy adventures, hilarious moments, and genuinely heartwarming scenes.

Honestly, I can’t think of a single thing I didn’t like about this movie. It’s a pure joy to watch, and it left me with a huge smile on my face. It’s the kind of movie you can watch over and over again and still find new things to laugh at.
If you love cartoons, if you love to laugh, or if you just want to have a good time, you absolutely have to see Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie. It's a 10/10 masterpiece of pure, unadulterated fun. Go see it! You won’t regret it!"

A downer ending is often what makes a movie great. But I do like satisfactory ones. _It Comes at Night_ did not give that to me. Mystery is often its own reward, and I do believe that's what writer/director Trey Edward Shults was going for here, but it didn't wind up hit that resonant for me. This particular movie felt like it wasn't about the journey, it was about the destination, and we essentially didn't get one.

Joel Edgerton is fantastic of course, but any one of the other actors could have been as well, we'll never know because they were never given that opportunity. Which really says it all with _It Comes at Night_. There seemed like there was something very worthwhile just on the other side of the veil, but we'll never know, because we never got to see it. And with cinema, if we didn't see it, does it really count?

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || **It's always family first in the apocalyptic world!**

It was not what I was expecting, enjoyed it though. The trailer, the posters hints something else. So I thought it could be a horror, but it was even a terror or a thriller flick. Well, there were a few occasions where it was edgy, though in the most of the film nothing really happened. Slow but not boring. A simple storyline, limited cast and a apocalyptic theme. Surely you would have seen hundreds of this kind, so when you watch it, you won't find anything new out of it. Then remains the question, is it any worth!

I liked a simple take. Just like the film 'The Survivalist'. A small family living in an isolated place, but very precautious about any outside threat. The world is infected with an unknown disease and people are dying everywhere. Recently they had buried one of their family members. So they are not taking any chances with anyone. But now after a terrifying encounter, another family joins them and how things go on from there are the rest of the tale to tell us with a small twist.

Well, you won't see Joel Edgerton doing a solo film often. But this was a different, because of a small budget and the kind of narration. He did good and so the rest his co-stars. Firstly, it was not a horror film. Then there were a few intentional scenes to scare the viewers, but it wasn't anywhere near to scary. I've watched the whole film and I still don't know what comes at night. Dreams? Nightmares? Looks that's what it implies. Other than that it is a drama film with a little thrill. It can be watched nothing more than once.

**6/10** || **The marketing made me expect something this movie was not and ultimately dissatisfied me with what I got.**

Marketed as a horror creature movie, It Comes at Night disappoints due to the severe lack of creature horror. Instead, the film follows a family surviving an apocalyptic virus that has all but wiped humanity off the face of the earth. Paranoia saturates every moment of the movie, with characters constantly fearing how others might attack or infect those they care about. The film's scariest moments are the weird dreams the son keeps having. The twists at the end most likely are meant to shock but left me deflated. While It Comes at Night might be beloved by cinema fanatics, I couldn't get past the deceptive marketing. I wanted monsters and got family drama and paranoia."
