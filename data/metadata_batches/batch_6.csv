In a town near coastal Georgia, a widow (Cate Blanchett) struggles to make ends meet with her three boys via her psychic abilities. When a young woman goes missing (Katie Holmes), the authorities ask her for assistance. Greg Kinnear, Keanu Reeves, Hilary Swank, Giovanni Ribisi, Gary Cole and JK Simmons are all on hand.

“The Gift” (2001) meshes plot elements of “Resurrection” (1980) with the setting or tone of “Murder in Coweta County,” “The General’s Daughter” and a little “Cape Fear” (1991). You can’t beat the cast and the Southern town ambiance is great, plus the flawed characters are nicely fleshed-out.

There are no less than five possibilities of who the culprit is and, with 20 minutes to go, it becomes clear who it is. Regrettably, it’s just so cliched and contrived I rolled my eyes, not to mention it ‘steals’ the hope of the viewer. I don’t want to say more because I don’t want to give anything away.

Still, if you can roll with that banal element, it’s a quality drama with a worthy point. Both Cate and Holmes are fetching in a girl-next-door kind of way.  

It runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in the Savannah area (Guyton, Thunderbolt and Springfield).

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Jetting off on yet another important task, FedEx whizzer Chuck Noland leaves his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) behind just before Christmas. Disaster strikes during the flight and the plane crashes into the ocean. Managing to free himself from the sinking jet, Noland is washed up on an uninhabited island. Without basic modern comforts and fighting solitude daily, Noland must live in hope that one day he might be saved before he loses his mind or the will to live.

Tom Hanks (Noland) re-teams with director Robert Zemeckis after their hugely successful collaboration on 1994 awards stealer, Forrest Gump. Though Cast Away didn't win any awards (the usual cry of it being Oscar bait had preceded it) it can be argued to be Hanks' best performance. Few actors in the modern era could carry the film the way that Hanks does. Beguiling and drawing us into his loneliness, Hanks, with minimal dialogue (his only company being a volleyball that washed up with a few other FedEx parcels) excels with facial and bodily acting. Zemeckis, who should be applauded for the middle section and the terrifying plane crash that precedes it, puts Hanks' Noland through the mangler. The convenience of said parcels washing ashore aside, Noland is bumped bruised and dentally challenged, the Robinson Crusoe clichés exist of course, but Zemeckis and a heartfelt Hanks put us there on the island as well, with a pat on the back due for the excellent work by the sound department I might add.

Sadly Cast Away is bookended by not so great work. The opening character introductions are unremarkable but just about good enough for the plot set up, but the ending lacks emotional punch and defies what has been built up. Things aren't helped by Helen Hunt's lack of chemistry with Hanks, but that in turn is not helped by the writing from William Broyles Jr. since it's only really now that it's Noland that we care about. It's a bit churlish to complain too much though, because Zemeckis kept us on the island with Chuck, there was no cutting back to grieving family or fruitless rescue attempts. With that it was a truly fine one man show, even if that is something that ultimately renders the ending something of a let down. 7.5/10 || **Cast Away is a brilliant movie in many ways, but some disappointing story and character decisions keep it from being a personal favorite.**

It all began on Christmas Day. Many people forget that Cast Away is technically a Christmas movie. The fateful plane crash that strands Tom Hanks on an island alone with his volleyball best friend, Wilson, takes off and leaves his new fiance alone on Christmas Day. There are some fantastic aspects to this film. Tom Hanks once again gives an Oscar-worthy performance committing himself entirely to the role that honestly carried the film. Everyone loves Tom Hanks, so stranding him on a deserted island fighting for survival gets everyone involved. The directing and setting of the film were well-crafted. There are two reasons Cast Away receives such a low rating:

> 1. Despite Hanks' incredible performance, the film was mostly one guy all alone talking to himself. It made the story drag and get a little boring.
> 
> 2. Call me a romantic but the fact that he battles and finally makes it home to his fiance only to find out she moved on was extremely disappointing. Sure he abandoned her during the holiday season but still, he returned to her against all odds, only to be rejected. Ouch! I guess she sort of… cast him away. 🤭

I agree with anyone who says Cast Away is an amazing movie, but it's not a personal favorite. || Tom Hanks excels in this well put together depiction of the archetypal, rather fastidious, business executive who finds himself stranded - after his plane crashes - on a remote tropical island. Completely ill-suited for life without any modern conveniences, but not without a brain cell or two, he has to adapt à la ""Robinson Crusoe"" to his new life of coconuts and whatever fish he can catch. The story takes it's time but that all contributes well to the effectiveness of his performance as he must deal with the physical, logistical and increasingly psychological challenges his predicament throws at him. Loneliness and despair fight against his human nature to thrive and to survive - and cause his creation of ""Wilson"", a sort of hybrid between a volleyball and a pineapple, for company! It was a Fed-Ex plane, which allows Robert Zemeckis to introduce some brief flashes of humour to lighten the mood - it's astonishing what people think to send to each other - and there is even a role for some ice skates to serve as a dentistry aid! As it progresses, we know that rescue is unlikely so are not surprised when his thoughts turn to venturing into the great, and turbulent, unknown - on a raft held together by plant threads and video tape. There isn't a great deal of jeopardy so the ending isn't really in doubt, but the effort here by Hanks and some solid writing and directing create quite a compelling and at times un-nerving film to watch. I've never really been one for the tropical island experience - I'm certainly not now!"

During the Depression, three guys escape a chain gang in Mississippi (George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro) to experience many misadventures with a blind prophet, a gifted musician (Chris Thomas King), a radio station, baby-face Nelson (Michael Badalucco), baptism in a river, “sirens,” a one-eyed Bible salesmen (John Goodman), an ex-wife (Holly Hunter), the KKK, corrupt politicians and an area with hidden treasure about to be flooded. 

A Coen brothers film, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000) is a farcical odyssey taking place in the Deep South of the 1930s. The cast is entertaining, which also includes the likes of Daniel von Bargen. It’s quirky and amusing augmented by its setting and locations, not to mention one of my wife’s favorite movies (possibly because Clooney was in his prime). In ways, it’s like “Deliverance” (1972) if it were a comedy, just mixed with “Cool Hand Luke” (1967) and a dash of Homer’s Odyssey. 

I like it, but don’t love it; it’s fun, no doubt, but also kinda forgettable. Yet the song “I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow” is well done and catchy.  

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot mostly in Mississippi, plus some stuff done at Universal Studios.

GRADE: B- || Weird convicts that escape. With no money they try to find treasure. Has some weird comedy as well. Good cast though. || Having just escaped from a chain gang, the eloquent “Everett” (George Clooney) and the two men who share his chain - “Pete” (John Turturro) and the not so bright “Delmar” (Tim Blake Nelson) set off on a journey to find his $1.2 millions in treasure buried in the ground in an area designated to be flooded to generate hydro-electric power. First things first, they have to get the chains off and that’s just the start of their escapades as they meet some of the eccentric folks that live in 1930s Mississippi. Along the way they encounter the mad-as-cheese bank robber “Babyface” Nelson (Michael Badalucco), distinctly dodgy bible salesman “Big Dan” (John Goodman); they meet travelling minstrel “Tommy” (Chris Thomas King) and he helps them to make a record for a blind radio host and they even manage to meet with some very tempting ladies doing their laundry on ricks in a stream! The whole thing is very, and I mean very, loosely based on Homer’s post Trojan war “Odyssey” and if you’re familiar with that text, then you can just about see the narrative as the story proceeds and certainly when you look back on it. If you don’t, well it doesn’t matter at all - this is still a comedy-laden and sharply written take on three people motivated by money in the first instance, but who come to realise that there is more to life than a dollar bill. It also transfers the ancient scenario quite entertainingly, politically, too - taking a fun pop at the gubernatorial race between an hopeless but exuberant incumbent flour merchant and the red-robed leader of the local branch of the KKK, and it also presents us with some toe-tappers from three men who work well together on a road-trip with a difference. This is probably my favourite outing for Clooney as he delivers some of his almost Homerian dialogue with charming sarcastic wit and skill. It’s enjoyable, this, and well worth a cinema viewing if you can."

Miss Congeniality finds Sandra Bullock as FBI Agent Gracie Hart, who must go undercover in the Miss United States beauty pageant to prevent a psychopath from committing untold homicide.

The premise is simple, it's a Pygmalion/My Fair Lady scenario that transforms the rough and tough Gracie into a viable contestant for the pageant. Thus we have all the comedy that comes with her literally battling everyone, including her own opinions on pageants, as she is being asked to be something she doesn't believe is in her make up. The mystery of who the killer is who's on the loose is strong for a good portion of film, and even once it's known and drama takes centre stage, it's still hard to get the smile off of your face. 

The jokes are plentiful, with Bullock finding chemistry with all of her co-stars. She's a very under valued comedy actress, and her ability to bond with an entire cast is marvellous to observe. Reference sexual tension with Benjamin Bratt, the jousting hostilities with Ernie Hudson, the way she bounces off of the other beautiful girls, and best of all the by-play with Michael Caine, who is playing a camp stylist and walks in to lift the laughter roof off the rafters in every scene he is in.

It doesn't push the boundaries of comedy, but it's thankfully a consistently funny piece of work, aided by a super cast on form who make a better comedy out of what the screenplay suggested it had any right to be. 7/10 || **A good comedy, albeit with an exaggerated and unbelievable story.**

This is perhaps one of the most enjoyable and endearing comedies of the 2000s. It's not a perfect film, it's far from it, but it manages to deliver on its promises and offers us an hour and a half of warm and friendly fun. It's one of those films that, while not being perfect, is ideal to watch as a family and doesn't make us waste our time.

The script has a very promising basic premise: faced with a credible threat to the security of the Miss United States of America beauty pageant, the FBI decides to infiltrate a female agent there. The problem is everything else that develops from here: the script exaggerates so much that it becomes unbelievable, even if funny. Gracie Hart, the main character, is not just an FBI agent with a tough profile and strong personality. She's basically an almost masculinized woman with the manners and demeans of a troll, who is then transformed into a model (basically) in a very, very short time! It's unbelievable and absurd. Of course, from there, the film unfolds more harmoniously, with excellent dialogues loaded with witty jokes and good material given to the actors.

Sandra Bullock is the main actress and, in this film, she achieves one of her most popular works. In addition to being excellent at what she does and giving us an impeccable job, she had the joy of playing a friendly character, worthy of the public's affection, who captures our sympathy with ease. Next to her, we can still see Michael Caine, in excellent shape and in a character full of humor. The film also has a good performance by Benjamin Bratt, Heather Burns, Candice Bergen and the participation of William Shatner.

Being a rather light humor film, it doesn't make a very strong bet on the technical aspects. Even so, I would like to leave a few notes: first of all, I believe that the special and sound effects did an excellent job throughout the film, and the same can be said of the design of the sets, costumes (with an obvious emphasis on the costumes of Bullock) and props. On the other side of the coin, I found the cinematography too uninteresting, and the editing didn't seem very inspired to me. The soundtrack does its job, highlighting almost only the song “One in a Million”, in the voice of Bosson. || **Miss Congeniality easily wins anyone over with Bullock's captivating and uproarious performance.**

Sandra Bullock's comedy brilliance permeates every part of this movie. The supporting cast also delivers excellent performances, with Michael Caine, William Shatner, and Heather Burns shining in their roles. But this movie delights and rises above an average forgetful comedy because of Bullock's hilarious and singular portrayal of awkward and endearing Gracie Hart. Her physical comedy and tangible discomfort with all the beauty routines and dresses make almost every moment humorous and entertaining. The character development, goofy cast, and satisfying conclusion all support Bullock in winning big. Miss Congeniality is one of my wife's go-to favorites, and it's one I'm always willing to watch with her."

All the Pretty Horses is directed by Billy Bob Thornton and adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the name name by Ted Tally. It stars Matt Damon, Penélope Cruz, Henry Thomas & Lucas Black. Marty Stuart scores the music and Barry Markowitz photographs it. Plot finds Damon as John Grady Cole, a young cowboy who travels with his best friend, Lacey Rawlings, from Texas across the border into Mexico. It's a journey that sees acquaintances come and go, love blossom and the harshness of the world become all too real to such young eyes.

A big financial disaster for Columbia Pictures and Miramax Films who lost nearly $40 million on the film. Serves them right I say, for Thornton's original cut was a long epic piece thought to be around three and a half hours in length. But good old Harvey Weinstein demanded drastic cuts to be made and Thornton had to trim it to just nearly two hours in running time. That's a lot of story gone astray, and boy does it show, no wonder Damon himself bitterly commented that to lose 35% of your movie ultimately leaves you with a completely different film. It's such a shame because although it's now a film chocked with flaws and flow problems, one can see that in its original cut there had to be at worst an involving rites-of-passage story.

So what are we left with? Well it's certainly not a donkey. It drips with period atmosphere and comes resplendent with a poetic beauty thanks to Markowitz's photography. Stuart's score too has the tone absolutely right, blending the old feel of the West with evocative arrangements for the more tender moments involving the protagonists: and there are tender moments, notably between Cole (Damon youthful but not really exuding a naivety for the age of the character) & Rawlings (Thomas effective and dominating his scenes). That the crucial relationship between Cole and Alejandra Villarreal (Cruz weak and lacking believability for the romantic strand) is barely formed can be laid at Weinstein's door. So too can the fact that a number of characters file in and out with blink and you miss them parts, sad when it's the likes of Robert Patrick and Sam Sheperd; and tragic in the case of Bruce Dern's judge; the latter of which is a crucial character in the final quarter but gets about three minutes screen time. Madness. Star of the movie is Black, who as young ruffian Blevins, manages to convey a deep sense of vulnerability. It's a critical role, one that affects the main character's lives, and thanks to Black's spirited performance we anxiously await what fate has in store for the lovable rogue.

So much good to sample, then, even if it feels like going out for a three course dinner and finding the main course is no longer available. It's hoped that one day we may get a directors cut from Thornton, only then you feel will All the Pretty Horses be revealed as a potential thoroughbred. 6/10 || _**Unique, beautiful Western with excellent score, but gaping holes in the story**_

Released in 2000, ""All the Pretty Horses"" stars Matt Damon and Henry Thomas as two West Texas cowboys, John Grady Cole and Lacey Rawlins, who are weary of all the fenced-in land in 1949 and so head to Mexico for freer pastures. There they meet up with a foolish juvenile (Lucas Black) before coming to a huge ranch where Penelope Cruze plays the owner's daughter, Alejandra. Unfortunately, unexpected problems surface. Miriam Colon plays the girl's staunch aunt and ranch matriarch while Sam Shepard and Bruce Dern have (very) small roles.

Billy Bob Thornton directed the movie based on Cormac McCarthy's novel and the original runtime was said to be around 3 hours and 12 minutes, but was cut at the insistence of distributer Harvey Weinstein to a mere 117 minutes (!). Similar circumstances forced Marlon Brando to cut his sole directed movie, 1961's ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" from 5 hours to half that time and it turned out to be a Western masterpiece, but ""All the Pretty Horses"" was cut TOO much. Even an additional 20 minutes would've helped immeasurably. 

As it is, there are gaping holes in the story. For instance, there is little build-up to Cole's love affair with Alejandra. ""The Horse Whisperer"" (1998), by contrast, is an excellent example of proper romantic build-up. Other questions abound: What did Alejandra experience in her life that made her brazenly risk her honor? What (specifically) was the source of her deep contempt for her aunt, who seemed to be just looking out for her? Why does Alejandra's father stay on close terms with Cole even AFTER it's discovered he (supposedly) lied to him? What led up to Rawlins' suicidal confrontation with a prison heavy and the same with Cole's deadly tassel? Also, it's subtly revealed that Cole, Rawlins and Blevins (the kid) have very different views of the world, but they're never fleshed out.

The original Director's Cut has been called a masterpiece by those who've seen it, and a release of it has been looked into, but the original composer, Daniel Lanois, steadfastly refused to license his score (which, unusually, he owns) to any release of the film. If they can't work it out, then why not just use the excellent score by Marty Stuart, which is the one used in the cut-down theatrical/DVD version?

As far as locations go, it's great to have a Western actually shot in West Texas rather than supposedly taking place in Texas, but being shot in Arizona, etc. It was equally shot in New Mexico.

Although ""All the Pretty Horses"" has a severely troubled post-production history, it's still worth catching DESPITE the holes in the story. It has magnificent cinematography and locations, formidable actors (Damon is perfect as the humble, respectable protagonist), a magnificent score/soundtrack, an epic tone and an unpredictable story. In short, it's a unique Western that not everyone's going to like because uniqueness polarizes opinion. It's not great simply because it was butchered in post-production, but it's still a quality film and, in many ways, a pleasure to behold.

Some criticize it as soporific and that's true in the sense that it's not a rollicking Western, like 2001's ""American Outlaws,"" which plays like ""Indiana Jones goes West."" ""All the Pretty Horses,"" by contrast, is a realistic Western drama with the tone of the aforementioned ""Horse Whisperer,"" but with periodic actions sequences. It's a refreshing change from the typical in-your-face, loud, CGI-laden, foul-mouthed, unreal movies we have constantly rammed at us; and, again, the music's great.

October 1962, for 13 days the American government fought to avert a nuclear war when it was discovered that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. This is that story.

Many superlatives can be chucked at Thirteen Days, and all are viable. In simple terms it's an intelligent and gripping political thriller, superbly scripted and performed by a cast firing on all cylinders. It's a treat to find a film of this type that educates while it pitches you into a world of political intrigue, to provoke real life thoughts even as the suspense takes a hold. Yes it's talky, of course it is, but these conversations are real and riveting. And while there's not a duff performance in the acting pack, Bruce Greenwood deserves special praise. He is the leader, the fulcrum, there's not a false note by him, JFK becoming the role he was born to play.

Superlatives were invented for films like Thirteen Days. Assuredly so. 9.5/10 || Kevin Costner at least tried to do an accent in this movie, which probably means he got a new agent, a yes man that didn't bother to give him the advice that doing believable accents isn't his thing.  It's almost like listening to your average Brit trying to sound like an American and completely overdoing it.

Do we really sound that exaggerated to them?

Who cares, ignore the above, it's still a good movie... despite Costner's accent.  Or, possibly, in spite of it.

It trashes Dean Achenson, and as a historian the only thing I like to see MORE than Dean getting his just deserts is Allen Dulles getting his... and it throws a jab at that a**hole too.  In 2000 that would have been seen as pure liberal honesty, but now it sort of comes across as far right.  I mean the movie is literally about avoiding Nuclear War with Russia as the entire Democratic party and the progressive movement seem to want to push us closer and closer to it.

It's one of the better political films you can see, and it builds the pressure to the point where you are terrified that the world could end despite the fact it has long come and gone.  And the shift from Jack and Bobby to Ken O'Donnel, a humble appointment secretary is probably one of the best approaches and best ideas any Historical Drama has ever had.

Start to finish it is one of the best political thrillers of all time."

This gem of the millennium comes with a great story (which has been done countless times before and after), great actors (funny faced most of them), and very well done action.

Unfortunately all is wasted on the terrible actual telling of that story and its people in action. We get weird colors, useless zoom ins, shots into nothing, a boring soundtrack, the whole thing stripped off any continuity and stretched to 2 hours 30 minutes.

It is understandable the makers of this film wanted to underline the realism with a documentary style, but come on. Or maybe they just were on some of the drugs shown in the picture, or maybe, and that must be it, they wanted the audience to feel like they were on drugs.

Twenty years later, the prospector is a wealthy man who owns much of the old west town named Kingdom Come. But changes are brewing and his past is coming back to haunt him. A surveyor and his crew scouts the town as a location for a new railroad line and a young woman suddenly appears in the town and is evidently the man's daughter.",Everything has a price.,"Drama, Romance, Western",120.0,2000-12-29,en,6.039,102.0,1.0748,"Peter Mullan, Milla Jovovich, Wes Bentley, Nastassja Kinski, Sarah Polley",Michael Winterbottom,"based on novel or book, romance, old west, california gold rush","The Casterbridge Claim. 

""Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"" 

Michael Winterbottom directs what is in essence a Western version of Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge. It's Sierra Nevada, California, 1867 and the pioneer town of Kingdom Come is thriving under the strict but effective rule of Daniel Dillon (Peter Mullan). Dillon came by way of a gold claim many years earlier by way of a trade, the barter? His wife and child. But now the past is about to catch up with him and Kingdom Come could well turn out to be his burning hell... 

Right off the bat it has to be said that The Claim is a difficult film to recommend, even to Western movie lovers. It's deliberately slow and purposely elegiac and ethereal. The literary aspects of the narrative positively sparkle, yet still this doesn't make the story any more vibrant, because Winterbottom and screenplay writer Frank Cottrell Boyce want to keep things in perspective. In a film that is awash with untold beauty, the snowy mountainous landscapes (Calgary standing in for California) stunningly photographed by Alwin H. Küchler, it's perpetually cold and bleak, the ice and snow a constant that marries up with characters who are deliberately hard to like. 

Technically this is one superior piece of work. Küchler and Winterbottom's panoramas are sublime, the town is strikingly designed by the art department, all wooded angles and smoking chimneys that are magnificently framed by the mountains, while the sound-mix thunders the ears and adds another dimension to the grubby realistic feel. Interior sequences are filmed in low lights, making the lamps spectral in sight, the costume design and the narrative strength of the town whorehouse (which is the fulcrum of proceedings) have a class about them that shines bright in the pantheon of modern era produced Westerns, while Michael Nyman's musical score is evocatively strong. 

The cast respond well to Winterbottom's requirements, Mullan, Wes Bentley, Sarah Polley, Milla Jovovich and Nastassja Kinski (how nice to see the latter twin euro beauties stripped of make up to show a natural era sexiness) all turn in charismatic and heartfelt performances. Narratively the film is driving towards Dillon's day of reckoning, his shoulders heavy with regret and his soul in desperate need of purging. In the interim we are privy to the lives and loves of the townsfolk, their foibles, faults and fancies, this while the town is alive with the arrival of the railroad company, who it is hoped by Dillon will make Kingdom Come prosper still further... 

Unfair comparisons have been drawn with Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Yes, this is similar in style and execution, but why not just see it as the perfect companion piece to Altman's movie? Because it is. How about we instead look at the finale? Which draws a favourably thematic link to the brilliant Boetticher/Scott Western, Ride Lonesome. When push comes to shove, and in honest terms, The Claim is a film that for sure may be hard to love, but it sure as heck fire is a film that is easy to admire. Western fans should see it because they ""will"" take something positive from the experience. 8/10 || ***The beginning and end of a boom town in the Sierra Nevadas***

During the California gold rush of 1849 a desperate man establishes a boom town in the Sierra Nevadas. Eighteen years later his abandoned wife & daughter (Nastassja Kinski & Sarah Polley) ride into town and turn his life (Peter Mullan) upside down. Milla Jovovich plays his singing saloon babe while Wes Bentley is on hand as a surveyor for the railroad that’s coming through.   

“The Claim” (2000) is a top-of-the-line Western that inexplicably fell through the cracks when it was released. It has similarities to “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” (1971), but with more interesting characters, a more compelling story and spectacular locations, not to mention less focus on a house of ill repute. 

If you appreciate grim, realistic Westerns like “The Great Silence” (1968), “Bad Company” (1972), “The Missouri Breaks” (1976), “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), “Unforgiven” (1992) and “North Star” (1996), you’ll like this one. It’s as good or, in most cases, better. I should add that it’s not all grim; there are glimmerings of light.    

The film runs 2 hours and was shot at Fortress Mountain, Kananaskis Country, Alberta, with the train sequences filmed in Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, Colorado.

In some ways it's a curate's egg of a film. It certainly helps if you are a lover of old classic film and have some knowledge of the source material at the film's core. It's a fabulous concept that the screenplay is based around, that the star of the film may actually be a real vampire, and the whole production is executed with consummate skill (Dafoe was deservedly Oscar nominated as were make-up artists Ann Buchanan & Amber Sibley).

Zack Mayo, after years of being shunted around with his woman chasing, alcoholic naval father, decides to up sticks and join the navy himself. He plans to fly jets and enrols at a tough Naval Aviation Officer Candidate School. Very much a loner and used to doing things his own way, Zack must tow the line if he is to succeed. Forming friendships and taking on a romance with a local girl, he may just make the grade. But he has to convince not only his tough no nonsense drill instructor, but also himself.

An Officer And A Gentleman has been bogged down over the years by being labelled as a chick flick, a film they say, that is for the soggy handkerchief brigade. Not so say I. Yes love is a critical strand here, not only finding it after years of being closed off from it, but also to keep it after seizing the day. But it's as much a film about determination as it is about conquering love, in finding strengths from within to achieve ones goals against seemingly badly stacked odds. It really is a film that essays that triumph of the will spirit so lacking in many similar pictures that followed this 1982 piece. There are some incredibly great sequences here, chiefly during the training programme, from Mayo's continuing conflict with Sgt Foley, to a devastating turn of events with a friendship. This film royally packs an emotional punch.

The cast are uniformly excellent, Richard Gere as Mayo is pitch perfect and it pays to notice that he was a 32 year old man playing an early 20s rookie, it's a testament to his undervalued ability that nobody noticed. Debra Winger was nominated for a Best Actress Award for her portrayal as Mayo's love interest, Paula Pokrifki. It's believed that Gere and herself didn't get on off screen, it isn't noticeable, though, because the chemistry sizzles and the resulting end product is one of a joyous returns. Honours have to go to Louis Gossett Jr., though, rightly winning the Best Supporting Actor Award, his performance as instructor Sgt Foley is towering and one of the best of the 1980s. David Keith and Lisa Eilbacher also turn in strong performances, and Taylor Hackford's direction is smooth and without intrusion. The involving screenplay and tidy editing are also noteworthy, and the theme song ""Up where We Belong"" took home the gong for Best Original Song.

Some critics have called the film sexist, oh come off it people! It may come as a shock to them but a lot of women do actually want to be carried off by some dashing hunk, similarly, a lot of us men are more than willing to be the ones carrying the maiden! And lest we forget that the characterisations here carry much depth. 9/10 || This is really a film about a power duet - and we don't get that until the end. The rest of this is a rather mediocre outing for all concerned. Richard Gere - an actor whose stardom still, even now, perplexes me - is ""Zack"", brought up by his dad ""Byron"" (Robert Loggia) after his mother died. Now an adult, he must learn to stand on his own two feet. Determined to prove himself and follow his father into the military, he enrols in the Naval Officer School where he encounters the no-nonsense drill instructor ""Sgt. Foley"" (Louis Gossett Jr) whilst befriending ""Sid"" (David Keith) and ""Paula"" (Debra Winger). Now ""Zack"" is quite a shrewd fella, and is soon running a range of scams around the base that eventually runs him foul of his equally savvy instructor - and the two are soon at loggerhead: a relationship that tests ""Zack"" to breaking point. Off the base, he and his pal are dating ""Paula"" and her pal ""Lynette"" (Lisa Blount) and he must now juggle his sex life with his determination not to get drummed out of the regiment at the hands of his nemesis. There is, sadly, something really predictable about just about all of this. You just know what the plot is going to deliver, and though Gossett Jr. is quite effective as the bad-ass sergeant, the rest of the characterisations are about as shallow as an Ethiopian river in July. Like so many films on this topic, those portrayed in the forces come across as arrogant and dumb, and ""Zack"" - though handsome, does little change that perspective - even if his reason for wanting to succeed is rather more honest than many. Forty years on, I very much doubt we will see it on the ""anniversary release"" circuit. I did it's job then, a job that really doesn't need doing now. Like so many other of Gere's films, it's entirely forgettable. Not so much ""Up Where We Belong"" as ""Down, Down, Way on Down..."""

For 13 days these brave men hold the fort...

The Alamo is not the film it should be, even after the 2004 remake (a great film that takes a reflective and thoughtful stance) we find ourselves still waiting for a blood pumping and stirring take on the folklore tale of what happened at the small missionary known as The Alamo. It's San Antonio, 1836 and General Santa Anna is marching his mighty armies into the contested territory of Texas, all that stands in his way is a small band of heroes, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett and their trusty men who are led by the inexperienced William Travis. They must buy time in order for General Sam Houston to get an army together in which to crush Santa Anna's imposing forces.

There really is no simpler way of putting it other than to say that The Alamo is an overlong misfire. Various cuts have been made to try and create an epic classic out of what was actually filmed, but neither of the cuts can succeed in making it the flowing genre piece it could have been. John Wayne directs and clearly cared about the project (with his own cash invested that was to be expected), but rumours have persisted that Cliff Lyons had to take up directing duties later in the picture, it's not hard to see why if that was the case, but various sources do poo poo this rumour, and is mostly believed to be Wayne's own work throughout the film. Wayne (having learnt from his mentor John Ford) had a great vision for the picture, and the scope is rather impressive, the recreation of The Alamo building in particular is first rate, whilst the formations of Santa Anna's armies finally rouse the picture out of its slumber.

However, the high points in the picture are few and far between, the acting leaves a lot to be desired, with Wayne himself unable to let the Crockett character be anything other than the John Wayne show. Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie steadily holds his own and manages to eek out a bit of bravado interplay with Wayne and Laurence Harvey (William Travers), but outside of that there is not much to write home about. The final third just about saves the film from being a stinker, with the Academy Award for best sound richly deserved, but sadly The Alamo remains to this day a plodding dinosaur that bores when it really should be igniting the spirit. 5/10"

It only had a limited release, so most people saw it as a cable release movie.  From the opening title crawl and showing the lead actors in their roles juxtaposed with pictures of the actual historical figures, it had me hook.

It is based on the novel The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara. It is one of the first books on the Civil War I read, based on a recommendation by a coworker. I have read dozens and dozens of books on the topic since then, and it is still one of my favorites. Considering that it is a fairly short book, the fact that the movie is over four hours long tells you that a lot more research was done.

I can’t speak to how the actors did with the various southern accents, but I thought it was a strong cast, right down to the lesser roles. I have heard they utilized Civil War re-enactors in the filming, a good source of extras who were familiar with the time period and brought their own period clothing!

Of course it didn’t hurt my feelings that one of the leads: Jeff Daniels, plays Joshua Chamberlain, who hails from my home state of Maine and who lived a remarkable life: college professor, Volunteer army lieutenant who rose to become a general and Medal of Honor recipient, Governor of Maine - and more. Apparently, thanks to this movie, the most popular spot for tourists at the Gettysburg National Battlefield is where the 20th Maine and Chamberlain fought. As a side note, another offshoot of the story behind Chamberlain and the 20th Maine’s exploits is the song Dixieland by Steve Earle. Whenever I hear the song I want to watch the movie, and vice versa.

Anyway, of course it is a war movie, and I do not normally like war flicks, but this one is much more than that. You can pretend it is a mini-series and watch it in two or three sittings if that makes it easier. Some people say it lets the southerners off the hook politically, but there is a speech about race relations by Chamberlain that addresses the race issue, I believe, and provides balance.

Well, I could go on and on, but I will spare you. Besides, there is this song I have a hankering to listen to right now. || _**The Civil War's Turning Point Battle**_

""Gettysburg"" (1993) has a lot going for it: an all-star cast, including Tom Berenger (Longstreat), Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain) and Sam Elliott (Buford); great authentic Gettysburg locations; good battle scenes; a commitment to historical accuracy; and thousands upon thousands of Civil War reenactors.

Part I is highlighted by Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top and his bold bayonet charge while Part II ends with the South's infamous Pickett's Charge. Both of these sequences are great and they give the viewer a good feel of what it must have really been like, which is one of the reasons I enjoy seeing historical films. Since both halves run the length of a normal movie, I strongly suggest splitting your viewing experiencing into two segments; it’s just too much to digest in one sitting.

There's a lot to respect about ""Gettysburg."" It's a story about how war was fought in the 19th century and the men who engaged in it, pure and simple. There are no female cast members, no forced romances. The creators did an admirable job of taking a 3-day battle, plus its set-up, and condensing it into an informative and fairly compelling long movie. 

One aspect I liked was seeing the officers and soldiers pray while standing in line right before significant engagements. Yeah, it's hard to be an atheist when you're about to walk straight into friggin' cannon fire where bodies are literally blown to pieces. I also appreciated the subtle Civil War trivia thrown in, like how the soldiers had to march across the American landscape from one battle to another, carrying heavy rifles in the heat of the summer, and how the Confederates didn’t have enough boots for their soldiers. Meanwhile the postscripts about all the main characters are informative and appreciated. 

Unfortunately the movie’s bloated, sappy and sometimes lethargic. While the score is mostly good, sometimes great, there are some annoyingly ""heroic"" or melodramatic pieces. General Armistead’s incessant blathering about his bromance with a general on the other side needed toned down a notch. Still, if I concentrate to pay attention to the dialogue and non-action events in the film, I get a lot out of it. In other words, if you're braced for its shortcomings it's worth checking out. But don't expect something great, like ""Glory"" (1989) or the wrongly maligned prequel “Gods and Generals” (2003). 

The battle of Gettysburg took place July 1-3, 1863 and was a huge victory for the North, the turning point of the war, along with Grant's simultaneous siege of Vicksburg. After the failure of Pickett's Charge, General Lee and his troops retreated back to their own territory. The war would go on for almost two more years as the Confederates continued to put up an incredible courageous fight, but the odds were against them because the North had the numbers and resources, not to mention Ulysses S. Grant. Gettysburg and Vicksburg were the seeds of their impending doom.

General Meade congratulated his men for driving the Confederate invaders from the North's turf. But President Lincoln was upset because he wanted Meade to DESTROY Lee's army, not allow them to safely retreat back to their Southern sanctuary. Lincoln groaned: "" 'Drive the invader from our soil'? My God, is that all?"" 

Four months after the battle of Gettysburg, on November 19th, Lincoln came to the small town and gave his potent 'Gettysburg Address' to honor the fallen soldiers and motivate continued Northern commitment and victory. So many people died at Gettysburg they were STILL burying the dead (!).

The cut I saw runs 4 hours, 14 minutes, but there’s a director’s cut that is several minutes longer. The film was shot at Gettysburg & the Adams County region of Pennsylvania.

The Pledge is directed by Sean Penn and adapted to screenplay by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski from Friedrich Dürrenmatt's novel, ""The Promise"". It stars Jack Nicholson, Robin Wright Penn, Aaron Eckhart, Sam Shepard, Patricia Clarkson, Helen Mirren, Tom Noonan, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke, Dale Dickey, Vanessa Redgrave and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, and cinematography by Chris Menges.

Police chief Jerry Black (Nicholson) is literally on his last day before retitement. But during his leaving party news filters through that a young girl has been brutally murdered. Talking his chiefs into letting him tag along to the crime scene, Black ends up breaking the dredful news to the girl's parents. There he pledges to the mother that he will find her daughter's killer.

Dürrenmatt's source material has been mined a few times for other filmic ventures, where the best of the other bunch is ""Es geschah am hellichten Tag"" (""It Happened in Broad Daylight""). It is here, though, in Sean Penn's hands, that we get the version that got two thumbs up from the author, mostly because of the ending staying true to his work.

It should be noted from the off that this is not police procedural detective piece. This is a slow burn, moody and edgy picture, the kind that Penn excells at as an actor. Thankfully, in spite of it losing money at the box office, it shows Penn the perfect director for such material.

It obviously isn't a film for everyone, more so if not prepared for it being a picture about one man's tumbling emotional descent. As Jerry Black searches for the perpretrator of heinious crimes, he also is faced with a moral judgement call and a major affair of the heart.

The trick of the screnplay here is not in the red herrings and the little dangles of clues that appear to be on offer to Jerry, it's that we are never quite sure if Jerry is actually right in his belief of a child serial killer at work. Is it the product of a man so driven by the pledge he made, that he isn't thinking straight? Or worse losing his grip on sanity? The answer will only will out with the clinically daring finale. 

Lead actors Nicholson and Wright Penn turn in some of their finest work, both responding to Sean's probing of troubled souls in search of an exit. There's an array of quality support actors in small parts, which is a testament to the pull that working with Penn did appeal. The musical score is nervy and sits smartly with the ethereal tones that Menges brings via his photographic lenses.

The Pledge is a haunting and disturbing character study that refuses to cop out. It achieves its aims and wasn't going to pander to any crowd pleasing bums on seats tactics. A dark thriller for grown ups who have the patience for such a telling, and perhaps more crucially are prepared to have their emotions tested with the finale. 9/10"

I can't get enough of especially the films of which they collaborated, 'Foxy Brown' and this, both of which I consider up there with the 'Shaft' trilogy and 'Super Fly' as masterpieces of the 'urban action' genre of the 70's. She, just 24 when she made this, certainly was one of the most beautiful and exciting women ever put on celluloid, and while I also love both Hill's short film 'The Host' and 'Switchblade Sisters' (viewed on one DVD as part of Quentin Tarantino's 'Rolling Thunder' reissue series), here his pacing and filming are on an entirely different level altogether.

It's a shame for us cinephiles that he chose at such an early age, 42 and clearly in his filmmaking prime, to retire from the business to both write novels as well as explore meditation with his wife, but I'm thankful for the films he made. The soundtrack (and most particularly the killer title song) by one of my favourite jazz/funk singer/musicians of the period, Roy Ayers, is up there with Curtis Mayfield's for 'Super Fly' as essential listening for lovers of such music.

Say what you want about him as a filmmaker, but I for one am glad that Tarantino has revived interest in both the actress (casting her as the star of 'Jackie Brown') and the director (through his aforementioned reissue series). It is an under-recognized way that Tarantino has significantly contributed to contemporary American cinema of all sorts, and has helped these unsung heroes from prior generations, who would otherwise be neglected and ignored unjustly from contemporary cinephilic attention. || Has a brilliant Roy Ayers soundtrack, great costumes and a lot of good moments but is brought down overall by a few bad performances.

Released in 1993, ""Untamed Heart"" tells the story of Caroline (Marisa Tomei) who works the night shift at a Minneapolis diner. She's a cute and likable young woman but, for some reason, is unable to maintain the romantic interest of the guys she dates. The answer to her love problems turns out to be right under her nose in the form of the diner's quiet dishwasher/janitor, Adam (Christian Slater).

""Untamed Heart"" is a must for fans of Marisa Tomei and the romance between Caroline and Adam works, although their sexual union is premature IMHO, but real-time has to be condensed into a 102-minute film so I guess it can be overlooked.

What struck me most about this film, aside from Marisa, was the character of Adam. He's an outcast; he doesn't fit with the crowd; he's quiet and mysterious in a misfit type of way; he's an easy target for people to mock; he's content to adore Caroline from a distance; his love for her doesn't change as she keeps making mistakes trying to find someone to love; he secretly acts as her guardian angel and doesn't care about getting credit.

Why is Caroline attracted to such a person? Because ""opposites attract."" We're naturally attracted to people that have what we lack and vice versa. Caroline is open, talkative and comfortable with practically any social setting; Adam isn't. Adam is aloof, meditative and unconcerned about fitting in —  qualities Caroline lacks.

You'll see people like Adam in real life if you open your eyes. At a local restaurant I sometimes catch a glimpse of one of the kitchen workers, whether taking a smoke break outside or whatever. He's in his mid-30s, maybe older, obviously intelligent with a striking appearance, but he's quiet and aloof from the people around him, with an air of mystery. This is a person, like Adam in the film, who doesn't fit into society's mold. College doesn't work for him despite his intelligence, nor does a conventional job; he just does what he has to in order to live.

The film is very successful at bringing to life this type of outcast in Adam. I found it quite moving because I understand and can relate.

Not everything in the story works, however, which is why I knock off a star in my rating. For instance, it isn't even remotely believable that Adam would be able to secretly break into someone’s house and do what he does while the people are sleeping. Dumb. What were the writers thinking? 

The film was shot on location in NE Minneapolis.

I think my biggest problems with this are that I can't honestly appreciate Matthew McConaughey or Bridgette Wilson-Sampras despite the quality of their acting: it's like a really well made pie in a flavor you don't like.  As much as I like Jennifer Lopez as an actor, we start on the end of a movie I'd rather see with Bree Turner, and I feel like I would have rather seen Judy Greer in the lead, she seems about as Italian as Jennifer Lopez.

I understand when the meet-cute is a life-threatening situation where adrenaline causes chemical confusion, but this is sort of a head injury causes an almost ""love at first sight"" cliche, but mixed with an ""unavailable romance"" cliche.

The movie is amusingly hammy, poking fun at those madcap 60’s flicks. Connie Stevens is on hand, looking great at 48, along with several cameos of familiar faces, like Bob Denver from Gilligan’s Island.

Siskel & Ebert praised the movie on their show (the episode is available on Youtube). And, sure, it’s entertaining to a point, but I was disappointed. It’s just no where near as great as they made it out to be. Still, if you’re in the mood for an innocuous musical with a goofy beach milieu, give it a watch.

Undaunted, Foley, aided by old friend Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher) and two intrigued local detectives, starts to unravel the mystery.

Hey Axel you got a cigarette?

There was a time when Eddie Murphy ruled the world. After Trading Places had introduced us to his sharp comedic tongue, and 48 Hours had shown him to be a more than capable action character actor, Beverly Hills Cop fused the two together and propelled Murphy to super stardom. Directed by Martin Brest and produced by Messers Simpson & Bruckheimer, it's really no surprise that ""Hills Cop"" is shallow, simple (a fish out of water comedy standard) and utterly commercial. Yet with its gusto, humorous script (Daniel Petrie Jr) and neat plotting, it becomes a hugely entertaining film - led superbly by Murphy due to infectious comedy energy and superb knack for timing.

You're not going to fall for the banana in the tailpipe routine!

It's hard to believe that the likes of Sly Stallone and Al Pacino were first mooted for the role, so not as a comedy one imagines, but as it being a standard police action movie, but enter Murphy and it ended up as a fine blend of action and comedy. There's little digs at Beverly Hills and its smugness, a way of life that Foley, with his down on the streets toughness, can't comprehend, while opposing police methods also get a wry once over -  wonderfully threaded in the relationship between Foley, Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). 


Small gripes reside, such as Steven Berkoff's by the numbers villain being something of a let down and Ronny Cox is sadly playing filler time with an underwritten character. But this is about Murphy, the fabulous stunt work and the successful union of action and comedy. And hey! even Harold Faltermeyer's bobbing synth score, ""Axel F,"" has a nippiness that remains quintessentially 1980s. 8/10 || This is probably my favourite outing for a fresh-faced and wise-cracking Eddie Murphy. He (""Axel Foley"") is the cop from Detroit who finds himself embroiled in some criminal antics in the upper class and distinctly by-the-book LA suburb of Beverly Hills. Despite the serious reservations of ""Lt. Bogomil"" (Ronny Cox) he ends up working with two of his detectives ""Taggart"" (John Ashton) and ""Rosewood"" (Judge Reinhold) as they try to track down the murderer of a childhood friend from Detroit that, of course, soon has them knee-deep in a lucrative - and deadly - drugs operation. It's the unorthodox nature of Murphy's character and the paradox with the posh culture of his new surroundings that gives the star a chance to be exactly that here. The writing provides him with quick-fire dialogue and the two foils work well in being the butt of the gags and, as the relationships develop along fairly predictable lines, the whole thing marries the comedic, the slapstick and some pyrotechnics with just enough sophistication to keep it from being cringeworthy. Of course there's no doubt that the guys will get their man - a rather hammy Steven Berkoff, but the manner in which this is all pursued is funny and entertaining. Keep an eye to for the disdainful Stephen Elliott as ""Chief Hubbard"" whose disbelief in just what's going on under his nose raises a smile, as does Bronson Pinchot's ""Serge"". It's got quite a memorable soundtrack - even if I hated ""Axel F"", and is good fun!"

A new DA assistant (Barkin) arrives in town and zeroes-in on corruption in the force. While the head detective (Quaid) cozies up to her, they try to solve a curious mob-oriented slaying. Ned Beatty, John Goodman, Lisa Jane Persky and Ebbe Roe Smith are on hand as members in the agency. 

""The Big Easy"" (1987) has the office camaraderie of Burt Reynolds’ “Fuzz” from fourteen years prior meshed with the milieu and more serious tone of “Cat People,” Eastwood’s “Tightrope” and Gere’s “No Mercy,” the latter of which came out just months before this. “Cop Land” was obviously influenced by it a decade later. 

It’s rich with the ambiance of NOLA, including Cajun, zydeco, R&B, and gospel music in the soundtrack. Many praise Quaid’s thick Cajun accent while others view it as overdone. I side with the latter but, then, I tend not to care about accents in movies, so it’s all good (for me). It just seems Dennis’ head detective comes across too convivial, but this can be explained by the fact that Quaid later admitted to being coked-up during the shoot in which he was only sleeping one hour a night. Nevertheless, both Dennis and Ellen consider this the favorite of the many films they've made.

While it was overpraised at the time of release and I’d watch “Cat People” and “Cop Land” over it any day, it’s superior to “Fuzz” and certainly worth checking out for those interested. Aside from the amusing (and sometimes grisly) dramatics, not to mention Barkin’s beauty, I liked the insightful commentary on legalism: If you want to get technical about it, people break laws every day, like jaywalking. But what if you ARE the Law? Where do you draw the moral line? How much is too far? Where is the proverbial point of no return?

It runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in New Orleans.

Of course, this creates unforeseen problems. Courtney Gains plays his geek friend and Seth Green his little brother.    

This is better than some 80’s teen flicks (e.g. Molly Ringwald’s movies), but not as good as others (“Fast Times at Ridgemont High”). It’s arguably on par with “Just One of the Guys” and “Some Kind of Wonderful.” Unlike those films, however, it has a semi-campy vibe wherein the cast members often exaggerate their lines in an artificial way, which telegraphs that what’s happening isn’t real. 

If you can roll with this odd element, there’s a lot of good in “Can’t Buy Me Love” and the ending is genuinely moving. There are many serious/realistic scenes, like the notable airplane graveyard sequence. The two protagonists have good chemistry and their relationship arc is convincing. Tina Caspary (Barbara) and Darcy DeMoss (Patty) are serviceable on the fringe female front.          

THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 34 minutes and was shot in Tucson, Arizona. WRITER: Michael Swerdlick. 

GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10) || Whatever happens to your popularity, stay yourself, don't change to please others. 

Can't Buy Me Love is directed by Steve Rash and written by Michael Swerdlick. It stars Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson. Music is by Robert Folk and cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister.

Plot has Dempsey as nerdy outcast Ronald Miller, who fed up of not being popular pays Cindy Mancini (Peterson), the most popular girl in school, one thousand dollars to be his girlfriend.

The 1980s was awash with films of this ilk, the teen dramedy topped up by a big hearted message and a finale of punch the air worth. What it all comes down to is if the film can hold its head above water, not become too twee, and crucially have you smiling come the finale. As evidenced by its popularity among 80s cineastes of a certain age, Can't Buy Me Love delivers all that you expect from such fare.

The core theme is of course self acceptance, the attainment of such in amongst the scary world of teenage school years. This shines bright in spite of some rather unconvincing dialogue and contrived corny moments. Director Rash just about holds it together, ensuring that the charm of the lead actors holds weight for character engagement, even though for thematic depth the screenplay only skims over the surface.

The teenage dramedy would evolve considerably once the 80s was left behind, becoming more biting, daring and observational. Yet for those who lived and loved this type of film in the 80s, there's a lovely nostalgic glow to be gleaned from revisits to the likes of Can't Buy Me Love. Nothing wrong with that. 6.5/10"

Spielberg is one of a handful of directors that everyone acknowledges. Whether your interest lies with films or elsewhere, he is known to all for his eclectic filmography that tackles nearly every single genre available. The beauty of his directorial talents, is that he can manipulate any subject matter and transform its contents into an accessible piece of entertainment. From hard-hitting crime capers (‘The Sugarland Express’) to the depiction of African-Americans succumbing to racial/sexist abuse (‘The Color Purple’). He has the ornate ability to disassemble history and shape the remnants into his Hollywood mould. But at what cost?

Does Spielberg’s contagious requirement for accessibility downplay the severity of its subject matter? Well, Empire of the Sun may just be the most perfect example to answer the aforementioned question. It illustrates my eternal adoration for the man as an auteur, as well as his damned tendencies that bring down his historical endeavours. A young British boy living with his wealthy family in war-torn Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents where he is soon retained as a prisoner of war in an internment camp.

An epic adaptation of Ballard’s semi-autobiographical novel, that heavily relied on a fictitious narrative to convey his own vivid memories of World War Two. A story of three vital themes that power both the characters and the central narrative. Opulence, faith and humanity. Spielberg commences the first act in a worrying light of unnecessary affluence, following a white family with an abundance of possessional wealth traversing the segregated streets of Shanghai embattled by poverty. The bitter aftertaste of supremacy as “peasants” desperately fight for survival. Whilst it may harken to real events, they make for unlikeable characters due to their careless perception in the environment they are enshrouded in. The father and mother are non-characters, merely acting as fuel for Jim’s coming-of-age journey, and Spielberg paid far less attention to the surrounding chaos which consequently diminished the severity of the war’s impact. It can be argued that the entire story, including the first act, is told through Jim’s perspective. But the naive ignorance to represent the lives that were truly affected was extremely profound.

Then Jim, in the crowded streets of Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents. Mugged, abandoned and lost. His opulent lifestyle relinquished from his selflessness. Gradually, Spielberg constructs an epic that conveys the loss of innocence. This once fragile young boy, unbeknown to the horrors of the world, now utilising his intuition to survive the brutality of war independently. Spielberg definitely downplayed the brutalism of conflict, and instead opted for an endearing focus on Jim’s abrupt development from a timid boy to unsung hero. Unsurprisingly, it worked. Spielberg’s screenplay presents Jim with a plethora of challenges that tests the will of humanity in its entirety. From attempting to escape the internment camp to resuscitating the recently deceased. Jim encompasses every notion of humanity during this heightened time, naturally making him relatable. His actions slowly further his development into adulthood in such a short space of time, with much gratification aimed at Spielberg’s masterful attention to characterisation.

Initially proclaimed as an atheist, Jim experiences metaphysical moments believed to be acts of faith, likening him to a deity of some kind. “Giving life” for a brief moment to the recently passed, which was an ounce of blood pumped to the brain. Witnessing a soul be released into heaven, however counteracted by the infamous Nagasaki atomic bomb. These “acts” grant Jim the power of self-belief, fully realising his potential as the “hero” of optimism.

There’s nothing more optimistic and endearing though than watching a juvenile Christian Bale steal the entire film. Malkovich and Havers ground the enthusiasm of Bale’s performance, yet his commanding presence at such a young age cements him as a talent to behold. Tender moments were handled with delicacy, whilst the louder moments fused with his boisterous personality. Quite simply, one of the best young performances I’ve seen. Williams’ signature score, ever accompanying Spielberg’s work, elevated the grandeur of the spectacular production design yet somewhat exhumed family-friendly vibes commonly found in his previous work. Admittedly that’s a personal conflict of my own, but again did diminish the more powerful scenes. Jim’s fascination with aircraft wasn’t fully realised and felt like an afterthought to coincide with the Japanese “friend” in the final act, although not a substantial detriment to the overall story.

In the blazing heat of war camps, Empire of the Sun shines as an epic that showcases the very reason for my Spielberg idolisation and his cursed ability to lessen the severity of history. Regardless, you’ll laugh, gasp and cry during this coming-of-age tale, and that’s the true beauty of this auteur’s timeless work. || _**Even great people have a dud on occasion**_

A British boy (Christian Bale) living with his wealthy parents in Shanghai is separated from them when Japanese forces invade in the early years of WW2. He then has to survive the war in a POW camp. John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, Nigel Havers and Joe Pantoliano play fellow prisoners.	 

Based on J.G. Ballard’s semi-autobiographical novel, “Empire of the Sun” (1987) was Steven Spielberg’s first venture into ‘meaningful’ filmmaking. It’s not without historical interest. For instance, the beginning situation in China is compelling, highlighted by a potent ‘slap’ scene that wakes the pompous kid up to reality. 

From there, though, the movie becomes a tedious prison camp flick with too many ambiguities and drawn-out scenes. Bale does an admirable job in a challenging role, especially considering his age, but IMHO he overdoes it and so the boy comes off hyperactive and annoying. Check out the low-key indie “I Am David” (2003) for a more effective take on similar material.             

The film runs 2 hours, 33 minutes and was shot in China, England and Spain (you can fairly easily figure out which parts were shot where).

Havoc ensues.  

This is a cult classic movie and the famous director’s first full-length feature. It only cost $350,000 to make and was shot in 1979, as well as the first weeks of 1980. Bruce Campbell makes for a quality protagonist and there’s a good trio of girl-next-door types (Ellen Sandweiss, Theresa Tilly and Betsy Baker), but Raimi only really takes advantage of these feminine resources with Sandweiss as Cheryl. 

The first half of the movie is great, which involves the five students’ arrival to the cabin and the initial possession/attack sequences. It’s atmospheric, well executed and compelling. The second half, however, is redundant. While each new attack ups the ante it’s basically more of the same in the same setting (the cabin). Don’t get me wrong, the second half is effective chaotic & chilling horror with loads of cartoony gore, but it’s too one-dimensional with no meaty subtext to chew on. It’s just people being attacked by hideous creatures, one after the other. 

This simplistic approach CAN work, as witnessed by 1972's ""Gargoyles,"" but in that movie the initial gargoyle attacks led to a captivating confrontation in their hellish cave complex in the last act. The latter half of ""The Evil Dead,"" by contrast, is just one attack after another in the same general setting. But the latter half of “The Evil Dead” is just one attack after another in the same general setting. This might work for 11-14 year-olds who are wowed by cartoonish gore and constant diabolic thrills, but it doesn’t work for more mature people who require some element of mindfood or, at least, variation to keep interested. Another negative is the final gory sequence which is decidedly low-budget and cartoony, albeit creatively and expertly done on a film student level. 

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 25 minutes and was shot in Morristown, Tennessee, with additional work done in Michigan.            

GRADE: B-/C+ || Decent watch at best, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend unless you just love classic gore practical effects.

I'm honestly confused why this was such a bit hit at the time.  Maybe it was just part of the trends, maybe the 1980s was just when people wanted to see horrific gore, and there was a lack of options.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's bad.  I don't feel like we get a proper explanation of what the hell is happening, so no expectations is really built to be subverted, but I certainly wouldn't want this movie to explain anymore than it did.

I'm honestly not sure exactly what to say about it: it's a ""don't mess with dark forces you can't possibly understand"" trope with a bunch of blood, gore, and weirdly designed possession.

Part of what I enjoy about (even paranormal) survival situations like this is the idea that their is / was a way out of it, if the characters can figure it out.  This is more of just someone blew up a dam, and now we're going to die from a flood.

I just feel like this movie could have been a lot more, and I'm not going to remember this, but I had a good enough time watching it. || The last time I watched this film, I was about ten years old. So, this is essentially a new viewing. I though the first twenty or so minutes were quite slow. Poor acting and dialogue led me to believe this was going to be another run of the mill 80's horror movie. But, once that action is established, it does not let up, with the next hour filled with nonstop thrills, leaving very little room to breathe. It was exhilarating with some fantastic tension, camera work, and special effects that had the hairs on the back of my neck standing straight up. It is incredible what Raimi was able to do with such a small budget. The story and dialogue leave some to be desired, but everything else is truly amazing. This is truly worth all of the praise it gets.

In the late 60s, a cynical Korean vet (James Caan) would rather be training soldiers for Vietnam in Georgia, but instead he’s stuck at Arlington National Cemetery playing what he calls “toy soldier” with his colleagues (James Earl Jones, etc.). When an old buddy’s gung-ho son shows up (D.B. Sweeney), he settles for trying to keep him from becoming another statistic in The ’Nam. Anjelica Huston plays his potential girlfriend and Mary Stuart Masterson the greenhorn’s girl.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola based on the 1983 novel, ""Gardens of Stone"" (1987) is a worthy companion piece to all those Vietnam War flicks of the 70s-90s as it chronicles what was happening on the home front. It’s a war drama, but not a war action film, yet not a dull, lifeless drama (more on this in a moment).

Caan and Jones have good chemistry as old Army buds and Sweeney works well as the “new kid” (he looks like a young Ben Affleck when he broke out ten years later). Meanwhile Mary Stuart Masterson was never more beautiful. 

In ways the movie’s reminiscent of Eastwood's ""Heartbreak Ridge"" (1986) with its spunkiness and a smidgen of comedy (which I wasn’t anticipating), although don’t expect the cartoonish character of Cpl. Stitch Jones (Mario Van Peebles). In other words, the proceedings aren’t all dour. Yet there are heavy, moving parts given the topic. Coppola contrasts the beginning scene and ending scene. They’re the same sequence, but it holds more weight the second time around for reasons you’ll discover.

I was entertained, amused and moved. It’s a necessary piece of the puzzle in understanding the era of the Vietnam War. While it’s not on the level of greatness of Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” (1979) or “Forrest Gump” (1994), it’s still a solid Coppola movie with a little sloppiness here and there. For instance, the war games episode could’ve been done more coherently and entertainingly, as was done in “The Dirty Dozen” (1967). But time means money in cinema and they had a deadline.

I've heard people complain about how this or that wasn't technically accurate or realistic, but filmmakers aren't interested in being 100% true-to-life. If they were, no one would go see their flicks. Let me put it this way, movies are real-life with the boring parts taken out, as well as exaggerations thrown in. Take ""Platoon"" (1986), for example. Do ya really think everything that took place in that movie happened to _ONE_ platoon in real life? Of course not. Oliver Stone simply took many different highlights of the 'Nam experience and condensed them into one 2-hour tale of a single platoon.      

The notable cast also includes the likes of Dean Stockwell, Sam Bottoms, Larry Fishburne, Dick Anthony Williams and Elias Koteas. Bottoms and Fishburne of course worked previously with Coppola on “Apocalypse Now.” 

Before shooting commenced, Francis’ 23 year-old son, Gian-Carlo Coppola, was tragically killed in a speedboat accident in May, 1986. The reckless driver of the boat was Griffin O'Neal (Ryan’s son), who was slated to play the role given to Elias Koteas.  

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot at Fort Myer & Arlington National Cemetery and nearby Washington DC.

Released just a year after Jon Cryer had become popular due to his turn as Duckie in John Hughes' Pretty In Pink-Hiding Out finds Cryer attempting to be leading man potential.

When we first meet Cryer's Andrew Morenski, he's a successful business man with a beard you could lose a badger in. But we know it's a youthful Jon Cryer (he was 21 at the time of making the film but looking every inch like a teenager), so it's kind of a murky start from which to hopefully entice the viewer fully into the premise. Yet it all quickly turns around as Morenski hits High School. Hair dyed two colours and dressed like some rockabilly rebel, this is where Cryer steps into his element.

From here on in, save for the inevitable gun buffoonery show down at the end, the film is a delightful comedy about the perils of school. Love, rivals, school politics and witch like teachers all come in for a shiny going over in Bob Giraldi's film. Some of it's twee, and some of it is even morally questionable, but it wears its comedy and romantic heart on its sleeves. Hell the film even has something to say about the truth and how it's taught in schools (look out for a great sequence as Andrew/Max calls into question the teachers teaching of President Nixon). So it's not all fluff for sure. But it's the fluff that drives the film to its conclusion, and if that fluff chiefly is decent enough to have met the viewers expectations?

For me it most certainly did, I only asked one thing from this film, and that was for it to give me some chuckles and to leave me smiling come the end. It did both, so maybe, just maybe, you missed this in the late 80s and are now stuck for some 80s veneer comedy with a zippy 80s soundtrack. If so? This might just be the ticket for you. 7/10"

The fish! Anyway, it all centres around the young ""Bill"" (Sebastian Rice-Edwards) who finds himself - along with mother ""Grace"" (Sarah Miles) and elder sister ""Susie"" (Geraldine Muir) caught up in London at the start of WWII. His father (David Hayman) is soon away fighting and his mother refuses to be parted from her children so they stay and muddle through the bombs and the mayhem, the death and the disaster - all whilst, though the eyes of this bold and unafraid child, we see an opportunity for mischief and joy. This is especially apparent when the school of their rather puritanical/Dickensian headmaster (Gerald James) is blown to smithereens. As he and his sister get a bit older, their hormones also start to kick in a little and the joys of illicit sex (or is it true love?) for her and bemusement - and a bit of fibbing - for him are enjoyable to watch. Then they head to their grandfather ""George"" (the scene-stealing Ian Bannen) who keeps a large house and though outwardly quite strict, is actually a wonderful tonic for his family and for the viewer watching. The narrative doesn't shy away from the ghastliness of war, but it contextualises it engagingly by using the innocence of the youngsters to illustrate that even amidst the rubble there is fun to be had in their hideouts, straight out of an Enid Blyton story. Miles is strong here as the mother who struggles to bring up her children amongst all this carnage, whilst also remaining keen to keep her family together for the spirit-lifting occasional visits from dad. The thing is genuinely funny at times, too - you'll see what I mean about an act of God and the fish, but he's also in a gang that give out ranking points depending on which swear words you know - the ""f"" word being the ultimate emergency alarm call. The sterling and charming effort from Rice-Edwards parallels a little with Christian Bale's in ""Empire of the Sun"" that was also made in 1987 and also looks ar war from a child's perspective. This kind of film is the kind the British do well - the stiff upper lip stuff, sure, but also the portrayal of a stoicism, humour and strength of character (not always obvious!) and John Boorman writes and directs with skill and empathy as we progress. If you can, see it in a cinema - the cinematography is great at subtly conveying the wreckage and the pastoral with equal eloquence and I did enjoy this."

Innerspace is directed by Joe Dante and written by Jeffrey Boam and Chip Proser. It stars Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, Meg Ryan and Kevin McCarthy. Music is by
Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Andrew Laszlo.

A hapless hypochondriac store clerk battles to save the life of the man who, miniaturized in a secret experiment, was accidentally injected into him. 

The premise is of course absurd, but everyone involved knows this and proceed to entertain with a mixture of thrills, spills and a good old fashioned good versus bad value. Narrative is based around the race against time thematic as miniaturised Tuck Pendleton (Quaid) fights from within the body of Jack Putter (Short). He has to keep Jack out the hands of crooks who are after the secrets of the miniaturisation process, whilst simultaneously being on a clock before he runs out of air - or fall prey to Jack's anti-bodies system etc.

Dante strings together some terrific set pieces, while the realisation of the inside of the human body is smartly staged. Cast are on hugely engaging form, with the central relationship between Quaid and Short a pure joy and mined for constant laugh and peril tactics. The dual aspect is niftily handled by Dante and his crew, with the battle within Jack's body running concurrently with Jack's battles out in the real world.

What wonderful sci-fi froth this is, as Dante has a blast of a time with the effects tools to hand to take the concept of Fantastic Voyage and make a top line action comedy adventure. Great soundtrack too! 8/10 || **A funny, effective and familiar comedy that deserves to be brought back from obscurity.**

This is one of those “no bones” comedies that we can watch with the whole family without any fear of embarrassing or inappropriate scenes for kids or deeply critical grandparents. It's a film from the 80s, quite dated, but that's not a problem for people like me, who actually like old films.

The story is very good and revolves around an experiment that goes wrong and involves the miniaturization of a ship with a human occupant, which should be introduced into a laboratory rabbit: when the laboratory is robbed by bandits who want to steal that technology, one of the scientists escapes and ends up injecting the liquid containing the ship into the body of an inadvertent citizen. What happens next is quite hilarious.

Dennis Quaid does a decent job as the ship's pilot, a daring combat aviator who volunteers for the experiment. I thought that the actor doesn't leave his comfort zone, he doesn't have a complicated task, and he just brags. Better than him, Martin Short shone as the fearful and shy man who, by chance, was dragged into that mess after being injected against his will. The actor managed to give the character an interesting evolutionary arc, where the character gradually gains more confidence and an adventurous spirit. Meg Ryan has the worst material: she just needs to be attractive and look scared.

Joe Dante deserves a shoutout for the work he did on this film. He's not a director I know very well, but I think this film is in line with what he likes to do most. The film may not be the most scientifically rigorous in the world (never, I believe, has the scientific community thought of anything similar to miniaturizing objects or people), but it makes up for it with humor and an unpretentious and good-natured spirit. The effects team did an excellent job, whether in the moments in which the ship is miniaturized or in the filming inside the human organism, where the realism is well achieved."

Somehow, the shark knew that Michael Caine was flying the plane to the Bahamas and simply had to follow his idol. 

Either that or he simply wanted Caine dead in retaliation for _Beyond The Poseidon Adventure_.

This film is well made and the performances are pretty good but the whole thing is silly beyond repair. Was the shark psychic? Was Ellen Brody psychic? Was the log that Sean Brody was clinging onto whilst being eaten psychic? Who cares?

Perhaps the shark in the Bahamas was a different shark? Perhaps the Brody's had a shark for each day of the week? Perhaps the whole thing was a dream - surely the most logical explanation.  However, I do not want to bail out the film makers on this one.

Lorraine Gary, meanwhile, spearheads an average support cast. Speaking of whom, I did find their dialogue and interactions to be very unnatural and forced.

5/10. There are many, many worse films out there though. || Michael Caine must have needed another new swimming pool, otherwise what could have possessed him to turn up for this terribly poor sequel. We all start off with ""Deputy Sean Brady"" (Mitchell Anderson) sent to clear up some seaborne blockage before the fishing boats return. Needless to say, he encounters the distant cousin of his late father's menacing pal and is soon little more than tooth pickings. This hastens the arrival of the pretty but extremely bland Lance Guest as older brother ""Michael"" and guess what, the shark seems to have him on his sonar, too. Despite the fairly charismatic efforts of Caine, this whole thing is just nonsense from start to finish, made worse by Lorraine Gary's serious over-acting. There are just no scares. Even the legendary music has been mucked about with to ensure all trace of menace has been removed as surely as if by the (largely mechanical) shark itself. This is also a creature that seems to fancy it is in a ""Tarzan"" film, judging by it's fearful roaring. Either that, or maybe it is fed up because it has too much Brady stuck in it's incisors? To be fair, there is some fine underwater photography and I've never seen a shark eat a plane before - even one made of wafer biscuits, but sadly though nowhere near as bad as ""Jaws 3"" (1983), this is a sad end to the franchise that ought never to have been made."

James Spader plays a smug high society dealer. 
 
This is the furthest thing from typical 80’s youth flicks, like “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” “The Karate Kid,” “Valley Girl,” “Footloose” and “Can’t Buy Me Love” (where there’s, admittedly, a lot of range). “Less than Zero” has the epic, artsy style of Francis Ford Coppola films like “The Outsiders” and “Rumble Fish” (both from 1983) meshed with the chic melancholy of “Poison Ivy” (1992). 

My main issue is that it takes too long to get absorbed into the characters and their story. The filmmaking is gorgeous, however, which is ironic because this is a really downbeat movie. Gertz is fine, but she never did anything for me, while McCarthy is serviceable as the main protagonist, yet rather bland in a goody-goody way. Both Downey Jr. and Spader, however, de-shine in their roles (in a good way). If you favor arty, glum movies you might like this better than me, but it’s nowhere near as effective as “Poison Ivy,” a similar artsy, gloomy flick.

After a mother and two sons move from Phoenix to coastal town in Northern California, the older son (Jason Patric) gets involved with a gang led by a sinister guy (Kiefer Sutherland) while the younger son (Corey Haim) hangs out with two geeky vampire hunters (Corey Feldman & Jamison Newlander). Meanwhile the mother (Dianne Wiest) starts dating a shop owner (Edward Herrmann). Jami Gertz in on hand as the sole young female.

Released in 1987, ""The Lost Boys"" is a stylish and hip vampire flick that expertly meshes horror and humor. I usually don't like horror-comedies, but this one works well. The horror is pretty horrifying (in a fun way) while the comedy is consistently amusing. The coastal California locations are superb. However, the excellent train trestle sequence was shot in Alabama (see below).

I generally don't like 80's new wave pop rock, but the soundtrack is enjoyable, particularly the creative Lost Boys Theme, ""Cry Little Sister"" by Gerard Mcmann (with a catchy chorus sung by children). ""Lost in the Shadows"" by Lou Gramm is good as well. INXS, Roger Daltry and Echo and The Bunnymen also have songs on the soundtrack, the latter group doing a mid-80's version of The Doors' ""People Are Strange,"" which is very close to the original song and actually sounds like its Jim Morrison singing. The sax-playing beefcake sequence features one-hit wonder Tim Cappello playing ""I Still Believe.""

Speaking of beefcake, this zeroes in on my problem with this flick: There are multiple lost boys, but only one lost girl. Although Gertz is good-looking, she's always wearing a long skirt and so we never get a good look at her beyond her face (not talkin' 'bout nudity), with the exception of a campfire sex scene that doesn't work because it's premature and overall lame. Needless to say, a mid-80s horror flick without adequate females is scandalous. Director Joel Schumacher needed to take notes from the six Friday the 13th movies that had been released by the time ""The Lost Boys"" was shot. Oh, wait, Schumacher is, um, nevermind.

While the movie was largely shot in Santa Cruz, California, the vampire cave entrance was 350 miles south at Rancho Palos Verdes whereas the train trestle sequence was shot in Bayou Canot, Mobile, Alabama. The boys were able to jump into the underlying fog because the river was only 12-15 feet below, although the movie gives the impression that they were way higher up. Interior shooting was done in the studio at Burbank.

It's short 'n' sweet at 1 hour, 37 minutes.

Mannequin is either a sweet affectionate nostalgia movie – or an empty vacuous experience that fronts the bad side of 1980s American film making? Of all the teen comedies and brat packer pictures that flooded the decade, Mannequin appears to be the one that has no in between fan base, you either love it for what it is, or despise it and everything it stands for.

So how do you review something like that? I mean if you have seen it already and are reading this, you don’t need any guidance from me. Your minds are already made up, if you have not seen it and have any interest in the 1980s strand of such fare, then give it a go. It’s hardly an abomination, while for fans of Kim Cattrall and Andrew McCarthy it has to be worth a watch to see them try to cope with such under written lead characters.

It’s frothy and cheerful, but yes, devoid of substance, while one stereotype coupled with James Spader’s worst performance hardly help matters these days. Soundtracking is decent enough, led by power pop ballad Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now sung by Starship, while the costuming is garishly period.

Not to be taken seriously, obviously, and it has flaws galore, but it does have fans. Who knows, you may become one as well? Or you may want to stick sharp implements in your eyes instead? Roll the dice and take the chance. 5/10 || <em>'Mannequin'</em> is pure cheese and very silly, but I can't deny it's a nice piece of light entertainment; it's cute, in its own way, too. Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall both fit their respective roles well, so does everyone else on the cast; Meshach Taylor is the standout of the rest.

There really isn't much more to say. It's a simple movie and I simply enjoyed it. Oh, and ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" is a banger. || After an altercation with a department store sign, the young “Jonathan” (Andrew McCarthy) saves the day and gets himself a job from it’s owner (Estelle Getty). This is much to the chagrin of the shop’s boss “Richards” (James Spader) especially when he starts to make a great impression on the public with his window displays. For that skill, he must thank an ancient Egyptian who has materialised several thousand years after having had a row with her mother in an Edfu temple. She (Kim Cattrall) is a lively and bubbly lass, but she is only animate when they are alone. Otherwise, well she’s the mannequin. What they don’t know is that “Richards” is a duplicitous son-of-gun and is in league with a rival store owner to force them out of business and pick up the place for ten cents on the dollar. Can his window-dressing generate enough new business to save the place before his secret is discovered, or before he is carted off to the asylum for his fetishist behaviour with a life sized plastic doll? McCarthy was probably my favourite of the “Brat Pack” and he brings a cheeky enthusiasm to this rather flat and predicable, almost slapstick, comedy that sees him and Cattrall gel quite amiably. Spader, on the other hand, is just plain terrible and but for a few typically feisty appearances from Getty, so is just about everyone else in this cheesy rom-com. It’s only really memorable for the “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” closing theme from “Starship” and for a scene with some furs in the shop window but that’s about the height of it. The originality and popularity of this genre was very much on the wain by now, and this is probably the most throwaway of all of them, but if you are of a certain age it still raises a nostalgic smile.

This was an epic classic. And it had a young Courtney Cox! || Masters of the Universe, at least the cartoon and toys, were one of the reasons I am so happy I had a childhood in the 80s... along with GI Joe and Star Wars, they were some of the most defining things of 80s childhood play.

And then this came out and we all felt a little cheated that we had a knock-off Orco, but totally excited that we had a movie we could see on the big screen. And we were young enough to not see how low the budget was.

But, man, Frank Langella really sold his role didn't he? He brought his A-Game to this and knocked it out of the park.

And Chelsea Field deserved better roles, she's never been bad in any of her films, even this low budget fair.

But, watching it as an adult... it's a lot more B-Movie than it was when I was a kid, and the nostalgia and, well, Langella, are all that's really carrying it. But it's still fun. It still entertains, and is still all that matters. || **The glorious ""greasy sci-fi"" of the 80s: who doesn't miss the days when a rough rubber mask was a good idea in a movie?**

I'm not really a comic connoisseur. It was only when I read about this film that I realized that the characters had been taken from that literary universe and from a line of action toys created by the American company Mattel. This is something that helped me to understand the sheer confusion and goofiness of this film, which I think only toy fans will truly appreciate.

The best thing about this movie is the cast. There are some very respectable actors here, and their commitment and talent is remarkable, raising the quality of a cheesy movie quite a bit. Frank Langella's involvement is particularly good. He gave life to the great villain, a being called Skeletor, who looks like Darth Vader in the day he decided to go to Halloween dressed as Death. The character himself isn't impressive, he's a huge cliché without any intimidation ability, but Langella is really enjoying and having fun with this work. On the opposite side is Dolph Lundgren, a herculean and apparently invulnerable young man who came out of the world of combat sports, who doesn't know how to play and has the dramatic qualities of an avocado, but who manages to respond to what is asked of the character. Meg Foster, the proud owner of one of the most beautiful pairs of eyes of her time, has a charisma of her own and does a very good work.

But let's be honest, is anyone going to see a movie just for the cast? I do not think so. It's a good argument, but it doesn't take anyone to the theatre by itself. Does the movie have anything else? Do you have qualities? Is it really worth it? There are audiences for all types of cinema, including kitsch, trash and B cinema. The proof of this is the success of some films that would never convince a person with the least amount of good taste. Therefore, I believe that lovers of “oily sci-fi” will be delighted with this magnificent piece of cheese with a very characteristic taste of the 80s.

In the San Francisco area, five girls in 6th Grade reject a boy’s polite offer to dance with one of them falsely accusing him of assaulting her. Thirteen years later, when they’re all about 25 years-old, the women start receiving macabre valentines before their gruesome deaths. Who’s killing them and why?

""Valentine"" (2001) was made by the director of “Urban Legend” (1998), which gives you an idea of what to expect. Like “Urban Legend” and the overrated “Scream” (1996), there’s a wink of parody, but it’s done better and is actually amusing, not to mention disappears by the second half. 

Unlike those flicks, “Valentine” wasn’t successful at the box office, but I like it better. Sure, it’s a standard slasher with the tropes thereof, but I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It’s similar in tone to “April Fool’s Day” (2008), just superior. 

The notable female cast includes: Marley Shelton (Kate), Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy), Katherine Heigl (Shelley), Jessica Cauffiel (Lily), Denise Richards (Paige) and Hedy Burress (Ruthie). On the other side of the gender spectrum there’s David Boreanaz (Adam), Fulvio Cecere (Detective Vaugn) and Daniel Cosgrove (Campbell).    

The rockin’ soundtrack is good, featuring acts popular at the turn-of-the-century, like Rob Zombie, Disturbed, Linkin Park, Deftones and so forth.	 

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Riverview Hospital in nearby Coquitlam.

Then, something entirely unexpected occurs that causes the two to refocus their relationship in the face of betrayal and disappointment - and well.... What helps this film stand out are the performances from both Tony Leung (""Chow Mo-wan"") and the gorgeous Maggie Cheung (""Mrs. Chan"") - it's a love story, and it burns intensely - but not physically - as their story subsumes both themselves and the audience. The film looks marvellous, is paced stylishly and uses quite a bit of Nat King Cole to set and keep the mood atmospheric, romantic and interesting. The photography offers us lingering close ups, we get a sense of them falling in love as if we, too, were undergoing the same experience and that all adds to the richness of the story.

Having read the books before I watched the movies, that actually does sort of track, as the first two books were better than the third. Even so, I actually think _Hannibal_ does the worst job of adapting the source material too. Looks pretty good and there's quite the cast list (although I don't think many of them are exactly giving career-defining performances here), Julianne Moore is fine as Clarice Starling (although not as good as Jodie Foster), and the story isn't **bad**, but if I'm being honest, I typically give this one a skip whenever I'm revisiting the Lecter mythos. 

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || As sequals go, this isn't a bad one - but somehow we are a bit more sanitised to the evil of Sir Anthony Hopkins' ""Hannibal Lecter"" in this; and Julianne Moore doesn't quite have the intensity of Jodie Foster as FBI agent ""Clarice"". The story is also a bit too contrived: Millionaire Gary Oldman (""Verger"") tries to use ""Clarice"" to lure, for motives of revenge, ""Lecter"" out from his secret existence as a museum curator in Florence. Once she discovers where he is, she alerts the carabinieri to keep an eye on him; one of whom quite fancies the reward so tries to take matters into his own hands... Hopkins returns to the US with only one aim in mind, and a cunning game of cerebral chess ensues. It comes across as more of a compendium of short stories rather than as a flowing narrative; there is still plenty of gruesomeness, but without the subtlety - the script isn't at all sophisticated; and though there is plenty of classical music trying to replicate some of the class of ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) it just doesn't quite work. It's a good enough effort, but just lacks that je ne sais quoi."

This movie is a lot of trash, fun trash, but trash none the less.  It makes sense that these actors would band together to do a comedic project, but I can't imagine why they did an ""idiot boys club"" trope with a ""gay as comedy"" twist.

I'm not a fan of Amanda Peet (but do watch ""A Lot Like Love"" and ""Brockmire"", oddly both baseball subjects), but she is the best actor in this by about a factor of 10.  She plays a highly intellectual character that just doesn't fit in the same world as these other characters (most likely by design), and even manages to do some action sequences with other people involved without them also doing the action sequences.

While I like Jason Biggs, Amanda Detmer, and R. Lee Ermey, I'm not a Steve Zahn fan, and this is not Jack Black's best work.  Being as the majority of the movie is the latter and Amanda Peet, there is a lot of ""this is kind of annoying"" as opposed to ""this is kind of funny"".

The structural writing is actually good, but the premise and the comedic writing is ludicrous, and it is pretty hit or miss.

I can't recommend it just because there are too many other options: just the number of abuse humor comedies starring Jason Biggs is enough to give you a list of suggestions for other movies."

Lee Fleming Jr.","high school, theater play, theatre group, romcom, falling in love, duringcreditsstinger, teenager","**_Snappy comedy revolving around a Shakespearian high school play_**

A senior (Ben Foster) loses his childhood sweetheart (Melissa Sagemiller) and so joins the school play to win her back despite his lack of theatrical talent. The play is a musical version of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in which the teen has to deal with the hyper drama teacher (Martin Short) as he gets to know his best friend’s sister (Kirsten Dunst). 

""Get Over It” (2001) is an energetic and innovative teen comedy with good camaraderie and the unique scenario of a Shakespearian play marked by that updated 60's-type aesthetic of the period. The amusing lines, mostly by Short’s character, are so rapid-fire you’ll have to see the movie a second or third time just to get ’em all. I also appreciate the ‘cool’ edge minus the over-the-top sleaze of flicks like the (puke-inducing) “American Pie” series.

Mila Kunis is also on hand in a peripheral role, but she never did anything for me, nor did Dunst or Sagemiller, but they’re all winsome enough. And Jeanie Calleja is notable as the assistant of the drama teacher, Jessica; plus there are some females on the fringes worth a mention. Speaking of which, statuesque Kylie Bax appears in an amusing side role and Carmen Electra has a bit part. 

On the masculine side of things, Short pretty much carries the movie with his over-the-top charisma. Moreover, Colin Hanks and Sisqó are likable as the protagonist’s best friends while Shane West is effective as the arrogant rival.

Remember the high school play in “Dead Poets Society”? Now imagine if the entire movie revolved around that with a wildly witty tone and fast pacing. That’s this movie. It took me a while to catch a grip with its uniqueness but, once I did, I savored it.

The film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Ontario at Mississauga (Port Credit) and nearby Toronto.

It stays very close to the original story, and fills out the characters in the book very nicely. Lon Chaney Jr. plays Lennie, who is simple-minded, trusting and sees the world in black and white terms. Burgess Meredith plays George, his companion and caretaker, who alternates between cruelty and tenderness in his treatment of Lennie. The two are constantly on the move, as Lennie ""always does bad things"" that get both into trouble. Tragedy is inevitable when Curly's wife tries to make friends with Lennie, and his actions toward her are misinterpreted as an attack. Lennie's strength and inability to read people are what make him ""do bad things.""

One of the dominant themes in the movie has to do with the value of life, both human and animal. Many of the main characters in the story are what could be termed ""throwaways"" - one is black and crippled, another has only one arm, Lennie is intellectually disabled, Curly's wife comes from a broken home and is damaged by emotional abuse, and Curly, the rancher's son, is short and physically unimposing. As we glimpse into the lives and personalities of the characters, we see that each one has good points - Lennie tries to see goodness in everyone, loves creatures that are gentle and throws his trust toward anyone who shows him some decency. One-armed Candy is compassionate toward anything with limitations; he sees the way he'll eventually be treated when one of the ranch managers convinces him it's best to shoot his crippled, blind old dog. Crooksie, the black cripple, understands what it is to be an outcast. Mae wants to feel as though she's worthy of being loved, and George enjoys being needed and feels respected and responsible, not just for Lennie, but eventually for Candy and Crooksie too as they all plan to buy a small farm together. The movie was made in 1939, three years after Hitler had become Germany's leader and at a time when details of his ""Final Solution"" were becoming public knowledge, making the judgments regarding the value of all of these people by the ranch owner and his son more significant. 

This is not a ""feel good"" movie, but it's well worth watching. The story and themes contained in it are just as relevant today as they were in 1939. || Aside from a few relatively minor adjustments to accommodate the censors, this is a pretty faithful screen adaptation of John Steinbeck's really wonderful book. Burgess Meredith is super as ""George"", who is travelling from job to job with his gentle giant pal ""George"" (an equally good Lon Chaney Jnr.) with both hoping to eventually raise enough of a stake to buy a small farm where they can settle down and the latter man can grow alfalfa to feed his rabbits. They come to work on a ranch where ""Curley"" (Bob Steele) - the son of the owner - suffers what might reasonably be called small man syndrome; and he instantly takes agin ""Lennie"" - indeed, the rather obnoxious man has picked a fight with just about everyone, except, ""Slim"" (Charles Bickford) who is both big enough and bright enough to keep him in check. Part of the problem for ""Curley"" is his gorgeous, but extremely bored wife ""Mae"" (Betty Field) who saunters around the place looking to alleviate her ennui. She isn't looking for an affair, nor is anyone offering her one - but when she encounters Lennie in the barn, a tragedy ensures that leads to certainly one of the most poignant endings to any story you will have ever read or seen. Although this uses plenty of outdoor settings, the photography is still largely framed as if it were on stage. This style works really well. It gives the scenes - especially between the two men - an intimacy and added potency that builds the tension and emotion really well as their relationship, and inter-dependency is demonstrated not just to their colleagues, but to us too. There are also a couple of fairly poignant sub-plots, and the supporting cast especially Bickford and Roman Bohnen's ""Candy"" deliver those well. It is perfectly paced, the score from Aaron Copland adds much richness and the end product offers a touching and engaging dramatisation that truly is heart-rending and well worth"

Sue me, but I like it plenty, all 3 hours plus of ass numbing is not a problem to me. It has been called a cumbersome bore, amongst other things, but some of the technical craft is amazing. The story itself is enthralling, building to the shattering Crucifixion parts of the tale, while for every pointless star cameo shoehorned into the production, there's also a Savalas, a Baker and a Heston. Then of course there's Sydow, giving a beautifully intense turn as Jesus, a magnetic portrayal that holds the attention throughout.

Ironically director George Stevens struggled with his own ills during production, a cross to bear as it were, but just as Jesus had Sidney Poitier to share the burden, so to did Stevens, who had David Lean to help carry the load. Now that's a deity if ever there was one. It's a gorgeous film, grand and epic, sensitive and astute. Flaws? Plenty for sure, yet it harks back to a time of blunderbuss epic film making, when story telling meant something, when a musical score rattled the ears and the heart, and when cinematography soothed the eyes as if cool lemon slices had been placed upon the optical nerves.

Yeah, I'm a fan. If you are not then I forgive you, for you know not what you do. 7/10 || Max von Sydow is Jesus in George Steven's take on the ""King of Kings"" story and aside from a suitably effective contribution from José Ferrer as Herod Antipas, gives the only decent performance in this epically long, plodding, depiction of the life of Christ. Clearly money was spent - the photography is epic, as is Alfred Newman's score and a first-rate cast of Hollywood A-listers ought to have delivered better. Sadly, it is hampered by a static script - producing some seriously stultifying dialogue; authentic but murky lighting and a paucity of action that makes the film drag. Aside from a good, if brief, performance from Claude Rains as Herod the Great at the start, the acting is at best disjointed - too many people trying to impose themselves at the expense of any considered approach to the narrative. It may well be the greatest story ever written, but this is certainly not the best telling of it..."

She preaches the word of God with a piousness that he finds compelling. Not because he shares her zeal, but because he can see the impact it has on the rather sheepish population who turn up at her prayer meetings in their thousands - and donate for the work of the Lord in just as generous a fashion. Initially, the Sister is sceptical but she underestimates his charms and his persevering nature. He, too, does some underestimating of his own and pretty swiftly they are a formidable team of evangelising fund-raisers. He has his detractors, though - not least his jilted lover ""Lulu"" (Shirley Jones) who resents his new found success and happiness, and so determines to ruin it all for him. Question is - is ""Gantry"" really a changed man, or is it all just a façade? There's oodles of chemistry on display here between Simmons and an entirely convincing Lancaster that mixes religion, affection and plenty of wry humour as the two play a cat and mouse game that you just know how is going to end up. The writing is pithy and lively allowing these two, as well as Arthur Kennedy and Dean Jagger to deliver meaningfully to this story of indoctrination - but by whom and into what? We used to have a Church of Scotland minister when I was young that I thought was a bit puritanical in his sermon delivery - I suspect he might have watched this! || **_The story of traveling tent revivalists in 1920’s America_**

A fast-talking salesman from Missouri (Burt Lancaster) is attracted to the troupe of a winsome evangelist (Jean Simmons). Once he proves his abilities as a charismatic preacher, he joins the ""road church"" show, but a woman from his past threatens to shake things up (Shirley Jones). Arthur Kennedy plays a reporter who travels with the group by train.

""Elmer Gantry"" (1960) was based on less than one-fourth of the 1927 book by agnostic-turned-atheist Sinclair Lewis. It makes fundamental changes to the two main characters by painting them sympathetically and therefore less one-dimensional and more interesting. This makes the movie better than the novel (at least the parts on which it was based). I should point out that Jean Simmon’s character, Sharon Falconer, was inspired by the notable-but-controversial Aimee Semple McPherson.

It goes without saying that the film must be interpreted separate from the novel. The message is somewhat ambiguous and leaves it up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions, which is a sign of quality art IMHO. While it’s clearly not anti-Christian, it criticizes how revivalism can attract charismatic people of dubious credentials and questionable morality, which naturally results in troubles that could’ve been avoided with a little wisdom.

The movie version of the title character is a fascinating study. At the beginning he clearly basks in partying in a bar at Christmas, but is willing to drop everything in order to passionately help a worker for the Salvation Army acquire donations. Why? Shortly later, he’s traveling penniless and shoeless, but is drawn to the lively worship at an all-black assembly where the congregants stare at him curiously, until he happily joins in the singing of “Canaan Land” to show that he’s really just one of them, despite his skin-color: A poor man seeking the Creator and salvation or redemption.

The movie’s basically a story about people in positions of influence vacillating between carnality and spirituality, a condition of which most viewers can relate. But, as Jim Lefferts (Kennedy) points out: ""We don't like our gods to be human.""

While the flick definitely has its points of interest, such as the milieu of 1920’s Middle America and Shirley Jones never looking better, ""The Apostle"" with Robert Duvall is a less artificial experience that addresses some of the same issues more effectively.

It’s ironic that Sinclair Lewis made his character Elmer Gantry have a weakness toward booze seeing as how the author perished in 1951 due to advanced alcoholism.

At 2 hours, 26 minutes, the film’s overlong by about half an hour. It was shot in the studio in Culver City and Hollywood, as well as the Columbia/Warner Brothers ranch in Burbank, except for the Tabernacle sequence filmed in Santa Monica.

Whether that was agent Harry Palmer in _The Ipcress File_ or the efficacious Charlie Croker in _The Italian Job_, Caine became Britain's greatest self parody of a bygone era.

In _Alfie_, Caine plays the eponymous character, a womanising lad-about-town who cares more about with who he'll be sleeping with than where he'll be sleeping that evening. The ladies - and there are more than a few - are often discarded as, literal, objects of desire, but as Alfie comes to learn, actions will eventually have consequences.

When watched through a contemporary lens, there is something both creepy and despicable about Alfie - if any modern man behaved the way that Alfie does, he would rightly be lambasted by the #MeToo movement. But then, this is both the sexually liberating 1960's and Alfie never claims to want to be admired or looked up to.

It would be easy to say that he treats all the women badly, but there is an argument that it is the men who usually come off worse, whether he is charming another man's wife into bed, or demanding so much attention that a perfectly respectable man is barely noticed.

In fact, there are moments when Alfie's moral side appears to shine through as he suddenly become repentant of his actions, and it is impossible not to feel sorry for him. With Caine often breaking the fourth wall and delivering Alfie's inner monologues, you quickly realise that you - the viewer - are also being cleverly manipulated.

Through clever writing and Caine's irresistible roguish charm, _Alfie_ is a multi-layered comedy with an exceptionally important moral message. || Michael Caine is a bit too convincing as the sleazy, London man-about-town who only cares about having a beautiful girl on his arm (and in his bed). It isn't so much that he's a misogynist, more that sees women in only one linear fashion and as he has no use for them - or anyone else, for that matter, unless it is for his own immediate gratification. The narrative of the film takes us on his slow journey of self-realisation; he starts to comprehend the shallowness of his existence and embarks on his own yellow brick road to maturity. There are some great supporting contributions from Shelley Winters and Denholm Elliott and a cast of glamorous 1960s British models to lend credence to his hedonistic lifestyle. It is hard to watch 50-odd years later; the character is so odious - but that is testament to good acting and a novel - intimate - creative style of directing from Lewis Gilbert.

When the planet Akir is threatened by a galactic tyrant (John Saxon), a young man with no experience in warfare (Richard Thomas) ventures into space to enlist the aid of several mercenaries (George Peppard, Robert Vaughn, Morgan Woodward, etc.).

""Battle Beyond the Stars"" (1980) meshes the space-oriented science-fiction of Star Trek (the Original Series and the 1979 movie) with the space fantasy of Star Wars for a colorful interplanetary adventure on a Roger Corman budget. The protagonist’s planet is called Akir and the denizens Akira because the basic plot was taken from Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai” (which, of course, was also the basis for “The Magnificent Seven”).

On the female front, Darlanne Fluegel is noteworthy as Nanelia, the potential mate of our young hero (Thomas). Meanwhile stunning Sybil Danning works well as Saint-Exmin of the Valkyrie warriors, albeit hammy. Julia Duffy can be observed as one of the Akira.

This was one of the first fairly big theatrical films to be scored by James Horner (although he previously did “Humanoids from the Deep” the same year), which paved the way for his notable career (think “Wolfen,” “Star Trek II,” “Star Trek III,” “Cocoon,” “Aliens,” “Field of Dreams,” “Glory” and so on).

Corman’s $2 million budget was mostly spent on the salaries of Peppard and Vaughn, but he had to up his game with the special effects to compete with the new standards set by “Star Wars” (which cost $11 million), “Alien” ($11 million) and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” ($35 million). Sure, the F/X aren’t as good as those movies, technically speaking, but they’re quite effective (and fun) all things considered, not to mention superior to “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century” (the theatrical movie that was also the pilot for the TV series), which had $3.5 million to work with.

It was very profitable at the box office and deservedly so since it’s all-around entertaining. You could say that it was the low-budget precursor to the Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy flicks of modern times.

It runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot at Corman's own studio in Venice, California, his ""renowned lumberyard facility.”

Detectives in Boston have to deal with several typical crime issues in the big city, including a money-hungry killer bomber (Yul Brynner). Burt Reynolds, Tom Skerritt, Raquel Welch and Jack Weston head the cast.

""Fuzz"" (1972) is an 87th Precinct tale based on the book of the same name and written by the author, Evan Hunter, aka Ed McBain. It’s similar in some ways to other big city detective flicks of that era, like “Bullitt” (1968), Dirty Harry (1971), “The Night Stalker” (1972) and “Deathwish” (1974), but it’s easily the least of these because (1) the attempt to shoehorn humor into the life-or-death proceedings, à la “M*A*S*H” (1972), seems forced and (2) the script tries to juggle too many separate incidents with too many characters.

One example of the strained humor is the painters working in the headquarters throughout. But some of the humor works. If they would’ve toned down these kinds of artificialities the movie would’ve worked better. But working out the kinks in scripts take time and time means money. 

In any case, if you can adapt to the movie’s peculiar tone there’s a lot to appreciate here, including the great cast, which includes many recognizable faces, like Charles Martin Smith, Steve Ihnat and Cal Bellini. It’s also worth noting that the film gets better as it moves along with the last act being the best. It was the obvious inspiration for the TV show Hill Street Blues.    

Fifteen months after its release, 24 year-old Evelyn Wagler was shockingly murdered in the rundown Blue Hill district of Boston in what might have been a copycat crime based on this movies’ depiction of bums doused with gasoline and set ablaze. What made this incident worse was that it appeared to be a racial hate crime, the victim being white and the six teen perps being black, as witnessed by Wagler before she succumbed to her injuries four hours after the crime. The thug scum were never caught.

The movie runs 1 hour, 32 minutes.

Retired FBI specialist Will Graham is lured back into action to track a serial killer who is killing families, seemingly linked into the lunar cycle. In the process it opens up some old mental wounds that were born out during his last action out in the field...

Before the gargantuan success of Silence of the Lambs, where the name Hannibal the Cannibal moved into pop culture, and before director Michael Mann became a named auteur often referenced with relish by hungry film students; there was Manhunter, Michael Mann's brilliant adaptation of Thomas Harris' equally brilliant psychological thriller, Red Dragon. It feels a bit redundant now, years later, writing about Mann's use of styles to bear out mood and psychological states, his framing devices, his commitment to his craft, but after revisiting the film on Blu-ray, I find myself once again simultaneously invigorated and unnerved by the magnificence of Manhunter. Visually, thematically and narratively it remains a clinical piece of cinema, a probing study of madness that dares to put a serial killer and the man hunting him in the same psychological body, asking us, as well as William Petersen's FBI agent Will Graham, to empathise with Tom Noonan's troubled Tooth Fairy killer. Here's a thing, too, Francis Dolarhyde (The Tooth Fairy) is a functioning member of society, he is quite frankly a man who could be working in a shop near you! This is no reclusive psychopath such as, well, Buffalo Bill, Dolarhyde is presented to us in such a way as we are given insight into this damaged mind, he is fleshed out as a person, we get to know him and his motivational problems.

Dream much, Will?

Mann and his team are not about over the top or camp performances, gore is kept to a premium, the real horror is shown in aftermath sequences, conversations and harmless photographs, but still it's a nightmarish world. Suspense is wrung out slowly by way of the characterisations. Will has to become the killer, and it's dangerous, he knows so because he has done it before, when capturing Dr. Hannibal Lecktor. Needing to pick up the scent again, to recover the mindset, Will has to go see the good doctor who has a penchant for fine wines and human offal. These scenes showcase Mann at his deadliest, a bright white cell filmed off kilter, each frame switch showing either Lecktor or Graham behind bars, they are one. When Lecktor taunts Will about them being alike, Mann understands this and visually brings it out. Dolarhyde's living abode is murky in colour tones and furnished garishly, and with mirrors, paintings and a lunar landscape, yet when Dolarhyde is accompanied by Joan Allen's blind Reba, where he feels he is finally finding acceptance, this house is seen at ease because of the characterisations. Switch to the finale and it's a walled monstrosity matching that of a killer tipped back over the edge. Brilliant stuff.

If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.

Lecktor, soon to be back as the source material Lecter in the film versions that follow, is actually not in the film that much. Brian Cox (chilling, calculating, frightening and intelligent) as Lecktor gets under ten minutes of screen time, but that's enough, the character's presence is felt throughout the picture in a number of ways. The Lecktor angle is very relative to film's success, but very much it's one strand of a compelling whole, I realise now that Mann has deliberately kept us wanting more of him visually. Noonan is truly scary, he lived away from the rest of the cast during filming, with Mann's joyous encouragement, the end result is one of the best and most complex serial killer characterisations ever. Lang scores high as weasel paparazzi, Allen is heart achingly effective without patronising blind people and Farina is a huge presence as Jack Crawford, Will's friend and boss who coaxes Will back into the fray knowing full well that Will's mind might not make it back with him. But it's Petersen's movie all the way. His subsequent non film career has given ammunition to his knockers that he is no great actor. Rubbish, with this and To Live and Die in L.A. he gave two of the best crime film portrayals of the 80s. He immerses himself in Will Graham, so much so he wasn't able to shake the character off long after filming had wrapped. There's a scene in a supermarket where Will is explaining to his son about his dark place, where ""the ugliest thoughts in the world"" live, a stunning sequence of acting and a showcase for Petersen's undoubted talents.

Newcomers to the film and Mann's work in general, could do no worse than spend the ten minutes it takes to watch the Dante Spinotti feature on the disc. Apart from saving me the time to write about Mann's visual flourishes, it gives one an idea of just how key a director and cinematographer partnership is in a film such as this. The audio is crisp, which keeps alive the perfect in tone soundtrack and eerie scoring strains of Rubini and The Reds. Some say that the music of Manhunter is dated? I say that if it sits at one with the tonal shifts and thematics of a story then that surely can never be viewed as dated. And that's the case here in Manhunter. The director's cut is included as part of the package but the transfer is appalling, and for the sake of one cut scene that happens post the Dolarhyde/Graham face off, there's really not much to the DC version anyway. The theatrical cut is perfect, brilliantly realised on Blu-ray to birth a true visual neo-noir masterpiece. 10/10 || With ""Hannibal Lecktor"" (Brian Cox) now safely behind bars, the traumatised profiler ""Graham"" (William Petersen) might be looking forward to a well earned-retirement. Thing is, the ""Tooth Fairy"" has other plans as he embarks on a killing spree that causes his erstwhile FBI boss ""Crawford"" (Dennis Farina) to seek his help. These murders are truly gruesome with entire families killed, inside their own homes, on nights with a full moon. With the next one of those due very soon, ""Graham"" has to enlist the help of his former tormentor - whose help is never as straightforward as he might like - to see if they can establish some patterns and preempt more slaughter. Meantime, we are introduced to ""Dollarhyde"" (Tom Noonan) who's about eight foot tall and maybe not the most stable of photographers we are ever going to meet. It's possible that he might succumb to the more calming influence of the lovingly blind ""Reba"" (Joan Allen) but with the pressures mounting you wouldn't want to bet on that. Is there a connection? As with Thomas Harris's ""Red Dragon"" book, the audience is aware of far more than the pursuers and that works well here as we see ""Graham"" try to work from a blank canvas, and with an insane convict, to track down a man who has left virtually nothing for them to go on. Petersen holds this together quite well and the cleverly cast Cox, well he always comes across as an actor who'd be quite prepared to eat the competition. I found the ending just a little rushed, but the jigsaw is well presented and the jeopardy effectively increased throughout this quite chilling adaptation. Honestly - I didn't much care for the intrusively synthesised score - just a little too much ""Miami Vice"" for me - but this is a solid and at times quite gripping story of imbalance and mania that I did quite enjoy."

It's history this, so if you're across the story then you will already know how it all pans out. Therefore what we are left with is a decent effort from Ron Silver as the tenacious lawyer, some almost ethereal contributions from Close as the occasionally animated corpse/narrator and the frankly underwhelming Irons.

When a group of high school friends discover that one of their social group has murdered another - his girlfriend - they all react in various ways...

Based on an actual murder incident in 1981, ""River's Edge"" is a deeply unsettling film in how it probes the troubling underbelly of American youth. Naturally considered controversal at the time of release, it is however a fascinatingly brave portrait of disaffected youth via home and school life. The various reactions each member of the group serve up is chilling whilst baffling considering the reality of it all.  

The screenplay is high quality because it doesn't demonise the ""kids"" for their bizzare response to a tragedy in there circle, instead we get complex characterisations that are smartly portrayed by the young cast. They in turn are bolstered by another edgy off the wall turn by Hopper (he did Blue Velvet as well this year), where his ex biker drug peddler also has a murder in his past and has given his love to a blow-up doll named Ellie. 

Troubling in many ways, a sort of nihlistic youth apocalypse that's amazingly handled with a calm honesty, this still decades later remains an important film. 7.5/10"

A Catholic school girl (Sarah Jessica Parker) hooks up with a cool guy from public school (Lee Montgomery) to enter a TV dance competition in Chicago. Helen Hunt plays her best friend while Holly Gagnier is on hand as her spoiled nemesis. A 13 year-old Shannen Doherty appears as the guy's little sister.

""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" (1985) mixes the 80's teen/school genre with the 80's dance genre in the mold of ""Footloose"" (1984), just not as heavy with the anti-legalism theme. It's a fun, energetic flick like ""Heavenly Bodies"" (1984), but more teen-oriented.

Although those two movies are better, ""Girls"" is a good movie for when you're in the mood for a lighthearted fun 80's flick. Sarah was 19 years-old during shooting and never looked better; same thing with Holly Gagnier (Natalie), except she was 26 at the time. It's interesting to see Doherty when she was so young and innocent. I shouldn't fail to mention Charene Cathleen in a bit part as Patty.

On the masculine front, Montgomery is effective as the ""hip"" male protagonist, coming off as a mid-80's version of the The Fonz. It's a wonder his career never took off. If you like him, be sure to catch him in his final movie, 1988's ""Into the Fire,"" aka ""The Legend of Wolf Lodge,"" where he plays the same type of character as in ""Girls,"" except that it's an adult-oriented tragedy.

Interestingly, the producers didn't use Cyndi Lauper's version of the title song for licensing reasons. Yet the cover version is acceptable.

Bottom line, if you're in the mood for a flick in the mold of ""Heavenly Bodies,"" ""Footloose,"" ""Teenage Dream"" (1986), ""Flashdance"" (1983) and ""Tuff Turf"" (1985) this one fills the bill.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles & Culver City (the mall), with some exteriors done in Chicago.

RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, ""Enemy at the Gates"" takes place in the last four months of 1942 during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad. Russian troops are carted in by the literal trainloads as the Germans attack/bomb the city. Once the dust clears the situation settles into a more personal battle of sharpshooting wills. A lowly young Russian soldier named Vassili (Jude Law) distinguishes himself for his shooting skills and is promoted as a national hero to motivate the Russian cause. After numerous German officers are assassinated, Major König (Ed Harris), the top German sniper, is assigned to seek out and eliminate Vassili.

Most WWII films take place on the Western Front whereas ""Enemy"" is one of only two mainline films I can think of that address the Eastern front, the other being Sam Peckinpah's underrated ""Cross of Iron"" (1977).

Three things stuck in my mind after seeing “Enemy at the Gates” years ago: (1.) The opening sequence where the Russian troops are boated across the Volga to join the fight is extremely harrowing, not far removed from the opening D-Day invasion in “Saving Private Ryan” (1998), but different. “Enemy” is worth viewing for this sequence alone. (2.) The city-in-rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurrying-like-rats-through-the-rubble warfare. (3.) Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet lovemaking scene while the soldiers lain in the rubble trying to sleep. I'm not sure why this left an impression, maybe because it struck me as so real: Men & women would be drawn to one another and mate even in the worst possible scenarios.

The film was based on the book ""War of the Rats"" by David L. Robbins and thus intentionally provokes the imagery of human rats scurrying through the debris. The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as the political officer who elevates Vassili to hero status via his pamphlets and articles, while Rachel Weisz plays the romantic interest between the two. Ron Perlman is also on hand in a limited role as Vassili's sharpshooting comrade.

As with any film based on historical events there are facts-obsessed critics who decry the lack of authenticity in this or that detail (e.g. ""The zippers on the trousers aren't right, blasphemy!!""), but ""Enemy"" gets the gist correct and, besides, it motivates the viewer to research the actual Battle of Stalingrad. What more can you ask for? 

The fact is Vassili had 260 verified Nazi kills and played a key role in motivating the Russians to victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare (with roughly 2 million killed, wounded or captured). The movie effectively shows how the Russian combatants weren't necessarily professionally trained soldiers; many of them were peasants, workers, teachers, mailmen, farmers, etc. They knew they could die the next morning hence they celebrated (and made love) while they could. Stalingrad was one of the major turning points of World War II; from then on it was all downhill for Germany.

FINAL WORD: ""Enemy at the Gates"" details an oft-ignored important aspect of WWII, the Eastern front. It has several memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot entirely in Germany (Brandenburg and Bavaria).

Disgraced former pro football quarterback Paul Crewe is sent to prison after a drunken night to remember. The prison is run by Warden Hazen, a football nut who spies an opportunity to utilise Crewe's ability at the sport to enhance the prison guards' team skills. After initially declining to help, Crewe is swayed into putting together a team of convicts to take on the guards in a one off match, thieves, murderers and psychopaths collectively come together to literally, beat the guards, but Crewe also has his own personal demons to exorcise.

This violent, but wonderfully funny film has many things going for it. Directed with style by the gifted hands of Robert Aldrich, The Longest Yard cheekily examines the harshness of gridiron and fuses it with the brutality of the penal system. The script from Tracy Keenan Wynn is a sharp as a tack and Aldrich's use of split screens and slow motion sequences bring it all together very nicely indeed. I would also like to comment on the editing from Michael Luciano, nominated for the Oscar in that department, it didn't win, but in my honest opinion it's one of the best edited pictures from the 70s.

Taking the lead role of Crewe is Burt Reynolds, here he is at the peak of his powers (perhaps never better) and has star appeal positively bristling from every hair on his rugged chest. It's a great performance, believable in the action sequences (he was once a halfback for Florida), and crucially having the comic ability to make Wynn's script deliver the necessary mirth quota. What is of most interest to me is that Crewe is a less than honourable guy, the first 15 minutes of the film gives us all we need to know about his make up, but much like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest the following year, The Longest Yard has us rooting for the main protagonist entering the home straight, and that is something of a testament to Reynolds' charm and charisma.

The film's crowning glory is the football game itself, taking up three parts of an hour, the highest compliment I can give it is to say that one doesn't need to be a fan of the sport to enjoy this final third. It's highly engaging as a comedy piece whilst also being octane inventive as an action junkie's series of events. A number of former gridiron stars fill out both sides of the teams to instill a high believability factor into the match itself, and the ending is a pure rewarding punch the air piece of cinema. 9/10 || On the face of it, the warden ""Eddie Albert"" maybe wasn't having his brightest idea when he decides that his prisoners should play a game of American football against his guards, but when a former pro is sent down for eighteen months after an altercation with a Citröen and the harbour, he has just the man to put together an opposing team. ""Crewe"" (Burt Reynolds) is offered preferential treatment for himself - and that might well mean early release, and for his team and so he and fellow inmate ""Nate"" (Michael Conrad) start recruiting. Obviously, there are no storage of volunteers but what starts off as a bit of glorified prank starts to mean something a little more to the team, and to ""Crewe"" himself as he must balance his selfish promises to the governor with the aspirations of a team that finally have some sense of purpose in their lives. With that conflict building as the game grows ever closer, just what will ""Crewe"" decide to do? It's all a little predictable on that last front, but Reynolds turns in quite a charismatic performance and Albert an equally dastardly one as the drama comedically illustrates the futility of imprisonment as a method of reintegrating folks into society. There's an entertaining mix of stereotypical inmates from which to choose from, and plenty of action towards the end giving us quite a sense of how perilous this ball game can be coupled with some entertaining shunts, bumps and black eyes."

If you liked ""The Hustle"", ""Ocean's 8"" (and maybe even ""Ocean's Eleven""), then you might really enjoy this.  I'm not a big fan of criminal enterprise movies without a great second motivator, so for me, I see this movie as a romantic comedy that does something extra.

As a romantic comedy, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jason Lee do an excellent job at their stop and go romance, with Jason Lee just basically being bemused at the entire situation and JLH kinda of just being mean for most of it.

On the other end of it, while I'm less of a fan, Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman, and Ray Liotta play out a must more complicated parallel love story that lends towards the hustle more than any traditional version of love.

This is definitely a romantic comedy that does something different, or a hustle movie that has a special spin to it, but there are other movies that do it as good or better.

I think the key audience for this are people look for female empowerment movies, and this nicely joins that group of movies."
77.0,Memento,"Leonard Shelby is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer, however, is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of short-term memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why.",Some memories are best forgotten.,"Mystery, Thriller",113.0,2000-10-11,en,8.179,15389.0,9.8844,"Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Russ Fega",Christopher Nolan,"drug dealer, amnesia, insulin, tattoo, waitress, motel, manipulation, flashback, confusion, revenge, murder, memory loss, memory, psychological thriller, whodunit, los angeles, california, polaroid, based on short story, nonlinear timeline, mourning, insurance agent, individuality, phone call, mysterious, disturbed, paranoid, neo-noir, somber, reverse chronology, introspective, remember, suspenseful, tense, baffled, bewildered, bold, complicated","We all lie to ourselves to be happy.

It's not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.

Christopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.

Christopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!

The reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. Super. 9/10 || Excellent. I can't believe I've finally gotten around to watching all of Christopher Nolan's films (I have 'The Prestige' on DVD, but have yet to see it), but it's been well worth the wait. There are a couple of handful of English-language directors operating right now that I will make sure I watch every single film of, and Nolan has become one of those for me, and rightfully so. A very fine twist on the noir framework. || ‘Memento’ is director Christopher Nolan’s tribute to classic film noir tales of revenge and mystery. By adding a new twist to traditional conventions, Nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. The aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. The viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). We then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear.

Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) and his wife are attacked in their home. His wife is murdered but Guy Pearce is left with a brain condition that disables him from creating anymore short-term memory. Constantly being reminded of the horror of the situation, he is relentlessly spurred on to get his revenge on his wife’s killer. As the viewer progresses through the film, they begin to feel more and more like Lenny. The audience have no idea of what has happened prior to the scene currently showing and so we are left feeling the same confusion as our protagonist. To cope with his condition, he maintains a system of notes, photographs, and tattoos to record information about himself and others, including his wife's killer. He is aided in his investigation by ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), neither of whom he can really trust (both of the latter actors starred together in ‘The Matrix (1999)’ in which Pantoliano was not to be trusted, disorientating the informed viewer more).

The film's events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in colour, and the other in black and white. Leonard's investigation is depicted in five-minute colour sequences that are in reverse chronological order, however, the short black and white scenes are shown in chronological order and show Leonard on the phone to a mysterious stranger having a conversation that the viewers cannot understand (these sequences are more direct references to the film noir genre that Christopher Nolan is embracing). This style of directing makes the audience completely empathise with Leonard’s situation as you never know more than he does, but also it creates huge comedic and emotional moments which rely heavily on the notion of dramatic irony.

With Nolan’s use of handheld camera work, an overtone of pink colouring, and sharp editing (the only transition effects in use are occasional fade outs) the viewer is made to feel disorientated and is therefore able to empathise more with Leonard’s character. The original idea was a short story by Nolan’s brother, Jonathan who also helped with the screenplay. The dialogue in the film is its best feature with its insightful, powerful and heart-wrenching speeches about the nature of memory. As we learn how we rely upon memory for our sense of reality, we begin to question reality itself.  The idea of faith and constant references to the bible can make the entire film a metaphor for people’s faith in Christianity or any other religion at that.

The Gleaners and I may be the most fun and yet, Varga delivers the political message with Vaseline. At the same time, we get an education on found art. || The Gleaners and I is a documentary about gleaning as both a physical and metaphysical activity. Director Agnès Varda is herself a meta-gleaner; she’s a gleaner of gleaners the same way that Jesus was a fisher of men.

The film is a confluence of the practical and the artistic. Many of the people in the movie glean to eat (their children sing a revealing ditty: “Monday, potatoes/Tuesday, potatoes/Wednesday, potatoes again/Thursday, potatoes/Friday, potatoes/Saturday, potatoes again/Sunday, potatoes au gratin”). For others is a chosen lifestyle, or a hipster hobby.

And for Varda, it is an aesthetic endeavor; “I'm not poor, I have enough to eat,” she said in an interview, pointing to “another kind of gleaning, which is artistic gleaning. You pick ideas, you pick images, you pick emotions from other people, and then you make it into a film.” Thus, while most of the gleaners in the film collect objects they can use, Varda chooses a useless object – a handless clock – and repurposes it as an ornamental piece.

The Gleaners and I is almost 100% wheat except for the chaff of self-indulgence. The film gains a lot of momentum when Varda simply observes, and one of its greatest pleasures is how the filmmaker makes room for spontaneous diversions, becoming sidetracked in the pursuit of beautiful things and interesting people.

This momentum is lost when Varda points the camera at herself, a mistake that is obvious to everyone but her; in fact, in a follow-up released two years after the original film, one of her interviewees tells her, after watching the documentary, that the scenes she devotes to herself are “unnecessary”. That said, Varda does deserve a lot of credit for her ability to find beauty in the most unexpected places, both in the countryside and in the city, filming with one hand, and gleaning with the other."

D.C. forensic psychologist Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) investigates when a senator’s daughter is kidnapped from a private school by a man obsessed with the infamous Lindbergh abduction (Michael Wincott). A secret service agent at the school assists him on the case (Monica Potter).

“Along Came a Spider” (2001) is an improbable detective thriller like its predecessor “Kiss the Girls” (1997) except that it doesn’t rip-off “Silence of the Lambs” (1991) or “Se7en” (1995). Both were based on the books by James Patterson.

The opening is great with a thrilling dam sequence. The ensuing story of the kidnapping & investigation is compelling but, like the first film, a plot wrench is thrown into the works that muddles everything. I can roll with that, but not the absurd ‘big reveal’ at the end, which comes off as a wannabe “Fooled ya” by the writers. They might’ve fooled me, but they also ruined the movie with the eye-rolling twist. 

Like “Kiss the Girls,” “Along Came a Spider” is worthwhile if you like proficient detective thrillers and the cast, but be prepared for a wildly unrealistic tale.      

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, British Columbia, and Owings Mills/Baltimore, Maryland (the train sequence), with establishing shots of Washington DC.

GRADE: C || Morgan Freeman is psycho-detective ""Cross"" who has retreated from his work after an operation went awry, killing his wife. Shortly after, the daughter of a senator (Michael Moriarty) is kidnapped by one of her teachers, and when he calls ""Cross"" to lure him back into the business the game is afoot. Aided by one of the girl's now disgraced Secret Service agents ""Flannigan"" (Monica Potter) the two have to piece together a puzzle that will track down and rescue the girl. The snag with this thriller is that it is all just bit too straightforward - there are no real problems with that puzzle as the pair solidly proceed. There is precious little jeopardy, and the characters are all just too sterile - it's just lacking in anything that gives it a sense of peril before an ending that really does have you saying ""Hmmm..."". Freeman certainly has a charm to him, but that's simply not enough to ignite this by-the-numbers effort from a director who couldn't, or couldn't be bothered, to make this more interesting and challenging to watch.

I remember seeing the French version of this film on the television when I was a kid, but don't recall much other than two men from the medieval in the streets of the modern world. Somehow I found this, and after some research I chose this version to watch which I thought easy to understand, as well as for the reason some updates were made in this. Well, I know nothing can beat the original, but for those haven't seen the original, this is not a bad one. Quite an enjoyable film with a simple theme and a simple adventure.

Seems a very familiar concept, but surely a unique product. Jean Reno was brilliant and so his sidekick and other supporting characters. Top notch jokes, felt like I had some loud laughs after a long time. Of course, there are some flaws, but minors, like relocating from Europe to the US since it is a Hollywood production. It is a time travel theme in fantasy. There's no time machine, instead a wizard behind the adventure through the time.

A perfect family film. It's not about prediction, since watching the first scene you would know what follows it and how it all ends. So you're relieved from guessing stuff and can sit back relaxedly and enjoy it as much you can. It is your average film, but if you're seeking a good comedy, then it is surely above that. There are thousands of masterpiece comedies, this is not one of them, though must see from this genre.

I think you need to like romantic comedies to enjoy this movie, and that eliminates a lot of guys who tolerate Rom-Coms for the sake of their ladies.

A cute female in London (Renée Zellweger) is concerned about spinsterhood & other womanly issues and so starts an honest diary that narrates her misadventures catching the eye of her suave boss at a publishing company (Hugh Grant), her quirky friends and her relationship with a boring man she hates but somehow finds quietly attractive (Colin Firth).    

“Bridget Jones’s Diary” (2001) is an English romcom that tries to be edgy, cute and amusing simultaneously. While it goes overboard with the cussing (less is always more) and the accents are too thick to grasp at times, the flick eventually won me over because it tries so hard and everything builds to a comical melee. It helps that Renée is adorable in a roundish way and is tastefully shown in alluring apparel, including a playboy bunny outfit.     

The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot London, Surrey, Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire, England.

GRADE: B || I was watching a documentary on the late Dame Maggie Smith the other day that was narrated by the amiable Celia Imrie (herself still awaiting that particular gong) and she brings that affability to this rather dated but enjoyable comedy drama too. It's all centred around the loveless ""Bridget"" (Renée Zellweger) who hasn't had sex for a while and has the hots for her floppy-haired boss ""Daniel"" (Hugh Grant). After a few rather embarrassing encounters, they finally do hook up but then she discovers he's a bit of a rake and takes a new job in television working for sleazebag tele-journalist ""Finch"" (Neil Pearson). Thanks to an incident with a fireman's pole, that doesn't exactly go to plan either, but it does offer her the opportunity to get it together with posh barrister ""Mark"" (Colin Firth). Now she's known him for a while but took an instant dislike to him at a curry party, so what's changed? Has she discovered a new penchant for striped suits and wigs? I remember reading the book at the time and feeling a certain degree of sympathy with old ""Bridj"". It was just at the start of the now all-encompassing validation culture when we'd dial 1471 on our land-lines when we get home only to find nobody had called (again) and where office instant messaging was rendering scuttlebutt obsolete as gossip and flirtation became the order of many a professional day. It's that culture of feeling needed, liked and wanted that Helen Fielding encapsulated so well with this character. Hapless, yes, but decent and given a chance - loving too. Zellweger delivers charmingly and enthusiastically, as does in a more roguish form Hugh Grant. As to Firth, I'm never quite sure how much acting he ever actually does anyway, but here his contribution works well too. It does struggle almost a quarter of a century later to resonate - especially the fisticuffs in the restaurant scene, but it still has enough wit and pith in the cleverly crafted and observational script to raise a chortle and be grateful for a series of daft scenarios that poke fun at the whole business of courtship amongst the young and the old. Also, of course, Celia gets to look shocked and amazed as only she can, too."

I never saw the original cartoon or read the comics on which it was based, but “Josie and the Pussycats” (2001) is fun and the three protagonists are attractive & enthusiastic (Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid & Rosario Dawson). Yet the movie shoots for something deeper as this is an amusing and potent satire on the influence and manipulation of the entertainment industry.

Alan Cumming is outstanding as the villainous band manager who uses bands, abuses them and throws them away at whim. His opening scene with the fictional boyband Du Jour is worth the price of admission. Parker Posey is also good as his diabolical superior. Curvy and towering Missi Pyle is also on hand as Alexandra.

Ever wonder why all those musicians die in mysterious plane crashes, overdoses, etc. at the height of their fame? How about all those successful government cover-ups? How do artists with little actual talent and songwriting abilities become hugely popular, usually overnight, while the truly talented artists languish in obscurity? Why do you sometimes have this insane drive for a Big Mac or Coke? ""Josie and the Pussycats"" explains all, lol.

As for those who complain about the product placement, they all live on Aduh Street.

Unfortunately, the great set-up of the first hour sorta peters out in the last act. It’s okay, just not up to the quality of the first two acts, as far as compelling writing goes.

The film runs 98 minutes.

GRADE: B || Entertaining enough music-comedy that at least had me smiling throughout. The core cast with Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson and Tara Reid were fun and the satirical element was fun with the incredible amount of product placement. Not familiar with the comic or animated shows beyond seeing a couple episodes here and there, but seemed to capture the tone. Not a big compliment, but it is far better than Jem and the Holograms... **3.0/5**"

Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee (Paul Hogan) is in Los Angeles with his son and Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), his longtime companion. There's something amiss in the world of movies and art, and Dundee is soon to be right in the middle of it.

Undeniably the worst of the three Crocodile Dundee movies, to the point where you wonder just why anyone at the studio gave it the green light? By the time Crocodile Dundee II came out in 1988, it was obvious that much of the charm and adventure like magic from the first film had greatly diminished. So fast forward 13 years and they saw fit to produce another movie.

Strangely enough it turns out to not be a complete stinker, yes the formula is tired, I mean how many times can you do the fish out of water comedy before it gets lame? But there's some genuinely funny sequences in here, with barbed asides towards the movie industry and the American way of life. Hogan and Kozlowski are still likable leads, their chemistry cemented, and if you can get past the stereotypes on show (they forgot this was not the 80s!) there's some fun to be had on a time waster basis.

Instantly forgettable, and certainly not needed, it is however a pic that fans of the first two films can find a modicum of comfort in. 5.5/10 || ***Meh sequel, but a handful of genuine laughs***

Sue (Linda Kozlowski) has to fill-in at a newspaper in Los Angeles for a few weeks and so Mick (Paul Hogan) & their son tag along. Misadventures ensue as they investigate a dubious movie production company.

“Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles” (2001) is the final flick of the trilogy and easily the least. Hogan is still his genial self and Linda is more beautiful than ever at 42 (during shooting), inside and out, but too much of the story is flat and the the constant product placements are annoying. Still, it’s likable nonsense and I found myself busting out laughing at the goofy humor at least seven times.  

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in (big surprise) Australia and Los Angeles.

Still a few slots below the likes of The Godfather and Heat, yet still a amazing film that holds up so well. **4.5/5** || Despite all the hype and plaudits, I don't think this film is as good as Paul Muni's 1932 iteration. That's not to say it isn't a good film, nor that Al Pacino doesn't turn in a good effort - it's that it is all so brash. The language and action has no subtlety or finesse to it. It glorifies violence - it's not just that it is a necessary evil in the world in which ""Tony Montana"" works, it just comes across as if there was nothing in the script and the film had to be padded out somehow - so let's shove in some more brutality. There is precious little sophistication with the characterisation either - and after a while that all just grates. Top drawer production and scoring, though - and some fine supporting efforts from Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer but for me it was all just a bit in my face when just a little more effort and better scripting could have improved it no end. Good, but not great. || **A very violent film about drug trafficking and paranoia, with a great cast and a great production, but where everything is histrionic and exaggerated.**

I caught this film yesterday on television and decided to watch it in full. I had already heard about it, and the good dramatic performance that Al Pacino had, and so I decided it was time to see for myself. Directed by Brian de Palma, it marked its time, but is currently somewhat forgotten. It's understandable: in addition to the gratuitous violence and the crudeness with which it approaches the topic of drug trafficking, we don't have any character here that we are capable of liking, and this puts a wall between the film and the viewer.

Brian de Palma is a very solid director. Unfortunately, I didn't see as many of his films as I would have liked: I really liked “Carrie”, which for me is his masterpiece so far, and “Untouchables”. In this film, he did a very competent job, especially from a technical point of view, but the film has no soul and, after a while, it just seems like pure carnage. The chainsaw scene, as well as the final shootout, are worthy of an anthology.

Technically, the film is impeccable and has luxurious production touches: the cinematography is beautiful, it highlights the sun and brightness of Florida very well and gives us a real feeling of the tropical climate. The sets and costumes not only fit well into the decade, but also manage to emphasize the characters' sense of nouveau riche and fast ascent. Of course, it's absurdly kitsch, even the soundtrack tells us that! However, we can't expect anything else from characters with no taste, no culture, no education and tons of money to show off! However, I will agree if someone tell me that the film is too long, with some scenes a bit incidental or unbelievable (that scene where Gina, enraged, gives herself sexually to her brother, was a good example). With little effort, about half an hour could have been removed from this film, making it more palatable.

The film's script is based on a remake of an original from 1932, which very few people know, and which was made by Howard Hughes. Perhaps the name of this film is slightly inspired by the figure of Al Capone, who had the unflattering nickname of “scarface”. In one of the most notable performances of his career, Al Pacino is histrionic, unpleasant and paranoid to the extreme. The intentional exaggeration may be off-putting, but it seems to be in line with a film where everything is exaggerated. However, I don't consider this to be one of the actor's best, I enjoyed seeing him in other roles. Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer provide very happy support, but Michelle Pfeiffer has little to do other than look sexy and vain. However, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and F. Murray Abraham have frankly underutilized characters."
32488.0,Days of Wine and Roses,"An alcoholic falls in love with and gets married to a young woman, whom he systematically addicts to booze so they can share his ""passion"" together.","From the days of wine and roses, finally comes a night like this.","Drama, Romance",117.0,1963-02-04,en,7.5,197.0,0.7569,"Jack Lemmon, Lee Remick, Charles Bickford, Jack Klugman, Alan Hewitt","J.P. Miller, Blake Edwards","rehabilitation, father-in-law, secretary, drinking, alcoholic, in-laws, public relations","It's as true to life as a vodka martini.

The above quote is from director Blake Edwards, it's taken from the highly recommended commentary track he provides on the DVD for this excellent and compelling piece of work.

Joe is a social drinker but he's social all the time, during one of his arranged parties for a client he meets and falls in love with teetotal Kirsten. They get married and changes start to dominate their marital bliss, he is stressed from work and drinks daily to forget the rigours of the job, she being the loving wife chooses to drink with him to help ease his pain, but soon the joyous days of wine & roses will turn to something dark and terribly turbulent, and this will threaten their own respective sanity.

The film begins with Henry Mancini's academy award winning title theme tune, it's a truly beautiful piece of music that perfectly sets the tone of the film for its first third, it lulls you into this couples love, the bond they share is a truly wonderful thing, it really is all sweetness and light, but then the bottle becomes part of this couples life, they become a threesome from which only dark horrors will form. Containing emotionally shattering scenes that once viewed can not be forgotten (witness Joe's soul destroying search for liquor in a greenhouse), Days Of Wine & Roses still manages not to force feed the viewer a moralistic stance, it lays down the facts of alcoholism and the perils of co-dependency with honest appraisal, we as the viewers are left in no doubt that it is us, and us only, that can make of it as we see fit, the ending especially is a particular poser of which we ourselves seek clarity.

Wonderfully written by the talented hands of J.P. Miller, Days Of Wine And Roses boasts marvellous direction from Blake Edwards and two academy award nominated performances from Jack Lemmon & Lee Remick, it's a testament to all involved that come the finale the viewer feels drained, yet strangely...not at all thirsty for the amber nectar. || This is an intriguing, heavy drama about the downward spiral into alcoholism, and how it irrevocably tore apart the lives of one man and his wife.  I have some respect for Blake Edwards, having seen this, as I previously had a low opinion of him after seeing The Pink Panther, which to this day I do not understand why it was so successful.  But I'm not reviewing The Pink Panther, so I'll lay off it for now. In Days of Wine and Roses, Jack Lemmon really is brilliant, and Lee Remick is disturbingly realistic.  The film is right up there with The Lost Weekend (1945), and the story carries an important moral lesson, which it delivers with a punch.  

Would I recommend?  Yes.  But to the mature viewer, who can really understand and appreciate it. || What a departure for Jack Lemmon this is! Together with the also Oscar nominated Lee Remick, they offer us a really gripping performance. She (""Kirsten"") is a tea-total secretary who is introduced to one of the PR guys ""Joe"" at a boat party. After a bit of a sticky start, she starts to warm to him and they begin to date. He is never far from a bottle; ""hit me again"" being his most oft used expression and gradually, even after the arrival of a child to this now married couple, he begins to wean her onto the sauce. Despite the best efforts of her father (Charles Bickford) they quickly spiral into a cycle of drunkenness that costs them their jobs, imperils their daughter and as an example of how badly, and completely, alcoholism can come to dominate their lives, this has to be amongst the most potent depiction on film. Jack Klugman (""Hungerford"") tries to offer some route to salvation via AA, and we are offered a few less cerebral drying out methods - all of which offer Lemmon a chance to really show what he is made of an an actor. Some of it still quite distressing to watch (especially if you happen to have a drink in your hand at the time). Messrs. Mancini and Mercer came up with the title song, which perhaps features just once too often; but for the most part this really is captivating cinema with both and director Blake Edwards (usually known for much lighter works) on top form."

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || ***Bigger is NOT always better; here it’s overKILL***

I'm a fan of the first movie from 1999 and was naturally looking forward to this 2001 sequel. I originally saw it at the theater with two friends; after about 10-15 minutes we were all bored by the bombardment of action and F/X. We just laid back in our seats in tedium for the remaining couple hours.

It's a curious thing that too much action and F/X in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true; and ""The Mummy Returns"" is Exhibit A. I usually give certain movies second and third chances in the hope that my first impression may have been in error, which I’ve done with this one over the years. Unfortunately I keep finding myself relatively detached from the story even though there are all kinds of exciting things going on; or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.

""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. (although some of the CGI is woefully cartoony, like the Scorpion King at the close). It has great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a forgettable piece of cinematic dung. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" abandons the characters while the plot is utilized as a clothesline for action and F/X sequences.

The flick curiously has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails to absorb the viewer. It is unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance or overKILL: having all the right elements, including budget, and yet stupefyingly fumbling the ball.

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes (overlong), and was shot in England, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt. 

GRADE: C- || Yeah, right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. You remember how that one went?

After the financial success of ""The Mummy"" two years earlier, the sequel was inevitable. The big players from the first film are back, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr. Stephen Sommers once again directs (and writes), Patricia Velasquez comes in to be a main player after her cameo in the first film, and young Freddie Boath plays the son of Rick and Evelyn who are now married. This time the cameo goes to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson who plays The Scorpion King and who is replaced by a very bad CGI version of himself at film's finale.

When the second sequel, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008), was released, Brendan Fraser went on record as saying that for ""The Mummy Returns"" they basically remade the film they had already made in 1999! This is absolutely true, some new characters and an expansion on the O'Connell romance have been put in to beef it up, while some Zombie Pygmies are around to add extra monster factor, but yes! It's a re-tread only with more money spent, more effects (and better effects apart from Scorpion King) and more noise. This actually is OK for those who enjoyed the first film immensely, because ""Returns"" is every bit as enjoyable as family blockbuster entertainment. The Worldwide box offices rang to the tune of over $330 million in profit. That's a lot of happy families you would think!.

So yes, it's a bit of a cheat, but much like the film before it, it gets away with it because the makers do everything they can to entertain the action/adventure loving crowd. With legions of Anubis warriors, those awesome Pygmies and the all round funny by-play between a cast comfortable with the material (again), ""The Mummy Returns"" delivers exactly what can reasonably be expected of it. 7/10"

There were two characters that I recognized one being that of Ergo the Magnificent the man that kept changing into different animals but was kind of a bumbling fool I remember seeing him play the teacher of Charlie in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory The musical that involved Gene Wilder and a young Liam Neeson who we will know as the lead star of the film Taken. This film had a little bit of everything it was a hodgepodge fantasy film that mixed dark magic with that of sorcery and combined a little bit of the mystical. When it came down to the final battle in the palace that was never in the same place twice however there were a couple of scenes that slightly dragged but it all came around full circle and I surprised myself that I have not seen this before. I would say that this is an odd film that is out there in left field and I would definitely recommend it for others who enjoy films of this nature to at least see it once. I relatively enjoyed the film and believe that it is definitely a cult classic. I really hate giving films any kind of a star rating as i find it degrading but this site gives me no choice. || **An expensive film, typically from the 80s, but it aged badly and was forgotten.**

I usually like fantasy films, but this film mixes things that seem so different from each other that I don't understand how such a thing was possible: on the one hand, the film shows a threat coming from space in the form of a spaceship, which looks like a black mountain with a big egg on top, and troops that shoot ray guns. On the other hand, it shows us an apparently medieval world, with castles, knights, princes and princesses. Almost as if Darth Vader had decided to invade planet Earth during King Arthur's reign.

The cast is quite satisfying, as the actors do what they need to do and make no mistakes, even though the job isn't demanding and there's nothing deep or very challenging here. The dialogues, for example, sound like they were written for a TV movie rather than something that has cinema quality. Despite the film featuring a young Liam Neeson, I barely recognized him.

Technically, the film is a very expensive production, and this can be seen from the quality of the sets and effects used. Well, quality doesn't exactly mean good taste, from what I can say that the film's visuals are expensive, elaborate, meticulously designed, but quite ""kitsch"", and the truth is that the special effects, although they were very good in their time, have aged badly and seem archaic nowadays. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, quite epic and triumphant at certain points. || My father called it one of the cheapest movies he had ever seen.... but when I saw it, I was a little kid, and it looked awesome, not cheap.

Now that I'm older and revisiting one of my favorite childhood films, yeah, some of the backgrounds move more than a Monty Python sketch. There is some obvious miniatures.

But... who cares, the story is really good. It's an adventure with loyal companions, an evil enemy, and a princess to rescue all in a sword and sandal sort of science fiction plot that tells a pretty good story even if it's a genre of adventure that we have seen over and over again.

It's just pure entertainment, and, if you are a kid, it's an epic film that you will love for the rest of your life."

He was one of the emperor Nero’s closest advisors and the credited author of this fantastic story of mythological excess. In this suitably outrageous Neroic drama, two close friends - “Ascito” (Hiram Keller) and “Encolpio” (Martin Potter) get into a strop about their ownership of their toy-boy “Gitone” (Max Born). Unable to reconcile, they determine to go their separate ways. The young lad chooses to go with the former man and so distraught, the latter considers suicide - but luckily an earthquake intervenes. The aftermath of the chaos sees the men separated and now we follow some of their escapades as they lurch from one debauched scenario to another equally sexually charged environment, with loads of erotic dancing, debauchery and hedonism. In due course, the three are reunited and embark on a wheeze to borrow a demigod from a sacred temple. Now that’s not a good move as he’s only a “demi” so promptly dies and that earns poor old Encolpio the enmity of the gods. Given the context of the whole film, his punishment is especially cruel but with his friend beside him, he hopes that perhaps they can travel to a far away land where there might be a glimmer that things could look up again! Some of the adventures do resemble more familiar fables. Theseus and the Minotaur, for example, but for the most part this is Fellini at his most enjoyably self-indulgent showing beautiful people (and some less so, too) luxuriating in just about every vice known to mankind. That said, there isn’t a surfeit of nudity, violence nor actual depravity on display here. Much of that is teasingly left to our own imagination as it’s tawdry seaminess really doesn’t go anywhere fast. As it progresses, it illustrates quite effectively just what it took to become the stuff of myth and legend in cultures where prowess was measured with little regard to intellect or decency. It’s essentially a romp through Roman history but as well as jealousy and lust it does show us signs of the value of love and loyalty, so there is a tiny element of redemption on offer - but look not for values here, just enjoy the colourful artistry of men (mostly) in the throes of gratuitous dissoluteness."
18691.0,Frankie and Johnny,"Johnny is a riverboat entertainer with a big gambling problem.

Johnny (Presley) performs on stage with his partner, Frankie (Donna Douglas), on a riverboat casino on the Mississippi River in the 1890s. To improve his luck at gambling, a gypsy woman says he should look for a redhead. When the girlfriend of the casino manager shows up (Nancy Kovack), Johnny feels he needs her to win, which rubs Frankie the wrong way. Harry Morgan plays the piano player while Sue Ane Langdon is on hand as a lonely performer.  

""Frankie and Johnny"" (1966) was Elvis' 20th movie of the 31 in his acting filmography. This one has fallen into obscurity because, while fun and colorful, it doesn’t stand with Presley’s more notable flicks, like “Roustabout” (1964), “Viva Las Vegas” (1964), “Kid Galahad” (1962), “Blue Hawaii” (1961), “Easy Come, Easy Go” (1966) and “Live a Little, Love a Little” (1968).

Presley movies are known for taking the Elvis formula and inserting it into different environments. For instance, in “Roustabout” Elvis is a carnival worker, in “Viva Las Vegas” he’s a racer and in “Kid Galahad” he’s a boxer. So “Frankie and Johnny” is the riverboat casino installment. 

I think what hinders the movie is that it’s entirely set bound and so it has an artificial air, which is augmented by its campy, comedic vibe. In other words, don’t expect the serious drama of “Roustabout” and “Kid Galahad.” Nevertheless, it’s an amusing, colorful flick when you’re in the mood for something light and entertaining. And it’s good to see Nancy Kovack, who’s most famous for playing Nona in the Star Trek episode “A Private Little War” (1968). Donna of course played Elly May Clampett on The Beverly Hillbillies.  

The film runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot at Samuel Goldwyn Studios and The Lot in West Hollywood.

What a fantastic cast: I honestly don't know if you could have cast it better.  Just thinking about Alan Tudyk, Heath Ledger, and Shannyn Sossamon makes me smile.

Everyone plays their roles fantasticly, taking their stock characters, and spinning the writing to the 9th degree: the jerks are hate-able jerks and I can't help but love the leads and supporting characters.

Part of what makes this movie disctinct is that they forces some modern (for the time) music into it when it very did not belong with medieval England / Europe.  There are several scenes where if you squint, you could mistake the movie for ""10 Things I Hate About You"" or some other teen rom com of that time period.

Fortunately they found a way to balance the jousting content with personality stories, which are by far more entertaining, but unless you're Kevin Smith, you can't exactly cut jousting out of a movie set in competitions for jousting.

All of the actors were top notch. I believe it was Nicole Kidman's best performance of her career. Ewan
McGregor usually doesn't add a lot of depth to his characters, but in this movie it was ample. Jim Broadbent was charismatic and Richard Roxburgh was a very convincing pervert, right down to his posture. I liked how well they developed each of these characters. The rest of the actors were also excellent, but the story didn't lend much depth to their character, and they simply came off as a backdrop or environment for the main four, often becoming a writers convenience or becoming a set of eyes we could see through from the outside looking in.

There were so many parts I enjoyed about this movie, more particularly the segments where Kidman and McGregor's relationship was explored. This made for a great second act of the movie. The first and third act I felt suffered from Baz Luhrmann's rapid, almost epileptic, editing style. His style is not not for everyone, but particularly in this movie, it didn't allow for much depth of the movie in the first and third act and came off as flashy and showy. This created pacing issues that I felt if he had slowed down and focused more on the characters instead of fitting as many shots into the move that he could, the story would have flowed a lot better.

The other major inconsistency of the movie was the theme it was building towards, and the theme it ultimately landed on. Throughout the entire movie, they are building a theme of faith in love no matter what the outcome, but the last minute and a half of the movie turns it into a tragedy that I felt was unwarranted and unearned. This would have been a palpable ending if the movie showed the characters doubting that maybe love wasn't enough, and then a tragedy strikes that proves the point.  But instead we have the ending segment that shows us that all this guy's belief in love was absolutely for not, and that we are left to assume he must have been faking his belief the entire time, because it sure didn't seem like enough for him. This isn't about always getting a happy ending, it's about not getting an ending that was a cheap and quick way to evoke a particular emotion in the audience without really building into. It felt rushed, and again, unearned. (And I'm not talking about the actual event, but more about how the event affected the character.)

Otherwise, I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did. An excellent second act with outstanding performances and likable characters, but with the pacing issues and inconsistencies in building a movie that naturally flowed from one idea to the next keeps me from rating it higher. All in all, though, a fairly enjoyable and rewatch able film nonetheless. || I could go on why I enjoyed this film - heck, I reviewed this 3 times on Letterbox!
But the one simple word I can best describe Moulin Rouge, is poignant. This film give a poignant feeling whenever I get the chance to see this it. The glits, the glamour, the music & the story. This is the perfect love story.
Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman were terrific.

I recommend this film as a Valentine's treat! || ""Christian"" (Ewan McGregor) is a struggling writer living a stone's throw from the legendary Moulin Rouge in Paris. He cuts quite a solitary figure until he is befriended by ""Toulouse-Lautrec"" (the scene stealing John Leguizamo) and introduced to the hedonism of the club run by ""Zidler"" (Jim Broadbent) that features it's superstar turn ""Satine"" (Nicole Kidman). He is besotted, he must meet her in her blue elephant apartment and love must follow, surely? Well, maybe, but ""Zidler"" has other plans on behalf of the seedy ""Duke"" (Richard Roxburgh) who has determined to make her his. ""Christian"" now finds himself inspired, and sets about writing his ""Spectacular Spectacular"" piece of musical theatre that thinly disguises the burgeoning romance between the pair whilst hopefully throwing the ""Duke"" off the scent. These things are expensive, though, so the venal ""Zidler"" ends up having to do a deal with the devil to pay the bill - and that leaves everyone exposed to the lasciviousness of the amorous aristocrat. We also learn that, not unusual for the late 19th century, ""Satine"" isn't so well and so time might not be much of an ally for them, either. Can they thwart the lecherous ""Duke"" and save their love? Though I didn't really love McGregor's rather flat singing so much, the rest of this is an highly entertaining romp through a tawdry Parisian society riddled with sexiness, vibrancy and just a little hint of evil. Broadbent is in his element as the master of ceremonies who'd have looked just as impressive hosting a circus - and indeed it's a circus that his boozed up and horny guests want every night as the original sex-club comes alive with colour, dancing and champagne. The soundtrack works really well using just about everyone from Rufus Wainwright to Elton John via Broadway and T-Rex - even Kylie manages a tinker-bell of a cameo. The film looks great, with huge attention to the detail of the look; the costumes and the set - with the perilously poised pachyderm overhead. There's heaps of chemistry between McGregor and a very natural looking Kidman and two hours just flies by. It's one of those films that positively wallows on the big screen and each time I see it, I seem to get just a little bit more from the humour and the pathos in the writing. Original, quirky, zany and good fun."

Lets not beat around the bush, it's historically suspicious, badly written, badly cast and clearly an hour too long. A splendid ""support cast"" are wasted as Michael Bay and his production team think they can produce some sort of Titanic of the Skies like epic and fail in their objective. By the time of the brilliantly constructed assault by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, and ""it is"" exhilarating and edge of the seat heart pounding, you are left with the feeling that all the main characters in the piece are not really worth our emotional investment.

It's not an outright stinker, situations such as the nurses trying to cope in the hospital during the attack are poignant, and there's a jingoistic - cum - romantic fervour that screams out that the film wants to be genuine in making you feel, well, emotionally battered. However, given the budget and time you are asked to invest in the story, it's impossible not to feel cheated as the clock ticks past the three hour mark.

Perhaps it's unfair to use Titanic as a template for this type of epic? Especially since over the course of time many have come out of the woodwork to knock Titanic when previously there were nods in appreciation for it, all be it grudgingly. But Pearl Harbor just doesn't have enough about it to make it even a ""time waster"" recommendation, and this even allowing for some quality ""Bayhem"" action as the film rolls into its blunderbuss third quarter. 5/10 || After about half an hour, I started to wonder if this film was going to take as long to get going as a pearl takes to form in an oyster! It's a close run thing, as it must be around eighty minutes in before the Japanese come to the rescue of the audience and introduce some action into this over-long and dreary romance. Certainly it is all handsomely presented with Ben Affleck (""Rafe"") at his most swarthy as he gets it to together with ""Evelyn"" (Kate Beckinsale). Having put us through the usual ""how to get the girl"" shenanigans, though, he heads off to the UK to help in the Battle of Britain. It's from here that reports reach her that he has been killed. Enter his best friend ""Danny"" (Josh Hartnett) who tries to console her before, well you can guess the rest. You can also easily guess that Affleck was being paid way too much money to be out before the fighting began in earnest, so back he duly arrives and a yawn-making love triangle takes over the plot. When we finally do start to focus on the events of December 7th, 1941, the action partially redeems this film. Twenty minutes of a quickly paced depiction of the meticulously planned destruction of the US Pacific fleet that caused mayhem and carnage upon their ill-prepared quarry. The creative use of CGI and intricate photography illustrate well both the human catastrophe as well as the significant destruction of materiel. Of course, our two survive and together with their erstwhile CO ""Doolittle"" (Alec Baldwin) are drafted into the retaliation plan than involves a perilous, long range, bombing attack on Tokyo to demonstrated that they still have the capacity for potent response. This is two films, really, and I much preferred the later stages. Even then, though, it has a shockingly poor script and the characterisations are weak and undercooked. The technology is used well, but that's about all I can say for this sentimental and meandering offering. || **_A fine drama/romance combined with great war action_**

""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) is a Titanic-ized version of the tragic events of Pearl Harbor—a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of December 7, 1941.

It's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the drama/romance and build-up to the infamous day BETTER be good, and it is. It's believable too (except maybe for the premature sex scene, which inaccurately transfers modern morals to the early '40s). This first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. I didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but I was wrong, as we get some quality action when Rafe (Ben Affleck) goes over to Europe to fly for the British. There are also a couple of fight sequences.

While dancing & drinking, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) comments to Rafe how shy Danny (Josh Hartnett) seems to be while he’s shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. Rafe responds that Danny is like a brother to him, that Danny's father abused him, and he therefore lacks confidence. While these characters are fictional, this is REAL. Much later, Danny goes to a woman's apartment fumbling & stumbling to ask her out. The conversation is, of course, awkward. He then walks away, speaking under his breath, ""You're such an idiot!"" This is good stuff.

The film also shows that the timid average-looking man can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man. It's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.

As for the Pearl Harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. Critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? Seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? I'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe Jimmy Doolittle's boot laces weren't right, Oh, my God!!), but what film with a historical backdrop ever has everything 100% right? The gist of the event is accurate. And the subplot with Cuba Gooding Jr. as Navy boxer Doris Miller is a true story.

The film is also respectful of the Japanese viewpoint as they meticulously plan, prepare for, and carry out their massive raid. I felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. They spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression. Meanwhile there’s a great scene showing the Japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. It's very realistic.

After the attack, I knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so I was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details The Doolittle Raid, the first American bombing mission over Japan. More great war action.

This bold mission took place a mere 4.5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack on April, 1942. The raid is notable in that it was the only time in US military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. Sixteen modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around Tokyo. Unfortunately, this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland China to land, crashland or bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is. Most of the Americans made it to China and safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers, but hey paid dearly for helping as it is estimated that the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese, vengefully searching for Doolittle's men! Incidentally, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle is greatly portrayed by Alec Baldwin and, true to history, the picture shows Doolittle taking part in the daring mission. More historical accuracy.

Some criticize that the Doolittle Raid doesn't belong in the movie, but nothing could be further from the truth. If all the flick showed was the Pearl Harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. Showing the successful Doolittle Raid makes the film end on a positive note. What effect did the raid have at the time? For one, it caused American moral to soar from the depths. It has the same inspiring effect on viewers.

In light of all the criticism I kept waiting for ""Pearl Harbor"" to stumble and fail, but it never happened. Yes, the viewer has to be open to the drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer CARE about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. I have zero interest in his ""Transformers"" films, but this is great filmmaking. It provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.

The film runs 3 hours, 3 minutes.

That being said, it's still a movie about a legend. My dad told me the story, my grandfather told me the story, it was party of my childhood and we Cubs fans. So, walking into this, when I was 8, I already new how it was going to end, all the names involved...

...and reviewing it at almost 40, it hasn't changed at all, it's still the legend Chicago baseball fans grew up with, projected on the big screen, to sit back and take in as if you were watching the cautionary tail yourself.

And the thing is, it holds up to it. It holds up to the story of Shoeless Joe that inspired but the book (named after him) and the movie that would become Field of Dreams. It lives up to the stories that Grandpa and Dad told me from different points of view about where the guilt rested. It lives up to the stories of the darkest times during the greatest era in baseball history.

I'm writing this in 2018, the movie is set almost exactly a century ago and people are still telling stories of Joe Jackson, Ty Cobb (unfortunately slurring his name still), Babe Ruth, Buck Weaver, Honus Wagner,Cy Young, Lou Gehrig, and so many others. They became legends that Nolan Ryan could only dream of...and it was because the era was so important in the history of our national past time.

My favorite scene had nothing to do with dude ranch stuff. Mitch (Crystal) is explaining how a DVD recorder doesn’t even require the tv to record a show, and his friend just isn’t getting it. It’s hilarious.

I don't really and so wasn't particularly engaged as this sort of merged John Wayne with Laurel and Hardy. Palance looks like he's enjoying himself, and easily steals the show with his facial expressions conveying just as much as the rather predictable script. Stern also delivers quite entertainingly as they battle with the cattle and the snakes that rattle amidst some stunning New Mexico scenery that sets up the story perfectly. It's a story about recalibrating life and on that score it sends quite a powerful message about people stopping every now and again to appreciate what they had/have and to take stock of what they want to come next. That thrust epitomises the difference between the urban and the rural, their population's who do and those who talk about doing quite well - but the humour was just all bit lame for me and the whole thing takes too long to finish where I always thought it would."

And how many of us will be shocked to discover something of Mayor Tilman in ourselves: we know all about what is going on and yet we choose to do nothing about it? That is the real lasting power of this superb film and that is why it will continue to have great longevity and deservedly so. || When three men go missing from their small-town Mississippi home, the FBI sends a team to investigate. ""Anderson"" (Gene Hackman) is very much the more hands-on of the pair leading the team, with ""Ward"" (Willem Dafoe) more inclined to play by the book. Their arrival exposes them to an open culture of racial hatred that's not only tolerated by the local sheriff ""Stuckey"" (Gailard Sartain) but enthusiastically supported by his deputy ""Pell"" (Brad Dourif). Their arrival only seems to empower the bigots as more Negro property is trashed or razed to the ground and the people themselves subjected to increasingly dangerous violence. The audience watching this know the local dynamic and who is pulling the strings, so the thrust of this rather potent look at the ghastliness going on here comes as we follow the differing styles of policing these men use to get to the bottom of things - and in a way that will make the equally complicit judicial system sit up and take note. With a media carnival only fanning the flames and tempers flying on both sides, the agents put into place a complex sting operation to turn the weapons of these intimidators into the very things that will hopefully entrap them. Hackman and Dafoe make for a formidable coupling in this well written and presented thriller that shines an unashamed light on the toxic attitudes of the white population whose concern for the missing men amounted to little more than ""they got whet they deserved"". Dourif is also on good form as his truly odious character emerges - not just against his black neighbours, but against his own wife (Frances McDormand) too. Alan Parker and Chris Gerolmo have created a palpably criminal scenario here and the ensemble deliver well that sense of fear, loathing and superiority. The photography captures well this increasingly menacing, dark and swamp-infested environment and by the denouement I did feel that this was all a perfectly plausible train of events in the mid-1960s USA."

Michelangelo Antonioni has created the ultimately crafted fly-on-the-wall film, here. The photography is intimate, almost invasive, at times as we watch these two people heading on a crash course to marital oblivion taking a great deal of themselves with them too. Though at times outwardly superficial, the characterisations are actually quite complex and both play with a subtle, nuanced charisma that compliments the more obvious symptoms of their declining interest in each other. What also adds a richness to this is a distinct paucity of dialogue. Giorgio Gaslini has provided us with a score that allows the photography to tell us great swathes of the story using imagery only - the lack of needless conversation between the characters helps it to showcase the ostentatiousness of their ball or the use of the Milanese city-scape in the darkness illuminated only by the occassional street-light - and that frequently creates a compelling atmosphere as sterile and barren as is their failing partnership.

A vile bandit constantly raids a small Mexican village and pilfers what he so wants. Finally having enough, and not wanting to relocate, the villagers set about recruiting some hired guns to finally rid themselves of the dastardly Calvera.

As most people now know, The Magnificent Seven is of course a remake of Akira Kurosawa's immense and hugely influential picture, Shichinin no samurai. Adhering closely to Kurosawa's themes, director John Sturges has crafted a classic in its own right, one that has become something of a Bank Holiday staple for TV schedulers. When you break it down for scrutiny, the story is purely a very ordinary one, but as each archetype character and set up arrives, it becomes evident that it's a story rich in texture, all framed marvellously in a Western setting.

Sturges for sure knew how to direct ensemble casts, he would after all go on to direct the fantastic 1963, ultimate holiday movie, The Great Escape. Here he is excellently served by a faultless cast, though Yul Brynner was the only major name of note, the likes of Steve McQueen (owning the movie), Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn would go on to become part of cinematic macho culture, with each actor vying for the right to own the movie proving to be a bonus trump card for this rousing and much loved picture. Even the score has slipped nicely into popular culture, Elmer Bernstein's music having now become recognisable to even the most youthful of movie fans ears.

Unashamedly macho, but certainly delightful for the female viewers as well, The Magnificent Seven is an across the board delight for almost everyone who enjoys the escapism of film. Perhaps the last word should rest with Kurosawa himself, who after viewing John Sturges' picture was moved to present him with a Samurai Sword in recognition of the great film he had crafted, enough said there I feel. 9/10 || From the opening bars of Elmer Bernstein's superb score you just know that this is going to be a good film... Add the ensemble of Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Yul Brynner and a superb Eli Wallach and it is a certainty. This version of Kurosawa's 1954 story tells of a group of put-upon villagers who set out to recruit some hired guns to help them fend off a gang of murderous marauders. There is some fairly grand cinematography; strong performances from all including Robert Vaughn as the neurotic cowardly ""Lee"" and Horst Buchholz as newbie ""Chico"" that provides for a great, action-packed Western adventure movie with more than it's fair share of twists and turns, some good tight dialogue/direction and Wallach is really entertaining, if not especially menacing, as ""Calvera"". The local population put up some good performances too and although it lacks the intensity and grittiness of ""Seven Samurai"" I think it certainly holds it's own as a classic piece of entertainment. || **A classic western in its own right.**

When I decided to see this film, I did so because of its enormous popularity in European lands, and not because of its particularly good reputation. For example, I knew that my father had seen this film in a theater in Luanda, Angola, in the years when it was released in theaters (back when Angola was not an independent country). Only later, when I read a little about it, did I discover that the film is a remake, an adaptation for a western of the famous film “Seven Samurai”, directed by Akira Kurosawa, which I saw before and which I thought was a bit overrated. And of course, it's one of those pure classic US westerns, not a western-spaghetti.

The script maintains the structure of Kurosawa's film, adapted to Northern Mexico: a village of peaceful peasants, often pillaged by a band of malefactors, who hire a small group of seven honorable gunmen to help them defend themselves. However, this film corrects several of the “errors” that I pointed out to the original Japanese film: first, it is much shorter and summarizes the facts more to the essentials, giving us a less dull and dense narrative, more efficient to entertain us. To do so, the plot focuses on finding the best men for the job and, then, on the adventures to defend the village. It remains, however, a predictable film: we know that, in the end, the heroes will save the day, albeit with a few brave deaths in the final body count.

This is certainly the greatest film of Yul Brynner's career. He was already a renowned actor and had a strong influence on the casting, ending up putting together a kind of “dream team” of incredible action actors. And he himself made an impactful and remarkable performance. Steve McQueen also deserves mention, along with James Coburn, both of whom will meet again in “Great Escape”, shortly afterward. Charles Bronson and Horst Buchholz also do a very good job and make good use of the opportunity to develop their careers. In a more discreet register, Robert Vaughn and Brad Dexter help compose the seven heroes. Eli Wallach, in the role of the villain, cannot be forgotten for the quality of the work he offers us, and for the charisma that come with him.

Technically, the film does not present great values to consider. Much of what we see was standard US cinema in the 1960s: the cinematography is good, quite colorful and well lit, but not particularly notable, and the sets and costumes are relatively good, from an aesthetic point of view. The recreation of the historical era fails a little: set around 1865-1870, the film does, however, have several props and clothing that are distinctly later by several decades. They look good, but they are not exact. However, this film makes up for it with good editing, a very pleasant rhythm, good special and sound effects and an excellent soundtrack, with a pleasantly epic and heroic nature, signed by Elmer Bernstein."

Filmed by Howard Hawks as a response to what he saw as none macho cinema in Gary Cooper's acclaimed High Noon, Rio Bravo has moments of brilliance that are sadly coupled with failings that are not Hawksian peccadilloes. The macho plot is simple but wholly effective as our heavily out numbered heroes (John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan & Ricky Nelson) defend a jail house against a marauding mob trying to release an incarcerated friend. This alone sounds grand but the truth is, is that it takes the film nigh on close to 100 minutes to get to the adrenalin rush of the siege and even allowing for fine character development, the film is ponderous and even at times dangerously close to being self indulgent.

The casting of Ricky Nelson was (as is widely regarded now) one of the worst of its kind in the history of cinema, he was there purely as a marketing ploy to garner the teen audience who were bopping to his pop tunes way back then. In fairness to Hawks, though, he saw straight away that this was out of Nelson's league and promptly (and cutely) gave him few lines of note to speak of. Also a big negative in the film is Angie Dickinson as the Female interest, she is raw and fresh out of water, and it shows, just like sushi on your plate.

The bonuses with the film however keep the film talked about for ever more, Wayne is magnetic and believable, whilst Martin comes into his own as the drunk trying to do right, a superlative performance from him and one would think that is really down to Hawks' direction. The action sequences are of a high standard, while the tight intimate feel of the town is precious - and who can resist an ending that makes you want to go fire yer guns in the air?

A very good film, but not a Western masterpiece by a long shot. 7/10 || Sherriff ""John T.""

Then, when he thinks things can't get any worse, the stagecoach comes in with a dodgy wheel and wanted card-sharp ""Feathers"" (Angie Dickinson) - a woman who knows exactly which buttons to press to turn the sheriff into a gibbering wreck. With tensions mounting, we retreat to the safety of their prison for a sing-song with Martin and some acerbic antics from the real star of the film - Walter Brennan. He's the cantankerous old ""Stumpy"" who is tasked with keeping an eye on their prisoner whilst fixing their beans... Wayne and Martin work well together and though Nelson is a bit wooden, his eye candy value just about works - that and his lively rendition of ""Cindy"" that gets even Wayne's toes a-tapping. It all builds well to a lively and explosive denouement with some diney-mite and a perfectly aimed sawn-off shotgun topping this off nicely. It's a solid story with engaging characters and well worth a watch - even if westerns aren't necessarily your thing."

Danny DeVito stars in what is his theatrical directorial debut. I chose to watch this because of him being in it, as I want to watch more of his stuff, and he is the film's strongest element, I'd say. Billy Crystal is good too, him and DeVito work nicely together throughout.

Anne Ramsey's character annoyed me a lot, I can't lie. I'm actually flabbergasted to read that the performance got Ramsey an Oscar nomination - 1987 must've been a slow year for Best Supporting Actress. No hate for Ramsey though, btw - happy for her! I know Momma is supposed to be annoying, but she's way too far along that particular scale for me.

The aforementioned is my only complaint, however. It's a good time otherwise, even if I feel like it meanders here and there in setting up each part of the story.

I'm not really a lover of buddy comedy as such. Usually the scenarios are so obviously contrived to get a series of laughs before a dead cert conclusion that you could have written them yourself. This one isn't really very different on that front, but DeVito and Crystal do work well together keeping the story from becoming too formulaic and at times it provides quite a poignant assessment of friendship and marriage.

Twelve O'Clock High features one of Gregory Peck's best performances as Brigadier General Frank Savage, a tough no nonsense martinet brought in to shake up a World War II Bomber Squadron. The men are shattered emotionally and after it's deemed that their previous commander (Gary Merrill) has been soft with them, there is no chance of that happening with Savage - but is he himself taking too much on?

Split into two parts, the first half of pic deals with how a group of men in war time can reach their lowest ebb. Fear of the jinx, fear of cracking under the strain, these men are by definition demoralised. Things are further compounded by the appointment of Savage, who drags the group further down the battered emotional scale. Second half softens things for a short while as Savage's methods begin take a hold, then there's the missions, which in turn builds to the film's revelation, which as it happens lets Peck become a revelation as well.

Director Henry King is on form, showcasing the skill of directing an ensemble cast, which sees Dean Jagger add mighty heft to the work of Peck, Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Paul Stewart and Millard Mitchell. The flying sequences are expertly photographed (Leon Shamroy), with the real footage splicing very effective, while the writing allows the piece to exude a realism factor, which then offers up a more humane war film that is delving into psychological stings. 8/10 || Gregory Peck is on top form in this gritty, authentic looking recounting of the actions of a battle-weary USAF squadron during WWII. Peck is ""Gen. Savage"" drafted into replace an extremely popular, but no longer effective squadron commander. Initially, his hard-nosed approach to them, their training and their attitudes engenders hostility, but over a period of time - and with the assistance of the intelligent camp adjutant/chief administrator ""Maj. Stowell"" (Dean Jagger) he sets about trying to change these opinions (and some of his own) before his entire squad transfers out. Henry King has managed to create a film that unsentimentally encapsulates some of the senses of frustration, fear, low morale and trauma that went with the relentlessness of constant missions - regardless of rank - not knowing who might return. The supporting cast - featuring Hugh Marlowe and Gary Merrill compliment the star well; some excellent original aerial battle cinematography and the Sy Bartlett screenplay has pace and detail enough to make this 2¼ hour assessment of leadership under enormous pressure a thoroughly entertaining and at times thought-provoking watch."
21876.0,Von Ryan's Express,"Von Ryan's Express stars Frank Sinatra as a POW colonel who leads a daring escape from WWII Italy by taking over a freight train, but he has to win over the British soldiers he finds himself commanding.",,"War, Action, Adventure, Thriller",117.0,1965-06-23,en,7.093,221.0,1.1229,"Frank Sinatra, Trevor Howard, Raffaella Carrà, Brad Dexter, Sergio Fantoni",Mark Robson,"nazi, escape, italian, switzerland, world war ii, prisoner of war, frontier, train, 1940s, suspenseful, bold, commanding","Get on board with Frankie Blue Eyes.

Out of 20th Century Fox, Von Ryan's Express is directed by Mark Robson & stars Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard. It's adapted by Wendell Mayes & Joseph Landon from the novel by David Westheimer. William H. Daniels is on photography and Jerry Goldsmith provides the score. Contary to what some sources say, this is not filmed in Panavision, it is filmed in Fox's trusted CinemaScope in De Luxe Color. Unless the opening credits are telling lies that is!

Italy, August 1943. With the Allies poised to strike, the Germans seize control of Italy. So the war Weary Italian nation fought on as a prisoner of the German armies.

Reeling from the critical kicking and gargantuan financial whack of ""Cleopatra"", 20th Century Fox desperately wanted a hit to put the company back on an even keel. Treating the project with kid gloves, producer Saul David (director Robson co-produces) for his first producing gig for Fox takes one of the biggest names in showbiz and shoots on location in Italy and Spain. The film was a big hit that got a strong critical response and a box office take that made it the 10th highest grossing film of 1965. Of note also is that it turned out to be Sinatra's highest grossing - and biggest earning - film of the 1960s.

With some changes from the novel, notably the ending, Von Ryan's Express isn't setting out to be a deep and meaningful war movie. It wants to entertain, to thrill the audience, to take them out of the stuffy prison camp and onto a fast moving train. And it does this, in spades, pitting our protagonists into a boys own adventure. We accompany Sinatra, Howard and over 500 American and British prisoners-of-war across 1943 Nazi controlled Italy - and hopefully to the safety of Switzerland. Once the film leaves the ""Bridge On The River Kwai"" like prison camp, where the characters for the story are formed, the film turns into a rip-roaring adventure piece that's flecked with moments of genuine suspense.

Directed with vigour and a sense of fun by Robson, and aided no end by the fine cast, the film is all about being an old fashioned type war movie. It's not bogged down by the need to adhere to history or ""the horrors of war"" message making, this thrives on just being an action/adventure movie, one that uses real life events as its backdrop. If you like a war movie but want escapism with some beer and snacks, well this is the one for you. There are some strong character moments to keep it emotionally viable too - with the ending particularly memorable, and dare I say it, bold (altered at Sinatra's request apparently). Even the appearance of a female on board our machismo packed train (Raffaella Carrà) serves an important purpose. For where it at first seems out of place, a token offering, it ultimately makes for a critical piece of the film.

Technically the piece scores high too, with effective stunt work, smart action set pieces (the last quarter bridge confrontations are thrillingly executed), sharp detailed colour and ear busting sound work (check out the Messerschmitt attack, wow!). This be an all encompassing piece of entertainment. Easily holding up on revisits over the years, Von Ryan's Express is a safe recommendation to the action/adventure/war film fan. 8/10 || ""Col. Ryan"" (Frank Sinatra) arrives at an Italian POW camp to find it's mainly British occupants at loggerheads with the Commandant ""Battaglia"" (Adolfo Celi). It seems his brutality led to the death of their former CO and now ""Maj. Fincham"" (Trevor Howard) is out for blood! ""Ryan"" is a more calculating man, though, and that initially elicits hostility from the men - hence the ""von Ryan"", but his patience pays off and soon he is able to lead the whole lot of them on an audacious escape attempt that could see them all make it to safety. With the Nazis and their former persecutor in hot pursuit, they manage to commandeer a train and now they must use their guile and the unique skills of padre ""Costanzo"" (Edward Mulhare) to blag their way through the heart of the enemy lines en route to Switzerland. Can they make it? It's a bit of a slow burn, but once the story gets up to speed then there's loads of action with Sinatra and Howard working well together to create quite an exciting sense of peril as it builds to quite an exciting conclusion. There's a strong supporting cast including their principal antagonist ""Maj. Von Klemment"" (Wolfgang Preiss) and Brad Dexter's ingenious ""Sgt. Bostick"". Jerry Goldsmith helps it along with a solid score and there's quite a bit of dry humour in the script, too. Not one of the most famous of wartime thrillers, but it's not bad at all. || **_Escaping the Germans by train in Italy_**

A captured American colonel (Frank Sinatra) takes command of the POWs at an Italian camp in 1943. He conflicts with the rigid Brit major (Trevor Howard) as the Allies soon land in Selerno. The opportunity eventually surfaces to take command of a train and possibly escape north. Sergio Fantoni plays an Italian captain who teams up with them. 

""Von Ryan’s Express"" (1965) was based on the book by David Westheimer, who himself was a navigator in a B-24 shot down over Italy at the end of 1942 wherein he ended up a prisoner in Stalag Luft III. While “The Bridge on the River Kwai” concerned a POW camp in Burma and “The Great Escape” concerned one in Poland, the camp here is in Italy. Thankfully, it only concerns the first act and the flick is wisely streamlined compared to those other two movies.

Amidst the adventure, there are interesting culture clashes between the Italians and Germans, the Allies and Italians, as well as the Brits and Americans. Sinatra insisted that the script deviate from the novel’s ending and it worked out for a memorable climax.

Beautiful Raffaella Carrà is a highlight in her black skirt and white shirt. Unfortunately, the iconic Euro-entertainer devolved into a LIEberal in the following years, supporting Communism and so forth (Get real). But what else is new?

It runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was majorly shot in northern Italy in Cortina d'Ampezzo and Florence, although the ending was filmed in the limestone gorge of El Chorro and the nearby railway bridge, which is close to Málaga, Spain. Interiors were done at 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles with the POW camp built in the front lot.

But as the insects start to evolve in the Earth atmosphere, they take on various shapes and forms of alien creatures. Pretty soon the whole place is over run and the government is at a loss in how to stop them. Enter Ira, Harry, Wayne and Allison to hopefully save the day.

Directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters 1 & 2), Evolution is a zany sci-fi comedy that achieves firmly what it sets out to do. Using the available special effects for great rewards, and lashing it in Technicolor, all that remained was to have a cast happy to be in on the joke itself. Up step David Duchovny (revelling in none serious X Files malarkey), Orlando Jones (getting all the best lines), Julianne Moore (accident prone) and Sean Wiillian Scott (goofball fireman wannabe). Backed up by Ted Levine, Dan Ackroyd, Ethan Suplee and Ty Burrell, pic is well served right across the cast list. Of course they aren't asked to do anything special, but it's not that kind of film. There's enough here for all the family to enjoy, kids will be awed by the array of alien creatures, whilst the adults should be chuckling away at some of the jokes.

Though I found the predictable comedy elements of this wore thin really quickly, it does offer quite a seriously thought-provoking look at just how warfare can affect a man. The constant pressures of remaining alert and vigilant whilst simultaneously dealing with day-to-day threat and tragedy are quite well illustrated in Mike Nichols' adaptation of the poignant Joseph Heller bestseller. There is a pretty stellar supporting cast, but their largely cameo roles augment rather than outshine the effort from Arkin as things gradually become more immediate for the man.

A young FBI agent (Keanu Reeves) is sent by his superior (Gary Busey) to investigate a surfer gang to find out if they’re a notorious group of bank robbers. Patrick Swayze plays the guru-like leader of the gang while Lori Petty is on hand as a surfer companion. John C. McGinley appears as the FBI chief. 

""Point Break"" (1991) is an action/crime thriller set mostly on the beaches of SoCal that obviously influenced ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) plot-wise. This is the better movie due to Swayze’s charismatic character and the interesting dynamic between Utah (Reeves) and Bodhi (Swayze), not to mention the relationship of Utah and Pappas (Busey) as well as Utah and Tyler (Lori). So, while this is a snappy, action-packed flick, it doesn’t forget to provide human interest. 

In some ways it’s even great with certain seeming plot holes easily explained if you think about it; others maybe not so much. 

Since it was made in 1990 it has an 80’s vibe (in a good way) with a pre-grunge soundtrack. Nirvana’s NEVERMIND wouldn’t debut until 2.5 months after its release.   

The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot mostly in greater Los Angeles (Malibu, Culver City, Santa Monica, Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach and Venice). The surfing scenes were done in O'ahu, Hawaii; the skydiving scenes at Lake Powell, Utah; and the closing Australian sequence at Cannon Beach, Oregon. 

GRADE: B+ || **Katherine Bigelow creates a beautiful complex action blockbuster with magnificent depth and chapters.**

Wow. Just wow. Point Break is a deep character-driven film full of top-notch action, mind-blowing stunts, and incredible performances. These actors made you fall in love and deeply care about each character and moment in the film. Each actor's portrayal was thoughtful, dedicated, outstanding, and worthy of much more acclaim and awards than received. This film transformed Keanu Reeves into an action hero, with Point Break only being the first of many 90s action movies he led, including Speed and The Matrix. Gary Busey nailed his mentor role as Agent Pappas. But the stand-out performance was Patrick Swayze as the cool and captivating Bodhi. His performance was shown brilliantly through his eyes, which said much more than any dialogue. Unfortunately, the real crime was Swayze didn't even get a nomination for this astonishing role. The complex relationship between Reeves and Swayze's characters as their friendship develops and their conflicting sides of the law is the focal point of the movie, providing an excellent foundation for the fantastic action sequences. Point Break is an incredible movie about friendship and justice, with skydiving action fight sequences, robbery heists, and chase scenes. Katherine Bigelow's film remains one of the greatest action and heist movies of the 90s and the inspiration for the Fast and the Furious franchise. || On this face of it, this ought to be rubbish... a testosterone-fuelled story of beautiful people who rob banks to fund their hedonistic lifestyle that largely revolves around anything that causes their adrenalin to rush, but it isn't rubbish. Kathryn Bigelow keeps the pace end-to-end, and both Keanu Reeves (""Johnny Utah"") and Patrick Swayze (""Bohdi"") are clearly having fun as the FBI agent pursuing the gang of rubber mask clad ""ex-president"" beach-bum robbers. Reeves is easy on the eye, but pretty wooden and sure, the plot has more holes than a string vest but the story isn't meant to be deep and meaningful. This is just a fun adventure escapade that sees our hero go surfing, sky-diving and the cinematographer is clearly in his element, too.

9967.0,Uncommon Valor,A group of Vietnam War veterans re-unite to rescue one of their own left behind and taken prisoner by the Vietnamese.,Seven men with one thing in common...,"Drama, War, Action",105.0,1983-12-16,en,6.24,202.0,1.6743,"Gene Hackman, Fred Ward, Robert Stack, Patrick Swayze, Harold Sylvester",Ted Kotcheff,"vietnam war, vietnam veteran, vietnam, post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), war veteran, fight, loss of loved one, heroism, based on true story, laos","Overall, Uncommon Valor (UV) is a less-flashy atypical Hollywood movie of ex-soldiers being reunited to form a team to rescue Vietnam POWs, using good (but not Oscar quality) humor, and decent near-realistic (but not memorable) special effects to tell a 2-part story of forming a rescue team which then performs their mission.

Decades after UV was produced, one could say that it's just another run-of-the-mill movie about rescuing Vietnam POWs; however, this was one of the earlier movies of this genre so I don't think it can be fairly compared with the rest of this ilk.  (E.g. Missing In Action was 1985 and the 2nd Rambo movie was 1986.)  UV isn't a typical Hollywood attempt at making a blockbuster, yet it did very well in the theater.  UV is noteworthy for being more emotional than its brethren; it's not a tear-jerker, nor is it a masterpiece drama since it is a bit light-hearted in many places and uses humor liberally. (The humor isn't comedy per se, I felt that its purpose is to reminder us that the characters are misfits and has-beens, ex-soldiers but not ex-warriors, and they're transitioning from plain vanilla real lives to what's normally reserved for elite teams of soldiers like Delta Force.

UV has a charm about it that most others lack. The acting isn't superb, but it's still very good.  It doesn't have tons of eye-candy special effects, but it does use them fairly appropriately to enhance the story; I'd even go so far to say that, unlike typical Hollywood movies of today, instead of dialogue and story gluing together a bunch of CGI action scenes, UV takes the opposite approach of using action scenes and humor to glue together the story parts and demonstrate that the characters are a bunch of misfits, aging former soldiers brought together for a rescue mission.  Patrick Swayze's character is unique here, really gung ho, kind of a counterpoint to the aging ex-soldiers.

The 1st half of UV tells a story of ex-soldiers coming together, overcoming their unique prejudices, and re-learning how to work together as a team.  Eventually, they form a fairly effective team and the rescue mission is a Go. The action scenes weren't very realistic, but they were still OK, certainly good at demonstrating how the character steadily became a team.

The 2nd half of UV is the rescue mission itself, not really anything spectacular and more typical of a Hollywood film.  It's not bad at all, just fairly routine, but done well, nonetheless.  The action scenes, in particular, are decent but not eye-popping or noteworthy of realism, yet they're sufficient for the story. (Of course, there are scenes which are a bit over-the-top, maybe worth a half-star ding in the overall rating.)

PS  This review is based on my having seen UV in the theater when released, augmented by my just having watched it again over 30 years later."

Other than Ridley Scott's brilliant Thelma And Louise 1991, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes has to rank as one of the finest films where the girls actually out buddy buddy the men!!

It would seem that a chief complaint with the film is that it has no similarity to Anita Loo's Broadway musical? And whilst I'm one for pounding on films for missing out crucial parts of source novels, I have no frame of reference as regards this films original source so therefore view with untainted eyes as it were.

Viewing it these days you have to admire the cheek of it all. I mean it really shouldn't work because on the face of it this is just a couple of showgirls taking a trip, but the blatant use of stereotypes for these two ladies is deftly funny. Monroe is absolutely perfect for the role of Lorelei, a woman purely out for the sparkle of diamonds and a man's bank balance, she is as much shallow as she is to die for gorgeous. Jane Russell is also sublime here, her Dorothy Shaw is witty and sophisticated and very protective towards her friend, yet she also needs to be loved and this shines out amongst the sarcasm and sharpness dripping off of her tongue.

The film works on more than one level, it's a sugar and sweet musical with glamour girls to feast my eyes upon, but also it works as a sharp piece of work when taking into account the era it was made. The 50s (my research and my parents led me to believe) were very much the time of family values being paramount, yet around the time of this pic's release, sex was becoming more of a topic to the people of the street. Playboy with Marilyn on the center was about to turn heads, and of course Kinsey and his report was just around the corner. So upon watching Gentlemen Prefer Blondes now I can't help thinking that Howard Hawks had his finger firmly on the pulse by throwing away the big show time of the source, and then making a film that saw the wind of change with people's attitudes.

Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but we get some tidy numbers from the girls and some sharp dialogue coupled with hilarious visual comedy. A very smart and astute film that's knowing of the times that were a changing, and featuring a dynamic female duo to rank with the best that cinema has to offer. 7/10 || Well there's a transatlantic voyage, a missing tiara, a private detective; a pair of sparkly dancers and a little courtroom drama - so something for just about everyone as we follow the antics of two American showgirls trying to make a living after the war. ""Dorothy"" (Jane Russell) and ""Lorelei"" (Marilyn Monroe) are working their passage as the latter woman takes a bit of a breather from her incredibly wealthy but just a little possessive fiancé ""Gus"" (Tommy Noonan). It's his millionaire father who is distinctly suspicious of his son's choice of bride so he's the one who hires the PI and so you just know there are going to misunderstandings galore on that front. Meantime, ""Dorothy"" has managed to attract the attentions of the American Olympic squad - a lot of fit, scantily clad young men who make her feel like a million dollars. Despite them being offered different temptations along the way, the two stick together like glue in the original depiction of ""sisterhood""! To be honest, the story isn't the best - it's an hybrid of lots of familiar scenarios all stitched together rudimentarily with the purpose of delivering an amiable vehicle for two women who do know how to entertain. 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" is the show-stopper from Jule Stein and Leo Robin amidst an otherwise rather unremarkable array of rather formulaic song-and-dance numbers, but these two do their own singing and synchronise perfectly as they dance their way through half a dozen numbers en route to a denouement that allows Norma Varden to get up onto her most snooty hind legs and for Charles Coburn to complete his few enlivening scenes as this thinnest of stories sails along effortlessly but, I have to say, forgettably. It is a classy looking film and oozes a charm that's well worth a gander."

I had previously heard a fair bit of hype down the years regarding <em>'Atlantis: The Lost Empire'</em> and now, finally, I can understand why. It is very good. My favourite part of it is the animation which is exquisite, especially across acts one and two with the great amount of detail. The characters are cool, while the premise is pretty fascinating.

Michael J. Fox is a superb cast as Milo, he is fantastic in the lead role. Honestly, none of the other voices stand out to me but that's not always a bad thing - especially in this film. There are no huge individual performances, away from Fox, but they all bounce off each other nicely.

The plot is very interesting, brought to life brilliantly by James Newton Howard's terrific score. It's not near the top of my Disney animated favourites, just through process of elimination really, but it certainly isn't majorly far off. It's a fun experience, one I'd recommend you see for yourself if you haven't done so already. || We start off watching the destruction of the legendary city before advancing several thousand years to meet ""Milo"" - a rather geeky young man whose grandfather had been obsessed with the mystery surrounding the lost continent. Gazillionaire ""Preston Whitmore"" recruits him on a perilous expedition to try and find the truth - so equipped with a submarine and a crew you just know have another agenda, off they go. The first forty minutes of this over-long adventure is much more reminiscent of something from Jules Verne, only spent on elongated character establishment scenarios, some borderline slapstick humour and by the time the film gets anywhere near it's sharp end, I could already feel a sense of ennui setting in. Michael J. Fox does inject some character as the young lad, and James Garner has his tongue firmly in his cheek as the completely untrustworthy ""Rourke"", but that can't really inject enough to create any sense of pace into this competently, but unremarkably, animated feature. The style of the artistry, though colourful, is clearly computer generated. The animations lack depth or texture and coupled with a really average storyline leaves this in a sort of Disney limbo. It is certainly not as bad as some that were produced ten years earlier, but it is still factory-style output that lacks for imagination and any of the traditional uniqueness that this studio used to deliver. It is watchable enough, but pretty forgettable."

It's not a perfect film, but one it's still of the better video game adaptations ever made.**

Lara Croft: Tomb Raider had high expectations to overcome with legions of die-hard video game fans wanting to see everything they dreamed of on the big screen. With a perfect lead actress and a director known for wild action films, Tomb Raider was brought to life in one of the most faithful video game adaptations ever made (for better or worse). This movie brought the 2000s-era Tomb Raider games to life with all the style and camp of the decade - Matrix glasses, grunge rock, mediocre computer effects, and over-the-top action. While it wasn't a mind-blowing epic, it was a fun ride that captured some of the Indians Jones meets James Bond style of the games. Angelina Jolie was born to play this role and nailed the look and strength of Lara Croft and looked like she had a blast doing it too. Throw in Daniel Craig before he was Bond and every video game movie's villain, Ian Glen, and you got yourself a ridiculous 2000s action flick that nails the Tomb Raider spirit of that time. With the same vibe and effects of the Resident Evil movie franchise, Tomb Raider has flaws, but it's still a lot of fun. Don't take it too seriously and you will have a good time. || I thought this was a good movie to bring to life from a video game. Angelina Jolie was the perfect person for this role.

She's at an auction where an ancient gizmo sells for way over the odds. She manages to procure said bejewelled object and next thing her house is being attacked and the piece is stolen. She now has to use all of her wits and considerable ninja skills to track it down and that involves following it's trail to an ancient site that's long been hidden in China's icy wastes. It's all very formulaic, yes, but with Daniel Craig and Iain Glen adding to the duplicity and even the odd appearance from her motivational dad (Jon Voight) it brings the video game to life quite enthusiastically. Jolie proves to be quite a charismatic lead and the visual effects do their job adequately mingling the ""Stargate"" with the ""Mummy"" quite impressively. Nope, it will never trouble a BAFTA jury but as a piece of adventure cinema it's perfectly watchable with a lively soundtrack and a constantly moving storyline."

Meanwhile the LAPD are trying to apprehend a radical group on the highways that targets semis and their valuable cargo. Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom’s babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.

“The Fast and the Furious” (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to “The Road Warrior” (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of “The Warriors” (1979) and “Torque” (2004) with the more serious air of “Grand Canyon” (1991) and “Training Day” (2001). (Yes, I realize “Torque” and “Training Day” debuted after this one; I’m just providing comparative references). 

Speaking of the tone, there’s no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.

Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.

The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent “Deep Enough” by Live.

The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).

GRADE: B || I can’t call this film a legend. The film, which gave a big push in such a concept as street racing and tuning cars. He raised interest in illegal races on the night streets, gave life to such a renowned game like Need for Speed: Underground, which in turn gained countless fans. And maybe the storyline is really simple and without frills, but its implementation is worthy of deep respect. || Point Break with cars! Sure it is a little cheesy but in the best way. Fun cast and fun premise. Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, and Brewster deliver a great movie.

In many respects I thought the movie was well made: the special effects, the deep thinking behind the plot, and the writing was mostly good.

And the end of the movie turns on that. Why would he wander off like that except to serve the plot?

His name says it all, his job being to ""pleasure"" women who want something that bit special. The two share his quest as the latter is pursued by the authorities - but can ""David"" reach his holy grail? This is heavily based on the ""Pinocchio"" story and that gives it a solid, potent and dark bedrock for a story of wishing for the moon. Osment is super here as the vulnerable but determined and lost lad looking for a mother's love and affection. Law also reminds us why he was ever an A-lister with an almost Astaire-esque performance as the ostensible wastrel who has more substance to his character than we might expect. The last half hour takes it's time, that could do with being tightened up - but the whole gist of this story of being careful what you wish for is otherwise well balanced between the drama, the emotion, a bit of technology and some fun too. It takes a swipe at the temporary culture that has prevailed for generations and maybe just reminds us that if it seems to good to be true, then it almost certainly is. Looks great on a big screen and is Spielberg at his most sensitively imaginative."

It's not what you're saying. It's all this stuff you're not saying. Insinnuendos.

Sexy Beast is directed by Jonathan Glazer and written by Louis Mellis and David Scinto. It stars Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane, Amanda Redman, Cavan Kendall, James Fox and Julianne White. Music is by Roque Baños and cinematography by Ivan Bird. 

Retired to the Costa del Chill Out, retired thief Gary 'Gal' Dove (Winstone) finds his tranquil existence shattered when menacing gangster Don Logan (Kingsley) arrives on the scene demanding Gal goes back to London to do another job. 

2000 saw a slew of British gangster films released. The success of ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" opened the door for film makers keen to do their bit for Brit Grit. As is always the way, quality varies, but the class of 2000 had a healthy rate of good 'uns, of which Sexy Beast is a proud operator. 

The story is very thin, very film noir, an ex bad boy doing one last job that risks everything he has settled down for, but there's a panache to how the makers construct the tale. It helps that it's boosted by a ferocious performance from Kingsley, who is given licence to unleash his dark half, as he swears, stares, gets violent and has a general disregard for anyone but himself. 

Director Glazer, in what was his film after breaking out from advertisements and music videos, shows a keen eye for stylist visuals and attention grabbing scenes. He opens with an outrageous sequence of Gal sun bathing by his pool, the sun burning down, and then a giant boulder thunders into view and lands in the pool! All set to the sound of ""The Stranglers"" single ""Peaches"". Quite a way to announce yourself in film. 

The first half of film is the best, set at Gal's Spanish villa, Glazer neatly frames the characters (Gal lives with his wife and his two friends from England live nearby) as they bicker and cower in the shadow of Logan, who wouldn't be beyond sending them all to hell if he doesn't get his way. It's sweaty and tense, a coiled spring like atmosphere tells us something is going to give - and it does. The second half of the piece is not so tense or thrilling, though the robbery has a whiff of genius about it, but the pay off works well because Gal has earned our respect, as has his fellow sun seekers. Sexy Beast is not just sexy (tongue in cheeks for the makers), it's beefy and brutal, but also strangely beautiful as well. Nice. 8/10 || The other day, my lady Tammy and I watched director Glazer's recent 'Under the Skin' and loved its otherworldly wackiness and ambience, and as I had his first two films on DVD, we decided that at the very least, this first one demanded immediate investigation. I've adored Ray Winstone's work since his early days working in the films of Sir Alan Clarke, and Ben Kingsley's always a treat. Watching the characters brought back such awesome memories of my teenage days, travelling throughout England and continental Europe in December, 1986, as well. We can't wait to hopefully check out 'Birth' later this week...This was definitely one of the best and most original British gangster movies since the likes of 'The Long Good Friday' and 'Mona Lisa' from that era... || Ben Kingsley is great in this ultimate comedy heist movie. He is sent to wrest ""Gal"" (Ray Winstone) and his wife ""Deedee"" (Amanda Redmnan) from their well earned retirement (from the criminal fraternity) in Spain. Initially, they want nothing to do with ""Logan"" and his scheme, but a series of almost surreal events and a negotiation that can really only be describe as unique (and vaguely devilish) soon have them reunited with ""Teddy"" (Ian McShane) and plotting away merrily. Meantime, ""Gal"" is having some really curious dreams - and he is soon struggling to differentiate between reality and his vibrant and menacing visions. The standard thread of the story isn't much to write about, but the characterisations do make a difference here. The usually wooden Winstone works really well contrasting his hard-nosed criminal with his almost sentimental love for his wife and family. She, an erstwhile ""adult entertainer"" proves just as robust as him and even the unremarkable McShane has something about him that reminded me of why he was ever a charismatic success in ""Lovejoy"" in the first place. The plaudits do, however, go to Kingsley. Aided by a humorous and pithy script, he delivers the frankly monstrous and obnoxious character with his tongue in his cheek and a thinly veiled threat never far from his lips. I loved the last twenty minutes or so as the thing comes to an head and with plenty of twisting and writhing going on, it's anything but predictable. None of my favourite acting talent here, but hats off to Jonathan Glazer for pulling off a clever and sophisticated, yet rough and potent drama."

An expert Chinese intelligence agent (Jet Li) is sent to Paris to help the head inspector (Tchéky Karyo) in apprehending a Chinese mob boss at a ritzy hotel, unaware that it’s a set-up. Bridget Fonda plays an American prostitute that “Johnny” (Li) develops a relationship with during the misadventure.

""Kiss of the Dragon"" (2001) is a big city crime thriller with the expected overdone martial arts action due to Li. It’s a modern mixing of “From Russia with Love” (1963) with the preposterous action of “The Gauntlet” (1977) and the martial arts of “Enter the Dragon” (1973).  It was Bridget’s second to last theatrical movie before calling it a day (although she also did some TV work in 2001-2002, like her final piece “Snow Queen”).

I like the fact that the protagonist, Liu Jian (Li), is confident and an expert fighter, but also very human, even meek, as a stranger in a strange land (being his first visit to Paris). The action is thrilling with a sense of style counterbalanced by some quality drama with Fonda’s character and her situation.
 
If I were to nitpick, some eye-rolling elements bring down the film’s quality. For instance, Liu Jian storms a police building, opens a door and suddenly enters a dojo full of martial arts guys ready to take him down. Why Sure!  Earlier, a British pilot grabs not one, but two Uzis to kill Liu Jian in the swank lobby, shooting up the entire place. Did he really need to cause mass devastation to kill one Chinese man? I'm sure the corrupt Inspector (Tchéky Karyo) wouldn't enjoy explaining the wholesale desolation to the mayor.   

Moreover, there are too many hip-hop songs on the soundtrack. I could see one or two (at the most), but they overdid it. It smacked of trying to be too ‘hip.’

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot entirely in Paris & nearby Seine-Saint-Denis, France.

The direction is apathetic at best. I watched it on an old DVD still bearing the BBFC’s cuts, so perhaps the visuals suffered there—but even Arrow’s restoration can’t polish this particular turd. Yes, the sexual violence still shocks, mainly due to how casually it’s presented.

""Beach Blanket Bingo” (1965) is the fifth beach party film by American International Pictures that released a whopping twelve such movies in less than four years from 1963-1967. I’ve only seen one other, “Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine” (1965) featuring Vincent Price, and didn’t like it. This one’s more entertaining if you’re in the mood for some innocuous 60’s beach-oriented fun that’s silly with a capital ‘S.’

The best parts are Lynde’s droll humor, the touching subplot featuring Bonehead and a mermaid (Jody McCrea & Marta Kristen), the scenic Malibu locations and the attractive female cast, highlighted by Bobbie Shaw Chance as the lass in a fur bikini and Donna Michelle as ‘Animal.’

For the real deal in SoCal beach flicks, check out the original “Gidget,” released in 1959 (I’m not talking about the two sequels or the TV series with Sally Field). “Gidget” is worthy of its iconic status as the first beach flick with surprising mindfood and no goofiness. No kidding.

RELEASED IN 1983 and directed by Hal Needham, ""Cannonball Run II"" is a car chase comedy about a second Cannonball Run race from the West Coast to the East Coast. The teams include JJ & Victor (Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise), Blake and Fenderbaum (Dean Martin & Sammy Davis Jr.) with other teams involving Jackie Chan & Richard Kiel in a submersible Mitsubishi Starion and Mel Tillis & Tony Danza accompanied by an orangutan. There are at least a dozen other notable co-stars in various roles: Jamie Farr, Telly Savalas, Sid Caesar, Tim Conway, Foster Brooks, Ricardo Montalban , Charles Nelson Reilly, Don Knotts, etc.

This is a fun turn-off-your-brain flick with an incredible all-star cast that’s worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, the script needed a rewrite with better jokes but the producers obviously didn’t want to blow the money. As it is, too much of the humor falls flat, but “Cannonball Run II” is still leagues better than comparable junk like “Smokey and the Bandit Part 3” (1983). And there’s a worthwhile sequence where Dom does an amusing Brando impersonation.

Moreover, the movie scores good marks on the female front with Catherine Bach jaw-dropping in form-fitting blue spandex during the first half, teamed with her Amazonian-ish partner Susan Anton (who’s no slouch in the beauty department). Bach looks like she was sculptured by God Himself. In addition, there’s Marilu Henner and Shirley MacLaine, who catch a ride with JJ & Victor, masquerading as nuns before revealing their real identities. MacLaine was 48 during shooting but still had a great figure.

Can Phillip persuade Madeline to leave this crumbling abode? will he himself be at the mercy of Roderick and the Usher curse?

Filmed in glorious CinemaScope with vivid colour photography from Floyd Crosby, based on a story from dark master writer Edgar Allen Poe, boasting Vincent Price in the lead role, and directed by Roger Corman with a budget worthy of his vision, House Of Usher (The Fall Of) is a highly eerie Gothic piece of work. 

Delightfully weird, the film covers a myriad of things to unease the watching public, curses, incest, burial alive, paranoia and sadistic intentions all sit together with Corman and Richard Matheson's Gothic leanings. In fact a huge amount of credit for the pic's subsequent success at the box office must go to Matheson, who took Poe's skeleton story and cloaked it with the previous mentioned strands to fully flesh out the piece. 

On the surface the picture probably shouldn't have worked, basically it's just four characters moping around talking grimly and waiting for the inevitable, but it's the house itself that is the story's major player. Corman utilising his widescreen trait to make the house disjointed and creepy in every frame, with the use of sounds also helping to keep the pervading sense of doom a very real threat -  the house does in fact become the monster of the piece.

All is not well in the House Of Usher, I hope you feel it as well. Amen. 8/10 || _**“It’s a mad house, a mad house!”**_

In the late 1830s, a man from Boston (Mark Damon) visits the ancestral manor of his fiancé out in the country (Myrna Fahey), but he finds her curiously ill and her older brother nigh insane (Vincent Price). What’s going on?

""House of Usher"" (1960) was the first of AIP’s gothic horror flicks of the 60s inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, eight of which were done by Roger Corman, but others were filmed by different directors, like “The Conqueror Worm” (1968), aka “Witchfinder General,” and “The Oblong Box” (1969). Others were Poe-ish in ambiance, yet had nothing to do with the works of Poe, like Corman & Coppola’s “The Terror” (1963). 

Speaking of which, most of these flicks didn’t follow Poe’s stories/poems very closely despite his name being linked to them. “The Oblong Box,” for instance, features a totally different story. Meanwhile the title of “The Conqueror Worm” was tacked on to “Witchfinder General” in America, along with a quote from Poe’s poem, merely to sell tickets. 

This one is closer to Poe’s actual story, “The Fall of the House of Usher,” although scriptwriter Richard Matheson wisely throws in some romance involving the protagonist and Roderick’s sister. 

While it was successful at the box office and kicked off the series, I found it (melo)dramatically tedious and one-dimensional despite the colorful gothic atmosphere. I suggest seeing “The Pit and the Pendulum” (1961), “The Terror,” “The Conqueror Worm,” “The Masque of the Red Death” (1964), “The Raven” (1963) and “Tomb of Ligeia” (1964) first. If you want more, check this one out too. 

AIP was basically the American version of Hammer in England, so devotees of Hammer horror should appreciate it.

The movie runs 1 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot at Raleigh Studios, Hollywood, with the fire-charred land done in Hollywood Hills.

Based around the real life experiences of journalist Richard Boyle, we are in 1980 and Boyle is not only in crisis torn El Salvador, he's also in it up to his neck.

It sometimes gets forgotten just what a great director Oliver Stone can be, strip away his ability to ruffle feathers on a seemingly perennial basis, and you find some pieces of work that are stark and striking for all the right reasons. Salvador is one such film, sometimes criminally forgotten, it remains to this day a searing tale of tension amongst the troubles of a Latin American hell hole. Boyle is right in amongst the implosion of a civil war, death squads and guerrillas from each side pull him from pillar to post as he tries to protect his Salvadorian girlfriend, while his friends and connections all are in peril purely for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Salvador triumphs mainly because Stone and his team have managed to capture all the building emotions of the main players, it's not just Boyle, it's the American government types, the press itself, and of course the crumbling Salvador people themselves, all things mold together in one big worrying pot boiler. James Woods plays Boyle and he is magnificent, managing to make an unlikeable character sympathetic, Woods (with Stone prompting for sure) clearly challenging himself to play out a career high. James Belushi also delivers his career best work, perfectly brusque and oblivious, his Dr Rock is the perfect foil for Woods' emotive Boyle. Then there is plaudits for Elpidia Carillo as Maria, charged with being the love interest amongst this carnage, she layers it perfectly for a very memorable performance.

Salvador bizarrely is at times a humorous picture, but the laughs are all of the uneasy kind, because ultimately Stone's attempt at getting into the nitty-gritty of troubled El Salvador, is a harsh, and at times, a humbling experience. 9/10 || With almost all things Oliver Stone...it gets political, and because of that you have people reviewing the politics and NOT the movie. Hate it or love it because of the politics...

...and politically I agree with the message in Salvador, but I'm going to try to keep all of that out of this and too the side. However, I do want to mention that the film dramatizes a few stories that should have gotten better coverage in the US.

Moving on, though, this is not unlike Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas...if it went entirely dark and realistic. You have a journalist and his buddy in a Hawaiian T-Shirt not going to the glitz and glam of Vegas in search of the American Dream, but rather going to Central America in search of the American financed atrocities.

And it is vaguely based on a true story and vaguely covers actual events from a dramatized perspective while asking the audience to be morally outraged at what they see...and it is horrific.

But when you really get here is WTC and Snowden on the other end, the movies following Alexander are Stone moving away from his cinematic hallmarks that made his films so great.

Salvador, but contrast, is Stone moving towards his beloved tropes, you can see him developing his technique in Salvador, and that almost works as a build-up onto itself if you're a fan of Oliver Stone's movies.

The dramatic cuts, and the tidal waves of A and B list supporting characters are still a few movies away, but you have a solid development of what Stone movies will one day become, but you have it with a young Oliver Stone intensity.

He was working hard back then, and it shows in Salvador. Nothing about the film is phoned in and it works if you agree with his politics or not, as a dramatic war film of the highest grade.

But, don't take any of that into account if you are a film major... because what you have here is Stone, crafting a war movie, on a shoe string budget, and pulling it off brilliantly. That should be the lesson any film student walks away with. Forget what the movie was about for a moment, look at the final product and then look at what he had to work with."

Essential for all cinephiles. A masterclass of acting, directing and cinematography. A dish to be savoured, exquisitely. || Ingmar Bergman's 1972 film <i>Viskningar och rop</i> (Cries and Whispers) was one of the auteur's major achievements of that decade. In a Swedish country house, the dying Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is visited by her two sisters, the sensual and impulsive Karin (Liv Ullmann), and the stern and frigid Maria (Ingrid Thulin). Though ostensibly there to comfort Agnes in her last days, they are essentially just waiting for her to die, as they are too more preoccupied with their unhappy marriages, their mysterious personal feud, and the specifics of dividing up the estate. It falls to Agnes' devoted maid Anna (Kari Sylwan) to provide any human warmth. One of the most emotionally touching aspects of the film is this contrast between the selfless love of a member of a despised underclass and the indifference (or outright disgust) expressed by Agnes' own family.

Bergman had made the transition to colour film with <i>En Pasion</i> of three years earlier, but <i>Viskningar och rop</i> finally exploits its possibilities. Red is ever present on screen, whether in the red wing of the house in which Agnes lies dying, the red transitions between scenes, or the vivid blood that flows in each of the sisters' flashbacks to the decay of their marriages. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is, as always, brilliant. And though one doesn't often think of the makeup artist in a Bergman film, whoever worked on this one deserves praise for making such a glamorous actress as Harriet Andersson (still in her late 30s then and quite glamorous) look convincingly decrepit.

Bergman considered <i>Viskningar och rop</i> one of his two greatest films, along with 1966's <i>Persona</i>. I must say, however, that I have never ranked it so highly. While <i>Viskningar och rop</i> continues to amaze me on every viewing, <i>Viskningar och rop</i> does tend to exhaust its overt symbolism and interpersonal dynamics right away, and I rarely come back to it. Furthermore, I feel Bergman wove too much of this film out of what had become stock gestures for him, such as incestuous siblings, and a man speaking about the need to trust God when he himself has lost faith. || There are certainly some very strong performances in this rather downbeat drama from Ingmar Bergman. ""Agnes"" (Harriet Andersson) is bed-ridden, dying of cancer and being tended by her two sisters ""Karin"" (Ingrid Thulin); ""Maria"" (Liv Ullmann) alongside their maid ""Anna"" (Kari Sylwan). The two sisters are pretty taciturn with each other; neither have particularly happy nor fulfilling marriages and the film uses the decline of ""Agnes"" as a conduit to reflect on their past lives, loves and on their own relationships. Thulin is particularly effective here, but the undercurrents of resentment between the siblings and their spouses (and the doctor Erland Josephson) are presented with a bleakness that I found all rather sterile. Watching their strife, I could not say that I was immersed with any feeling of involvement in their scenarios. Certainly the acting is penetrative, the intimate (though sometimes quite clunky) moving photography adds richness to the performances; but I found the story to be devoid of much humanity. Bluntly, I just didn't really care for any but the dedicated servant ""Anna"", who quite possibly loved ""Agnes"" more than the others put together. The last ten minutes are surreal - and they do finally put some bones onto this story, but until then I struggled with this rather angst-ridden tale of middle-class foibles and values. Maybe when it was made 50 years ago, it had potency. Not so much now."

Mike Hammer is driving down a dark highway when a half naked blonde forces him to stop, this event sends Hammer spiralling on a journey that may have a cataclysmic consequence for all involved.

Kiss Me Deadly is a harsh movie, it contains an array of characters that are dislikable in the extreme, nobody can be trusted, and everyone on the surface appears to be selfish in their respective motivations. Taking in torture, murder, violence on tap, and a wonderful mystery plot, it's not hard to see why the film has gained a massive reputation as the years have rolled by - where although it's brutish in substance, the film is a damn riveting piece of work.

Ralp Meeker is excellent as Hammer, a character who refuses to lay down, he gets knocked down constantly, but he gets back up tougher than before, he becomes the kind of hard boiled guy who hits first and then asks questions later. The direction from Robert Aldrich is perfect, off-kilter camera work drags the viewer into this skew-whiff world that Hammer has entered, and we often only see shots of the bad guys torsos so as to make them faceless thugs. It's down right aggressive film making that hits the requisite thriller mark.

Kiss Me Deadly has influenced many others since its release, be it ""Repo Man"" or ""Pulp Fiction"", the impact is still being felt today. Containing a much talked about ending (both the restored and alternate endings work on differing levels to many), it's a film that leaves things up for discussion and debate, but what we do know for sure is that it's explosive and crowns what is now firmly established as a crime classic from the film noir splinter of film making styles. 8.5/10"

Still like a democratic drawbridge: going down for everybody. 

The Lion in Winter is directed by Anthony Harvey and adapted to screenplay from his own play by James Goldman. It stars Peter O'Toole, Katharine Hepburn, Jane Merrow, John Castle, Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton, Nigel Stock and Nigel Terry. Music is by John Barry and cinematography by Douglas Slocombe.

1183 A.D.: King Henry II's (Toole) three sons all want to inherit the throne, but he won't commit to a choice. His sons and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine (Hepburn),  variously plot to force him into a choice - but he himself has is own agendas as well.

An utter lesson in theatrical tropes shifted to the screen with brilliant results. Set over the Christmas period, Henry II has called all the family together to the family castle in France, for what proves to be a blindingly sharp game of human chess.

Essentially it's one giant family squabble of huge political importance, a conniving dynasty war that could shape history. The script sizzles with literate smarts and firey dialogue, with performances from the top draw, while costuming, set design and Barry's melancholy score seal the deal for what is a true genre classic. 9/10 || Katherine Hepburn is simply superb in this depiction of the truly dysfunctional relationship between Eleanor of Aquitaine, the estranged queen of England's King Henry II and her spouse. Peter O'Toole reprises his characterisation from ""Becket"" (1964), and together they spar and spat with aplomb. Aided by a wonderful screenplay from James Goldman that is full of sarcasm, pith and some wonderfully effective (and brutal) put-downs, we play through this most bizarre of family dynamics. It all centres around a Christmas court for which the Queen is released from her Salisbury house arrest to join the couple's three sons: the ambitious, but sexually ambiguous Richard (Anthony Hopkins), the King's favourite, but pretty weak John (Nigel Terry) and the clever, silent-type, Geoffrey (a lovely, understated, effort from John Castle) at Chinon, where they will also be joined by the young and naive Philippe II, King of France (Timothy Dalton). Director Anthony Harvey now presents us with a stylish and quickly paced illustration of just how this devious, untrustworthy and potentially murderous family were prepared to conspire and manoeuvre to ensure who, eventually, succeed to the English throne. Hepburn and O'Toole have a distinct and effective chemistry between them. She has the best lines, I think, and delivers them with a razor sharp wit - you are never quite certain what either she, or her equally and skilfully manipulative husband are plotting as the sons prove to be pretty selfish, fickle and sometimes quite imbecilic. The film looks great, the sets and costumes are spot on and the whole thing offers an excellent appraisal of the antics of a collection of shrewd 12th century despots."

A recently divorced blonde bombshell in Reno (Marilyn Monroe) befriends three guys and stirs their passions: An aging cowboy (Clark Gable), a cynical bush pilot (Eli Wallach) and a brooding rodeo contender (Montgomery Clift). They take an excursion to capture wild mustangs for profit. Thelma Ritter is on hand as a fifth misfit in the first half.

“The Misfits” (1961) was Gable and Monroe’s final film and Clift’s last significant one. Gable passed away a few days after shooting from a heart attack while Marilyn died 18 months after its release. Clift was dead by 1966. Even Ritter died before the 60s were over.

It’s a B&W drama with Western elements and haunting reflections on the nature of life and death, reminiscent of those Tennessee Williams’ flicks of the era, like “The Night of the Iguana” and “The Fugitive Kind.” The characters are lost souls who drown out their pain with lots of drinking and shallow socializing. Monroe is voluptuous and charismatic; and there are thematic gems here and there, like Gay’s potent commentary on doing something with pure intentions while society pulls a bait-and-switch and it becomes morally dubious or outright bad. The film’s also a fascinating period piece.

FYI: Director John Huston originally wanted Robert Mitchum for Gable’s role, but by the time they worked the kinks out of the script Mitchum was busy with another project. The writer, Arthur Miller, was Marilyn’s husband during shooting, but they were officially divorced 11 days before its release.

GRADE: B+/A- || This is a belter of a film that reminded me of just how imposing Clark Gable could be on screen with a strong part and a decent script. He is ""Gay"", a tough but pretty past-it cowboy who is hanging out with his buddy ""Guido"" (Eli Wallach) leading a pretty aimless existence with a lifestyle that is gradually withering on the vine. That all changes when they encounter the flighty ""Roslyn"" (Marilyn Monroe) who has arrived in Reno to get a divorce. Briefly, a bit of a love triangle develops and despite them moving to a house that ""Guido"" was building for his late wife, she sets her hat at ""Gay"" instead, and a relationships starts to burgeon. Both men still have the wrangling spirit, and when a small herd of mustangs is spotted, they want to catch some (to sell on for dog food!), but for that they need another. Fortunately, en route to a rodeo they encounter the broke and stranded ""Perce"" (Montgomery Clift) and are soon chasing down the horses in the Nevada desert - much to the horror of ""Roslyn"". There are quite a few tussles in this well paced and creatively shot drama with all four characters having issues with the others that test their loyalties, integrity and spirit - as well as offering us just a soupçon of romance as the story concludes and choices have to be made. As ever, Thelma Ritter contributes well - though only at the start - as their broken-armed pal ""Isabelle"" but it's really just the quartet that gel effectively for this robust and characterful story and  who keep this entertaining for just over the two hours. I never really got why Monroe became such a star. Very attractive, yes, but not really much of an actress. Here, though, she ups her game a bit and is much better - more natural - than usual. There's quite a duel between man and horse at the end that's almost worth watching the whole film for too. Good stuff!"

Obsession is directed by Brian De Palma and written by Paul Schrader. It stars Cliff Robertson, Genevieve Bujold and John Lithgow. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Vismos Zsigmond.

You either love him or hate him, it seems. Brian De Palma that is. He's an amazing stylist who made some piercingly great thrillers in the tradition of Maestro Hitchcock, or he's a knock off artist using style to hide his inadequacies as a story teller? One thing for sure, for a good portion of the 70s and 80s his films would not be ignored, for better or worse depending on your own proclivities of course.

Obsession, as has been noted numerous times, is De Palma's homage to Hitchcock's masterpiece, Vertigo. It's not a straight out copy as some reviewers have somehow managed to convince themselves, but narrative drive is similar. Robertson in grief for a passed on wife (Bujold) and daughter meets a doppelganger (also Bujold) of his dead wife 16 years down the line and becomes obsessed with her. As the new woman reciprocates the attraction, the relationship becomes wrought and borderline unhealthy, reaching a crescendo when muddy waters are stirred and revelations force the can to open and worms to spill everywhere.

When remembering that for a long time Vertigo was out of circulation in the 70s, Obsession was sure as hell a good second option for anyone hankering for a superbly stylish thriller boiling over with psychological smarts. Even if you buy into the style over substance argument, what style there is here though. Roving camera work, up tilts, haze surrounds, canted frames, pan arounds, dream shimmers and personalised focus. Add in the splendid use of New Orleans and Tuscany locations and Herrmann's sensually dangerous score (lifted in part and re-worked from Vertigo) and it has style to burn. While the big reveals at pic's culmination are in turn intriguing and daring; even if the original ending planned would have really put the cat among the pigeons and made for a more potent piece ripe for heated discussion.

Lead cast are on fine form, Robertson plays it superbly as a wistful and damaged wastrel, guilt and obsession seeping from every pore. Bujold is just darling, a telling twin performance that actually doesn't demand to be noticed until late in the play. While Lithgow stomps around the edges of the frame like some shyster lawyer whose tie is on too tight.

11906.0,Suspiria,An American newcomer to a prestigious German ballet academy comes to realize that the school is a front for something sinister amid a series of grisly murders.,Do You Know Anything About Witches?,Horror,99.0,1977-02-01,it,7.5,3016.0,3.8781,"Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci, Miguel Bosé, Barbara Magnolfi",Dario Argento,"witch, boarding school, germany, ballet, whodunit, young woman, gothic, evil, coven (akelarre), ballet school, dance school, dance academy, giallo","There seems to be a never-ending feud between many horror fans regarding 'Suspiria', due to the fact that this film is considered Dario Argento's outstanding masterpiece. Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.

'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple: in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, like I said before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways.

So concluding: 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen. Enjoy this dark fairy tale about witches and childish girls. || If you can, check out the Synapse remaster. Seems to be the only one that gets the colors right, and the little-heard 4.0 English mix is absolute insanity || This is my favourite movie in the world. I love it so much that I have a Suspiria tattoo, it got me into movies - into Italian horror which is one of my favourite things now. 

This is a masterpiece. Nothing will ever come close to this movie’s cinematography and soundtrack. Many people comment on the ‘style over substance’ aspect of Suspiria (and some of Argento’s other films), but I don’t see it as a flaw. It’s an experience. I don’t care if everything makes 100% perfect sense, when I put Suspiria on I feel transported to another world and that’s the best kind of movie. One that can just take you away from the real world. 

Suspiria is oddly comforting to me. I guess it’s that taking me away from the world feeling. It feels like a hug which I know isn’t what Argento was going for, but hey, apparently people ran out of theatres screaming in the 70s and I’m just a freak.

Would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I can’t imagine not liking it. I get that the dubbing and the cinematography or whatever may be a little jarring at first as beautiful it is, but go in with an open mind and let yourself get lost in the beautiful world of Suspiria and I can’t see anyone at least not somewhat liking it.

Nothing I could ever say could sum up how much I truly love this movie."

In order to do this, he used the existing footage with Lee, also used stock footage from previous Lee films and got a double and shot new footage with a new story line.

The result is a choppily edited film despite getting Hollywood actors such as Dean Jagger and Gig Young as well as John Barry to do the musical score. In fact Jagger gets some awful dialogue.

Honestly though, if you are walking into it now...it's a bit dated and in the cheesiest possible way. But then, even in the 80s it was trying hard to be cheesy, just, unlike it's peers, some of the cheese didn't age well.

Fortunately though, it holds it's own in that little notch, the Black-Fu subgenre of blacksploitation, and it holds its own in the funnest possible way.

The Bad Guys are over-the-top and hysterically so. The hero is brilliantly naive and pulls off the wang chung with an ease that is convincing for a kung fu movie. It's choreographed extremely well for the budget, making the action believable and blends seamlessly into the humor and cheese.

If you watched it as a child in the 80s, it will remain on of your absolute favorite films. If you're seeing it for the first time, well, it's not exactly timeless, you won't love it as much, but there is still enough there to amuse you and keep you entertained, it's still worth the time to watch."

This is a quiet and quirky movie, and may not appeal to some viewers. Certainly it differs from 95% of the movies being made these days. But what the heck, our tastes are all different, right?

William Hurt gives the restrained performance the role calls for, playing a man who has disconnected from his feelings so as to avoid the pain of thinking of his deceased son. He writes travel books for people who don't want to ""go local"" when they travel to other countries, but rather want to feel as comfortable as if they never left home. His character's siblings are even more eccentric than he is. I won't spoil anything by saying how. I will say that near the beginning of the movie is a scene between Macon and his wife about loss through violence that resonates in this age of mass shootings.

William Hurt is at his best as Macon, wound up tight and denying the presence of emotions. Kathleen Turner is good as his wife. The movie has its share of slightly off center characters, in a good way, and Macon’s brothers and sister are no exception. You will perhaps recognize David Ogden Stivers and Ed Bagley Jr. in two of those roles. Geena Davis plays the wild card in this movie, an unconventional dog trainer who somehow sees something in William Hurt's character to want to try to pull him out of himself. Geena won an academy award for her role, as I recall, if you care about such things. Her character is, yes, you guessed it, also eccentric, so that might be a lot for the average viewer to take in. They could have done a bit more with her son, as he almost seems like plot device at times than a character. They might have overdone it on his allergies.  Geena Davis is perfect as Muriel, who is at once flaky but solid when it is important to be. Her face is expressive. In fact, without spoiling anything, right near the end you see her facial expression change and show her feelings much more effectively than giving her 25 quirky words.  Another quiet difference about this movie is the soundtrack. It doesn’t go the Big Chill or most other movie routes: cherry-picking pop or rock hits to accompany scenes for thirty seconds each and then gather on a soundtrack album. Instead, at certain times during the movie, the instrumental thread of music introduced at the beginning is repeated to stress the scene. It is a nice touch.

This movie is a quirky sum of all the quirky characters, so give it a try; it might all grow on you."

It turns out she is ""Sarah"" (Jodie Foster) and after a passer-by takes her to hospital we learn that she has been gang raped in the games room of a bar. Deputy DA ""Murphy"" (Kelly McGillis) is assigned to the case, and although she believes her client, she is reluctant to prosecute as she doesn't think she can win. Her DA boss ""Rudolph"" (Carmen Argenziano) insists that they must change the accused three men with something, so they settle on a lesser charge after some plea bargaining. Needless to say, ""Sarah"" is livid, and tempers really flare when one of the other men from the bar that night, goads her into ramming her car into his. This is the point when the ambitious lawyer has a bit of a volte-face and despite the objections this time of her boss, she initiates a prosecution of the others in the bar for egging on the rapists - criminal solicitation. Can she prove these men are guilty? If so, that will also ensure those who got off lightly will also end up serving full sentences and have the nature of their sexual assaults placed on their criminal records. Foster is impressive here. She offers us a compelling portrayal of a young woman who suffers an heinous assault and struggles for justice. McGillis also delivers well, as does Bernie Coulson - the young ""Ken"" upon whom much of the chances of conviction rest. The graphically violent scenes towards the end of the trial stages are harrowing, disturbing and effective, and they also provide for an unnervingly nauseating performance from the vocal architect of her assault ""Scorpion"" (Leo Rossi). The drama is tough to watch, and offers food for thought as to just how victims can ever receive fair treatment in a legal environment that all too frequently takes a ""was she asking for it?"" approach, and is so oft just automatically stacked against them."

This was one of the movies he took me to see as like the father-son bonding time. And I can understand why, no one loved pulp novels more than my dad and when it came to picking things the word ""Adventures"" really played to his pulp trash sensibilities.

I might have inherited a bit of that.

This was my first introduction to Gilliam, and from there it opened up Monty Python and all kinds of craziness right down to effecting some of my reading habits. So, as a child, this movie had a profound effect on me.

It was funny, it was an adventure, it was silly, it was deep (deep enough where even an 8 year old can sense there was more going on than he could understand at that age) and it was one of those movies that dad and I could both enjoy as father and child, for two different reasons...

.... now, however, that's probably an inappropriate thing to do and I am certain that if I bonded with my kids the way dad bonded with my sister and I, I'd get arrested for taking them to see a movie like this.

So we watch these things at home. Because, whatever, I have complete and total faith my kids are smart enough to know what a movie is and emotionally equipped enough to deal with this type of fun.

At any rate, this was brilliant and I still hold it in high esteem because it introduced me to Gilliam and that opened a lot of doors for me."

An ex-CIA martial artist, is now a vice squad detective in Chicago (Steven Seagal) where he and his new partner (Pam Grier) investigate a drug ring, but are shocked when the drug lord (Tony Salvano) is let go by the Feds, which can be traced to his nemesis in the CIA (Henry Silva).

""Above the Law” (1988) was Seagal’s cinematic debut. He claimed he picked the movie from a pile of scripts that Warner Brothers had lying around for Clint Eastwood. I bring that up because the film is basically the next generation in Eastwood’s detective thrillers, just mixed with the martial arts and general plot of “Code of Silence” from three years earlier. That one had the same director, as well as the same actor in the villain role, Silva.

Sharon Stone is on hand as the protagonist’s wife and she looks great, but her role is decidedly peripheral since she was still fairly unknown when the film was shot in the spring/early summer of 1987. Grier has a much bigger part and she said this is one of her personal favorites in her oeuvre because she actually got to act.

Seagal proved right out of the gate that he had the masculine screen presence to star in an action thriller. His movies kept making more money until he achieved his greatest box office success with “Under Siege” four years later, followed by “Under Siege 2” and “Executive Decision” in the mid-90s. His career then took a downturn to mostly direct-to-video productions.

The story gets a little convoluted, involving the assassination of a nosey Chicago Senator, but at least no one can say it’s a simpleminded action flick. It’s thought to be the first American film to feature Aikido in fight sequences. 

It runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in Chicago. The aerial scenes of the Southeast Asian jungle were filmed in O'ahu while the jungle scenes featuring the actors were done at Warner Brothers’ backlot in Burbank.

Two preadolescent girls meet on the beach and become lifelong friends living on two different coasts. The brassy CC Bloom (Bette Midler) is a performer living in New York City while the classy, but reserved Hillary (Barbara Hershey) lives on the West Coast. Bubbly Mayim Bialik appears as the 11 year-old version of CC in the opening act while likable John Heard has a fairly notable part.

“Beaches” (1988) is an 80’s “chick flick” that throws in drama, realistic comedy, romance, Broadway entertainment and music. It’s also known as a tearjerker, but it didn’t literally move me in that sense, although I’m sure it would some people. It effectively shows the ups and downs of a long-lasting friendship. Fans of Midler or Hershey will no doubt like it more than me.   

The film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot California and New York City.

GRADE: B-/C+ || ""Beaches"" is an earnest and well meaning film throughout that always favours the overbearing and self important Bette Midler at the expense of the much more insipid Barbara Hershey as it endeavours to tackle the notion of a friendship which spans decades and supersedes all other considerations, but such a misplaced and lofty ambition as this is often an almost impossible aspiration to realistically achieve during a two hour period so we are consequently rushed through a sketchy succession of highs and lows of two lives with no real sense of any emotional bonds developing or being ruthlessly torn asunder during the passing decades and no opportunity to really get to know about any of the characters and subsequently there is no reason to care about what happens to any of them in an unmemorable and superficial film which is an amazing underachievement on every level. || There's something quite uncanny about the resemblance between the young ""CC"" (Mayim Mialik) and Bette Midler who plays her adult self in this quite touching story of lifelong friendship. That all starts when this ordinary youngster meets the well-heeled ""Hillary"" (Marcie Leeds then Barbara Hershey) and despite being from opposite sides of the tracks, they begin to bond. The former has a love of all things showbiz but isn't exactly getting her name up in lights as she gets older. Her friend had a much better starting position and builds up a successful legal career as well as having a daughter with a man that they are both rather keen on! Things take a much more serious turn for the couple, though, when some bad news puts all of their lives in a perspective that requires both women to readjust for what's now inevitable. It's one of those stories that shows quite effectively how difficult lifelong friendships can be to maintain. They write to each other, they meet now and again, but it's never a straightforward momentum that keeps them aligned nor one that prepares them for what life throws at them. The characterisation of ""CC"" allows for Midler to belt out a few memorable numbers along the way - ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" and ""Under the Boardwalk"" maybe being the two best suited for her powerful vocals and it stays just the right side of sentiment allowing the pair to portray quite distinctly powerful characters emotionally, sometimes comically, and engagingly."

Biloxi Blues is directed by Mike Nichols and written by Neil Simon. It is based on Simon's semi-autobiographical 1985 play of the same name. It stars Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Penelope Ann Miller, Corey Parker and Matt Mulhern. Music is by Georges Delerue and Bill Butler is the cinematographer.

The second part of Neil Simon's Eugene Morris Jerome trilogy, the plot centers around Eugene's (Broderick) draft into the United States Army during the last year of World War II. Sent to training camp at Biloxi, Mississippi, Eugene is thrust in amongst people from all walks of life. Here he will not only learn about life, but also have it changed for him.

Straight from the off I have to say that this has become one of my favourite films of all time. From the moment I first caught it back on release, where I only went to see it because it was written by the guy who wrote The Odd Couple, I have without fail been humoured and charmed every year since. On synopsis it seems to be yet another run of the mill coming of age picture, or just another tales from the boot camp time filler, but with Simon holding the pen and Nichols painting the narrative with careful nostalgic splendour, Biloxi Blues is much better than it's often given credit for. For it's a film that is that rare old beast that strikes the right balance between laughter and sentiment. 

""It was hard to believe these guys had mothers and fathers who were worried about them"" 

Although this is primarily Eugene's story, film is propelled by the bubbling concoction of a group dynamic. At training camp Eugene and the other lads have to face up to a number of challenges, not just growing up into men, but learning about bigots, bullies, homosexuals and intellectuals, all while under the borderline crazy command of Sergeant Merwin J. Toomey (Walken). They may all be different personalities and from different backgrounds, but one thing binds them together, that none of them want to be there! In other hands this group would have consisted of annoying stereotypes, but Simon and Nichols, courtesy of the writing and the garnering of acting performances, ensure this isn't the case. The audience isn't short changed with these characterisations because they are stripped down to being survivors by way of humour and naive honour. Thus it never feels false. 

""I wasn't in on that Pearl Harbour thing"" 

One of America's most celebrated film critics said Biloxi Blues contains limp dialogue! That's something which I certainly can't begin to comprehend. For the film is an advertisement for witty retorts, where often responses are used as a survivalist tool, to de-heat a flare up or to hide nervousness. In this respect Biloxi Blues pays big on revisits, each time another little one-line gem registers where previously it had been missed, maybe because we are too focused on the airy sound track first time around? Or most likely because we are too lost in a ""Eugene"" or ""Toomey"" facial moment. One of the best passages in the story concerns a last week on Earth game the lads play, the writing is sharp, yet tender, funny, yet telling. It really is a case of laugh whilst being drawn into the frightening reality that these boys are a long way from home, with the very real possibly they soon could be fighting for their lives in some muddy trench. 

The cast are uniformly strong. Walken delivers one of his quintessential mania turns, marking Toomey out as being one click away from either sane or insane. Broderick holds court and narrates with earnest style, while Corey Parker is a revelation as intellectual Arnold Epstein, a guy who no matter how much he is persecuted by Toomey and the other rookies, refuses to be shaken and lose his principles. Miller and Park Overall get the two female roles of note, both memorable in short appearances, with the latter deliciously dry as a hooker with a heart. In the support there's macho mirth from Mulhern (stomach of a goat) and Markus Flanagan (he calls his mother Louise), homespun mystery from an excellent Michael Dolan, and wistful tunings from Casey Siemaszko as Don Carney (can anyone count on him?). 

The ending doesn't quite have the dramatic impact that many would expect, and there is indeed some mellow periods of tinted nostalgia that will have some viewers urging the pace to go faster, but these are mere fly specks on a mound of horse droppings. Biloxi Blues, a wonderfully rich comedy drama, and to my mind the best thing Simon has written. 10/10"

Bent on financial success, a young ex-soldier (Tom Cruise) becomes an expert bartender in Manhattan while attending college in order to make it on Wall Street. Then a dream surfaces to establish a nightclub in Jamaica. Bryan Brown plays his cynical mentor while Elisabeth Shue and Lisa Banes are on hand as romantic interests.

“Cocktail” (1988) is an entertaining Cruise-led 80’s flick that starts energetic, amusing and shallow but, thankfully, fleshes out the characters for something deeper. It’s fun in a snappy way, yet hindered by a feeling of unreality in the first half, which is resolved in the second.

Brown is reminiscent of Michael Caine while Shue is in her prime, although her beauty isn’t fully captured as it was in “The Karate Kid” and the later “Leaving Las Vegas” (the fools). Laurence Luckinbill shows up in the last act; he would go on to superbly play Sybok in “Star Trek V: The Final Frontier” the next year.

The ending is fine, but a bar is a bar, a place where people get soused. You can make a good living from it, sure, but does that benefit or deter humanity in the grand scheme of things? 

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in Toronto and Ocho Rios, Jamaica.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._ || I didn't enjoy it as much as expected, but <em>'Coming to America'</em> is nevertheless still good.

Eddie Murphy is unsurprisingly the star of the film. Any notable scenes include him, which isn't a shock given the obvious and the fact he plays a number of characters; on that note, only Akeem amused me - the barber shop guys... not so much, to be honest.

James Earl Jones (Jaffe), John Amos (Cleo) and Frankie Faison (landlord) are the most noteworthy in terms of those away from the lead, while there is even an appearance from someone named Samuel L. Jackson - what ever happened to that guy?!

I wanted/anticipated much stronger humour, if only due to Murphy's presence. I can't say I laughed that much, which is disappointing. The romance parts are probably more memorable to me, even if it's kinda familiar in those regards. With all that said, I can see why loads thoroughly enjoy this - it just didn't fully land on me, personally.

Still worth viewing and I'm very much up to see the sequel. || _**My all-time favorite comedy**_

In ""Coming to America"" (1988) Eddie Murphy plays the likable prince of a rich African kingdom, Akeem. He comes to Queens to find his future queen accompanied by his best friend & servant, Semmi, played by Arsenio Hall. He understandably wants a wife who will love him for who he is and not for his great riches. So they get hired at McDowell's, a McDonald's knock-off, where he meets the shining daughter of the owner (Shari Headley). Is she the one? Will she find a fast-food mop boy appealing enough to marry? 

As noted in my title blurb, ""Coming to America"" is my all-time favorite comedy. Why? Simply because it's a laugh-riot from beginning to end. The first time I saw it was on TV in 2000 and I couldn't stop laughing; I saw it again last night (after purchasing it) and it had the same effect.

Everything works here -- the characters, the jokes, the story -- to make ""Coming to America"" one of the greatest comedies ever made.

This film also seems to have an inexhaustible number of places to go and by God it insists upon dragging us all along to those places as Burns gleefully swears on the radio and successfully prices himself into the higher echelons of the top salary bracket, but above all this it is a thoroughly entertaining and well engineered film which never really loses any of its enthusiastic momentum until the very end and this is vitally important especially for a comedy."

He was!

D.O.A. is directed by Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton and adapted to screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue from a story by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene. It stars Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan, Daniel Stern, Charlotte Rampling, Jane Kaczmarek and Christopher Neame. Music is by Chaz Jankel and cinematography by Yuri Neyman.

A loose remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name, the story finds Professor Dexter Cornell (Quaid) staggering into a police station proclaiming that he is dying because someone has poisoned him. Told in flashback by Cornell, we see the events that led up to the point he was poisoned, but not who did it, and then track the frantic Professor as he tries to solve the who done it mystery before he keels over and dies.

Not as bad as the poor box office returns suggest it is, D.O.A. is still very much a frustratingly shaky experience. Lifting only the basic idea of the 1950 movie, the makers stamp their own mark on the premise but add too many red herrings to the already fishy stew. Some plot developments are daft, as is the casting of Meg Ryan in the key femme role - seriously she is just too cookie cute and homely for this material - while the motive reveal is a bit much to swallow. Yet there's still a lot to enjoy and sample here for the neo-noir faithful.

Visually the picture is stylish and appreciative to its noir roots. Opening in black and white to set the story in motion, Jankel and Morton then infuse the film with angled shots and frame distortions. Shadows often come into play, with Venetian blinds and roof rafters impacting, while the addition of a spiral staircase late in the day is most pleasing. Quaid is ever watchable in what is a tricky role that calls for him to garner sympathy whilst not being likable! While elsewhere Stern and Rampling provide good characterisations, even if as written the roles are too small given the importance the characters have to the plot shenanigans.

A bit over cooked on the page, and basically a race against time thriller dressed up in neo-noir clothing, D.O.A. is still none the less worthy of a viewing. 6.5/10"

Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is directed by Frank Oz and written by Dan Launer, Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning. It stars Michael Caine, Steve Martin, Glenne Headly and Anton Rogers. Music is by Miles Goodman and cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.

Two con-men from different ends of the spectrum, prey on women's good nature to fund their lifestyles. Both operating out of the same Mediterranean town, they agree that the town simply isn't big enough for the both of them. They strike a bet where the first one to get fifty thousand out of the chosen female target, gets to stay in town while the other has to leave.

A loose remake of Bedtime Story (1964) that starred David Niven and Marlon Brando, Frank Oz's picture is deliciously amoral, sly, clever and very funny. Boosted by the casting of Caine (oily slick) and Martin (live wire bottom feeder), who are both having a wonderful time of it, the film unfolds in a whirl of bluffs, chaos conning and oneupmanship. The story is slight for sure, but as the comedy set-pieces come and go, the ribs are tickled and the surprises that the makers have in store for us late in the day, are truly inspired. The French Mediterranean makes for a visually pleasing backdrop, while Goodman's score is consistently upbeat and perfect for such mirthful shenanigans.

They are dirty, they are rotten and they are definitely scoundrels, but once your belly has subsided form the laughter, you may find yourself wondering just how the makers got you to cheer on such shifty characters?! The answer? Inspired casting and smooth construction of plotting by the director. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a real joy. 8/10 || Sometimes I’m just looking for a laugh. That’s when a movie like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is the perfect fit.

This is one of my go-to movies if I’m looking for some hearty laughs while not having to think too deeply. || ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is terrific fun all round and the luscious locations look absolutely gorgeous - the sun kissed French Riviera has never looked more inviting. The humour is genuinely funny and Michael Caine in particular  is obviously enjoying himself tremendously in the guise of Doctor Emil Schaffhausen - he takes great pleasure in torturing a wheelchair-bound Steve Martin, especially during one scene where he vigorously whips his ankles repeatedly using a length of cane. It could have been a major miscalculation telling us from the outset that this film is all about con men. This information leaves you forewarned and continually on the alert during every twist of the story, but that is never a consideration on this occasion. The guile used to construct the film combined with the final pay off is completely unanticipated in what can only be described as a wonderful slice of satisfying entertainment which has been expertly produced."

She actually managed to integrate herself into the mountain gorilla community - this results in some superb shots of the mountain gorilla in its natural habitat and it is genuinely difficult to differentiate between what could possibly be mechanical special effects and the real great apes - and it soon begins to seem as though her gradually all consuming work supersedes many other aspects of her life (she even begins to refer to the gorillas and the mountain they live on as her own) and she willingly sacrifices a blossoming romance with the photographer Bob Campbell in order to stay on the mountain with the gorillas to study them. Dian Fossey achieved recognition through her work and this film ends with the fact the gorilla population continues to multiply as the enduring spirit of her accomplishments lives on, but this coda is juxtaposed with the sobering knowledge that her untimely death remains a mystery."

The duplicitous plot and character choices just didn't sit great with me.  Having recently seen ""Brother Nature"", it is interesting to see a movie that could have inspired it.  I think it would have been a lot better with John Candy as an overwhelmingly positive buzzkill and Aykroyd playing a family man.  But Candy is sort of the family man of the late 1980s, and Aykroyd is the quintessential New York scumbag, and they do it well.

I'd ultimately say it is worth the watch, but there are probably a dozen ""back to nature"" movies I could recommend in front of this one. || ""The Great Outdoors"" is only a moderately entertaining film, although it does feature the unforgettably spectacular sight of John Candy water skiing. The grizzly bear action also works well and there is always an enthusiastic energy about this film which every member of the cast effortlessly maintains, but in terms of John Hughes's output this entry is not one of his more memorable outings and some of it does feel like miscellaneous bottom drawer material that has so far gone unused until now. He has done a reasonable job of using such material - if this indeed happens to be the case - as the basis for a mildly amusing film which is as watchable as it is because of Dan Aykroyd and John Candy.

When the first group of travelers is bused-in to spend the night it turns out that the ancient citadel is actually haunted. The rest of the cast includes the likes of Steve Guttenberg, Beverly D'Angelo, Jennifer Tilly, Liam Neeson, Daryl Hannah and Peter Gallagher.

""High Spirits"" (1988) is an outrageous horror comedy in the mold of ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" (1967), ""The Vampire Happening"" (1971), “Young Frankenstein” (1974), “Elvira, Mistress of the Dark” (1988) and “Elvira's Haunted Hills” (2001). It ranks with the best of these even though it failed at the box office.

Director Neil Jordan said that the movie released is very different from the one he shot, pointing out that he was excluded from the editing process of the final cut.

Beverly D'Angelo and Jennifer Tilly are of course highlights on the feminine front, but more shoulda/coulda been done with them (not talkin’ about nudity or raunch). Still, enough was done with them.

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot at Dromore Castle, County Limerick, Ireland. I’m sure a lot of it was also filmed in the studio.

GRADE: B || ""High Spirits"" was a part of the exciting and ever growing renaissance that was taking place within the Irish film industry. And rightly so. It brings some unique and quirky Irish humour brilliantly to life on the silver screen for a much wider audience to wholeheartedly indulge in and thoroughly enjoy. It was amongst an expanding number of productions being produced back then which reached a much higher level of success than in previous times. And why shouldn't it have been so? After all, the Irish had the talent both in front of the camera and behind it to be able to work in any given genre of film and when the results turn out to be of this calibre where the infectious comedic enthusiasm of the cast never wanes and there are some wonderfully wacky set piece sequences loaded with humour which the audience can  relish then  Irish cinema deserves all the hard earned plaudits and success accorded to it."

RELEASED IN 1988 and directed by Bud Smith, ""Johnny Be Good"" is a high school comedy starring Anthony Michael Hall as Johnny Walker from central Texas, America's most wanted football prospect. Should Johnny take one of the tempting offers from scores of talent scouts or should he attend the local state college with his babe (Uma Thurman), giving up his football dream? Paul Gleason plays his dubiously motivated coach while Robert Downey Jr. is on hand as his amusing bud.   
 
If you remember Hall from “Sixteen Candles” (1984) and “The Breakfast Club” (1985) you might think he would be too geeky to play a quarterback stud, but he’s older here and more beefed up, not to mention 6’2”. He and Downey Jr. have great chemistry and the movie scores pretty well on the feminine front with Thurman in her debut, as well as Jennifer Tilly, Hayley Ladner (Juicy Dorfman) and some other peripherals. On the other side of the spectrum, Steve James is a stunning example of masculinity as the coach at the state college (too bad Steve died so young from cancer of unknown origin). Jim McMahon has a quality cameo. 

While there’s some semi-serious drama, the tone is often silly, but the movie’s kinetic and offers numerous laughs. Anyone who criticizes the film for being goofy might as well criticize water for being wet. Unfortunately the story’s awkwardly uneven and there are curious lulls. If the script were tightened up this could’ve been a hit in the 80’s teen comedy genre.

Lastly, the flick features a fun rockin’ soundtrack with the likes of Judas Priest’s “Johnny B. Goode,” which plays over the end credits.

Directed & written by Ken Russell and loosely based on Bram Stoker’s novel, “The Lair of the White Worm” (1988) chronicles events in England when a young archeologist (Peter Capaldi) uncovers a skull of some unknown beast near a bed & breakfast run by two sisters (Sammi Davis & Catherine Oxenberg). These three and Eve’s beau (Hugh Grant) soon stumble upon an ancient snake cult led by the eccentric Lady Sylvia Marsh (Amanda Donohoe), who dwells at a lavish estate nearby.

The movie is a creative and entertaining creature feature reminiscent in tone & theme of “Squirm” (1976), but with Russell’s well-known offbeat excesses. The “creatures” are vampire-like snake people plus a gigantic serpent at the close, both of which recall the snake worshipers & giant serpents from “Conan the Barbarian” (1982).

There are some iconic cinematic images, like Donohoe as the vampiric snake lady, not to mention a few well done horror scenes, like a snake woman who’s cut in half, but still wiggles with furious intent. 

The snake cult is diabolical in an anti-Christ way and I can see why some viewers might find the movie shocking and offensive, like the weird nun-raping flashback. Yet everything's so exaggerated and sometimes cheesy with a bit o' humor thrown in that the film can't be taken very seriously, which negates it from being shocking or disturbing. Fun in a horrific way? Yes. Disturbing? No. Also, keep in mind that horror villains/monsters are SUPPOSED to drip with ee-vil and be shocking. The question is, do they win or do the noble protagonists win?

On the female front, the chief snake lady thinks she’s hotter than she really is as Donohoe amusingly hams it up. Meanwhile Catherine Oxenberg as Eve is a semi-highlight, particularly in the last act.

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot entirely in England (Hertfordshire; Manifold Valley, Staffordshire; Peak District National Park; and Derbyshire). Thor's Cave in Manifold Valley is magnificent.

Benjamin's career as an actor has often reflected that of someone like Clint Eastwood in a lot of ways. They only specialised in playing a particular type of character for the most part and this undoubtedly restricted their choices principally because they may not have coincided with audience expectations concerning what they might have wanted to see them appearing in, but they have now successfully managed to extend their range into other genres as a director and apparently with great acclaim.

The closing moments of this film are also very arresting, especially when we discover the revelation that no matter how their relationship may have begun Tim (Rob Lowe) really did fall in love with Olivia (Meg Tilly) and not just her money and as you would expect this incredibly well paced film - like many others preceding it - benefits greatly from John Barry's haunting musical score which has been beautifully tinged with a memorably subtle and a genuinely heartfelt melancholia. || **_Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to…_** 

A wealthy heiress in the Hamptons (Meg Tilly) falls for a handsome yacht captain (Rob Lowe), but there are human vultures seeking her fortune. John Glover plays her jerk stepfather while Doug Savant is on hand as a friend from her youth who’s also a local police officer.

""Masquerade"" (1988) is a ‘hip’ drama/romance with crime thrills and sweet Long Island locations, not to mention sailing sequences. It bombed at the box office because the studio was in chaos and the president’s wife hated “all that sex,” which resulted in Lowe not starring in another studio film for years. 

Aside from Meg on the female front, there’s Kim Cattrall as the yacht-owner’s adulterous wife and Dana Delany as the girlfriend of the stepfather. There are a couple of R-rated sex sequences and the corresponding nudity.

As a plus, there’s a good message on the power of love to redeem a person from corruption. But there’s just so much duplicity going on it’s hard to relate to most of the characters. It’s almost comical how the heiress remains blitheful while evil people are swooping all around her. More reality and less movie-isms would’ve made for a better film. Still, it’s worth checking out if the above piques your interest. 

It runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot on Long Island (Riverhead, Sag Harbor, Shelter Island, Southampton Village and Broadview) with some bits in Manhattan.

A low-paid widowed scientist (Dan Aykroyd) makes contact with aliens and they send an agent (Kim Basinger) to meet him.

Alyson Hannigan plays the winsome daughter while Jon Lovitz is on hand as the researcher’s annoying brother.

“My Stepmother Is an Alien” (1988) is cut from the same cloth as the contemporaneous “Earth Girls are Easy.” Although it’s not as good and has a strange off-kilter vibe, it’s vastly superior to future duds ""2001: A Space Travesty"" and ""What Planet Are You From?"" (both from 2000). While I’m not a fan of Basinger (I don’t NOT like her either), she does comedy surprisingly well, better than you would expect. 

This was the feature film debut of future “stars” Alyson Hannigan and Juliette Lewis, as well as one of Seth Green’s early movies. The roles of the latter two are almost unnoticeable. Meanwhile, whoever wrote the script loves Jimmy Durante.

There’s a surprising scene involving porn that, while it doesn’t get outrageously out of hand (and I could care less about its inclusion), it seems out of place for a warm-hearted family flick.

""Jasmin"" seems to have purifying effect on the place, she even - must to the chagrin of her host - tidies up, and gradually that soothing, friendly and considerate attitude wears down the hysterical and moody ""Brenda"" giving the film a certain comfortableness to it. That's not to say it's dull, but it does show us a little of just what some human kindness and consideration can do where it's least expected and that's despite finding sceptical and strong-willed characters who just want to keep doing things as they always have. There's an amiable chemistry between the two women here, Pounder keeps her enthusiasm on the right side of dominating, and Palance brings a gently comedic je ne sais quoi to the proceedings making for a film which makes you smile rather than laugh, and concludes with the ultimate exposition of never judging a book by it's cover..."

Only thing holding it back was the pairing of Schwarzenegger and Belushi never quite worked for me. Still a good flick from Walter Hill, though not sure it ranks all that high compared with others from the era. **3.5/5** || Look out Chicago, Arnie & Jimmy are loose on the streets.

Captain Ivan Danko (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a no nonsense Soviet cop who is sent to Chicago to pick up a murdering Russian drug dealer. Upon arriving in the windy city, Danko is teamed with Art Ridzik (James Belushi), a wise-cracking street cop notorious for cutting corners to get the job done. Complete polar opposites, both men form an unlikely alliance as Danko's Soviet methods blend with Ridzik's free spirited street wise techniques.

There were quite a few buddy buddy films around in the 1980s, certainly the teaming of unlikely cop partners was nothing new at the time of Red Heat's release. Yet for all it's obvious reliance on clichés, and its out dated Russian/American guffaws, Red Heat is a romping, violent and funny picture. Pairing the big Austrian Oak Schwarzenegger with the Americana that is James Belushi pays off in bundles. Yes it's sometimes crass, but Belushi's cocky mannerisms play off Schwarzenegger's robotic frame with comedic joy. All played out in amongst carnage and murder created by director Walter Hill, who is quite frankly, and thankfully, just extending the formula that he started in 1982 with 48 Hrs.

The support cast is not to be sniffed at either. Peter Boyle, Ed O'Ross, Laurence Fishburne, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Brion James and Gina Gershon. All line up to add fuel to the Arnie and Jimmy fire. Also good to see is that Hill shot on location in Illinois and Moscow to give the film some scenic impetus, whilst James Horner's score is suitably bombastic and at one with the material. It's no rocket scientist who observes a film like this and calls it popcorn fodder, because it so obviously is. But within its buddy buddy framework lies a very quotable film that's essential for fans of Arnie & Jimmy. Sometimes that's all one needs from a film like this. 7/10 || I am not sure how much actual acting Arnold Schwarzenegger had to do in this rather derivative crime caper. A bit like John Wayne in ""Brannigan"" (1975), he is despatched to partner up with a cop abroad to order to repatriate a dangerous criminal. In this case, though, he is a Russian and it is wise-cracking American ""Ridzik"" (Jim Belushi) that he must bridge the culture-gap and work with to track down a murderous drug dealer who did for his partner and fled. To be fair to Arnie, he has his tongue a bit in his cheek here, but Belushi just mis-fires once too often in this rather sloppy adventure. The escapades are all rather predictable and the underlying joke/scenario wears thin all too quickly. I suppose it nods a little to the thawing in the post-Reagan relationship between the USA and the Soviet Union, but the delivery borders on the slapstick at times and I was never really a fan of Belushi's brand of rather puerile comedy - indulged in spades here by a trio of writers including the usually far more reliable Troy Kennedy Martin. It passes the time effortlessly enough, and reminds us who lived through that period of just how dodgy some of our fashions were, but thereafter it's all pretty mediocre fayre."

I don't hate <em>'The Man from Snowy River II'</em>, but there's nothing I truly liked about it either. It spends the first 45 minutes dragging out the love squabble between Jim and Jessica, for no reason as it's blatantly obvious where it's all going - yet they decide to do a will they/wont they for a huge chunk of the film. Once that gets sorted, it does get a tad better. Still, the premise isn't that great at all.

Cast-wise it's OK, even with the sizeable absence of Kirk Douglas; who played a dual role in the original. Despite Douglas not reappearing, the character of Harrison does return - with Brian Dennehy. Should've killed him off instead to be honest, story would've felt more different and fresher in my opinion. Meanwhile, Tom Burlinson (Jim) and Sigrid Thornton (Jessica) are, again, decent.

Quite interesting that Disney decided to pick up the sequel. In the opening scene or two there's a kid involved, which made me fear they were going to fully dumb it down to be family friendly with a bunch of children onscreen. Thankfully, they don't.

Spoorloos (AKA: The Vanishing) is directed by George Sluizer and Sluizer co-adapts the screenplay with Tim Krabbe from Krabbe’s own novella The Golden Egg. It stars Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu, Gene Bervoets, Johanna ter Steege and Gwen Eckhaius. Music is by Hennie Vrienten and cinematography by Toni Kuhn.
 
It’s a lesson in creeping unease, a film firmly interested in character development as it unfurls a tale of obsession whilst casting a clinical observation of a sociopath at work. Story is basic on plot terms, young lovers are separated during a vacation when the girl mysteriously disappears. So begins her boyfriend’s obsessive search that spans years, then things get intriguing as the person responsible for girls disappearance starts sending the boyfriend messages, giving him the run around, until the question is asked. Just how far are you prepared to go to find out what happened?
 
The script is brutally clever, we follow two parallel lives, that of emotionally torn boyfriend Rex Hoffman (Bervoets), and that of sociopath Raymond Lemorne (Donnadieu), the latter of which is a family man moving freely amongst his loved ones whilst simultaneously practising his perfect crime. Lemorne is a very different type of sociopath to what normally fills out horror movies, he’s sometimes a figure of fun, even inept, but he beats a black heart and as Rex Hoffman is going to find out, he’s very methodical in his belief that he was destined to enact a perfect crime.
 
Sluizer builds the picture very slowly, only turning the screw an inch at a time. He lets Spoorloos chill our blood not by jolt shocks or stalk and slash histrionics, but by the very fact that Raymond does what he does just because he can. While the disintegration of Rex’s emotional being is terrifying in its realism, what gnaws away at him also gnaws away the audience, so when the coup de grace comes at film’s end, the impact is like being run over by a tank. Great direction is matched by great acting from the principal players, to seal the deal for Spoorloos being a truly excellent thriller that’s well worth seeking out by those after a bit more thought in their thriller viewings. 8.5/10 || George Sluizer's 1988 film <i>Spoorloos</i> (The Vanishing) is the story of a murder and the search for the killer, but it's not a whodunit for the audience at any rate. Just after Saskia (Johanna ter Steege) disappears at a French rest stop while vacationing with her boyfriend Rex (Gene Bervoets), the audience sees the long chronicle of local chemistry teacher Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu) preparing to carry out a murder of some random woman. As the film rises towards a climax, we follow Rex's obsessive hunt not for justice and retribution, but for simple understanding of what happened to his love. It is that unquenchable curiosity to know the very details, to indirectly share Saskia's fate that drives Rex forward on a dark quest. <i>Spoorloos</i> is widely known for its twist ending, and I'd recommend avoiding spoilers before you watch the film. I myself was spoiled, but still, Rex's doom was played very different than I imagined.

Rex is something of a one-dimensional figure who exists purely to carry out the philosophical conundrum that is the plot. Lemorne is the truly detailed character, even if I find some of his motivations hard to swallow. Donnadieu plays him convincingly – I really came to despise this character. It is interesting that his initial attempts to abduct a victim, though played buffoonishly to a rather comic soundtrack, don't lighten the mood (as in, say, the black comedy of Edward Gorey), but rather make us squirm even more.

Though the twist ending makes this film memorable, and Donnadieu and, to a lesser extent (for she has little screen time) Steege's acting is fine, I wouldn't rank <i>Spoorloos</i> so highly. The cinematography is plain, and there's little re-watch value. Still, this is worth seeing once."

When was the last time your city was torn apart by a towering metal penis?

A button-down wage earner and his girlfriend are driving in the city when they hit a man. They then cart him to a field and dump him. Seems the two were having sex while driving, and their hit-&-run arouses them still further until they are having sex at the scene in the full knowledge that their (presumably dying) victim is watching them.

The next morning, salaryman finds his cheek has sprouted a shiny metal zit. Soon he'll be having scary encounters with transformed strangers and having sexually charged nightmares of his girlfriend as a demonic hermaphrodite (or at least sporting a bionic strap-on of more than regular size).

What's going on here?

Shinya Tsukamoto's 1989 professional debut is a retelling and expansion of his homemade short Futsu Saizu no kaijin (“Monster of Regular Size”). It's more of a primal scream of suppressed rage and lust than a movie, really. With no budget to speak of, Tsukamoto has drawn on techniques not too removed from early Sam Raimi and applied them to an inspired vision of urban Hell that could the same neighborhood from Eraserhead, with a heavy dose of Cronenberg's body horror, Tetsuo seems to draw influence from manga and the pioneering days of Mtv (think Talking Heads videos). Tetsuo is filmed in stark black and white 16mm, lending a grain to convey the grit and inhuman decay of Tokyo city, and maniacally edited to the point that it's difficult to follow without several viewings. the images are of a world buried in the debris of society, metal refuse of every sort heaped and heaving like a fungus over civilization, nothing natural in sight but for the human body itself. Tetsuo has a sound design that matches its frantic and disjointed look. Feverish in pitch and tone, what not many mention when talking about the movie is that Tetsuo is also wickedly funny. Tsukamoto infuses it with a sick sense of humor from absurdist to slapstick.

So what is really going on? That's up for interpretation. Some see an anti-homosexual plea at work, others see it as pro-gay (Tsukamoto, a humanist with an empathetic bent, is far from the type to deliver a message of intolerance). The director claims that it grew from his love/hate relationship with the city itself, living removed from nature. The facts of the story are that the man hit by the wage earner has a fetish for metal and a sexual appetite for violence. He had already tried to fuse his body with bits of metal inserted under the meat of his limbs. When he sees the driver's lusty response to having hit and nearly killed him, the fetishist sees a kindred spirit and becomes infatuated with the driver. He begins to harass the man through bizarre psychic methods (we see his POV, memories, and messages to the businessman via televisual imagery), an insane courtship aimed at bringing out the salaryman's latent sexual thirst for destruction. The driver's transformation of psyche manifests in the man's biological body becoming more and more am abstract mass of iron. More than that and you're reading what you want into the film. It's highly suggestive but never explicates itself. 

Tsukamoto structures his tale around two men and a woman, the same setup he's reused for the bulk of his early screen career with the woman often transformed through her relationships with the men. What I find fascinating in Tetsuo (Is that the name of the fetishist or the salary man? I don't know!) is that the business drone seems to have an ambivalent attitude about sex and possibly women (he flees an encounter with a prim businesswoman in the subway, though admittedly she's pretty damn scary) while the metal fetishist positively identifies with women and female sexuality, choosing to use both the girlfriend and the subway patron as his avatars, and ultimately appearing as an androgynous punk sprite during his final seduction.

Testsuo is not my favorite from Shinya Tsukamoto, but it gets better every time I see it. In fact, the first time left me exhilarated by the ferocity of it but lukewarm to its substance. I've now seen it a number of times, and it...grows on me. Tetsuo would make a great double-feature with Cronenberg's Crash. || Just another Japanese-language, surreal, horrifying, chilling, gross, sadistic, industrial sixty seven minute nightmare in glorious black and white. What can I say about the plot? A victim of a hit-and-run accident has his revenge on the couple that ran him over. That sounds like a pitch to an average Hollywood movie, and it has been done, but ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" quickly leaves all safe Hollywood ingredients in its wake. The victim somehow gets the male driver to slowly turn into a raging machine. It starts with a small wire sticking out of his cheek. Soon, he is being chased in a subway terminal by a woman with the mechanical affliction. He escapes her, but still tries to make it with his girlfriend. In the film's most horrific scenes, he grows a giant ugly drill, and the two spend many minutes both trying to kill and love each other. Halfway through, we find out what the victim is trying to do, and the climax involves the two men joining together in more ways than one.

Surrealism is so hard to describe- quick, give me the plot of ""Un Chien Andalou,"" but this film is one of the most violent films I have seen. So much can be read into this, from machines taking over our world, to impersonal love relationships, but all in all, director and writer Tsukamoto stuns the viewer with eye imploding visuals. The stop motion special effects work well, and everyone involved seems to be in actual pain in many scenes. The makeup and mechanical costuming are top notch, and the music totally kills- not quite heavy industrial, but not just another rock soundtrack, either. There is not a lot of blood here- there are torrents of it. This is a blood monsoon. The soundtrack has little dialogue, and the sound effects consist of a lot of metal scraping metal, which had me climbing the walls. Watch for the now infamous scene as the unnamed man feeds his girlfriend breakfast. ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" is a hard core sci-fi/horror fan's dream, I'll never curse my car or microwave again."

Based on the real-life story of Preston Tucker from the late 1930s-1950, the genius inventor (Jeff Bridges) designs the Tucker 48 sedan, aka the “Tucker Torpedo,” an automobile way ahead of its time with aerodynamic style, padded dash, seat belts, pop-out windows, fuel injection and disc brakes. He rounds up a team, develops the prototype and starts producing cars in his Chicago factor. But this didn’t sit well with the Big Three automakers in Detroit and the politicians & sharks (lawyers) in their pockets; so they try to squash him like a bug with a smear campaign and legal attacks.

The setting is historical (mostly taking place during the 40s) while the tone is fun & snappy and the pace is quick, akin to “Seabiscuit” (2003), which shows that the movie itself was ahead of its time. It was released in 1988, but has a timeless feel, like it could be released today, no kidding; probably because it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, a genius in his own right. 

Speaking of Francis, he was probably attracted to the story because Tucker’s experiences parallel his own in the movie business. The big shots who run any industry don’t want some new guy, virtuoso or not, waltzing in to their territory and taking a piece of their pie, making them look bad in the process. Tucker’s story parallels independent prodigies in any industry, like Trump strolling into D.C. and stirring up the slanderous ire of the Demonic-rats and their Left-leaning media, not to mention the RINOs.

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes and was shot in the Bay Area, California.

They are works of art in there unique style and quality.  This is actually my favorite of all of them.  There could be a criticism that this movie is didactic and sends some sort of clumsy  political or philosophical message but I'd have to reply that you simply don't get it. Unlike the modern propensity for movies to try to hammer home some political point or perspective, the message here is only window dressing.  The message may (or may not) be important but instead of getting caught up in some sort of self-important moralizing, let's remember this is a movie - and a SciFi action movie at that. (that is the approach in my opinion) If I would compare movies to literature or movie makers to authors I'd compare Carpenter to Hemingway - although Carpenter specializes in anti-heroes and sometimes over-the-top characters, while Hemingway is understated. They are analogous for their own medium.  This is action, sci-fi but like Hemingway's stories, this is a man's movie. Straight forward. Fun at times, brutal at times and even funny at times. Keep a watch out for one of the great one-liners in movie history when the star is in the bank - only peripherally related to ""bazooka.""  A+ to Roddy Piper as well. When I first saw this movie I had zero expectation from him.  Now I wish he'd have made a lot more movies... || Life's a bitch and she's back on heat!

They Live is directed by John Carpenter who also adapts the screenplay form the short story Eight O'Clock in the Morning written by Ray Nelson. It stars Roddy Piper, Keith David and Meg Foster. Music is by Alan Howarth (and Carpenter) and cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe.

Unemployed drifter Nada (Piper) wanders into the city looking to find work, but upon finding a unique pair of sunglasses he sees a different world to everyone else. It's a world frequented by an alien race who are using the Earth for their own nefarious means.

See The Truth!

Carpenter does subversive sci-fi and it's a whole bunch of fun. Stripped back it's evident that They Live is Carpenter's wry observation on the politico posers who endorse the rich getting richer and everybody else sliding down the pole; to where they stop nobody knows! It's also a blatant paean to the glorious years of the 1950s when paranoia based sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features ruled the air waves. It's also a wonderfully macho driven action movie, laced with comedy as well. You can rest assured there will be plenty of shooting, punching, dodging and spoken lines to make you smile.

Piper is no Kurt Russell, but we shouldn't hold that against him because he fills the role nicely. With muscular frame, 80s hair and a quip on the tongue, he is most assuredly a Carpenter leading man for the 80s. Alongside him is the reassuring presence of Keith David, himself a beefcake and also one of the coolest muthas on the planet. It's easy to believe that these two can save the planet, even after nearly beating each other to a pulp during a prolonged side-alley fight sequence, where Carpenter doesn't miss a chance to parody professional wrestling. While away from the beef, Meg Foster gets the lead lady role, with those amazing eyes nestling in perfectly with the world Carpenter has created.

Carpenter does political? Yes, but it's not the be all and end all of his intentions. He wanted to make an action sci-fi schlocker with sly politico undertones as motives. And that's exactly what he did. Joyously so. 8/10 || They Live is a great movie that delivers an exceptional story with a dystopian vibe that is both thrilling and terrifying.

John Carpenter's screenplay was ahead of its time in terms of its social commentary on American capitalism and the class divide. The film's story explores how a small group of people has taken control of the world by using subliminal messaging and manipulation, making it a unique sci-fi tale that is still relevant today. I particularly loved how the film built tension and hysteria in many scenes, such as the protagonist's discovery of the truth behind the hidden messages.

The performances in the film were okay, with some being better than others. Keith David and Meg Foster's performances stood out as impressive, bringing a sense of intensity and authenticity to their roles. On the other hand, Roddy Piper's performance was pretty corny, but it worked well for the film's B-movie style. Of course, nothing beats the iconic line ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum.""

John Carpenter's direction was top-notch as always, with the ten-minute fight scene between John and Frank being a standout moment. The choreography was fantastic, and the lack of cuts made it a thrilling and believable engagement. The film's score was pretty basic, but it added a subtle tension to the entire movie and had a distinctly 80s feel to it. Carpenter's vision on analyzing American capitalism and the rich was very refreshing, and it's clear how he felt about the American way, which is still very relevant 35 years later.

In conclusion, They Live is a great movie that combines a unique sci-fi story, impressive direction, and memorable performances. Its themes and message remain just as important today as they were when the movie was first released.

As long as you know what to expect, and really that shouldn't be too hard to do when you are getting ready to watch a movie that has Danny DeVito & Arnold Schwarzenegger as twin brothers!

Julius (Arnold) & Vincent (Danny) are the result of a genetic experiment that should have realised the perfect child, instead they were born as twins, separated at birth and both went on to lead different lives. Julius was raised on a gorgeous island, he is greatly educated and knows no fear of the world, Vincent on the other hand is a low class womanising weasel from the big city. Upon learning of having a twin brother, Julius sets off to the big city to find the brother he never knew he had, trouble is, is that Julius has no comprehension of city ways, and coupled with the fact that Vincent really isn't the brotherly kind, this only compounds the situation further.

Twins is a very tidy piece, the two leads play off of each other very well, and as dumb as the plotting is, it sure as hell makes for a good fun night viewing. Female gravitas comes in the form of the sultry Kelly Preston and the criminally undervalued Chloe Webb, but really the film's charm is all down to the little and large act of DeVito & Schwarzenegger, plenty of laughs here. So open the ale, chomp on the popcorn, and leave the brain at the door. 7/10

Yakety Yak, Yakety Yak. || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend, if you're okay with a date movie.

This movie holds up surprisingly well.  It is dated quite a bit, just the dollar amounts they mention are off, and car phones and pay phones.  I give full credit to the delivery of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito that keeps this movie enjoyable after all this time.

The premise is almost laughable in 1988, but since then we've come so far as it actually being possible that this moves from science fiction to realistic fiction.

Yeah DeVito's character is awful on the redeemable side, and Schwarzenegger is comically pure, but it's about using both extremes to find a middle ground in the solutions to our problems.  It is also about families reuniting, and strengthening bonds: it's a touching story when you get past the comedy and gunfire.

Worth a watch if you can stand a trip in the way back machine to 1988. || Fun and all around enjoyable comedy that doesn't devolve into cheap humor (i.e. constant jokes about their height for instance) and instead two opposites working well off of one another.

A basic action movie from the '80s but it doesn't hold up.

Plot

An American soldier with special skills gets posted to an island base where someone keeps hijacking military convoys. When his convoy gets hit, he's cooperating right up until someone hits the Colonel's daughter, and then he intervenes. His memory of his childhood is mostly gone from an explosion on an island, but he has obviously had training. When the hijackers send Ninjas after him, it becomes obvious though that his skills are way more than just simple techniques.

What I Liked

Some of the basic fight scenes are fine, particularly between Joe and the Black Star Ninja. And the opening sequence is really well done. There's a scene where they shoot arrows at him, and he uses the handle on a shovel to deflect their trajectory...highly iconic and when I first saw it as a kid, I was hooked.

What I Didn't Like

I rewatched it recently, and it just doesn't hold up. As I said, some of the basic fight scenes are good, but the fight scenes with guns seems more like a Stephen J. Cannell TV show where a million bullets are fired but nothing ever hits its target. In addition, some of the stunt work is either done at low speed, shows that it isn't the actor doing the stunt (particularly a motorcycle jump), or in one case, requires a helicopter to hover in place for about 5 seconds for the stunt man to get ready to jump on the front. || The acting is terrible, the scripts and dialogue are terrible, the plot is [extremely] shallow.
But, I love this movie... from the 1st time a watched it (a straight to VHS video tape).

Black Rain is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Craig Bolotin and Warren Lewis. It stars Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia, Ken Takakura, Kate Capshaw, Yusaku Matsuda and Tomisaburo Wakayama. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jan de Bont.

After New York cops Nick Conklin (Douglas) and Charlie Vincent (Garcia) arrest a sword wielding psychopath named Sato Koji (Matsuda), they are tasked with escorting him back to Osaka in Japan. From here they are plunged into a war that is brewing in the Japanese underworld.

You see there's a war going on here and they don't take no prisoners.

Welcome to Blade Runner's younger brother, Black Rain, a Ridley Scott film I feel has never received the credit it deserves. Viewing from the outside it looked like one of those 1980s cop movies, one where the main cop is washed up and perched on the edge of oblivion, his partner his sanity and voice of reason. However, Scott (brought in late to direct when Paul Verhoeven bailed) wasn't interested in the normalities of the cop drama, he saw the potential for cross continent culture clash and the chance to bring his visual skills to the fore.

Yep, it's the big neon glitter of Osaka and the grime and dime of New York that is the big draw here, but characterisations are still rich for the drama, with Scott taking plenty of time to set up the lead protagonist. We know Conklin's troubles, we know how tight his friendship is with Charlie, and by the time things go grim and dour in Osaka we understand just why Conklin plunges head first into a do or die situation.

Visually Scott infuses the picture with cramped locales, steamy streets, industrial wastelands and blood red suns, while his lead character is an unshaven trench coat wearer who still manages to look devilishly cool. It's perhaps the drawing of Osaka that is the most impressive, for it's an alien creation to us as much as it obviously is to Conklin, the ignorance gap between America and Japan still wide apart in 1989.

Complaints? At just over two hours in running time the film does have periods of flatness, where some better editing wouldn't have gone amiss; though Scott's original cut was considerably longer, begging the question on if more could have been done to enhance the seething culture clash between cops Conklin and Matsumoto (Takakura)?

Another problem is that Capshaw's character is under written, a crime when it's the sole female part of note in a two hour movie. Did more of the character hit the cutting room floor? Likely, because now it's a token eye candy offering, which is a shame since what little we do get hints at a savvy performance from Capshaw.

Ridley Scott lifts Black Rain from merely being a fish out of water thriller to something more layered. True to say there is more style than substance (what style though), but there is still very much interesting juxtapositioning of countries and human interactions of credible worth as well. 8/10 || The fact that the words ""produced in association with Michael Douglas"" appear on the credits before the name of the director (Ridley Scott) tells us much of what we need to know about this crime thriller. It is a project for and about Michael Douglas and it isn't very good. He (""Conklin"") is a New York cop, and a bent one at that. Together with his oppo ""Charlie"" (Andy Garcia) he witnesses a Yakuza killing in a restaurant. Apprehending the culprit, they are tasked with repatriating him to Japan but manage to cock up the prisoner delivery when the plane lands. Determined to track down his miscreant escapee, he now proceeds to treat the local law enforcement with an arrogant disdain that ought to have found him neatly at the end of a Samurai sword. Of course, though, he is the hero - so the plot gradually swivels the characterisations round so he starts to look the decent, intuitive police officer whom the incompetent, hapless, Tokyo officers have needed all along. Luckily, Garcia gets to take an early bath which leaves us with a very weak supporting cast, a few scenes from a completely unnecessary Kate Capshaw (""Joyce"") before an ending that made this legendary and lethal criminal fraternity look little more dangerous that a Californian fraternity house. Someone clearly decided that the dark and dingy look was in; the lighting is on half power for much of this, and what action scenes there are merely serve to further augment the star's ""hard man"" image but do little to add any depth to this really average story. Hans Zimmer's lacklustre score also seems to have come straight out of an episode of ""Miami Vice"", too. This is just poor, derivative and instantly forgettable. || Well made neo-noir thriller featuring great performances by Douglas, Garcia and Takakura with special mention to Yûsaku Matsuda who worked on this despite dying with bladder cancer (and he was only 40 years old).

Fox, Sean Penn, Don Harvey, John C.

Based on a true story, the arrogant sergeant (Sean Penn) of a 5-man squad on a reconnaissance mission in Vietnam in November, 1966, decides to kidnap a Vietnamese farm girl for some “portable R&R” because it would be ""good for the morale of the squad."" But PFC Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) refuses to participate and fears being “killed In Action” for dissenting.

“Casualties of War” (1989) separates itself from other Vietnam War movies by focusing on the incident at hand, including the build-up and aftermath. Its uniqueness is augmented by Brian De Palma’s slightly off-kilter style. The picture balances the beauty of the location and the artistry of Brian De Palma's filmmaking with the horror and ugliness of war & rape.

It's also realistic and compelling while simultaneously being mundane, which is why some viewers might find it boring. In other words, this is more of a gut-wrenching war drama with some action than a typical war flick with explosions and action thrills galore. It fairly closely follows the real story; Google Incident on Hill 192 for details.

The movie runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, with the original Theatrical Cut being 6 minutes shorter. It was shot in Phang Nga, Kanchanaburi & Phuket, Thailand, and Dolores Park, San Francisco, California.

GRADE: A-/B+ || ""Casualties of War"" is a deeply disturbing and emotionally overpowering film which remains strictly impartial throughout and it just recounts the acutely distressing and repugnant details in a dramatically harrowing yet still compelling way. The rape itself is dealt with in an incredibly matter-of-fact fashion as indeed is the victim's very life when she is indiscriminately murdered after she becomes an inconvenience. It is also shocking but to be expected that when Private Eriksson brings squad leader Sergeant Meserve's criminal act to the attention of his superiors he is met with a lack of concern and even a measure of anger. The real area of upset for them lies not with a lack of justice for the victim, but with the lives of the young men in the platoon Eriksson is about to destroy."

Back then, the stars were named Stallone, Van Damme and Schwarzenegger, and no matter what they did, they couldn't go wrong. We all wanted to be like these. Today, luckily stars need acting skills and not just muscles and a bit of martial art skill. In fact, had this movie been made today, it might even have been a masterpiece to be compared to such post-apocalyptic movies as Children of Men and The Road.

Lets take a brief look at the story, because there is a story hidden here somewhere.

We are in The States, a world that has been destroyed completely by anarchy, genocide and starvation, a world where the plague has spread, keeping the population down to an absolute minimum. Somewhere, scientists have found a cure, though, a cure that everyone wants, for good or bad. A cyborg named Pearl is sent into the world to retrieve this cure, and at the beginning of the movie, we learn that she has found it and is taking it back to the doctors who created her. A cyborg, by the way, is a man (or woman) who have been so heavily implemented with cybernetics that they could no longer be recognized as being humans. Pearl is taken by Fender, a madman who also kicks off the movie as our narrator, explaining how he enjoys this new world. Gibs (played by Van Damme) briefly encounters the cyborg, but is really only interested in killing Fender.

Those two have a dark past, a past that Gibs (or Gibson) relives throughout the movie in long flashbacks. He was once charged to get a small family to safety outside the city, but Fender interfered and tried to kill them. Now he even has one of the children, a girl named Haley, among his pirates.

Gibson is followed by another girl, one named Nady. She is interested in the cure even though Gibs care little for this. They are unlikely travelling companions, but starts out on a big journey towards Atlanta, hoping to catch up with Fender and Pearl, to get revenge... and the cure. Along the way, they encounter many dangers, and finally catch up with the pirates.

Cyborg is a low budget movie that tries too hard. Just take a look at the first scene, in New York. Less is more, and if only the director would have remembered that. If only I had had the option to remove the music, then I might actually have enjoyed the movie a little, but no, there is music in nearly all scenes, with only a few exceptions. Music that wants us to feel certain things, and that wants us to be prepared for what is coming. If only we were talking about a beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, but alas, we are not. So why do I ask if this is a failure, or a masterpiece? Well, what if the director deliberately used poor actors, to tell us something of the human race. What if he wanted us to think that all humans in this future were somehow cyborgs, part man, part machine? Unfortunately, this is not so, the director wants us to feel something for Gibs, Nady, Haley and Pearl, and therefore he makes them all human, a humanity that their acting skills cannot handle. Alas, this is not a masterpiece in any way, but a big failure, a movie with a tolerable plot, but that fails to deliver it in a believable way.

_Last words... my only star goes to the two beautiful paintings of New York and Atlanta that we see in the beginning and end of the movie. These are hauntingly beautiful, but unfortunately, the rest of the movie... is not._ || Nope, this is not good and we might as well get that out of the way first. Jean-Claude Van Damme does, however, manage to show off his rippled torso quite frequently whilst everyone else just shows off the fact that they can't act and that even if they could, the dialogue is so pathetic that they'd decided not to bother learning their lines. He's ""Gibson"", a retired fighter who has to come to terms with an apocalyptic scenario that has reduced these United States to rubble ruled on the basis of survival of the fittest by the ""Pirates"". Scientists in Atlanta might be onto to a cure for this pestilence, but for that to work then cyborg/human combo ""Pearl"" (Dayle Haddon) has to get some information to them. Meantime, the well informed gang leader ""Tremolo"" (Vincent Klyn) wants the cure for his people instead and so rather easily captures her. With the pieces all in place ""Gibson"" and his feisty new friend ""Nady"" (Deborah Richter) have to fight the ostensibly un-winnable fight against overwhelming odds to try and rescue ""Pearl"". There's not the merest hint of jeopardy here and the action scenes are so badly choreographed and edited together that it makes ""Conan"" (1982) look like Fellini. The repetition in the storyline really becomes irritating after the seventh scene when our hero is slashed to ribbons only to recuperate into an even more deadly ninja - and he's not even the robot. Auteur Albert Pyun clearly had too much time and money on his hands to waste on developing characters or story and what we are left with is unlikely to be on Van Damme's audition tape."

James Rainwood (Tom Selleck) is a real stand up guy, with a loving wife and in a dream job with a company that just couldn't cope without him. His life is just dandy, That is until two corrupt cops make a mistake and burst into his home believing it to be host to a drug deal. Thinking his hairdryer is a gun, one of the cops shoots Rainwood and it's then that the cops realise they have made a monumental error. So planting drugs around the home they set Rainwood up as a dealer who shot at the cops. Believing justice & honesty will see him OK, Rainwood refuses to cop a plea, and is promptly sentenced to a hell hole prison for six years. Here the affable Rainwood needs to wise up quickly or face a brutal and torrid time in the big house. 

Earlier in 1989 we had seen the release of Sly Stallone vehicle Lock Up, a film, that for all its many faults, was a dream come true to the action movie fan who also has a bent for any piece involving incarceration. So up steps Tom Selleck, who after recently showing himself to be a more than effective light entertainer in films such as Three Men and a Baby and Her Alibi, is looking to break out into other, more rounded genres (he also made the quite excellent Quigley Down Under in 1989). For the most part it's a good fit for Selleck and the casting director. The role of Jimmie Rainwood calls for someone charming, elegant and reeking of pure homeliness. That's Selleck without doubt. But the problems for many observers have been, and will be for first time viewers, the transformation of homely Tom into cocksure daddio prison geezer. Thrust into a world of violence and male rape, Rainwood simply must shape up or face a few years of brutality and a stripping of his soul. We know this, and once he starts to be guided by Virgil Cane (F. Murray Abraham adding a touch of class to a stereotypical role), the film for the rest of the prison sections is sign posted for us. And it's hard to swallow, even for someone like me who is a fan of the film! 

As for the other elements in the film, the various sub-plots hold few surprises. Rainwood's wife (Laila Robins) is loving and crusading for her man's release, but writer Larry Brothers has her very much by the numbers. As he does for Badja Djola's Internal Affairs investigator, John Fitzgerald. The latter of which is a real shame as Djola holds his scenes very well and is aching to put more meat into the character. Then there is of course our dirty cops played by Richard Young & David Rasche. Young's Danny Scaliese is the calm thinking one, Rasche's Mike Parnell is the aggressive and borderline psychotic one. It's hard to tell if Rasche is playing it for ham or really attempting to layer the madness lurking within? Either way, it's very entertaining, if ultimately miles away from the brilliance that was his Sledge Hammer! TV series. These cops are of course in desperate need of a fall, the question is if the makers here are merely reverting to formula or do they have some tricks up their sleeves? Well it's directed by Peter Yates and the writer is hardly an inspired scribe, so you do the maths. And lets face it, Selleck is no Stallone - a better actor for sure, but when it comes to shanking and shooting who you gonna call? Rambo or Magnum? 

I do like the film a lot, but I love the genre it belongs to anyway. And I literally will watch Abraham in anything. So take my 7/10 rating purely with a pinch of salt and call it a 6/10 time filler if you not be singing of the same page as myself. || ""An Innocent Man"" draws on every person's secret fear: what would you do if there was a gross miscarriage of justice and you suddenly find yourself being imprisoned? This film does a competent and realistic job of essaying an innocent man's life behind bars and you could say it makes use of the expected cliche of Jimmie Rainwood's greatest challenge being his day-to-day struggle to survive at the remorseless hands of the other more habitual inmates, except this isn't a cliche at all. It is a chilling fact of prison life all over the world. This is a very interesting film which raises a number of harrowing dilemmas in the story and resolves them in a well engineered, realistic and, for the most part, extremely satisfying way."

That the mayor and the commissioner are played respectively by Rod Steiger and Harvet Keitel only stresses the gravity of the situation.

However, the discerning moviegoer will be able to anticipate the true nature of the film as soon as they observe that it follows the Kevin Kline Mustache Principle, according to which Kline always wears facial hair when playing comedic roles, but shaves for serious roles. 

Nick Starkey (Kline), a brilliant former detective who has been exiled to the fire department because of an oft-mentioned but never-explained scandal. His brother Frank, the aforementioned police commissioner, reinstates him per the mayor's suggestion/order. This is bad news for police captain Alcoa (Danny Aiello).

Aiello stands out in the usually thankless job of 'straight man', to the point that his best scene, and arguably the best in the film, is not among those he shares with Steiger and Keitel, or with Kline and Alan Rickman, but the one wherein he reacts with increasing bewilderment when a subordinate attempts to explain why Nick turned down the office that was assigned to him.

Rickman plays Ed, a painter/computer whiz. Nick and Ed discover that the location of the buildings where the victims lived, when viewed on a map of Manhattan, form the constellation Virgo. They also realize that all of the rooms in which the murders occurred have windows on the front of the building, and that when the exterior location of the windows are aligned based on the floor they are on, they correlate with eleven notes in the chorus of the song “Calendar Girl”.

That the occupant of the apartment is always a woman who is always home alone the night of the attack (the killer acts on dates that are prime numbers) is arguably the least of all the coincidences in the movie, but then The January Man has not the slightest interest in creating a plausible villain, and that in an all-star cast, also including Susan Sarandon and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, the anonymous killer is played by a stunt double, tells us everything we need to know about the importance this character had for the filmmakers. || This is one of those rare films about a serial killer that isn't so much about the killer himself as it is how the law enforcement officer tracks him down and arrests him. And that perspective is always welcome, especially here because it took the gambit of really not focusing on the killer at all.

It was a bit like Manhunter in its approach.

And the fact that an actor with great comedic timing was cast as the lead and supported by Alan Rickman in a nearly unrecognizable role made it even better. It's a rare gem of a film that stands out from everything else on so many levels.

Johnny Handsome is directed by Walter Hill and adapted to screenplay by Ken Friedman from the novel ""The Three Worlds of Johnny Handsome"" written by John Godey. It stars Mickey Rourke, Ellen Barkin, Elizabeth McGovern, Lance Henriksen, Forest Whitaker, Morgan Freeman and Scott Wilson. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.

John Sedley (Rourke), AKA: Johnny Handsome, has a severely disfigured face, when he and his only real friend are double-crossed by two accomplices during a robbery, Johnny is sent to prison and his life reaches a new low. However, hope springs in the form of Dr. Steven Fisher (Whitaker), a pioneering plastic surgeon who offers to give Johnny surgery that would give him a normal face as he attempts to integrate back into society. With a new face making him unrecognisable, there is scope to enact revenge on the two people who killed his best friend and had him put in prison...

Walter Hill knows his film noir, anyone who has seen The Driver knows this. Here for Johnny Handsome, Hill takes a lot of the fantastical elements of noir and dresses it up admirably as a violent revenge thriller. A box office flop and something of a kicking post for big hitting critics of the late 1980s, it's a film that now can be seen as being very much in tune with its influences.

The charges of it being too bonkers, too violent and too much of a ""B"" movie homage just don't add up, because what is on offer is good solid meaty neo-noir cinema. A protagonist with an affliction, medical shenanigans, hyper femme fatale, over the top villain and a stoic and sarcastic gumshoe type copper. All of which operate in a sweaty and luridly coloured New Orleans. Add in Hill's eye for aggressive action sequences and it's neo a go-go.

Hill gets strong performances from his cast, ensuring emotional bonds are not over egged and a clamour for sympathy and understanding kept to a bearable level by the actors playing the ""good"" guys ""n"" dolls. While giving Henriksen and Barkin licence to sizzle with sinister glee is astute and perfectly in tune with the material on the page. Leonetti's photography has the requisite pulpy noirishness to it, and the familiar twangs of Ry Cooder are never a bad thing in a Walter Hill movie.

It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but those complaining about missed opportunities regarding rehabilitation - or that the liberal doctor turns out to be clinically wrong in his reform beliefs - really are missing the point or unaware of the world where something like Johnny Handsome lives. From the kinetic misery at film's start, to the ""ever so in tune with film noir"" finale, Johnny Handsome is well worth a look by anyone interested in noir's updated version. 7/10"

Pursuing crime boss Lyman, maverick cop Dooley is tipped over the edge when a false lead ends up with an attempt on his life. Determined to finally get his man, Dooley enlists the help of a police dog called Jerry Lee (The Killer) to hopefully sniff out the drugs that he knows Lyman is involved in. Trouble is is that Dooley has no idea how to treat a dog and Jerry Lee is more of a maverick cop than he is!

Given its low rating, it's hard to know what sort of film the critics and general movie watching public were expecting with this one. Since a buddy buddy cop movie staring James Belushi and a German Shepherd Dog doesn't say anything other than the film we actually get. By the time of K-9's release it was evident what sort of film would be Belushi's staple money earner, the kind that called for him to play the cocky quipper with a glint in his eye. Belushi would try to abandon his buffoonery roles post Curly Sue (who could blame him after that mess really?), and attempt to be a more dramatic action type actor. It wouldn't work, his excellent performances in Oliver Stone's Salvador and The Principal (the latter also criminally undervalued) were long behind him. So you hear the name James Belushi in relation to films and you by and large think larking about action comedies. Coming a year after Red Heat (it looks like Belushi is wearing the same suit from that film in this one!), K-9 delivers exactly what it screamed out it would from the off.

Technically the film has very few things to recommend, but as a family friendly action comedy it has much to laud. The interplay between man and dog is great fun, they are both members of the animal kingdom, they both got needs and they are both great cops. Yes we are never in any doubt that after a troubled start, this pairing are going to become firm friends, and that ultimately, by hook, crook and paw, they will get the job done. Belushi has a nice line in facial comedy and he also never comes up short in delivering quips with panache, and a confidence that often belies the trouble his characters are often in. The dog too is hilarious (hats of to animal handler Robert Zides). Courtesy of writers Steven Siegel & Scott Myers, this is a dog that eats chili and wants to vie with Dooley for Tracy's affections (Mel Harris as Dooley's frustrated girlfriend). It makes for a number of funny set-ups that both man and beast revel at being involved in. Kevin Tighe as villain Lyman is a touch under written, and the obligatory emotional heart tugger moment now looks like over egging the formula pudding. But this is harmless witty fun that gets in and does its job without proclaiming to be anything other than what it is. 7/10"

With your mind, your heart, your whole being.

Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, who after witnessing his brother getting crippled in a Muay Thai fight in Thailand, sets about learning the art himself so as to enact revenge on the sinister Tiger Tong Po who illegally put his brother in the wheel chair.

Ah look, I don't see any point in writing about the market that Van Damme movies sit in, I think everyone knows that there isn't going to be great acting in these movies, the plotting will be straight and simple and the resolution will be prescribed to get a whoop and yee-haw response. I would think that as much as some highbrow film fans roll their eyes and look down their noses at these type of action movies, they do at least acknowledge the fighting artistry and choreography on show. They, you hope, stay away and leave the ass kicking fans and nostalgists to wallow in their cheese and beaten body pulp kingdoms. I mean why would an arty film lover seek out an early Van Damme movie anyway?

I love Kickboxer, I really do, when I first caught it on release I could be found trying to do some of those wonderful Van Damme moves, rewatching the key moments over and over again, enjoying immensely the adrenalin rush that comes as we go slow-mo and Jean-Claude goes about dismantling uber bastard villain Tiger Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Now, well over twenty years later, I still get that rush, I can't do the moves, mind, I nearly put my shoulder out just punching the air in triumph as a mullet headed Dennis Alexio sticks his thumb up from his wheelchair, but all the thrills are still there, the skills on show still amazing. Hell, there's even a pet thread of substance, damn those animal threads, that cool dog better not get killed! Grrrrrrrr.

Of course now, viewing with older and wiser eyes, you can see the clunkiness of the script, the lame-brained plotting and excuses for Van Damme to flash the flesh and show his dexterity. There's even one of the worst dance sequences ever put down on film, so bad I can't believe I never laughed out loud at the cinema all those years ago. Yet it's still a wonderful movie, often exhilarating, the thematics of second chances (Haskell V. Anderson III having a great old time of it as Winston Taylor), revenge and different cultures, these impact greatly on the picture. Then there's Dennis Chan as Xian Chow, giving Pat Morita a run for his money as the most fun cinematic Martial Arts trainer, the real location photography in Thailand, the training sequences and of course we get to learn about the ancient sport of Muay Thai. There's a lot of good here to off set the saggy cheese.

There are some truly awful Van Damme movies out there, case in point Cyborg which was released the same year as Kickboxer, and without doubt the quality of Van Damme movies improved in the 90s as his stock began to rise and the budgets went higher. But this is a goody for his fans to lap up, a film to sit alongside Bloodsport as one of the two best action movies from his early body of work. And I love it so. 8/10 || JCVD is not a good actor, but he is a fantastic martial artist, and he has shown that in a lot of movies. While there are moments here that demonstrated his skills, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. Some of the build-up I actually quite liked. Tong Po looked menacing and while the Winston Taylor character was a bit cheesy, he grew on me. I was not a fan of Eric Sloanes arrogance. I guess you need to have a bit of that when your champion, but he just did not feel real. Most of the film plays out more like a training montage before the big fight at the end. There were some fun training moments, but a lot of it felt quite boring to me and the added romance did not really work, especially when the acting is not great. I wish the final fight played out differently, it was extremely predictable and there was not much of a fight considering they tried to fix it. I just hoped for more than what I got.

What if a baby, still inside the mother's womb, could tell us what he thinks? The premise of this film is that, and it gives rise to one of the most outstanding romantic comedies of the 80's (and this is no small thing, considering the amount of romantic comedies that appeared in the 80's and 90's) and gave rise, thanks to a considerable critical and commercial success, to another two sequels, renewing John Travolta's career and making Kirstie Alley a star.

The film is a good comedy, intelligently made, full of well-placed humor and that makes us smile, when it doesn't really make us laugh. The plot was well-thought-out, has a sense of humor, is witty and has a good dose of sympathetic sentimentality, without exaggeration: a young woman from a good family, single, became pregnant by a married man with whom she had an affair that only she is incapable of seeing who has no future; when the inevitable happens, and she ends that relationship, she finds herself alone and pregnant, ending up emotionally supported by a taxi driver she casually met. Of course, the baby will be the first to do what he can to bring them together as a couple, and we will listen to his ideas and opinions.

The film is largely based on the figure of the baby, whose voice is that of Bruce Willis, an actor with great vocal versatility and who proved to be totally up to the challenge. His vocal expressiveness was essential for the jokes that the baby plays. In addition, the text given to the actor is humorous, very well written and seems to really correspond to what the baby could be thinking at that moment. John Travolta also does an excellent job here, with an excellent performance, one of the best in the actor's career. He manages to embody the figure of a loving, sincere and sympathetic man, who really cares about the other characters, thus being more than a mere heartthrob. Much less pleasant, but still worthy of our appreciation, Kirstie Alley does an impeccable and funny job. The actress, who was not particularly well-known, will be catapulted to stardom with this film. The film also has the collaboration of veteran actors such as Olympia Dukakis, George Segal and Abe Vigoda in supporting roles.

Technically, the film isn't particularly brilliant, but it's in line with what was common in light films of the decade: low-contrast cinematography with unclear or vibrant colors, but very natural, without great artifice; a regular edition, without any notable mishaps, regular sets and costumes, good filming in several locations, with a good part of the film being shot outside. The soundtrack is the most notable element, thanks to a good selection of rock songs that include themes by the Bee Gees and the Beach Boys."

Wild Thing you make my heart sing, indeed. 7/10 || **Major League proves anything can be fun and hilarious with the right collection of zany outlandish characters.**

Major League just makes me happy. It’s packed with quirky, eccentric characters, lots of ridiculous moments, sincere character development, and that iconic song, Wild Thing! This crazy team of misfit baseball players makes Major League as wonderful as it is. Tom Berenger’s weary veteran catcher balances a young Charlie Sheen and Wesley Snipes. Add in All-State Insurance’s own Dennis Haysbert as the volatile voodoo power hitter, Pedro Cerrano, and strong performances from Rene Russo, James Gammon, and Corbin Bernson, and Major League becomes one of the most iconic and hilarious sports movies of all time. Major League made me start to enjoy watching baseball at a young age and fills me with nostalgia and joy. Ok, I need to go watch it again right now. || It came out when I was 9 and, honestly, all 9 year old boys love baseball movies. It's a law that transcends race, religion, and country of origin. Even in backwards countries like France, when they value soccer as a national popular sport, the 9 year old boys still love baseball movies. Even if they don't play it.

Anyway, this was a love story to the Cleveland Indians. It stinks of it. You know, you just know that someone wrote the movie, directed it, whatever, just so that they could sit back and watch the Indians win.

It's like baseball fan fiction, only unlike normal fan fiction, it's a pleasure to watch because baseball fan fiction is about the team winning and not about a Mary Sue taking all the glory.

And then, to cover up the fact that it's baseball fan fiction, they made it into a comedy as if to tell the audience not to worry, they aren't going to take it seriously anyway.

And I get where they are coming from, I had the exact same fantasies about the Cubs, most of my life, at least until I went to Europe and saw a soccer riot and got worried about what would happen if they did actually win... but it went off without a hitch didn't it? And now, honestly, it doesn't feel right.

A part of me, the masochist in me, would almost rather have a movie like this made about my team, instead of seeing the real thing.

Anyways, what it is, is baseball fan fiction, and base ball fan fiction is a lot better than most other things. Baseball period is a lot better than most other things.

Its almost like a romantic comedy in a very weird way. So sit back, grab a beer, and enjoy. It's like watching a funny version of the real thing."

I had never heard of <em>'Miracle Mile'</em> until a mere few hours ago, when I simply chose to watch it on Prime Video due to its cool poster. With only (a relatively) small amount of watchers on a few sites, I'm surprised this hasn't reached further.

As per with me, I hit play without knowing anything about this movie; I actually knew it was classed under 'apocalyptic' from when I minorly vetted it (checked for sequels etc.), but had forgotten. The early few scenes have an odd vibe to them, though I only mean that positively - it fits perfectly, particularly the subtle omnipresent score.

Anthony Edwards is the only actor I previously knew, well apart from Kurt Fuller (in only his second movie); I also thought I recognised the guy at the diner next to Harlan, but apparently I haven't seen Alan Rosenberg in anything - must be a doppelganger. Anyway, waffle aside, Edwards is very good - nice to see him away from <em>'Top Gun'</em>.

Liam Neeson, God love him, should never again do a movie with a hillbilly accent. || Appalachian Clan vS. The Chicago Mob

Patrick Swayze stars in an action revenge thriller in the same year that he also made Road House, the following year he made Ghost, these were two years after he had made a sensual splash with Dirty Dancing. Thus it's safe to say that Patrick did not pigeon hole himself. Next of Kin holds no great hidden gem rewards, but it's a rock solid thriller boasting a splendid cast list featuring Liam Neeson, Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Adam Baldwin, Andreas Katsulas, Ben Stiller (in a serious role), Michael J. Pollard, Ted Levine and Paul Greco.

Plot finds Swayze as a Chicago cop who after the murder his younger brother desperately tries to uphold the law while one of his brothers from the ""sticks"" would rather enact all out revenge on the mobsters that killed the younger sibling. Suffice to say things go pear shaped and blood, loyalty and life altering decisions do follow.

The trajectory is simple , honest cop tries to do the right thing by the law in spite of the hurt in his heart, hillbilly brother (Neeson getting the best role in the film) would rather deliver some ""deliverance"" type justice - all while the rest of the ""Gates"" family clan await the call to come wading down from the hills to aid the retribution flow. The action scenes are well enough staged by director John Irvin, there's a whole bunch of fun in the characterisations - even if they are standard 101 scripted - while if you can get past Swayze's ponytail you will find a very restrained and cool performance.

Hardly a must see, but definitely no stinker and worth your time as a time filler, if only to see  such a fresh faced young cast of well knowns turning tricks before bigger things awaited. 6/10 || Like its hero, Next of Kin is an anomaly — a thriller about a family feud between hillbillies and wiseguys that brings together Patrick Swayze, Liam Neeson, Adam Baldwin, Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton and Ben Stiller.
Truman Gates (Swayze) is as elusive a cryptid as the Frozen Caveman Lawyer; born and raised in Appalachia, Truman emigrated to Chicago where he is now a plainclothes cop with a violinist wife (Hunt), a sports car, and a mullet that's pompadour on the front and a ponytail on the back; what we have here is a Civilized Redneck.

And yet Swayze makes the character work, precisely because he is the last person we would imagine as a hillbilly; thus, the otherness that Truman projects when he returns to Kentucky for the funeral of his younger brother Gerald (Paxton) feels genuine.

Elsewhere, Neeson is one of the few actors who could convincingly play a both a Highlander as well as a hillbilly; Paxton unfortunately only appears in a couple of scenes, and like Stiller has the thankless task of being a sacrificial lamb; as for Hunt, she is predictably reduced to a Damsel in Distress).

On the mob side, Baldwin is effective as main villain Joey Rossellini, playing him something like Full Metal Jacket’s Animal Mother back home from Vietnam. Being at least a head taller than the rest of the cast except Neeson, Baldwin looms menacingly over everybody else.

By contrast, Johnny Isabella (Andreas Katsulas) is one of those mob bosses who hasn't forgotten his humble origins and, accordingly, isn't too proud to roll up his sleeves and cook himself some traditional Italian dish — but with a nickname like Pappa John, what could you expect? (to be fair, Katsulas wasn’t copying Paul Sorvino in Goodfellas, which was released a year after Next of Kin.)

This is possibly the first of the now seemingly unending films where Neeson becomes a lone vigilante who decides to take the law into his own hands, in this case as Briar, Truman and Gerald's older brother not named after a former president.

Following Gerald's funeral, Truman and Briar return to Chicago separately; without the restrictions of the penal code, the latter’s investigation progresses more quickly than the former. Everything comes to a head in a graveyard shootout that includes throwing knives, bows and arrows, dogs and snakes, and which may or may not have inspired the climax Sam Rockwell envisions for the movie Colin Farrell is writing in Seven Psychopaths. All things considered, Next of Kin is like those oddball relatives we all have; as such, we can’t help love it even if we don't always like it."

**_Alan!_**

_Final rating: ★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole_. || Reverse Darwinism - survival of the most idiotic.

Eight years after the horrors of Jurassic Park, we find Dr. Alan Grant happy with his lot, nothing on Earth could coax him back on to one of the ""InGen Islands."" Trouble is, is that Paul and Amanda Kirby, in the search for their missing son, get him to Isla Sorna without his knowing anything about it, and sure enough, dinosaurs are set to rule their evolved world once more.

Clocking in at just about 83 minutes in actuality, you sense that director Joe Johnston (Jumanji) knew he had to get in quickly, do his job, and get the hell out of Dodge ASAP. Sure enough, JP3 feels like (is) a quick coin in, the formula is straight up simple from the executive desks, dump a load of annoying characters on an island and see if they can survive being chomped on by dinosaurs. That the makers managed to get Sam Neil and William H. Macy on board with such a turgid script, is nothing short of amazing. Perhaps just as Neil's character is duped in the film, so shall it be in real life...

Still, it's no abomination by any stretch of the imagination. Johnston, realising that the audience wants dino action, wastes no time in letting the critters loose on our motley crew. Which in spite of the child friendly nature of the piece (think more chase movie adventure than monster peril) is all rather spiffing and enjoyable. You may find yourself hoping the irritable Téa Leoni gets eaten, and you may find yourself laughing at some of Alessandro Nivola's scenes when you are not meant to (is that a Superman homage?), but at least it's fun enough to get away with the bad points. Thanks in the main to the creatures and the relatively short running time. 5/10 || MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

I can understand why some viewers find Jurassic Park III fun enough. I just can't tolerate it, sorry. It feels more like a parody than a serious attempt at making a good sequel. The suspense and sense of wonder are totally gone. Even the CGI-animatronics combo looks terrible.

I also couldn't stand the new characters, ugh. I may come back tomorrow and think differently, but Fallen Kingdom has more redeemable qualities, despite it also being pretty awful and even offensive to fans of the saga.

I just don't imagine myself rewatching III ever again.

It’s school friends “Enid” (Thora Birch) and “Rebecca” (Scarlet Johansson) who have just finished school and have, hitherto at any rate, been determined to live together whilst they abandon education and get jobs. It’s fair to say that these two women are a bit on the periphery of their community. “Enid”, especially, with her blue hair and punk affections fancies herself as a bit of an artist and has disdain for just about everyone else. To alleviate their boredom, they answer an ad in a lonely hearts type column and encounter the rather sad character that is “Seymour” (Steve Buscemi) to whom neither take much of an instant shine, but with whom “Enid” begins to become friends - without acknowledging that it was them who not only replied to his advert, but who also left him high and dry once they had seen what he looked like on their supposed date. With this friendship taking an unpredictable path and “Enid” gradually managing to distance herself from just about everyone else, it might be too late when she eventually realises the short-sightedness of her ways. At times this is quite a quirky and wittily written coming-of-age drama, but I couldn’t find enough from any of the characters here to care about. We were all selfish and opinionated at that age, with little respect for anything that didn’t meet our (not very exacting) standards, but that doesn’t necessarily make for engaging storytelling. The production seems overly designed to exacerbate the issues from their largely self-inflicted problems and poor life choices, and though Buscemi comes across as quite natural with his portrayal of a nerdy character I felt this film strived to make the bleeding obvious a more pedestrian tale of teen angst than create anything fresh or innovative.

If you want a good reboot/remake, seek out the 2011 version and its 2 sequels. || Yeah... pretty poor.

I didn't even know this existed until a week or so ago. Gotta be frustrating for all involved that they were in a remake/reboot of 1968's <em>'Planet of the Apes'</em> that wasn't the 2011 version. This one walked so that one could fly etc.

Speaking of flying, what the heck is with the high jumping apes in this? It looks so silly and doesn't add anything; a very odd choice. It is, though, a surprise that this film flopped given who got attached to it. Tim Burton as director, with the acting talents of Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Paul Giamatti. It's neat that Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison (stars of the original) made cameos, though.

Wahlberg feels a bit miscast, though Bonham Carter and Giamatti are solid; the latter particularly seemed to enjoy the role. The film does have a Burton edge to it, as expected, but this is one of his weaker films no doubt. Some other negatives, for me, include the make-up, esp. for General Thade, - I'm in the minority there - and the story's pacing. || This is much more of a straight remake of the original 1968 version that certainly benefits from superior visual effects and animatronics, but otherwise is really quite stodgy and sterile. Mark Wahlberg is the astronaut ""Leo"" who finds himself stranded on a planet that is dominated by apes that can speak. Just like their human relatives, the Simian community is facing a war. The more benign, cleverer, chimpanzees are facing a conflict with their more aggressive gorilla cousins led by ""Thade"" (Tim Roth). Luckily, ""Leo"" can count on the feisty assistance of ""Ari"" (Helena Bonham Carter) as they race their antagonists to a secret facility deep in the forbidden zone that could offer them a solution and reveal the nature of their past. Wahlberg is good in these action roles. He manages to keep the pace moving along despite a rather weak story that takes quite a while to establish itself, and then is all too procedural as it bumbles along to an admittedly lively and fitting denouement. It's not a great film, indeed was there really any need to remake it at all, save for it being a vehicle for the easy-on-the-eye star? Still, it's an above average production that passes two hours without effort. If you're really eagle-eyed you might spot ""Planet"" original Linda Harrison (in a cart) but that might be all this has to make it memorable."

Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is a highly regarded professional cooler of bars and clubs. He is hired by Frank Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) to clean up his Double Deuce Road House down in Jasper, Missouri. A rough drunken and bloody place, the Double Deuce is just the start of Dalton's problems as he falls foul of town despot Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara).

I don't know if it's the same the world over, but here in Britain a bouncer is very different to that of a doorman. This is something that anyone who has been in and round the profession can attest to. So even though the casting of Swayze at first glance seemed an odd one, his character Dalton (wonderfully essayed by him actually) is the epitome of a doorman cooler, where violence is the last resort and used only in extreme circumstances. All of which makes Road House an interesting film in the context of its subjects, it's only when the makers resort to cheap tricks and heavy formula that the film descends into soggy popcorn fodder.

The fight scenes are competently handled here, and the characters are an engaging bunch (an axis between Dalton and his landlord Emmet is particularly warm). It's also a very sexy film, mucho machismo for the lads and ladies as Swayze buffs up and kicks butt, while Kelly Lynch sets pulses raising as the perfectly toned, obligatory love interest, Doc Clay (this is a world where doctors look and are shaped like Lynch). A huge question remains though as to if Road House means to be as cheese funny as it is? Because outside of the obvious jokes (plenty) there's cringe moments that make you wonder if it's comedy first, hard buttock actioner second? Be that as it may, Road House is an entertaining film regardless. Scorned by many but cherished by a lot, it remains a late 80s genre splicer that now has something of a cult following. See it at least if only for Sam Elliott's delightful turn as Wade Garrett, the cooler with a reputation as big as Jasper itself. 7/10

A man ends up in an asylum after a shocking experience as a boy in a traveling circus in Mexico. When he escapes he finds his maimed mother and falls under her negative influence. Guy Stockwell plays the grossly overweight circus owner. 

Released in 1989-1990, “Santa Sangre” (meaning “Holy Blood”) is a surreal circus fantasy made by cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who’s known for “El Topo” (1970) and “The Holy Mountain” (1973). His son, Axel, plays the protagonist here, Fenix.

Surreal or not, I love circus/carnival-oriented flicks and this one works well in its bizarre way for the first half, but totally bogs down in the second. The colors are vibrant and there’s a lot of deep symbolism with a Christ figure, a giant snake and so on. The various women are displayed in a creative titillating manner (Thelma Tixou as the tattooed woman, Blanca Guerra as the lithe high wire artist, Sabrina Dennison as the innocent Alma and Gloriella as Rubi) and I suspect this is a key reason why a lot of guys hail the film.

Unfortunately, the second half is dreadfully dull. Fenix doesn’t develop as a character in any attention-grabbing way and the story isn’t compelling, unless you find Fenix using his arms to help Mommy interesting. It’s still worth catching if you appreciate eccentric cult flicks that dare to be different, just be prepared for a tedious time in the second hour. 

The film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in Mexico City.

A widower (Tony Danza) manages a radio station and takes care of his two girls. As he’s away on business, his girlfriend (Catherine Hicks) gives his nerdy 15 year-old daughter (Ami Dolenz) a makeover. When the dad returns home his daughter is no longer a girl, but a blossoming woman who’s attracting males left and right. Wallace Shawn plays a successful psychologist.

""She’s Out of Control"" (1989) is a coming of age dramedy that pokes fun at several things: The loving father who’s overly concerned about his daughter’s honor, a girl’s discovery of her womanly powers, self-help authors who supposedly have everything figured out, and the challenging relationship between the daughter’s boyfriend and her father . 

The title isn’t “false advertising” because everything’s told from the perspective of the protagonist, which is Danza’s character. To HIM, she is out of control. Speaking of Danza, he has John Ritter’s likable charm and easily carries the movie. 

Dolenz was 18 during shooting and is serviceable as the title character, but she got better in such roles as she aged, as witnessed in “Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings” (1993). The film would’ve been more successful if they casted a more iconic 80’s actress in the role (although I’m glad Molly Ringwald didn’t play the part, probably because she was too old by 1988 when the film was shot). On the other side of the gender spectrum, Dana Ashbrook stands out as rockin’ loner Joey.

The main reason I was interested in seeing this flick was because Siskel & Ebert tore it to pieces on their show. Gene even said he considered quitting his job because of it. Seriously? It’s a cute high school comedy focusing on a father’s amusing travails, not frickin’ “Gandhi.” Meanwhile, in Ebert’s review, he laughably psychoanalyzed the dad’s attitude toward his daughter as “perverse,” “sick” and “sexual.” Really? All movies exaggerate reality to some degree, especially farces like this one. ALL fathers of nubile daughters can relate to his situation to some degree, even though it’s amusingly EXAGGERATED.  

The movie runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena, Malibu, Huntington Park, Downey, Oxnard and Hollywood).

A writer (John Ritter) is caught cheating by the woman he’s cheating with and so his wife kicks him out (Alyson Reed). He gets advice from his bartender and counsel from his therapist while every attractive female in SoCal catches his tipsy eye. 

“Skin Deep” (1989) comes across as Three’s Company five years after it ended, except movie length, more dramatic with better production values, and Jack Tripper as a boozing writer, not to mention the addition of a little nudity. Helmed by Blake Edwards, it’s basically a combo of his “10” and “The Man Who Loved Women.” (He was no doubt writing about his _own_ life and challenges). 

If you liked those two movies and Three’s Company, you’ll appreciate this, but it’s too meandering and arguably the least of the three. Ritter is his likable self though and the female cast is notable (Denise Crosby, Julianne Phillips, Chelsea Field, Diana Barton, Jean Marie McKee, etc.).

One sequence that I could do without is eye-rolling crude in a juvenile way, but the payoff line is pretty funny.

After an amiable man (Terry O'Quinn) in the Seattle area slays his family he starts a new one under a different identity, but his discerning stepdaughter (Jill Schoelen) picks up on his questionable morality.  

“The Stepfather” (1987) is a solid crime drama/thriller with a bit o’ horror. Movies like “Psycho” (1960), “Play Misty for Me” (1971), “Halloween” (1978), “The Shining” (1980) and “Fatal Attraction” (1987) come to mind, but this is equal parts coming-of-age drama in the mold of “The Crush” (1993) with a sort of inverted story.  O’Quinn effectively portrays the delusional titular character while Schoelen is reminiscent of a young Demi Moore. The decidedly 80’s score is quaint. 

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, including Edgemont Village. The main cast is rounded out by Shelley Hack (the girl’s mother), Charles Lanyer (her therapist) and Stephen Shellen (the justice-seeking brother of the original family).

GRADE: B+ || Leaving a scene of carnage behind him, “Jerry” (Terry Quinn) chucks the evidence over the side of his departing ferry and goes off in search of a new life. He is soon settled down with “Susan” (Shelley Hack) and her teenage daughter “Stephanie” (Jill Schoelen). That all seems to be proceeding well enough, he’s got a job as an estate agent and though his relationship with his new step-daughter could be better, things seem fine. Suddenly, though, it’s as if a switch has been flipped and his previously more menacing character starts to rear its ugly head. His family aren’t quite as malleable as he required and so, well, you can imagine his reaction and the rest of the plot. I suspect his approach to a pain-in-the-ass teen might resonate with some, but perhaps not with a family who have to come to terms with his increasingly unpleasant behaviour and that’s really the gist of this. It’s not exactly original, nor does it stray very far from the path of predictability as the drama is repetitively protracted to maximise the sense of peril without really paying much attention to plausibility. We know that “Ogilvie” (Stephen Shellen) is on his trail, but that thread rather peters out before a denouement that is both rushed and clumsily sequel-boding. It’s ok, but nothing special, sorry."

Some element of comedy, very black humour, remains but overall the film is a family tragedy.

The tragedy is that this disturbed young woman nicknamed ""Sweetie"" is simultaneously a victim of her own illness and an unwilling aggressor against her family, who feign love and acceptance but clearly would like to do without her. The strongest aspect of the film is Lemon's performance, one of the best screen portrayals of mental illness since Bergman's IN A GLASS DARKLY. Something I appreciate more on repeat viewing is that the background to this family drama is left ambiguous.

Unashamedly macho and very much of its time, this is daft energetic fun that's full of octane inventive action and ever quotable one liners. Stallone is Tango, the smart dressed sophisticated policeman, Russel is Cash, the slobbish act first - ask questions later copper, both men very different but both excellent at their jobs.

Pic gets by mostly on the chemistry between Stallone and Russell, who put much zest into their respective characters bickering and bantering. Action is well put together by director Andrey Konchalovskiy, but unfortunately the final third of the piece starts to sag as our mismatched cops start to respect and befriend each other and the plot reaches the inevitable conclusion.

It doesn't help matters that Jack Palance's main villain is only a bit part player, or that his head henchman Requin (the usually ace Brion James) gives us a quite appalling British accent. Add in Teri Hatcher who is in it purely for dressage and as a cypher between the two boys, then it's a picture not without problems.

""Laforgue"" is not an evil man, but he has a job to do and the rather more simplistic religiosity of the locals which is based much more around the seasons, the harvest, the weather etc., is not really much of a match for his disciplined indoctrination of these people - especially once the church is built.

In Bradford, Yorkshire young Billy Fisher (Tom Courtenay) is working a soul-crushing job in a funeral home and suffering daily the derision of his elderly parents. His only escape from this drudgery is his active imagination, where he imagines himself leader of his own country and misleads other townspeople about his family's situation with little fibs. His propensity to make things up and shrug off his responsibilities, however, leads him to end up dating two women at the same time (Helen Fraser and Gwendolyn Watts), though ultimately he dreams of escaping with the liberated Liz (Julie Christie).

As a snapshot of Britain at a particular time, this is a valuable film. As background to Fisher's own personal struggles, the camera often shows wrecking balls smashing down the walls of old homes, and at one point a town councillor marks an entire swath of the city for demolition. A scene at a dance club captures the growing influence of rock 'n' roll on Britain. Old class tensions persisted, however, though American audiences might not entirely get this as it is often suggested only by characters' particular accents.

The ending is a letdown though, essentially saying that young people should give up their silly dreams and give in to their parents' demands. This moral lesson was entirely overturned by the youth revolution that erupted through the Sixties. As the UK saw full employment through that decade, young people could take the risk of following their dreams even if it meant a rupture with their families and hometowns. Nonetheless, the comedic approach in the film makes it entertaining almost throughout, and I'd recommend that anyone see it at least once. || Tom Courtenay is ""Billy"", a lad whose grasp on reality is, well, tenuous. In his dreams, he is a brave and valiant life-saving sort of fellow. In real life he is a lowly clerk who works for a funeral director and lives with his increasingly exasperated parents. His problems only increase as he struggles to differentiate between his real life and that in his fictional land of ""Ambrosia"" and as his fantasies develop, he becomes more and more alienated from those around them. In the end, it is really only the happy-go-lucky ""Liz"" (Julie Christie) who might be capable of offering him a yellow brick road back to his, admittedly, rather dreary and relentless reality. Her imminent relocation from provincial Yorkshire to London might offer him salvation - but he will have to choose, and be brave - as brave as he is, on a daily basis, in his far away land. This is a tightly cast self-adaptation of Keith Waterhouse's play and with a strong supporting cast from Wilfred Pickles and Mona Washbourne we are quickly immersed in his dual existences in a fashion that is both entertaining and disconcerting. Clearly the young ""Billy"" is ill - but at a time when any form of mental health issues were stigmatised if acknowledged at all, and we cannot help but sympathise with the frustrated parents and with the young man himself. Christie is a breath of fresh air - she has a character full of pragmatism, optimism and opportunity that was clearly designed to offer that gust of wind to blow away the fabric of his paper house, and John Schlesinger allows the characterful performances and this most human of stories to thrive with a minimum of distraction. Courtenay and Christie are at the top of their games here, and as a study of aspects of human nature as yet largely unexplored by cinema, this is a fine example."

Il gatto a nove code (The Cat O’ Nine Tails) is written and directed by Dario Argento. It stars Karl Malden, James Franciscus, Catherine Spaak, Horst Frank, Aldo Reggiani, Carlo Alighiero and Rada Rassimov. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Erico Menczer. 

 

Blind puzzle solver Franco Arno (Malden) and newspaper man Carlo Giordani  (Franciscus) team up to see if they can solve the mystery of the murders that are terrifying the city. With their own lives becoming increasingly in danger, and the lines of investigation splintered all over the place, the men are drawn to the mysterious Terzi Institute where geneticists are tampering with gene patterns…

 

Argento doesn’t like it and the fans are very much divided about the worth of it on the Argento curriculum vitae, yet The Cat O’ Nine Tails is a delightfully entertaining oddity.

 

The plot is labyrinthine with relish on top, spinning the viewers into the same convoluted investigative maze that Messrs Arno and Giordani find themselves in. In fact, it’s near genius that it rarely makes sense under inspection, yet still there’s a fascinating edge to the story, with its characterisations, sexual kinks and cruel murders, there’s a power to the piece that rewards if you can just run with it, buy into Argento’s Giallo singed world.

 

With Malden turning in a great performance and Franciscus performing to a level nobody thought was in him, the lead characters really come to life. Add to that Morricone’s creepy jazzy-garde fuelled score underlining the skew-whiff nature of the beast, and Menczer’s photography tonally muted, tech credits are at one with the themes ticking away in the narrative, a narrative that has observation, ironically, on vision, sight and minds eye. While there’s a couple of rug-pulls jostling for our attention just to keep things twisty.

 

Then there is the director himself. The Cat O’ Nine Tails finds him restrained compared to the excess of style over substance films that would dominate his oeuvre post release of The Cat. That’s not to say there isn’t style here, there’s plenty as Argento dallies in POV, iris vision, and a nifty trick that gives the blind Arno “sight”, further ensuring that the supposed handicapped character is the key player and potential saviour of all. A number of scenes are bursting at the seams with suspense, with a cemetery/mausoleum sequence top draw, for sure Argento is firmly getting in his stride here.

 

It’s not a gore movie, something which I personally think has led to some of Argento’s fans giving the film the cold shoulder, but it’s the tale (or tails of course) and characterisations that hold it up as being under valued. It’s a Giallo whodunit flecked with sexual stings and no little amount style draped all over it. 7/10 || Okay giallo movie from Dario Argento has its moments and fine performances from James Franciscus and Karl Malden, but the end wasn't exactly satisfying. Still some entertaining scenes here and there. **3.5/5**"

Far better than its iffy reputation suggests, The Cotton Club is guilty of being stuffed to the gills, but it also contains mighty fine film making that shows craft both behind and in front of the camera.

Set in late 1920s Harlem, the pitch is an area of New York rife with swinging jazz, racism, crooks and gangsters. Prohibition and the depression fill the air just as the talkie movie bursts out of the silver screen. The Cotton Club of the title is the focal point for many of the key character's lives, so Francis Coppola, who stepped in at the eleventh hour of the troubled production, has many threads to juggle. He drops the odd one, but never to the detriment of the verve and swagger of the pic. Violence comes and goes, song and dance often dazzles the eyes and ears, and a cast of hundreds induces that good old game of spot the stars - past, present and future.

The narrative has strength via the observations of a major part of America in great transition, with the art design ops and tech crew beavers aiding him considerably via some superb period flavourings There is no getting away from the slightness of some character strands, the director and co choosing to insert another, all be it delightful, dance or song number to fill the void, but the core of the story remains strong throughout. The underworld always looms large, the seedy side of the era pulses away continuously, while the cast enjoy the dressage and frontage of a key time in America's history.

A young man from upstate New York, Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck), travels to the seedy side of Manhattan with a mysterious wicker basket, looking for a couple of dubious doctors.

“Basket Case” (1982) is a very bloody ‘B’ horror with (mostly) low-key comedy that’s actually funny. The quaint low-budget effects consist of rubber puppetry & gloves with some stop-motion unapproved by Ray Harryhausen. Blonde Terri Susan Smith shines as Duane’s potential girlfriend, Sharon, while Beverly Bonner heartily rises to the challenge as Duane’s friendly next-door neighbor in hotel, Casey.

The flick is entertaining so I can see how it’s become a cult favorite, but the focus on the seedy side of Manhattan makes for a somewhat unpalatable experience. Yet it’s interesting going back in time to New York City in 1981. Some people lambaste “Basket Case” for being “amateurish” but, come on, it only cost $35,000, which would translate to about $100,000 today.

The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan with some stuff done in Glens Falls, New York.

The direction is solid in the first act, pulling you into a world of mystery and romance, but as the film progresses, it starts to feel a bit uneven. There are moments where the storytelling builds tension effectively, but then it stumbles with some forced scenes that don't entirely fit the character arcs. The script is melodramatic, leaning into its themes of obsession and betrayal, though it sometimes feels more like it's trying to be provocative rather than meaningful.

Angelina Jolie carries the film effortlessly, giving a performance that elevates even the weaker parts of the script. Antonio Banderas does well too, but his character feels more reactive than driving the story. The chemistry is there, but certain scenes, especially one in particular, feel out of place given the way the characters were set up earlier. The score complements the film's mood but isn’t particularly memorable. Overall, Original Sin is a stylish but flawed film that keeps you watching, even if it never fully delivers on its initial promise."

Den ersten Teil habe ich auch erst 10 Jahre nach seiner Erstveröffentlichung geschaut und nun darf man natürlich gespannt sein, ob die Sichtung von Teil 3 erst 30 Jahre nach seiner Veröffentlichung passiert. Doch zurück zum Thema, meiner Meinung zu Rush Hour 2. Harmonieren Chris Tucker und Jackie Chan im ersten Teil noch perfekt zusammen ist diese Harmonie in der Fortsetzung ein wenig verloren gegangen. Alles wirkt irgendwie aufgewärmt und die Action etwas unspektkulärer als im Vorgänger. Was mir allerdings am meisten aufgefallen ist, wie abwertet der Film mit seinen Frauenfiguren umgeht. Da folgt ein Machospruch auf den nächsten, was nicht nur nach Me Too nicht mehr haltbar ist, sondern eigentlich schon 2001 etwas zu deftig war. Schiebt man diesen Kritikpunkt bei Seite, bleibt eine solide Actionkomödie, die alle typischen Klischees des Buddymovies erfüllt, dabei allerdings nicht so in Erinnerung bleibt wie andere Vertreter des Genres. [Sneakfilm.de] || OK, for those of you who, like me, liked Rush Hour, do yourselves a favor and stay away from this.

What we have here is basically Lethal Weapon 4 set in Hong Kong rather than LA. And... it just doesn't work.

Everything (save the stars) that made the first one funny is kind of out of place and forgotten. It's horrible. The fish out of water scenario fits well in Rush Hour, but set in Hong Kong, Tucker comes across as obnoxious instead of funny.

It's horrible."

This feels like a trope, but I'm honestly not sure if ""surprise, you're royal"" is a trope.  Making up a country for this also feels like a special sub-trope.

What I'm sure is a trope is the ""She's All That"" where you have a clumsy, homely girl that you turn into a beautiful, graceful desirable.

The fun of cultures clashing between America and ""Genovia"" is fun, and a family reuniting is touching, but all the high school girl drama, all the flavors, is overdone and boring.  I understand it is needed to develop Mia as a character with which we empathize, but there have to be better ways to establish a character.  Unfortunately, we would lose quite a lot by speeding it up, so I get it.

While this movie doesn't do much special, it's equally good from start to finish, and reliably so. || It goes on for a bit too long, but <em>'The Princess Diaries'</em> is just about a good film.

Anne Hathaway (Mia) is the star no doubt, she's the only character I'll likely remember from this 2001 production. Julie Andrews (Clarisse) is decent too, while Héctor Elizondo (Joe) is extremely likeable in his role. There's also a (incredibly) small appearance from <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> alum Karl Makinen.

I found the plot a little tedious to watch in parts, not helped by a few cringey gags. I also, in live-action/non-fantasy films, always find it difficult to believe in fictional places - in this case ""Genovia"". It's a small gripe of mine. Anyway, I do of course appreciate and rate the overall message of the film.

Overall, when all is said and done, I did narrowly enjoy watching this. The main reason being Hathaway, but also the moral of the story."

What an absolute bore, and a waste, <em>'Paint Your Wagon'</em> turns into. Why did they make this so long? The plot needn't be that extended, the music doesn't carry it either. It has a few decent parts, but they are surrounded by excess fat.

Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood and Jean Seberg stopped me from hating this, I will say, because that trio are all solid despite the aforementioned. It's amusing, at first anyway, to see Marvin and Eastwood sing, as they aren't the types you'd expect to do so. I'm not saying they can sing per se, but it's comically positive - which is the film's intentional, after all.

The story does take quite a while to get going, but the three principals with the help of some wonderful orchestrations (Nelson Riddle at the helm) of ""Wandrin' Star""; ""They Call the Wind Maria"" & ""I Talk to the Trees"" all deliver really rather well (if, perhaps not quite so tunefully by Marvin). The actors are having great fun amongst the rain, mud and poverty - and that fun can at times be quite contagious; there are some really enjoyable ensemble scenes/numbers too. The story is, however, strung out far too thinly over what seemed like an age and though there are some quite pithy one liners, the comedy is equally sparsely distributed throughout this all but three hour film.

Legendary gunfighter J.B. Books rides into Carson City, diagnosed with terminal cancer he has a short time to live. After taking a room at the widow Bond Rogers' house, he becomes something of a mentor to Bond's son, Gillom.

Dignified, eloquent, perhaps even incredibly sad, The Shootist mirrors John Wayne's personal situation and closes his career (and life) with a poignant last hurrah. Based around the popular novel from Glendon Swarthout (Where The Boys Are), and directed by the astutely knowing Don Siegel (The Duel at Silver Creek), The Shootist begins with edited scenes from Books' (Wayne's) life, where he literally ages before us during this montage. Cut to his arrival in Carson City in 1901 and we are about to be witness to the end of an era. Wayne is backed up in his swansong by Lauren Bacall (Bond Rogers), James Stewart (Doc Hostelter) and an engagingly important Ron Howard (Gillom Rogers). While a big shout out has to go to Bruce Surtees' cinematography which perfectly captures the elegiac nature of it all. 

The message well and truly hits home and hard come the bloody finale, where with one nod of his head big John Wayne, alias J.B. Books, says more than words surely ever could.

RIP - The Duke. 8/10 || I publicly take back every negative thing I ever said about John Wayne.  I was so far wrong in claiming that he was just a very famous, highly overrated actor, but I blame my misconceptions on the fact that I was probably introduced to him via some of his lesser movies, or perhaps just not the kind of movie I like or usually bother with.  I never have been big on Westerns, but after viewing The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, I thought he was okay.  Now having just seen The Shootist, I apologize for everything I've said against him before.  He was truly brilliant in this, his final movie, and it was a fitting ending for a memorable career that spanned three decades.  Forget everyone else; his performance makes the movie!  It really, really could've done without the unnecessary amount of bad language, but the story was great, being alternately tense and touching throughout.  And, in the end, John Wayne really could say so much with just a single nod.  Here's to the Duke! || John Wayne's final big screen role sees him playing a terminally-ill gunfighter determined to go out with his boots on - and to take as much local riff-raff with his as he goes. He settles down in a boarding house run by a slightly puritanical widow - Lauren Bacall, and her teenage son played by Ron Howard. Once his doctor, James Stewart, has confirmed the worst, he manipulates some of the local ne'er-do-wells into ensuring he gets the send off he desires. His relationship with Bacall thaws, somewhat, and we end with a gentle nod to both of their different sorts of humanity. Make no mistake, this isn't at all soporific, and Wayne and veteran sparring partner Richard Boone have the odd scene to remind us of both of their younger days (Boone only survived Wayne by 2 years). It is a great, fitting send off for a man who in 1976 was as enduring a legend as Hollywood had ever produced."

In the late 60s and mid-70s, a psychopathologist (William Hurt) from the New York/New England area honestly seeks ultimate truth and the origins of humanity through dubious experiments with sensory deprivation mixed with drugs, including a potent mixture used in ceremonies by Mexican AmerIndians. This leads to altered states of consciousness and amazing primordial revelations. Blair Brown is on hand as his romantic interest while Bob Balaban and Charles Haid appear as his colleagues, the latter a scientific version of a Pharisee.

Directed by Ken Russell, “Altered States” (198o) is a mature sci-fi drama with elements of mystery/horror. It comes across as a meshing of movies like “Wolfen” (1981), “An American Werewolf in London” (1981), Russell’s later “The Lair of the White Worm” (1988) and “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968). One of the fascinating things about the movie is that it shows how a person can reach other realms while in an isolated location through the power of the mind/spirit, albeit in this case with the assistance of drugs.

I can relate to a degree. For instance, eleven years ago I was sleeping in bed (during the day) having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. This happened again the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?

Anyway, the apeman sequence is one of the best parts of the movie and recalls those werewolf flicks noted above (of course “Wolfen” isn’t really a werewolf picture). But “Altered States” is so much more than a standard creature feature or nature-runs-amok flick. The apeman make-up is great and the bizarre imaginings are similar to the same in “The Lair of the White Worm.” While I disagree with the evolutionary nonsense (humans didn’t evolve from apes, rolling my eyes), this is a fantasy about finding the truth by Ken Russell and so I don’t expect those kinds of details to be accurate anyway.

Blair is winsome in a girl-next-door kind of way and Russell doesn’t fail to capture her beauty (and I’m not tawkin about the top nudity), although that’s there too, if you’re interested.

I suggest using the subtitles since a lot of the jargon is pretty technical. It helps the viewer to stay with the story if you can understand what the characters are saying and discussing.

The movie runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot in New York City (including the Bronx Zoo); Boston; Sierra Tarahumara, Chihuahua, Mexico (the rock formations); Burbank Studios and a VA hospital in Los Angeles.

Big laughs, big fun and a big ape who is not above _soiling_ in police cars make this a lot of fun.


- Ian Beale || More of the same in pleasant sequel to Every Which Way But Loose.

Any Which Way You can is directed by Buddy Van Horn and written by Stanford Sherman and Jeremy Joe Kronsberg. It stars Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis, William Smith and C.J. the Orangutan. 

Philo decides to retire from bare knuckle fighting, but when the Mafia come along and arrange another fight, he is spurred on to take another big money fight. The Black Widows motorcycle gang are still after his blood, Clyde the orangutan is still creating mischief, and Lynn Halsey-Taylor is trying to make up for breaking Philo's heart.

Much like the first film this is all very silly but ultimately great fun. Crux of the narrative is Philo being dragged back into the bare knuckle fight game to fight the street fighting king Jack Wilson (Smith excellent). All this and matters of the heart are trying to be repaired. Clyde the orangutan is once again a ball of mischief fun making, while the crowning glory that is the big fight is superbly staged and prolonged for grand effect.

There's a wonderfully fruity section that sees parallel seductions going on - including Clyde and a lady orangutan - and there's actually some adult writing in how the fighters are shown to be compassionate men, as opposed to just being brainless thugs making a few bucks. It was another big hit at the box office, once again proving that sometimes theatre goers just want to leave the brain at the door and have a fun time of things. 7/10 || <em>'Any Which Way You Can'</em> is woeful.

It would be quicker to note what I liked about this - nothing - than to note the negatives. It's such a haphazardly created film, with every detail of it being either nonsensical, extremely forced or just dull. It's such a drag also, I checked the elapsed time at one point expecting to see at least 1hr 15mins... I had seen barely 40 minutes.

Clint Eastwood tries his best, I guess, and is one of the brighter parts, everyone else is very forgettable - including Sondra Locke's Lynn, who is all of a sudden the opposite to what they set up in the original. Then you also have the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Which_Way_You_Can#:~:text=Manis%2C%20the%20orangutan,William%20Munns.%5B9%5D"">dodginess</a> of stuff offscreen with the orangutans.

Rogers,"summer, beach house, group of friends, tantra, superglue, sex comedy","American Pie 2 doubles the amount of crude toppings but lessens the characterised filling. A sex comedy can only be pushed so far before it miraculously transfers to soft-core pornographic territory. The original American Pie, whilst an influential milestone in the sub-genre, was a satirical take on high-school life by hyperbolising the quest for losing one’s virginity. How would Rogers and Herz continue the saga? Well, shoving a trumpet up one’s filthy anus, using super-glue instead of lubricant during an awkward masturbation sequence and the longest “lesbian” endeavour ever. Suffice to say, the misadventures of these four friends do not retain the freshness of the original. After their freshmen year at college, the boys regroup for a party held by Stifler at a rented beach home, where they intend to spend the summer getting laid and participating in cringe-inducing phone sex (twice!).

The cast are back, ready to precariously thrust beds, the tainted air and Stifler’s mother in a luxurious car (no pie though...). Yes, the aroma of crusty semen and raging hormones plague the summer season. Whilst that may be sufficient comedy for fans of the original, there’s no saucy masquerading of the narrative structure. It’s a complete retread of its predecessor. Almost identical! The characters go through the exact same scenarios, only heightened by a writer who clearly couldn’t produce any enticing material. The equivalent of an adult magazine. Used once, thrown away shortly afterwards.

The elongated and repetitive scenes of comedy, while slightly funny initially, tire themselves by never ending. The “lesbians” persuading the guys to play with each other? That was essentially thirty minutes of the runtime, and as a homosexual, horrible to endure. God bless Hannigan though for stepping up her game, she was an absolute delight with an equal balance of comedic timing and heartfelt peculiarity. The remaining cast members, aside from Reid who was predicting her ‘Sharknado’ future, all performed consistently as expected. And by that, I mean with the overwhelming smell of mediocrity. I do not want to see Klein touch himself again whilst talking provocatively on a phone! The padding in the pants was too much *starts to heave*.

Oh, and the lack of basic mathematic knowledge. Right, simple arithmetics here, the whole “Rule of 3” scenario. Pens and paper and the ready, please. If Kevin stated he slept with three girls, and this “Rule of 3” means you divide the number by three, how many did he actually sleep with? Take your time now...! Got it? Well, the result is not zero. It’s one. Why the hell are these college students objectively stating the answer to be zero? Are they mad? Fine, Vicky isn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, but Kevin? C’mon man. Arithmetics! Of course, it isn’t an American Pie film without the alternative rock soundtrack. Blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day and Alien Ant Farm all make an appearance and give life to the teen angst shown on screen.

Just a shame this sequel gave me unnecessary angst for never surpassing the original’s hilarity. If you adored its predecessor and appreciated its exaggerated satire, then this sequel will only be viewed as watchable. If you just want crude comedy and are content with elongated phone sex sequences, by all means give this second pie a taste. It’s not piping hot, but lukewarm at best. || Everything and everybody are all apart in part 2. It's funny as hell but not the same chemistry as the 1st."

RELEASED IN 2001 and written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, ""The Others"" is a haunted house flick about a woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in an old manor on one of the Channel Islands with her two photosensitive children immediately after WWII. After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.

While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there’s a one-dimensional pale ‘look’ to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.

Everything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought.               

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid. 

GRADE: B/B- || ""Grace"" (Nicole Kidman) lives in her almost blacked-out stately pile on Jersey where her two children ""Nicholas"" (James Bentley) and ""Anne"" (Alakina Mann) are hyper-sensitive to light. When her staff mysteriously abscond, she has to employ a new housekeeper ""Mrs. Mills"" (Fionnula Flanagan), and together they must ensure that the children are always locked into a room with no access to any windows that are not shrouded by thick curtains. The suddenly she hears a noise. Maybe a voice, even? She searches in vain but these odd occurrences start to multiply. Their usually fastidious household routines start to unwind, doors are left unlocked and the children start telling their mother of people moving around the house - folks that she cannot see! Just what's going on? Are these happenings connected with ""Mills"" and the new staff? Great news when husband ""Charles"" (Christopher Eccleston) returns from the War - shellshocked and distant, or then again - does he actually return at all? ""Grace"" is becoming increasingly paranoid. She can't tell what's real and what's not - and her children are only fuelling her fears! Although way darker and more sinister, this actually reminded me a little of the ""Amazing Mr. Blunden""! A ghostly story that uses children as a conduit between what might have been, or is, or may yet to be. The young Bentley and Mann deliver effectively here as director Alejandro Amenábar uses the dark and creaky house, extensive and frequently misty grounds and a creative sound effects mixer to create a genuine sense of menace. It's very hard to be innovate with this genre, there's just so much we have all seen before, but Kidman paces herself well here delivering a story that's not so predictable as we might have expected."

They are brought together by the recently hooked up “Jackie” (Sasha Alexander) and “Brent” (Adam Goldberg) but it isn’t the most auspicious of starts. Indeed, after their first date you’d have got better odds on the Danube really being blue. Circumstance and their friends don’t give up easily, though, and gradually the pair begin to get to know each other and take each other, and us, on a dirty washing exercise as we learn of their childhoods and the sources of the chips on various shoulders that they have accumulated over the years. So far, it’s all entirely procedural with dramatically created troughs so we can have the peaks, but for me the thing falls flat fairly early. Sure, there is a magnetism here and both of these actors deliver competently enough, but their romance is borderline toxic at times and I think any sane person would just have chalked it up to experience and moved on right from the get-go. Serendipity is just too involved as each episode in their relationship becomes less plausible yet more cementing of a conclusion that you just know is bound to happen. The film has a custom-made, manufactured, look to the whole thing and after a while I lost interest in whether they did or didn’t and would rather have followed the sub-plot with their newly loved-up and squabbling pals. At least the production is decent enough, but this is still quite disappointing as it uses stereotypes to poke fun at, well, stereotypes."

The legend of the James/Younger gang gets another outing in this fanciful actioner that's guaranteed to have history buffs frothing at the mouth.

It very much comes off as a Western primed for the MTV generation, a young spunky cast are assembled and the action kitchen sink is thrown at the piece where ever possible. There's lashings of cool on show, some sexiness, and the prime action sequences are exciting. Yet it just comes off as soulless, something emphasised by the awful score and soundtrack.

Acting is OK, particularly from Timothy Dalton as Allan Pinkerton, the man tasked with bringing down Colin Farrell's Jesse James - this whilst having a grudging respect for the outlaw - while Gabriel Macht puts some assured calmness into the role of Frank James. Elsewhere everyone else is having fun even though they be hamstrung by the script.

There's hints of thought, such as the power of celebrity status and corporate greed, but these are few and far between, for this is what it is, an action film that works on that level only. 5/10 || SPOILERS AHEAD!  ""American Outlaws"" is cinematic proof that the American public will watch just about anything, even a film that makes ""Young Guns"" look like ""The Searchers.""

Colin Farrell is Jesse James and Gabriel Macht plays his brother Frank. After the film opens with perhaps the most fun ever had at a Civil War battle, the Jameses and Youngers head home to Missouri. There, evil railroad executives have moved into the state in record time and are trying to buy everyone's land to build a railroad. Farms are burned, people killed, and the Youngers and Jameses have had it. After Ma James (Kathy Bates, here for the paycheck) is killed in an attack, the guys decide to stick it to the man by robbing banks where the railroad company does business. The rest of the film is a series of explosions as the gang robs, Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) tries to track James down, and the boys escape from one pickle to another.

This film is stupid. So stupid. First of all, all the characters are straight out of a screenplay seminar: Jesse the dashing hero, Zee (Ali Larter) his love interest, Frank the smart one, Cole Younger (Scott Caan) the hothead, Bob Younger (Will McCormack) the ""funny"" one, Jim Younger (Gregory Smith) the boy who you know will die, Tom (Nathaniel Arcand) the politically correct Native American Indigenous People Indian Scout guy whose sole function here is to add some color to the cast of white guys, Rains (Harris Yulin) and Parker (Terry O'Quinn) are the villains, Ma James is the religious nut who has no problem with guns and killin', and Pinkerton, who enjoys the chase of James more than the capture. All the young men wear cool clothes and brandish magical pistols that reload themselves. Thank goodness everyone over thirty five is an idiot, so as these rascally killers can go John Woo/Chow Yun Fat all over their gold-filled rumps and do serious damage without ever killing an innocent bystander. Electric guitar riffs fill the soundtrack, and the film goes through all its preordained set pieces where the outcome has already been determined yet the film makers treat them as if they invented the genre. If you need to see cute guys without their shirts on, go online. If you need to see a decent western, watch anything but this. The entire cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves for coming up with this and shooting it. Did we learn nothing from ""The Brady Bunch,"" when Bobby worshiped Jesse James until Mike brought home the son of one of the outlaw's victims? Why is that decades old sitcom more responsible than this dung? Wanna know the kicker to this whole migraine of a movie? Ma James is killed, prompting the boys to take revenge on the railroad. In real life, she outlived Jesse by almost forty years.

Avoid ""American Outlaws"" like you would the popular girl at the brothel."

Session 9 is directed by Brad Anderson who also co-writes the screenplay with Stephen Gevedon. It stars Peter Mullan, David Caruso, Josh Lucas, Brendan Sexton III and Stephen Gevedon. Music is scored by Climax Golden Twins and cinematography is by Uta Briesewitz.

Danvers State Hospital (AKA: State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers, The Danvers Lunatic Asylum, and The Danvers State Insane Asylum), Massachusetts. Built in 1874, opened in 1878 and closed in 1992. The home to misery, madness, tragedies and troubling treatments. Five men from an asbestos removal company, each with issues or points to prove, enter the vast bat shaped structure under the promise of a big pay off to get the job done in one week. But over the course of the week money will be the last thing on their minds.

Psychological horror at its finest, Session 9, in the hands of Brad Anderson, pretty much gets everything right in this most skin itching of sub-genres. Like the ghost story splinter of horror, setting is absolutely everything, and few, if any? Horror settings are as imposing or eerie as the one time Danvers State Hospital. Sadly demolished in 2006/7 to make way for an apartment complex (bastard property developers have no respect outside of the purse), the place positively oozes unease throughout the movie. With Anderson choosing to shoot his film on videotape, this further aids the sense of realism and palpable dread, and although it isn't a stretch of the mind to think about some of the misery that played out in reality at Danvers, Anderson and his photographer Briesewitz ensure that it never leaves our conscious. Tone is set from the off as being slow burn, this is perfect as it allows us to get a grasp of the characters, their psychological make ups and narrative worth.

With the Danvers facility proving to be the extra character, all things come together seamlessly to gnaw away at the viewers. It's a devilishly odd thing to say, but as the story and characters are given room to breath, the audience who have immersed themselves in the picture will start to feel claustrophobic, and then for the night time sequences, even achluophobic. It's pitch perfect pacing by Anderson, who prior to unleashing the unnerving finale, has pulled us (and his excellent cast) slowly through a labyrinth of dank corridors, wards, treatment rooms, caged stairwells and a morgue. Even on the outside during daylight hours everything feels bleak, either with characters loomed over by the building, or on a roof chatting while Gothic turrets watch over them menacingly, the ghosts and bitterness of Danvers Hospital exist fully in Anderson's movie.

Story links a tape recording found by Mike (Gevedon) with that of the workers' unfolding plight. The tape tells of 9 sessions with a troubled patient named Mary Hobbes, to say anymore would be spoilerish, but for the record in this writers eyes it's the creepiest tape recording in horrorville. Add in the odd hospital prop such as a lone wheelchair, a hydrotherapy bath or an orbitoclast! Well you get the picture I'm sure. Climax Golden Twins provide a suitably jarring score, where disjointed noises and elongated tonal strains further enhance the pervading disquiet. Picture only falls down slightly with silly plot error involving a furnace, and for some folk the ending will inevitably be met with dissatisfaction. I liked it plenty but I also feel they could have gone another way with it. But it does work well and isn't a cop out, and certainly it's better than the alternate ending available in the extras section of home disc formats.

It's a horror film aimed at a certain horror fan, the one who has the patience to enjoy slow burn psychological pin prickery. All played out expertly by cast and film makers at a naturally unsettling location. 9/10"

A naïve teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) has to stay separated from people due to having no immune system. When the woman he loves (Marley Shelton) goes to Niagara Falls to marry her bad boy beau, he sets out to stop the wedding clothed in a protective suit resembling a plastic bubble. Several colorful characters are encountered along the way.

“Bubble Boy” (2001) is not a serious drama on the topic, like Travolta’s “The Boy in the Plastic Bubble” from 25 years earlier (which was inspired by two real-life cases). No, this is a comedic account in the manner of that 1992 Seinfeld episode mixed with the zany road trip milieu of “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.” The protagonist is reminiscent of Brendan Fraser in “Blast from the Past” meshed with Ace Ventura.

It's laugh-out-loud funny throughout because it constantly goes over-the-edge in executing the jokes. The sacred cow on the highway is a good example. It takes stabs at several types of people, but isn’t offensive because of its equal opportunity approach. Some examples include, religious legalists, youthful libertines, bikers, sideshow freaks, pop cultists, Hindus and Asians. Wait till you find out who the guru of the cultists is.

Winsome blonde Marley Shelton is a highlight in the female department, as is Ever Carradine as her beau’s sister, not to mention Stacy Keibler in a small role as a mud wrestler.

It runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, and was shot in areas north of Los Angeles, including Palmdale, Santa Clarita, Piru, Santa Paula and La Verne, as well as Las Vegas and Niagara Falls.

Led by ""Ballard"" (Natasha Henstridge) these cops, and their target, soon discover that their location has been compromised and pretty soon they are under siege from an army of zombies with an unique (and quite well depicted) means of entering and controlling the human body. Odd to see Jason Statham with hair, but otherwise I found this to be a pretty unremarkable drama that I can't think John Carpenter would look back on particularly fondly. Henstridge is competent, but her part is so generic and the dialogue - especially with her and a lacklustre Pam Grier is banal. It looks OK, and the pace once we start picks up too, but the whole thing is really derivative and this attempt to mix the horror and sci-fi genres is too dependent on some, admittedly decent, make up effects before an ending that left me wondering if a sequel were to be in the offing.

While a Cape Cod baseball prospect with hopes for the Major League lands a gig playing for the Chatham Athletics (Freddie), his potential girlfriend (Biel) is pressured by her pompous father (Bruce Davison) to move to San Francisco and work for a firm. Brian Dennehy plays the no-nonsense coach while Matthew Lillard, Brittany Murphy, Corey Pearson and Wilmer Valderrama play various youths. Fred Ward and Jason Gedrick are on hand as the father and brother of the protagonist.

""Summer Catch"" (2001) is essentially a baseball version of ""Youngblood"" (1986), ""Varsity Blues"" (1999) and ""The Program"" (1993). It's not as good as ""Varsity Blues,"" but it's arguably superior to ""The Program."" Sure, it's predictable in some ways, but everything clicks for an entertaining coming-of-age flick: cast, story, acting, locations, cinematography, music and editing.

Biel shines on the feminine front in several notable scenes while Beverly D'Angelo still sizzles at 49 years-old in a small role; and Brittany is nothing to sneeze at. I'm at a loss as to why ""Summer Catch"" is so reviled.

Jeepers Creepers tips its hat off to the creepy horror movies that were all the rage in the 70s and early 80s, boasting genuine suspense and characters fully formed, Jeepers Creepers is something of a refreshing antidote to the ream of horror movies available that line up teenagers purely to be slasher fodder. Lifting it just above average is the fact that our two sibling protagonists have viable discussions before venturing into the realm of horror staple requirements, although the picture is ""B"" movie in substance, it does however attempt to be credible in its story telling.

Sadly though, after a wonderfully edgy first half, the picture drops down in standard, the introduction of ""The Creeper"" may well be a necessity, but it shifts the film to such a degree, it rapidly loses its creepy momentum. Not that the second half of the film is a disaster, far from it, it's got a scary fun vibe to it, it's just that it promises so much, but ultimately runs out of steam. Jeepers Creepers was successful enough to spawn inferior sequels, with the ""Creeper"" of the piece firmly entering the horror hall of fame, thus an argument for the film having done its job seems totally viable, it's just sad that it didn't stay on the side of edgy and become a horror classic. 6/10"

Stranger still, however, are the rituals that take place there.",Flesh to touch...Flesh to burn! Don't keep the Wicker Man waiting!,Horror,93.0,1973-12-06,en,7.345,1496.0,3.8181,"Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento, Ingrid Pitt",Robin Hardy,"virgin, island, based on novel or book, sacrifice, scotland, ritual, cemetery, investigation, cult, human sacrifice, rural area, disappearance, paganism, policeman, bonfire, psychotronic, voyeurism, may day, folk horror, song, sea plane, harvest festival, horror musical","I believe in the life eternal, as promised to us by our Lord, Jesus Christ.

Mainland Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) flies off to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a 12 year old girl. What he finds is a culture steeped in Paganism, presided over by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). Meeting static and indifference wherever he goes - and being driven to anger by the assault on his Christian beliefs - Howie is very much a man alone and most likely in grave danger? 

Directed by Robin Hardy and adapted to screen by Anthony Shaffer from David Pinner's novel, Ritual, The Wicker Man is very much a cult masterpiece. The back stories to it could make a film all by itself, be it censor baiting, studio cuts, body doubles or just plain offending religious groups, it's a film that is well worth looking into via the top range home format releases.

From the moment Howie (a truly brilliant Woodward) lands at Summerisle everything seems off, there's a sinister atmosphere pervading the story. He is met by unnerving imagery wherever he goes, songs and rituals gnawing away at his senses, there's even eroticism deftly placed within the film's master plan. He doesn't know what's going on, and neither do we, this is a mystery right? There is after all a missing child to be found, right? But once Lord Summerisle (Lee also terrific) enters proceedings and ups his game, things unravel in edgy fashion, building up to the justifiably famous and harrowing finale.

Some modern horror fans may baulk at the lack of bloody carnage et al, but this is classic horror. A horror film bulging with intelligence and pulsing away with literate smarts. 9/10 || Well the cinema was packed as we all sat though what seemed like an interminable preamble of interviews with those connected with the film - including Britt Ekland - before it all started. Was it worth it? Well, I didn't really think so. Policeman ""Howie"" (Edward Woodward) arrives on a remote Scottish island after reports that a girl has gone missing. He is perplexed by the seemingly indifferent attitude of the locals who claim that she never existed or her mother who claims that she is six feet under in the graveyard. He becomes even more bemused by the general attitude of the villagers - led by their laird ""Lord Summerisle"" (Christopher Lee) and taught by their not quite ""Jean Brodie"" schoolteacher ""Miss Rose"" (Diane Cilento) to life in cereal, and to his presence in particular. Soon, his investigation starts to lead him a merry dance as he begins to suspect something way more sinister is afoot - and boy, is he correct. Thing is, though, can he find and save the missing girl and get to the bottom of this mystery. To be fair, it does offer us a more sophisticated, almost mythological, approach to an horror movie loaded with mysticism and pagan ritual. Indeed, I don't know that it fits well into that genre at all - it's more of a psychological thriller populated by a decent cast of household names. The thing for me is the story. I just found it all a bit weak; it takes far, far too long to build up anything like an head of steam and is really rather over-scored with music that is left do too much of the heavy lifting when it comes to generating the sparing senses of peril this film elicits. Perhaps it isn't fair to look upon it critically forty years later, when so many of our sensitivities have been eroded away, but I really couldn't figure out quite what all the fuss was about. It's now a cult film - and maybe that says it all? Worth a watch, but a television leaves nothing missing, I'd say. || Here Edward Woodward stars as Sgt. Howie, a Christian Scottish policeman sent to the remote island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. 

The horror of the Wicker Man is not the obvious kind that hits you in the face with a hammer, but quietly creeps up on you. The way the pagan villagers act indifferently or defensively to the supposed disappearance or murder of a child is disturbing, especially as everyone seems to be hiding something, including the girl's classmates.

One criticism of the various heavily cut versions of the film is that not quite enough time is given to that subtle process of building up the suspense and atmosphere of the film. The Director's Cut, however, is a small masterpiece. The central idea of this closed-off pagan community, generally peaceful but indulging in the rare bit of ritual of human sacrifice, is delicious. 

Woodward as Howie is on top acting form, as is the legendary Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. Economical storytelling ratchets up suspense and mystery. Additionally, the film boasts one of the best and most fitting soundtracks I've ever heard, comprised mostly of in world folk songs rather than generic ""spooky"" music.

The ending of The Wicker Man must go down as one of the most shocking in cinema history. Since the film plays it relatively cool until that point, the payoff is all the more harrowingly believable. 

I also enjoyed the idea that, in terms of what may lie beyond death from the point of view of the characters, both Howie and the islanders get some kind of ""reward"" from the final ritual. The islanders get the reassurance that their crops will thrive in the coming year, while Howie gets his martyr's death and the expectation of a special place in heaven. The film made me think a lot about belief systems; who is to say paganism is less valid than any other system of religion? All religions are sustained by faith and passion rather than reason or evidence.

Thought-provoking, strangely beautiful, and just plain creepy, the restored version of The Wicker Man deserves its cult status. Even if you're not usually a fan of horror, you're likely to take something away from this burnt offering. The word ""classic"" was invented for this brilliant and eccentric film."

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || ***Sad drama with Leelee Sobieski and Stellan Skarsgård switches to thriller***

A suddenly orphaned teen girl (Leelee Sobieski) & her little brother start a new life in Malibu with their guardians (Stellan Skarsgård & Diane Lane), who might not be the caring friends of their parents they seem to be. Bruce Dern is on hand as a lawyer.

“The Glass House” (2001) starts as a melancholic drama with the general plot, setting and tone of “Poison Ivy” (1992), but without the lethal Lolita angle. It eventually morphs into a suspense/thriller à la “Enough” (2002), just don’t expect Leelee to change into Rambo, like J-Lo.    

Sobieski as protagonist Ruby is one-dimensionally sullen, which fits the situation, but it gives a lifeless vibe to the proceedings. Some critics claim the last act is predictable, but it's really not, excepting the fact that two people ultimately square off (which is obvious from the beginning). I'd cite examples but don't want to give away spoilers.

The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Malibu & that general area of Los Angeles.

GRADE: B- || The Glass House is one of those movies that might not blow you away but keeps you intrigued with its unsettling vibe. The cold, modern house perfectly mirrors the eerie atmosphere, creating an unsettling backdrop for the story. The cinematography uses this to its advantage, making the environment feel as much a part of the tension as the characters themselves. Leelee Sobieski delivers a standout performance, convincingly portraying her character’s growth and determination amidst the unfolding mystery. Stellan Skarsgård adds another layer with his chilling yet restrained presence, keeping you on edge even when the story feels familiar.

Sure, the plot leans toward predictable territory, which seems to be a sticking point for critics, but the film’s strength lies in how it teases the possibility of different outcomes. Even if the ending plays it safe, the journey there has enough intrigue to hold your attention. It’s not groundbreaking, but it’s a solid thriller with good acting, a cold and unsettling tone, and just enough tension to make it worth a watch. If you’re in the mood for something straightforward yet atmospheric, it’s a decent pick."

“Are You a Wolf Or A Sheep?” || _**Great urban thriller**_

Ethan Hawke plays Hoyt, a rookie cop on his first 24-hour training day with the L.A.P.D. narcotics division. Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?

""Training Day"" had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six weeks as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of ""Training Day"" is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in ""Runaway Train"" or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now.""

As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, ""I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir."" How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.

There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Training Day"" is an excellent urban thriller with a captivating performance by Washington. It's fittingly ugly, raw and brutal, so stay away if you don't think you can stomach it.

The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in L.A. Peripheral actors include Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Eva Mendes, Charlotte Ayanna, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.

GRADE: A- || Denzel Washington is sensational in this, the plot might not quite match his performance but <em>'Training Day'</em> is still a great watch. It's a riveting 122 minutes, I'm just not in love with how the premise is played out.

Washington's character, Alonzo, never really changes throughout, despite a supposed problem of his. I kept waiting for a reason to change the opinion that the first act puts to you regarding him but it never came, there's never a point I cared for him and I assume I was supposed to... at least to some degree? Also, his issue is thrown at you in one scene and isn't really mentioned again until the end. I get the character, just not his arc.

Ethan Hawke is very good, too, in this, even if I kept hearing Tom Cruise when he spoke... You also have a load of now familiar faces involved, including Eva Mendes, Raymond Cruz, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Terry Crews. Quite an interesting cast list, that.

Loved all of this, except the (still good) plot execution. Maybe that's just me though. From what I've seen, Washington's best performance so far. He's the main takeaway from this whatever way you look at it."

They begin to encounter the pack ice with over 400 miles yet to go, and as they become deeply embedded in the frozen wastes their ship falls foul to it’s icy might. It’s at this point that their journey turns from one of exploration to one of survival as they must attempt to find their way back onto the shipping lanes, or better yet - to land. The story is fact so we all know what actually happened, what makes this stand out is the use of some astonishingly well preserved archive. Coupled with some insightful interviews from relatives of some of the crew, this paints a genuinely chilly picture of a terrain hostile to all but penguins and seals. A voyage reminiscent of that taken by the mutinied Captain Bligh through high seas, snow storms and hurricane-force winds is captured using photography, diary entries and some actuality as these men face the worst that the elements can throw at them with no hope at all of help finding them. This also serves as an interesting reminder of just how bleak and barren (for people) this part of the planet was a mere century ago, and it does make you wonder in awe at the courage and perseverance of these men armed only with a few fur sleeping bags, harpoons, with everything else made of wood and them only bearing what they could physically carry themselves. There’s a lot to be said for the audio here, too - the whistling, howling wind and the breaking waves also add to the sense of danger, yes, but also of fortitude and bravery. It makes you reach for a jumper when you watch it, too!"

It's the complete opposite that really works well here as we mingle the story of an 18th century woman living within the constraints of high Victorian society with a more profligate 1970s one. To fit out the earlier scenario, we meet the shy ""Sarah"" (Meryl Streep) who is rebounding from a liaison with the titular French lieutenant by having an even less suitable assignation with the altogether more decent ""Charles"" (Jeremy Irons). The modern day scenario has the same two actors playing ""Anna"" and ""Mike"", only both are married to others and they are the ""real"" life actors portraying these other characters in a film of their lives. Now we get to experience the story of both relationships undulating in parallel. It sounds way more complex than it actually is as a combination of Harold Pinter's adaptation of the original novel and the acting from both Streep and Irons manages to convince us that though we are seeing two separate stories play out before us, they have remarkable similarities in the life imitating art sort of space. I preferred the older scenario, but only because the supporting cast of characters could make much more of their rigid, sexist and downright hypocritical environment and Streep works well with her frankly quite insipid ""Sarah"". The more modern day story tended more to soap for my liking: their behaviour more duplicitous, selfish and that led to a disappointing degree of predicability. More relatable, if you like. I'm not really a fan of Irons, but here he works well across both iterations and gels remarkably well with a Streep who seems to morph from both of her persona effortlessly and convincingly. The pace can dawdle at times, and maybe Karel Reisz could have just tightened things up a little at the rather plodding start, but the production design across both storylines looks good and it's once the tram lines are laid down and the two become entrenched, it becomes quite a compelling story of love, lust, betrayal and lies."

The Legend of Hell House is directed by John Hough and adapted to screenplay by Richard Matheson from his own novel Hell House. It stars Roddy McDowall, Pamela Franklin, Clive Revill and Gayle Hunnicutt. Music is by Electrophon Ltd and cinematography by Alan Hume.

The Belasco Mansion, the Mount Everest of Haunted Houses, a place where many have stayed and never made it out alive or escaped with sanity in tact. Now four more people are challenged to enter it and investigate if survival after death exists...

In many ways it is a film that has been unlucky over the years, for it has consistently been dogged with association with Robert Wise's similar themed, and excellent, The Haunting from 1963. Not only that but it was also released in the same year as The Exorcist, William Friedkin's behemoth that continues to cast a shadow over many a supernatural based horror movie. While the fact that it was ""toned down sexually"" from the book has proved to be irksome to some fans of Matheson's page turner. Oh definitely John Hough's film has a sturdy fan base and reputation, but it still comes under fire from first time viewers who will not judge it on its own terms. A shame because although it may indeed not be in the same league as The Haunting, or as sexually charged as the book, it does sit worthily in the top draw of haunted house pictures.

The back story to the house sets the scene. It was run as a place of complete debauchery, a sort of Buck Whaley and the Hellfire Club type of place, the master of ceremonies was the owner Emeric Balasco, a man with a fearsome reputation, that of a roaring giant. When one day the sins and violence overspill, all inside are finalised from the planet, only Belasco was never found, and ever since that day the house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits. Enter our four protagonists (a physicist and his wife, a mental medium and a physical medium who was the sole survivor of the last Hell House carnage), who under a financially dangled carrot set about unearthing the truth. They are opposites in beliefs, and for the next 90 minutes they will be haunted whilst having their respective fears, desires and repressions born out.

What unfolds is a lesson in how to get the maximum scary atmosphere with so little to hand. Following the brilliant example set by Robert Wise back in 63, special effects are kept to an absolute minimum as Hough lets our minds eye fill in the blanks. We don't need to see the horror up front, it's better when we can just feel or hear it. Little incidents help fuel the fire, a mad cat, a séance, ectoplasm (put a specimen in the jar please, ooh Matron), suspicious noises, eroticism and a little possession. The mansion itself is suitably eerie (exteriors are the wonderfully Gothic designed Wykehurst Place in Bolney, West Sussex) and drifting in and out of the story is Electrophon Ltd's rumbling sinister score. The direction is tight, the cast work exceptionally well to bear out the interpersonal conflicts before the final battle against the paranormal kills or defines them?

Working well as a haunted house spooker of some considerable substance, and intelligent and interesting with its themes of paranormal psychology and investigation of such, The Legend of Hell House is a classical supernatural thriller. 8/10"

The Great Silence is directed by Sergio Corbucci and Corbucci co- writes the screenplay with Mario Amendola, Bruno Corbucci and Vittoriano Petrilli. It stars Jean-Louis Trintignant, Klaus Kinski, Frank Wolff, Luigi Pistilli, Vonetta McGee and Mario Brega. Music is by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Silvano Ippoliti.

Snowhill, Utah - Winter at the turn of the century, and the local villagers have succumbed to thievery purely to survive. But with that comes bounties on their heads, which brings into the area the bounty hunters who are a law unto themselves. Enter the mute gunfighter known as Silence, who has a deep rooted hatred of bounty hunters...

Something of a cult classic and massively popular in Spaghetti Western fan's circles, The Great Silence is as perpetually cold as the snowy landscapes that surround this tale. Death is a financial commodity, greed and corruption stalks the land, while the shades between right and wrong are as blurry as can be. The violence cuts deep, none more so than with the famous finale that closes down the pic with a pneumatic thud. The photography captures the winter scapes perfectly and is in tune with the narrative drive, while maestro Morricone lays a ethereal musical score over proceedings. 

There's some daft goofs such as a dead man blinking and manacles that mysteriously disappear, and not all the acting is of the standard that Kinski and Wolff provide, but this is one utterly unforgettable bowl of Spaghetti. Its reputation in the pasta circles well deserved. 8/10 || _**Killers in the snow of the (Italian) Old West**_

In 1898, a mute gunfighter called Silence (Jean-Louis Trintignant) comes to a snowy town in northern Utah where ruthless bounty hunters clash with fugitives in the hills. He accepts a job from a widow (Vonetta McGee) to take out Loco (Klaus Kinski), the man who slew her husband.  

Directed & co-written by Sergio Corbucci, “The Great Silence” (1968) ranks with the better Spaghetti Westerns due to several highlights: The awesome snowy setting, a moving score by Ennio Morricone, the silent protagonist, the uniquely beautiful Vonetta McGee (a rare black woman in a prominent role in an old Western), the dastardly villain played by Kinski and the shocking climax. It influenced future Westerns, like “The Claim” (2000) and “The Hateful Eight” (2015). 

As with most Italian Westerns from back then, the English dubbing is serviceable at best. The only issue I have on this front is the voice used for Kinski’s character, which seems incongruous.

The movie runs 1 hour, 45 minutes, and was shot about 15 miles from the border of Austria in northeastern Italy (San Cassiano & Cortina d'Ampezzo), as well as the flashback done at Bracciano Lake, Rome, with other stuff done in Elios Studios, Rome.

GRADE: B+ || Set against a really effective wintry, hostile, background this tells the story of revenge - and that's always best served cold! A woman ""Pauline"" (Vonetta McGee) and her family are the victims of unscrupulous bandits. Bent of avenging their heinous behaviour, she hires an equally ruthless and deadly enforcer of her own (Jean-Louis Trintignant) to even the score. This anonymous, mute, gunman is very adept at settling scores, and as the bodies gradually pile up, it looks like a confrontation with the bounty hunter/killer ""Tigrero"" (Klaus Kinski) cannot be long for the waiting. This is a film that you need to watch with a blanket. The freezing scenarios are used superbly to create a sense of isolation, desperation and the frequent presence of blood spattering the snow helps further illustrate the violent and brutal nature of the lives of the late 19th century Utah citizens - only marginally on the human side of civilisation. The dubbing isn't the best, but the dialogue isn't actually that important. It's the whole look and feel of this film that resonates really well. Kinski and his maniacal eyes, the mute Trintignant (did he just not want to learn any lines?) and the sparing interventions of local kingpin ""Pollicut"" (Luigi Pistilli) and sheriff ""Burnett"" (Frank Wolff) all add richness and general unpleasantness to the whole thing. What also helps here is unpredictability. The narrative does not just plod along with the usual hero/anti-hero inevitability to it. The story is alive, it has an authenticity and duplicitousness to it that holds the attention really well before a bleak and, frankly rather savage, denouement that is entirely fitting! It's a great big screen experience!"
