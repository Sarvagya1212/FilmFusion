The class of haves, in his view, were being increasingly selfish and dog-eat-dog, while the have-nots of the world could not be expected to stand by idly. Society was surely headed for a breakdown, and his 1967 film WEEKEND is an absurdist vision of it in one hour and forty-five minutes. This is emphatically *not* a good entry point to Godard -- if you don't know his work, see Breathless or Le Mepris first -- but it is a marvelous capstone to his first decade of cinema. (After this, Godard disappeared from the limelight for some years while making more overtly political films with Jean-Pierre Gorin as the Dziga Vertov collective.)

Married couple Roland (Jean Yanne) and Corinne (Mireille Darc) set off from Paris one weekend for Corinne's parents' home, as her father is dying and they want to make sure they get their cut of inheritance. Not only is their relationship with Corinne's parents focused solely on money, but both Roland and Corinne are secretly having affairs and each plans to later dispose of the other in order to run away with their lovers. As Roland and Corinne hit the road, civilization appears to have vanished all around them: people are violently fighting each other over petty arguments, the road out of Paris is an endless traffic jam of honking horns and yelling, and the roadside is littered with car wrecks and their bloody victims.

WEEKEND is a grand portrait of human veniality like Dante's INFERNO. Even when Corinne and Roland encounter a group of hippies, the idealistic dreamers who oppose the cruel order of capitalist society, they are shown great cruelty. Godard was awfully prescient: not only did he shoot this film a year before the events of May 1968 and he presaged a youth revolt, but he also expected that youth to perpetuate the same flaws of the system they overthrew.

Visually, WEEKEND is as much a delight as any of Godard's other colour films of this time, with a pop art feel. Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard had a great eye for colour, mainly the red, white, and blue from the French flag, but all the hues on screen are bold and electric. A great treat for film aficionados are several long tracking shots that required great skill to shoot, such as the long traffic jam. There's a lot of poetry in the shots: I don't know why, but a long take where a pianist plays a Mozart suite to a crowd of farmers in a barnyard and Anne Wiazemsky (in a non-speaking role) walks up to listen, is as emotionally moving to me as anything from Tarkovsky.

By this point Godard's films assume that the viewer is an intellectual, someone who has read a good bit of the literary canon and is aware of the political disputes not only of our time but also those reaching back to the 18th century. Thus as Corinne and Roland are wandering around lost around their own eventual car wreck, they come across the historical personage Saint-Just from the French Revolution (one of two amusing roles played here by the legendary Jean-Pierre Léaud), who absurdistly declaims from his writings while decked out in period costume. They then meet Tom Thumb and Emily Brontë. As the climax of the film approaches, two representatives of the Third World, African and Arab dustmen that our protagonists hitch a ride from, recite a revolutionary Marxist text at some length. And one scene where Corinne recounts a sexual encounter to her lover is a parody of Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA, which had come out the previous year.

Criterion's re-release of WEEKEND on Blu-ray is a welcome event. The pop-art canvas of Godard's 1960s colour films comes through better in this higher-resolution format than on the old DVD releases. Criterion's extras are also enjoyable and informative. Viewers without a prior grounding in Godard's literary/political/social context will appreciate a 20-minute visual essay by Kent Jones which explains most of the references in the film, as well as some contemporary developments in Godard's life that aren't directly shown in the film, but made it what it is. There are interviews with the main actors from French television just before the film's 1968 release, and they explain how great it was to work with Godard, though one realizes that they hadn't seen the finished film and might well have been appalled at its anarchic pace and agitprop. The role of ""making of"" featurettes is provided by relatively recent interviews with cinematographer Raoul Coutard and assistant director Claude Miller."

The French New Wave drew much inspiration from American crime stories, and Jean-Luc Godard's 1965 film PIERROT LE FOU has a plot that is essentially simple: Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo), five years into a marriage that leaves him unsatisfied, meets his children's babysitter and discovers that she's an old flame of his, Marianne (Anna-Karina). They both want to run away, and as it turns out that Marianne already has some experience in the criminal underworld, the pair steal some cash and head towards the south of France. On their way to what they hope is a better life, they leave a trail of more crimes in their wake. However, tension builds between the two, as Pierre is mopey, obsessed with literature, and pessimistic, while Marianne is a capricious and spontaneous personality who doesn't want to think about the future. When they are confronted by some other gangsters in Nice, things come to a head.

But it is the extremely elaborate way in which this story is told that elevates this from a cheap thriller to a masterpiece of avant-garde cinema. Scenes are depicted with exaggerated features, often becoming absurdist metaphors for the action that the audience should understand has happened. Two dialogues between the lovers turn into musical numbers. Even in straightforward thriller plot turns like shootouts, Godard avoids any pretence at realism. The old Brechtian technique of alienation, where the audience is continually reminded that they are watching staged action and not the real thing, is thus abundantly employed. Furthermore, Godard confronts 1960s consumer society and the Vietnam War.

It's modernist and highly personal, sure, but PIERROT LE FOU is also instantly accessible to an open-minded audience due to its pop art feel. The colours in the elaborate set designs and landscapes are electric, it's as if Godard and cinematographer Raoul Coutard in 1965 saw brighter shades of everything than we do today, and could bring that hyper-sensory perception across on film. Karina and Belmondo are not only masterful actors in themselves, they also have great chemistry together. When it all comes down to it, PIERROT LE FOU is simply an emotionally moving film. After I saw it the first time, I felt as if my life had changed forever, and I swiftly scheduled another viewing (the film continues to impress on rewatching).

I don't know if this would be the best introduction to Godard. However, there is an especial pleasure in seeing his films in chronological order and coming to PIERROT LE FOU after the director's nine preceding feature films. Godard packed this film's storytelling technique, costumes, film score, and other elements with references to each of the movies he had made to date. These little winks, looks back at a productive and already storied career that in fact had only started six years before, are fun for aficionados.

The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-Ray and DVD in 2008. Unfortunately, this release swiftly fell out of print after Criterion lost the North American rights. That's a real shame, as the Blu-Ray presents this visually gorgeous film in the HD format it deserves, and there are many interesting extras on both the Blu-Ray and the 2DVD set: an hour-long documentary on Godard and Karina's time working together, an interview with the elderly Karina made just for Criterion, archival interviews with cast and crew, and a featurette where Jean-Pierre Gorin presents the themes of the PIERROT LE FOUR in an audio track over excerpts from the film. || Remember the old days of vinyl when you'd put the stylus on, and it would just slide across the disc? Well, despite the number of times I have watched this film, it does the same as that stylus. I just don't really get it. It centres around the slightly Bonnie and Clyde existence of the married and recently unemployed television executive ""Ferdinand"" (Jean Paul Belmondo) and his flighty ex-babysitter ""Marianne"" (Anna Karina) as they travel across France trying to make a Bohemian sort of living whilst she avoids some Algerian gangsters from whom she has worked smuggling guns. Now we know from the start that these two have a bit of history - she continuously calls him ""Pierrot"" - much to his chagrin, but different as they are, and rather despite themselves, together they must remain as their escapades become more perilous, quirky and their personalities emerge stronger and clearer. I get all of that, it's a road movie - a colourful, occasionally entertaining one - with a certain, though not overwhelming - degree of chemistry between the two handsome stars. The scenarios though, are all a bit repetitive and too much of the significance of the film seems attached to the former relationship (off screen) between Karina and Jean Luc Godard. Perhaps it is based on their own life, but what has that to do with what we are watching on the screen now? Sure, it's a well photographed and flee flowing story, but too much of the significance of the plot and the characterisation is reserved to those ""in the know"" and so I just found it, increasingly, a rather unremarkable semi-comical romp. It's highly rated, so I am probably just out of kilter - but for me this is really nothing much to write home about."

Sadly, here is no different - Todd Armstrong in the title role and Nancy Novak as "" Medea"" are as wooden as the Argo in this retelling of the ancient Greek myth. It is still, however, an exciting action adventure though, with plenty of episodes to keep it moving along as Jason fights monsters and treachery to seek out the legendary Golden Fleece from the distant land of Colchis. It's got a decent enough, largely British, supporting cast with Honor Blackman standing out as his patron ""Hera"" and Nigel Green making for a wonderfully over-the-top ""Hercules"", but the spoils definitely go to Talos, the Harpies and the skeleton battle is fabulous. || **_Swords & Greek Mythology in the Mediterranean_** 

Jason (Todd Armstrong), the rightful heir to the throne of Thessaly, Greece, gathers a crew of intrepid sailors to find the magical Golden Fleece, a quest that brings clashes with a 100’ bronze statue, a couple harpies, the venomous Hydra and a squad of sword-wielding skeletons.

“Jason and the Argonauts” (1963) is a sword & sandal flick based on Greek Mythology with Ray Harryhausen’s stop motion special effects, which were state-of-the-art at the time. It’s very similar to ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" from five years earlier and on par in all-around entertainment. 

You can’t beat the scenic Mediterranean locations, the vessel, the costumes and the mystical action sequences. The fight with the skeleton warriors only runs three minutes, at most, but it took Harryhausen four months to produce it.

Unfortunately, this isn’t as compelling, story-wise, as “Ulysses” (1954) and “Mysterious Island” (1961) or future flicks like “Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger” (1977) and “Conan the Barbarian” (1982). Those movies feature a fairly prominent female presence to counteract the sweaty men in loin cloths; this one doesn't. Sure, Nancy Kovack is on hand, but she doesn’t show up until well past the hour mark and not enough is done with her.

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot on the coasts of southern Italy (Salerno) with studio stuff done in Rome and Shepperton Studios, just west of London.

Washizu (the Macbeth character, Toshiro Mifune) is a soldier serving the lord of Spiders-Web Castle. While riding through a forest with his comrade and childhood friend Miki (the Banquo character, Minoru Chiaki), they come upon a forest spirit that foretells an elevation in rank for the two, and eventually Washizu's reign over Spiders-Web Castle. While Washizu denies that he has any desire to seize the throne, the forest spirit could see into his heart, as can his wife Asaji (the Lady Macbeth character, Isuzu Yamada) who spurs him on to murder any potential rivals. Thus Mifune moves inextricably towards his own elevation, but also his own fall.

Although the film is an adaptation of Shakespeare, the way the actors move before the camera owes much to the Japanese theatre called Noh. So much of the film is carried by the powerful facial expressions of the main actors: the over-the-top snarls and gasps of Mifune; the sad mien of Chiaki, as if his character is already aware of his fate; and the chilling calm of Yamada, a coldblooded killer even if she doesn’t personally murder anyone but has others do it. Kurosawa's set design is elaborate, one really feels back in Edo Japan. Furthermore, by shooting the film in a bleak part of Japan with abundant fog, the landscape powerfully mirrors the predicament in which the characters find themselves.

This is one of those films that any Westerners with a solid liberal arts education (by which I mean at least some general knowledge of Macbeth) should see and will probably enjoy. Because it is based on a universal theme that just happened to be so well packaged by Shakespeare, the plot is straightforward and engaging in spite of the exotic setting. But because viewers can so easily follow that plot, the feudal Japan dressing with its distinct mores will prove a fascinating touch, and Kurosawa has depicted this world in rich detail. I don't know if postwar scarcity was still a thing in 1956 when Kurosawa shot <i>Throne of Blood</i>, but it seems like no expense was spared here. || I think that this is a superb tragi-adventure story that stands out well amongst the numerous loose adaptations of Shakespeare that have been made over the years. Kurosawa takes the Scottish play and gives it the ""Noh"" treatment that delivers an enigmatic and tautly directed rendition of a story of betrayal, power and insanity. Toshirô Mifune is magnificent as ""Washizu"" who after getting lost with his colleague (Minoru Chiaki) in the doleful ""Spider's Web"" forest is given a cryptic prophecy that one day he too is destined to rule the great ""Spider's Web castle""... Initially reluctant to embark on this path, he soon becomes blinded by this ambition on the misguided advice of his wife (Isuzu Yamada) and so he sets out on a despotic path than can only end in disaster for everyone. The cast work the story well, ably aided by the eeriness of the sets and a sharp pace. It works far better, in my opinion, in monochrome - no colourful distractions from the moody cinematography of the forest nor of the castle architecture and the mobilisation of grand armies - especially in the scenes set in winter; and the general grittiness of the scenarios are easily akin to those of 11th Century Scotland. Once the delirium of the final scenes is upon us, the performances become plausible and in the end , I almost felt sorry for ""Washizu"". Great stuff."

_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._ || Can you dig it? Well actually yes Mr Hill, I bloody can! 

During my schooling as a teenager there were a handful of films that it was deemed cool to love, The Wanderers, Scum, Quadrophenia and The Warriors, and it's perhaps a weird thing to say... but I still feel here in my middle age that these are still cool films to be adored and cherished.

I have just sat through The Warriors again for about the hundredth time in my life, and it still entertains me as much now as it did back then, sure it's dated, sure I see more cheese than I thought it had back then, but I also see a visually tight movie that actually delves interestingly into the lives and psyche of young gangers.

The plot is simple, all the gangs of New York City are called to a meeting where they are called to unite to take over the city, the leader of the gang known as The Riffs is a guy called Cyrus who is the one calling for the unity. He is shot and killed during the rally and The Warriors are wrongly framed for his murder. The Warriors then have to make their way back home to Coney Island with every gang in the city out to kill them, and also with the police hot on their tail as well. This journey is excellent as we are introduced to a number of gangs trying to get the better of The Warriors, the fights are well choreographed, the clothes are wonderful, and some of the dialogue is now teenage folklore.

The film was criticised on release for glamorising gangs, but I fail to see how this opinion was formed, if anything, when analysing the main characters, the film has a sad streak running through it. Be that as it may, the films triumph is getting the will of the viewer to hopefully see the unfairly tarnished Warriors make it home to Coney Island, which builds to the climax of the film that is both poignant and punch the air greatness. 8/10 || In a dysfunctional New York City, the charismatic leader ""Cyrus"" (Roger Hill) assembles all the gangs and declares that it is time for them to overwhelm the police and to take control of their city. Amidst cheering crowds he is promptly gunned down - and the ""Warriors"" are held responsible. Led by ""Swan"" (Michael Beck) they must run a gauntlet of other avenging gangs and try to establish just who pulled the trigger. What now ensues is a really well paced, gritty, series of escapades that pit them against a whole range of thugs and hoodlums - of varying degrees of efficiency - whilst trying to evade the cops. Along the way back to Coney Island, they encounter serial hooker ""Mercy"" (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) and despite their initial hostility, she and ""Swan"" start to respect each other as their perilous journey comes to head. The whole look of this film is effective. There is not a great deal of dialogue - but what there is is frequently quite pithy. The story gathers pace with some well staged combat scenes, and some intense urban cinematography that lends well to the underlying purpose of the story of a lawless and dystopian society the is still the home for valour and courage, honesty and comradeship. On the downside, though they do their jobs well enough here, none of the acting is especially memorable, but maybe that is what helps this whole thing hit home. Next time you eat an ice lolly...!"

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is directed by Norman Z. McLeod and adapted loosely to screenplay by Ken Englund and Everett Freeman from the short story of the same name written by James Thurber. It stars Danny Kaye, Virginia Mayo, Boris Karloff, Fay Bainter, Thurston Hall, Ann Rutherford, Konstantin Shayne and Gordon Jones. A Technicoor production with music by Sylvia Fine (songs) and David Raskin (score) and cinematography by Lee Garmes.

Milquetoast Walter Mitty (Kaye) escapes the incessant needling of those around him by dreaming up exciting adventures for himself. Upon meeting gorgeous Rosalind van Hoorn (Mayo) he gets thrust into a real adventure involving Dutch treasure, but this is real stuff and his life is under threat!

A lovely Danny Kaye vehicle full of neatly constructed comedy, pleasant tunes and Technicolor supreme.

After the huge love and deserved critical praise for Ron Underwood’s 1990 film, Tremors, this in spite of poor box office and lead man Kevin Bacon disowning the film at the time, sequels were always likely. And so it proved.

Fred Ward and Michael Gross return from the first film and are joined by Christopher Gartin, Helen Shaver and Marcelo Tubert. Underwood hands over the directing reins to S.S. Wilson and co-produces instead, while music is by Jay Ferguson and cinematography by Virgil Harper.

In spite of adding some new beasties into the mix, it all feels very same old same old, only without the funny script and any sense of peril. What made Tremors so strong was that even as it had its tongue in its cheek, homaging 1950s creature features with a proud sense of being, it was still scary and suspenseful. The characters there gave a believable sense of danger and fright, here it’s just done for laughs, we never once think the principal players are remotely scared of the Graboids and their offspring.

Story has advanced for Earl (Ward) and Burt (Gross), where this time it’s Earl who is romancing (Shaver under used but lovely) and Burt is all on his lonesome as his Mrs (Heather played by Reba McEntire) has left him on account of his love of war and weapons, a joke which grows old very fast here. Still, when the action isn’t of the budget CGI kind, it’s well staged and good fun, though Wilson’s comic sequence shooting is flat, while Ward is a strong enough actor to carry the film to keep it above average.

Passably enjoyable for fans of creature feature movies without ever being an essential viewing choice. 5/10"

The third movie in the Tremors series of films is adequate entertainment for the fans. Michael Gross returns as Burt, who in turn returns to Perfection to find it a tourist haven of Graboid fans. Into the mix is a nefarious real estate deal that threatens the very existence of the townsfolk. But of course, the Graboids and their mutated offspring don’t care about such things.

If not expecting too much then this serves up some good straight to video fun. The formula remains the same, with Burt the paranoid saviour of perfection getting some good lines, while the return of characters from the first film is a splendid bonus for the fans. There’s some snarky asides to the perils/cheats of tourist traps, and the real estate rape of the land angle is driven home without over kill. Safe if undemanding creature feature fare. 6/10"

Sheriff Pat Garrett. Sold out to the Santa Fe ring. How does it feel?

Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is directed by Sam Peckinpah and written by Rudy Wurlitzer. It stars James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills and Barry Sullivan. Music is scored by Bob Dylan and cinematography by John Coquillon.

One time they were friends, cohorts in crime, but now Pat Garrett is the law and his objective is to bring down Billy the Kid.

It seems to be an absolute when writing about a Sam Peckinpah film that it was plagued by studio interference. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is no exception, the back story to which tells of behind the scenes clashes, bizarre cuts and a disownment of the film by cast and crew. Thankfully through the advent of time and technological advancements, it's one of the Peckinpah movies that can now be seen in a true light. A good job, too, since it's one of Bloody Sam's finest movies. My personal preference is for the TCM Preview version, and that is what is reviewed here.

Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid finds Peckinpah at his lyrical and elegiacal best, the old west is dying and as it is told through the eyes of aging Pat Garrett (Coburn), it's meticulously played out via an unhurried narrative structure. Time is afforded the key players, helping the story unfold its bitter take on the frontier changes as greed begets violence, Peckinpah wryly observing that the newly appeared good guys are no better than the bad guys, hence The Kid's (Kristofferson) reputation as a dandy likable outlaw becomes assured in spite of his less than honourable traits as a human being, but he at least is honourable to his codes.

Film contains many memorable scenes, scenes fit to grace any Western. A shoot-out and aftermath involving Pickens and Jurado has poignancy in abundance, Dylan's Knockin' On Heaven's Door tenderly filtered over the top of it. A duel featuring Jack Elam is another that resonates highly, great character moments are plentiful, performed by a roll call of Western movie legends, Peckinpah knew how to pick a cast and then some. Moments of violence are dotted throughout, Bloody Sam's trademark, as is cross-cuts, sepia tones and slow-mo. The great director even makes a Christ allegory not come off as cheap, and a self loathing mirror sequence strikes a significant chord.

This is a film big on characterisations, it's not just a film of visual touches, be it the dual psychological conflict between Pat and Billy, or the ream of peripheral players, everything they do is detailed and designed to capture the period and atmosphere of the changing times, the environment that folk inhabit, on either side of the law, is a big issue. No frame is wasted, MGM and their head honcho James Aubrey in their ignorance failed to see this fact. While the cast turn in damn fine work and Coquillon's burnished photography is striking and perfect for the director's vision.

It's undeniably downbeat, and the slow pace isn't to everyone's liking, but this is up with the other Peckinpah Western greats, The Wild Bunch and Ride the High Country. A truly great Western crafted by a truly great director. 9/10 || _**Peckinpah’s lyrical (dull) Western with a great cast and Dylan’s music**_

In 1881 New Mexico, Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is now a lawman working for ranch barons who want Garrett to take out his former wild friend, Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson). Everything leads to the final showdown at Fort Sumner. Bob Dylan is on hand as a stranger who assists Billy while notable actors show up for bit parts, usually just to get shot to death (R.G. Armstrong, Matt Clark, L.Q. Jones, Slim Pickens, Jack Elam, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills, Jason Robards, Richard Jaeckel, etc.).

“Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid” (1973) was a project that director Sam Peckinpah wanted to fulfill a dozen years earlier with his script for what he called “the definitive Billy the Kid movie” based on Charles Neider’s 1956 novel “The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones,” a fictional treatment of the story, with Stanley Kubrick set to direct. Marlon Brando eventually took over that production to create his outstanding “One-Eyed Jacks” (1961) with Peckinpah not given any writing credit.

In any case, this was a troubled production with the turbulent director struggling with serious alcoholism and only coherent for about four hours a day. Kristofferson got Dylan involved, who was initially enlisted to compose the title song, but eventually wrote the score/soundtrack for the entire film, most notably ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door.” The soundtrack album was released seven weeks after the movie’s debut.

It’s very similar in tone and theme to Peckinpah’s “The Wild Bunch” (1969) with Coburn’s role being almost identical to that of Robert Ryan in that more famous Western. It’s also reminiscent of contemporaneous films like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” and “The Missouri Breaks.” But it’s the least of these because the story is both uninvolving and tedious despite the gory gun slayings every 10 minutes. Like “The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid” from the year prior, it makes the Old West ugly. 

Meanwhile Dylan’s one-dimensional folk ditties don’t help in making it compelling, but rather drag it down. I mean no disrespect to the musical icon. His music is fine for what it is; it’s just too static to carry a film like this IMHO.

Peckinpah complained that 15 minutes were cut from his preview version while six editors are credited with the final product. Maybe this is why there’s no drive to the picture. Too many cooks spoil the broth.      

On a positive note, Dylan does fine in his acting debut and looks more like the real-life Billy the Kid than Kristofferson, who resembles Jim Morrison. Plus there are some great sequences, like Billy’s 10-step duel with Elam’s character. And you can’t beat the cast, which also includes Rita Coolidge, who was Kristofferson’s girlfriend during shooting and would become his wife for the next seven years.

To see Peckinpah at his Western best I recommend the outstanding “Ride the High Country” (1962) and the unique “The Ballad of Cable Hogue” (1970).

There are a few cuts of the film: The theatrical version runs 1 hr 46 min, the 1988 restored cut runs 2 hr 2 min and the 2005 Special Edition runs 1 hr 55 min (which is the version I saw). The movie was shot in Durango Mexico, roughly 500 miles due south of the historical locations in New Mexico. 

GRADE: C || James Coburn has something of the Angel of Death to him in this rather pace-less but still quite enthralling story of these two men after they'd ceased being on the same side. His alter-ego here (Kris Kristofferson) is having some fun in New Mexico to the chagrin of some cattle ranchers and so they employ ""Garrett"" to come be their sheriff and settle things down. He warns his erstwhile buddy to skedaddle, but of course he doesn't and so a posse is formed to chase him out or track him down. With both men determined in their own way to never give in, a lethal denouement begins to look like it will be the only way to prove who's best. Coburn only ever really had one, very slow, gear - but his considered effort here actually starts to imbue his character with quite a bit of menace and counters engagingly with the more profligate, almost playboy, image offered of ""Billy"" by Kristofferson. There is plenty of action as the story sees the lawman hoover up some of the more undesirable elements of the now less ""wild"" west and that, in itself, is quite symbolic of changing attitudes amongst a more civilised and law-abiding community. Of course, it would not be complete without some early symbolism of corporate greed, and it soon becomes evident that the barons paying his wages have an agenda of their own. There's a solid supporting cast with veteran western stars Chill Wills, Jason Robards, Barry Sullivan (he's doing John Wayne's bit) and the always curmudgeonly Jack Elam keeping the thing characterful and authentic looking and then there's Bob Dylan. Why? Your guess is as good as mine as he brings very, very, little to his largely dialogue-free part. Indeed, were it not for frequent reprises of a his song - ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" proving quite appropriate, his presence would be completely superfluous to a gritty and thoughtful story that points to the end of an era."

The source story from which this film is adapted, ""I Am Legend"" written by Richard Matheson, is rightly or wrongly considered to be something of a sci-fi classic. This explains why in three different decades the film has been adapted to the big screen. Following on from this first attempt we have been offered up The Omega Man in 1971 and I Am Legend in 2007, all three big screen outings are of differing quality and separated by their respective approaches to the subject.

The Last Man On Earth is to me the best of the three films to date. Having horror legend Vincent Price play the main character automatically lends people to think that this picture is primarily a horror film. Something that may explain why it's been largely ignored outside of those who have a penchant for Matheson and Price's respective work. Tho proudly containing (justly) horror elements (George Romero was clearly watching with interest) Ubaldo Ragona's film perfectly portrays the agony of Morgan's solitude, it's not merely about his battle with virally challenged zombies. Morgan's battle is chiefly with himself (wonderfully realised by an undervalued Price performance) he may have inherited the Earth, but his function has been reduced to being nothing more than an assassin of the night creatures. His existence is growing grim by the year, until he makes an amazing discovery, and it's one that swerves the film into its final quarter. Where to me at least, the film achieves what the other adaptations failed to do, namely no swagger involved, no cop outs and pandering to the norm, it's a highly fitting finale that is in keeping with the story's heart.

Tho based as if in an American city, it's actually shot on location in Rome, Italy. With the whole cast other than Price himself, being Italian. Low on budget, The Last Man On Earth is unable to break free of its B movie sheen, yet this aids the structure of the picture. Grainy black and white shots of derelict streets are boosting the apocalyptic essence, this is a depressing time, not only for Morgan, but for us the viewers as well. We are not meant to jump out of our seats with fright, or to whoop and holler as Morgan lays waste to another creature of the night. We are asked to imagine what it would be like to be the last human on Earth, and if indeed we could quite simply cope with the isolation and dreams of a life long since past.

Fine and intelligent picture 7.5/10 || The first hour was very good - that he could have been the last man on Earth wasn't so hard to believe. However, the closing scenes were a bit routine and disappointing."

On the trail are hit men Quill & Sappensly, Bennie & his prostitute girlfriend Elita, and some other Mexican bandit types, all of them are on a collision course that will bring far more than they all bargained for.

This was the one film where director Sam Peckinpah felt he had the most control, the one where we apparently get his own cut and not some chopped up piece of work from interfering executives. Viewing it now some 34 years after its release, it stands up well as a testament to the work of a great director. On the surface it looks trashy, we have homosexual hit men, grave robbing, potential rape, murders abound, prostitution, lower than the low characters, in short the film is awash with Peckinpah traits. Yet it would be a disservice to even think this film isn't rich in thematic texture, for the journey that Bennie, our main protagonist takes is one of meaning, he is a loser, but we find him on this quest to find not only fortune, but respect and love. It's a bloody trail for sure, but it has much depth and no little Peckinpah humour to push the film to it's bloody yet triumphant finale. Warren Oates is rewarded by Peckinpah for years of sterling work for him by getting the lead role of Bennie, and he grasps it with both hands to turn in a wonderful performance that splits sadness and vibrancy with deft of ease.

Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia has a harsh quality about it, be it the violence, or be it the sadness of the characters, but what isn't in doubt to me is that it's harshness is cloaked in Peckinpah splendour. 9/10 || Some of the works of Peckinpah had been on my watch list for months, sitting there in a subfolder of a subfolder. From the choice of Straw Dogs and Cross of Iron, I chose the aforetitled, liking the idea of embarking on a bit of a journey through Mexico with a gritty protagonist as we experience splatterings of violence and negotiate the thoughts of a down and out vagabond making a ran for his riches.

The film left me with mixed feelings. I enjoyed the path of Benny, experiencing how his character is unwavering in his desire to take that last lucky ticket out of debauchery street, but didn't care much for his journey's partner. While I appreciated the dynamic of the relationship, the understanding they both had that they weren't in love with each other, but all they both had, the chemistry and dialogue didn't really resonate with me at parts. I actually was rather glad when this relationship came to its abrupt end as the film entered its final 3rd.

On top of that, there was major issues with the sound which made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the journey at times. I found myself feeling I was watching a caricature of a 70s movie now and again, as opposed to be engrossed in a gritty noir-esque adventure.

But all in all, an enjoyable film which has left an impression. I always appreciate watching unpolished characters navigating circumstances plotted outside their usual courses, then watching how they deal with the inevitable implosion. From what I've read since, the film was one which perhaps accurately portrayed the director's life at the time of filming; dealing with various booze-infused demons. That rawness definitely shows, as does the inevitable imperfections in this movie's execution."

""All I want is to Enter My House Justified""

Sam Peckinpah's second feature film is today standing up as a must see and must own for those interested in the Western genre.

The film sees ageing lawman Steve Judd land a job of escorting a gold shipment safely to a bank in Hornitos. After running into old friend, and fellow aged lawman Gil Westrun, he hires both he and his young sparky sidekick Heck Longtree to hopefully see the job through to a successful conclusion. Yet Gil has other ideas, for where Steve is upstanding and adhering to the values he has lived his life by, Gil sees this as one last chance to actually get a big payday. The journey takes a further twist as the three men meet and then save Elsa Knudsen from a brutal marriage, it's an incident that puts them all on a collision course with the Hammond brothers.

What we have here is Sam Peckinpah's first film dealing with men who have outlived their time. We witness some emotionally poignant stuff as the two main protagonists know that they have aged beyond their world, yet as alike as they are, they have different ideals in how to deal with the advent of time. The masterstroke here is the casting of genre legends Joel McRea & Randolph Scott as Steve & Gil respectively. It's evident from the off that both men are identifying with their characters, with both men hitting top emotional form to fully realise the thematic heart of the story. Mariette Hartley makes her film debut as Elsa, and she fits in nicely with the quality on show behind and in front of the camera. Lucien Ballard's cinematography is gorgeous as the various California locations envelope the protagonists in a sort of elegiac way, and Peckinpah directs with his heart as well as his head.

Bookended by two heart-achingly super sequences, of which the finale has rightly passed into Western genre legend, this really is a strong and beautiful film, one that simultaneously shows a truly great director was at work. For here he was left alone, and the final result is a quality Western beating far more than just a cowboy heart. The supporting cast is strong, notably Edgar Buchanan, L.Q. Jones & John Anderson, while the undervalued George Bassman provides a  narratively  fitting tonal music score. If there is a criticism? it's that Peckinpah doesn't let the younger characters breath, but given the film's core focus on aged men in an aged passing era, well it's easily forgiven. A precursor to The Wild Bunch for sure, but while the theme is the same for both films, this one impacts in a very different way. Highly recommended, not just for the Oater crowd, but for fans of classic cinema too. 9/10"

Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is directed by Terence Fisher and written by Bert Batt. It stars Peter Cushing, Veronica Carlson, Simon Ward and Freddie Jones. Music is by James Bernard and cinematography by Arthur Grant.

The fifth entry in Hammer Film's Frankenstein series is one of the best. Playing as a variant on the original Frankenstein sources, story finds Cushing's Baron Victor Frankenstein as an utterly repugnant individual who is prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve his medical goals. Morally and ethically bankrupt, Frankenstein blackmails young lovers Anna and Karl into helping him achieve his ultimate goal - with disastrously ghoulish results for all concerned.

Steered strongly by the hands of the under valued Fisher, pic is not just hauntingly elegant as per being a Gothic mood piece, but it is filled out with macabre shocks, and even gallows humour. Some scenes are striking in their ability to gnaw away at your senses, including the infamous sexual predator scene that has divided opinions (personally I think it's great in showing how low Frankenstein has gotten). It builds to a terrific climax, where Freddie Jones (turning in a super emotionally driven turn as one of the better ""creatures"" in the series) and Frankenstein indulge in spider and fly bluster.

Despair, degradation and disintegration unbound, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is high-end Hammer Horror. 8/10 || _**One of the best Frankenstein films**_

Hammer did 7 Frankenstein films in 17 years from the late 50s to early 70s:

1. The Curse of Frankenstein (1957); 2. The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958); 3. The Evil of Frankenstein (1964); 4. Frankenstein Created Woman (1967); 5. Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969); 6. The Horror of Frankenstein (1970); and 7. Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974).

Peter Cushing played Baron Frankenstein in every one of these except ""The Horror of Frankenstein"" because it was a remake of the original story and they needed a much younger actor to play the role; they chose Ralph Bates (who superbly plays the love-to-hate satanist in ""Taste the Blood of Dracula,"" released the same year).

We all know the basic Frankenstein tragedy: A brilliant scientist is obsessed with creating life and eventually succeeds, but his creation goes on a killing spree, although the creature is nice to kids 'cause they're innocent. Ultimately the monster must be destroyed (and the Baron usually goes with him).

I like how ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" deviates from this overdone original plot. The story involves Baron Frankenstein as a fugitive going by a different name yet still intent on continuing his gruesome work. He cunningly manipulates a young couple into assisting him wherein they apprehend a patient from the local asylum to conduct experimental surgeries.

This is one of the best Frankenstein flicks I've seen. It's creative, labyrinthian and full of pizazz. Being a sequel, the film retains the essential elements of the original story but is a natural progression. The REAL monster in this picture is Baron Frankenstein himself; he's no longer a basically decent, brilliant person obsessed with creating life. His obsession has defiled him to the point of enmity, hate, arrogance, violence, rape and murder. 

Speaking of the brief rape sequence, I always felt it was forced into the script to make the series more 'cutting edge' at the height of the counterculture movement (1969). In other words, it was out of character for Baron Frankenstein but producers didn't care because they wanted to keep the series 'hip' and profitable in the late 60s. That said, I suppose it can be defended on the grounds that Victor got morally worse as the series proceeded and his arrogance increased; and this was the second to last film (discounting “The Horror of Frankenstein” which, again, was a redo of the original story with a different actor).

The film is highlighted by Veronica Carlson, who looks a lot like Ursula Andress, but possibly even more beautiful (if you can imagine that).

The movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot just northwest of London at EMI Studios, Elstree, and nearby Tykes Water Lake, as well as Stanmore Hall Lodge, Middlesex (Victor’s hiding place). 

Another great Frankenstein film from this same period is the Italian ""Lady Frankenstein,"" which likewise puts a creative spin on Shelley’s basic plot. It was released in 1971 and stars Rosalba Neri (aka Sara Bey) as the Baron's daughter who overtakes his work after his death. See my review for details.

RELEASED IN 1959 and directed by Paul Wendkos, ""Gidget” is a beach drama about a 16 year-old tomboyish girl (Sandra Dee) who gravitates toward a group of surfing males in Southern Cal, specifically Malibu. Kahuna (Cliff Robertson), a surf “bum” and leader of the group, becomes her figurative big brother as she tries to attract the attentions of Kahuna’s mentee, Moondoggie (James Darren).

The film is iconic and influential, leading to two sequels and a TV series, not to mention scores of 60’s beach flicks, most inferior because they lack the depth and went the zany route. Dee was only 16 during shooting, but seemed more mature than her years and is remarkably strong as the petite protagonist. She’s a combo of youthful energy, honesty and unexpected insight & understanding. The film scores high marks in the female department in general with curvy Yvonne Craig (aka Batgirl) notable in the first act, but there are several others in the periphery.

The movie’s iconic because it’s about way more than girl-meets-boy frolics, although there’s some of that. For instance, Kahuna says ""Who says so?"" in response to how we 'have' to live our lives. Later, he recognizes ""everything has a price"" or, put differently, everything has a tradeoff. He desperately seeks total freedom, but realizes it doesn’t really exist in our present world, but he instinctively seeks it. His epiphany leads to an important decision.

Then there's Moondoggie who admires Kahuna and intends on following in his footsteps as an alternative to his staunch father's more conventional path to status. Yet it's still about status for Moondoggie and not a lifestyle choice for its own sake, as it supposedly is with Kahuna.

What happens to Flyboy (the pet bird) sets up a weighty conversation between Kahuna and Gidget, which offers insights about Kahuna's past, including his time in the Korean War and how it affected him. Perhaps he was working out a case of PTSD. Five years of dropping out of mainstream life and living on the beach was what he needed to get it out of his system and, by the end of the movie, he seems back for the attack. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple computers, had a chapter in his life of living on the street and doing drugs, asking the big questions, etc. He now says it was an instrumental part of his life.

Even the whole Kahuna almost having sex with the under-aged Gidget was ballsy for 1959. Kahuna genuinely didn’t intend to, and actually wanted to teach Gidge a lesson, but he wasn’t above doing it since he was a little drunk and she was sorta insisting. Shortly later, Moondoggie reprimands Kahuna for it.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in Leo Carrillo State Beach, Malibu, California. WRITERS: Frederick Kohner (novel) and Gabrielle Upton (screenplay).

What ensues now is a series of entertaining and perilous adventures that allow each character to take centre stage. Mifune is very much in his element as the loyal, chivalrous - and pretty lethal - general; the Princess is no shrinking violet either and along the way we are entertained to an engaging assessment of the venality, mendacity and couragousness of war - it brings out the best and the worst in everyone.

The scenario reminded me a little of an episode of ""Columbo"" - a rather sterile, studio-set environment that came across as quite limiting. Once it gets going, though, it's one of the best crime thrillers I've seen in ages. It all centres around the kidnapping of a small boy for whom the anger-prone, shoe millionaire ""Gondo"" (a strong contribution from Toshirô Mifune) is supposed to pay a ransom of ¥30 million - a colossal sum. It turns out, though, that it's not his son who has been snatched - it's the child of his chauffeur. Why ought he to pay? Will he just get on with his impending company takeover or will he risk bankruptcy for the young ""Shinichi""? This is a film split into three sections. The first deals with the decision making process around will he/won't he/why should he. Next, the police must try to apprehend this individual. This process is meticulously carried out and Kurosawa has chosen to immerse us in some of that detail, rather than just cursorily skip through it. This makes the whole detection process a much more interesting part of the film; allowing some aspects of the characterisation of the police officers to develop and also introducing some dark humour to the proceedings. Finally, we reach the denouement with it's own rather curious and not entirely explicable agenda. There's an element of ""what would you do?"", there's a grim depiction of a seamier side of Japanese (heroin-fuelled) culture that we seldom get to see and there is a rather starkly effective dose of humanity presented here as the story juggles aspects of human nature, nurture and good old fashioned greed in quite an effective fashion. It's based on an Ed McBain book (which I haven't read) but the entire project has been successfully subsumed into it's guest culture for a gripping and detailed mystery that flies by. || A well worked, high stake crime thriller. The stakes are deeply personal to our main characters and puts them in an impossible situation. The performances and direction are very solid, the story is engaging and ultimately, it's a simple yet enjoyable film.

Indeed, this fictional documentary written, directed, and starring Woody Allen differentiates between imitation and parody the same way Hitchcock differentiated between action and suspense.

For example, the protagonist's parents used to punish him by locking him in a dark closet. If that were it, the film would simply be copying an aspect of Ingmar Bergman's childhood; Allen's genius lies in adding that when Zelig's parents are really mad, they ""get into the closet with him.""

Zelig's targets go beyond the filmmaker's family, and include the press (“in those days, you'd do anything to sell papers. To get a story, you'd jazz it up, exaggerate, even maybe play with the truth a little bit. But here was a story. It was a natural. You just told the truth and it sold papers. It never happened before""), politicians (""He was selling the same piece of property to a lot of the same people, and... Matter of fact, a congressman from Delaware bought it twice""), psychologists (“I worked with Freud in Vienna. Yes, we broke over the concept of penis envy. Freud felt that it should be limited to women”), and philosophers (“His performance endears him as well to many leading French intellectuals, who see in him a symbol for everything” ).

Set in the 1920s and 1930s, the film revolves around Leonard Zelig (Allen), an indistinct man who has the ability to alter his appearance and behavior to fit those of the people around him; e.g., “When two Frenchmen enter, Zelig assumes their characteristics and speaks reasonable French. In the company of a Chinese person, he begins to develop oriental traits;” etc etc.

This desire and ability to blend in ironically makes him an outcast; “Zelig's very existence is a non-existence. Devoid of personality, his human qualities long since lost in the confusion of life, he sits alone, silently staring into space, a figure, a non-person... The one who only wanted to fit in, to belong, to go unnoticed by his enemies and being loved, neither fits nor belongs, is supervised by enemies, and remains abandoned”. His protean nature also gives him access to a number of famous people and historical events. In this sense, Zelig is ahead of Forrest Gump, not only in that it precedes it, but also in that it surpasses it.

Zelig is disruptive in more ways than one; while Forrest finally fades into the background as a new, Zelig anarchically places his protagonist, much to his own dismay, front and center of the action; in the Vatican he creates commotion by interrupting a ritual that had not been celebrated in “63 years” (while “His Holiness Pope Pius XI tries to swat the intruder with a sacred decree”), and in Germany the greatest irony of all: his ""desired immersion in the mass and anonymity"" lead the Jew Zelig to join the Sturmabteilung — the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party — ruining Hitler’s speech at a Nazi rally (""We couldn't believe our eyes. Hitler's speech was ruined. He wanted to make a good joke about Poland, but just then, Zelig interfered and Hitler was extremely upset""). || I suppose nowadays we would call this a “mockumentary” about a chap who can be all things to all men except, perhaps, himself. It’s told using interviews, news reports and other actuality to regale us with the life and times of this man who somehow managed to infiltrate just about every scenario, strata of society and political grouping whilst altering his appearance to attain a consistent prominence even though his reasons for being where he was/is/would be were never quite clear to observers. Finally identified, he attracts the attention of psychiatrist “Dr. Fletcher” (Mia Farrow) who attempts to discover a little more about what drove this man. Is he an attention seeker or exactly the opposite? Does he need to stand out or simply want to conform? Either way, what he actually wanted had little to do with what he got as the publicity took his life by the scruff of the neck and embroiled him in a series of legal, ethical and practical issues. I wasn’t really bothered about the rather far-fetchedness of the plot nor of his fairly predictably evolving relationship with his shrink, but as a critique on documentary making and archive research, it’s an effective tool that also pays homage to the style of the silent film whilst showcasing the fickleness of public opinion and loyalty as well as demonstrating the hypocrisy of the media. It’s a bit long and once the direction of travel has been established then I found my interest was way more it’s delivery than it’s content. Worth a watch, though."

The Last House on the Left).

The inside of the house, which appears to have been designed by serial killer H.H.

From the outset, it's clear that there are issues facing these relatives - they want to be the ideal, loving family but ""Karin"" has just returned from a psychiatric hospital and her younger brother has issues feeling valued and dealing with the opposite sex.

In mid-19th century Sweden the magician Albert Emanuel Vogler (Max van Sydow) goes from town to town promising people cures for their ailments and performing magic tricks, including what was the sensation of the time, hypnosis. He is joined by his tout (Aake Fridell), his ""ward"" Mr. Aman (Ingrid Thulin) and his ""grandmother"" and the troupe's maker of patent medicine (Naima Wifstrand). After fleeing the law after a performance in one town, they pass through the forest and enter another community. Here they are detained by the authorities, so that the physician Vergerus (Gunnar Bjornstrand), the consul Egerman (Erland Josephson) can decide a wager on whether Vogler's tricks are real spiritual powers or scientifically explainable illusions.

While <i>Ansiktet</i> should not be overlooked for fans of Bergman, I think it is fair that the film is not ranked among Bergman's greatest achievements. Characterization is pretty slim – we get no idea of why Vogler and his companion chose this life, and Vergerus is so shallow that Gunnar Bjornstrand seems wasted. And had the film ended three minutes earlier it would have been one of Bergman's more powerful conclusions, but instead we get a completely unexpected happy ending that just seems lame. Much of the middle part of the film depends on sex jokes that are funny at times, but I suspect anyone who knows Bergman's great output will continuously be thinking that he's capable of so much more than this.

Still, <i>Ansiktet</i> does have a generally thought-provoking dramatic arc, and some moments will prove memorable. I especially admired the battle between Vergerus and Vogler and the magician's breakdown (funny how his temperment appropriately changes with his clothes in this scene). || I thought there was something of the slightly menacing John Carradine in Max Von Sydow's performance here, as the eponymous purveyor of bafflement. His troupe arrive in a forewarned small Swedish town that is full of scepticism about the wares and skills of the ""Vogler"" enterprise. MVS is the master magician, with his wife ""Wanda"" (Ingrid Thuler), his anti-wart tonic mixing aunt/grandmother (the scene-stealing Naira Wifstrand) and the enigmatic ""Tubal"" (Åke Fridell) all pulling their weight in this family business. The local police commissioner (Toivo Paulo) is deeply suspicious and demands that before they try out their ""gifts"" on the more gullible wider population, they demonstrate to a triumvirate of himself, local bigwig ""Egerman"" (Erland Jospehson) and the downright hostile health minister ""Vergerus"" (Gunnar Björnstrand). Now try as they might, these detractors just cannot disprove what they are seeing. Can this be real or is the ""Vogler"" science just too clever for them? What now ensues sees a sophisticated and frequently quite amusing series of battles of wits emerge. Not just between the accusers and the visitors, but soon we see a fracturing dynamic amongst the family itself as cracks begin to emerge and eyes (and hands) start to wander. It's the clever denouement that still holds up well and allows this enjoyably under-scripted poke at science and horror to conclude in an almost workmanlike manner. As ever with Bergman, it's also about the photography - and some of the intensity here, especially around the frequently rather sexually ambiguous wife, focusses on the eyes. Always the eyes. That really works well to build and sustain the growing hint of mystery and intrigue. Even we are not entirely sure what's going on and surely we would be wise to what must be their fraud?

His friend, who was tied up in the diner rushes to warn him, but he does nothing - he invites the fate that we see, right from the beginning of the film. Why though? Why didn't he run? It transpires that he had a modest life insurance policy and so investigator ""Reardon"" (Edmond O'Brien) tries to track down the beneficiary and piece together a story of robbery, betrayal and duplicity - to all of which the character of ""Kitty"" (Ava Gardner) proves central. This is a superior film noir, with Lancaster and O'Brien on great form as the flashbacks gradually fill in the gaps and with the help of ""Lt. Lubinsky"" (Sam Levene) they discovers what truly happened. Ava Gardner's character features quite sparingly, but potently when she is on screen - manipulating and twisting as she manoeuvres the men around her with consummate skill. The pace is measured, the story takes it's time to develop and that helps make this quite a compelling drama that puts a little more meat on the bones of the original Hemingway short story. The photography is intense, using the light and shade dramatically, and the score from the maestro Miklós Rósza adds a richness to the gritty look of the film too. Burt Lancaster's first major screen role, but it's O'Brien who does most of the heavy lifting here, and he does it well! || Robert Siodmak’s _The Killers_ intrigues more than it excites. Each scene is steeped in a rich atmosphere, with tension simmering under the surface. Siodmak’s non-linear storytelling leads you through a maze of betrayal and mystery, making it a slow-burn puzzle rather than a thrill ride.

Released in 1964 and directed by John Huston based on Tennessee Williams' play, ""The Night of the Iguana"" stars Richard Burton as a defrocked Episcopal minister who resorts to a job leading bus tours on the Mexican west coast. As he guides a group of middle-aged Baptist women to Puerto Vallarta, he struggles with the attentions of a teen sexpot (Sue Lyon) and the antagonism of her curmudgeonly ward (Grayson Hall). The group ends up at a bed & breakfast where the effervescent proprietor (Ava Gardner) and a spiritual artist (Deborah Kerr) aid the ex-clergyman in coming to terms with the failures haunting him. Skip Ward plays the hunky bus tour assistant.

As much as I appreciate this drama, it's too bad it was shot in B&W as color would've really enhanced it, particularly considering the resort setting. (I'll never understand why filmmakers insist on shooting in B&W when color is readily available). The movie is also marred by some contrived melodrama with Burton guilty of chewing too much scenery. At the same time, it's interesting to go back in time with these old dramas and observe the artificialities of the (over)acting based on the contrivances of an inflexible script.

Despite my criticisms, there's a lot to savor here. The rich (and sometimes synthetic) dialogue is full of gems to mine. The film is an honest rumination on the human condition. The theme is to cease struggling and to ride out the hardships of life, whether they're the result of one's own folly or otherwise. The answer will come; just be on the look-out for the ""messenger"" or ""assistant"" and, of course, accept.

On other fronts, Sue Lyon is outstanding as the Lolita, probably because she literally played Lolita in her previous film, 1962's ""Lolita."" Thankfully, she's more womanly here. She was 17 during filming and thoroughly sumptuous, particularly in her short shorts. Gardner also looked great at 41, but her character is too boozy and it's a turn-off. She's well contrasted by the almost saintly Kerr.

Interestingly, there's a brief denouncement of lesbianism, which wouldn't work today. In our current upside down culture it would be hailed as the highest good, worthy of a call from the President (rolling my eyes).

Without an understanding of what's happening on the screen, the initial story developments fail to make an emotional connection. What the viewer is left with is an appreciation for the darkly fantastical world and the technical prowess it would have required by the film crew to create. (Some of us will also appreciate the protagonist's beauty.) || What a difficult thing it is to review this movie. First the movie most people have seen is not the movie Clive Barker created, as the studio did the final cut without Barker's approval or even contacting him at all. So the studio (and the infamous test audience, people with no intelligence and movie or art knowledge) released what they thought ot be a summer monster movie ...
The Director's cut released way later is closer to what Barker wanted, but with time, some tapes had disappeared, and Barker had moved on, so what the prognal movie should have been is a mystery.
So we have Boone, a guy plagued with nightmares of monsters living in a strange city, living with his girlfriend Lori that is a singer in a bar. He wants to live a normal life and has hopes his psychiatrist will help him. To make things short, the psychiatrist is interested in the monsters and Boone gets killed but is reborn as a monster. Then ""humans"" to eradicate them.
I never go in the subtext of the movies as I look for entertainment in watching movies. So of course here its obvious that the theme is human instinct is to fear and kill what's different, either other humans or animals. But if you see only the in this movie, you'll lose 2 hours and won't like it as the monsters and Boone will just seem stupid to explore this theme.
I prefer to think most Directors / writers will write a story based on the world they live in and the knowledge they have of it and the memories they have of history, what happeded to them and their close ones. Here Barker is much more interested in creating a world and legend of monsters than really showing humanity's weaknesses. And he does it brillantly. His monster society and history is deep, the craftsmanship of the costumes is insane, and even Dekker (played by David Cronenberg) is a good character, even the priest os a good character, even Lori is a good character, and that makes a good and enjoyable movie. I even enjoyed the ""theatrical cut"" as at the time we didn't know it was an awkward stodio cut."

Can we reasonably assume that everyone already knows how Market Garden turned out, or are we doing the Millennial thing where we are assuming people don't know where Arnhem is, let alone Antwerp, let alone Holland, let alone who participated in WWII?

The Nazis were part of that one right?

Anyway, this movie has everyone in it, just about everyone that was anyone in 1977 and, from all appearances all of Hollywood was tied up in the making of this film right down to A-list actors in minor roles.

So you kind of know that the acting is there and top notch... and so is the direction.

At least the direction is about as good as you can assume for something that attempts to tell a little too much of the story all at once.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie, and when they use the word ""Epic"" they are talking about epic in scope, and for that scope it does a pretty awesome and very coherent job.

My one issue is the scope, Market Garden was enormous, it was an enormous failure, it was an enormous catastrophy, it was an enormous event, it was an enormous air invasion and this movie attempts to tell all of it at once. The result is that it's spread a little thin Had they made the movie 6 hours long, they might have been able to pull it off flawlessly... but who is going to sit through that?

But no one can really argue with the results. It's not as bad as it could be, and it is a lot better than a movie this epic in scope should be. They achieved something brilliant.

My only wish was that, after the epic failure, they gave Montgomery's infamous ""Operation Market Garden was 90% successful"" the last words and left it there, left it as a mess with a general trying to save face. || Usually when you read the term ""stellar"" applied to a cast, it's more for marketing purposes to convince us that the cast is better than we might want to think - well not so, here. Connery, Caine, O'Neal, Olivier, Bogarde, Hackman, Hopkins, Caan, Schell & Liv Ullmann all chip into this true telling of ""Operation Market Garden"" - a co-ordinated attempt by the allies to use almost anything that will fly to parachute troops behind Nazi lines. Their purpose: to secure strategically important river crossings before the enemy have a chance to blow them to smithereens. Their missions are fraught with dangers - bad intelligence, bad weather as well as a tenacious and well established enemy. The planning and actions scenes give a clear dramatic indication of just how logistically complex and risky this whole procedure actually would have been; and as war films go it is much less gung-ho. It is, however, very long - and a bit more judicious editing would have helped keep it more taut. || **_Star-studded cinematic account of Operation Market Garden_**

In September, 1944, the Allies unleash an ambitious operation to secure key bridges in the Netherlands, which would facilitate a quick advance into Germany and have the boys home by Christmas. Unfortunately, the Germans’ defensive capabilities and willpower are stronger than expected.

“A Bridge Too Far” (1977) covers the largest airborne operation in history up to that point with a great cast and several memorable sequences involving actors like Anthony Hopkins, James Caan, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Sean Connery and so on. It’s a straight war film in the manner of “The Longest Day” that refuses to get artsy, like, say, “Apocalypse Now.”

The flick effectively illustrates how plans can look great in the comfort of a war room but, in the field, Murphy’s Law often comes into play.

Whilst the chief goal of seizing the Arnhem Bridge failed, there were several successes, such as the capture of Eindhoven and Nijmegen, and the creation of a 65-miles foothold in Holland for future offensives, not to mention tying-up thousands of German troops. The boys wouldn’t be home for Christmas; it would take another four long months of strategizing and fighting.

Speaking of which, the similar “The Bridge at Remagen” from eight years prior covers the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge on the Rhine in west-central Germany in March, 1945.  

It runs 2 hours, 56 minutes, and was shot in England and the Netherlands.

A prisoner in Huntsville (McQueen) is released early due to his wife (MacGraw) making a deal with a corrupt official (Ben Johnson). The cost of his freedom is to head a bank heist in San Marcos with the officer’s questionable henchmen (Al Lettieri and Bo Hopkins). O, what a tangled web we weave.

“The Getaway” (1972) is a crime thriller written by Walter Hill based on Jim Thompson’s book and was director Sam Peckinpah’s second most successful film at the box office, after “Convoy” six years later. It was remade in 1994 with Alec Baldwin and influenced soon-to-come movies like “The Outfit,” ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry,"" ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" and “The Gauntlet,” as well as later ones like “No Country for Old Men.”

If you like those flicks, you’ll appreciate this one, although it ranks with the least of ’em IMHO. Why? Because the bank job is unnecessarily convoluted, not to mention expensive, with the myriad pre-caper photographs, a cliched last-minute briefing session in a basement, severing electrical cables in the sewer tunnels and even diversionary explosions. Why Sure! Then there’s the curious train station sequence with a convenient con man that’s inserted into the midsection, which I admit is entertaining in a Hitchcockian way.

Lastly, despite some amusing bits, the proceedings are shrouded by a pessimistic and ugly perspective. I get that the protagonists are antiheroes, but the film needed more glimmerings of nobility and love, and less murderous venality. “Pulp Fiction” is a good example.

Ali looks good on the feminine front and is, thankfully, way less annoying than her character in “Love Story.” Blonde Sally Struthers eventually appears and never looked better at 23 during shooting, but her character is a ditzy turnoff.

McQueen would marry costar MacGraw seven months after the movie’s release, but their marriage would only last five years.

It runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot entirely in Texas at Huntsville (prison), San Marcos (bank robbery), San Antonio (train station), Fabens (city street confrontation) and El Paso (Laughlin Hotel).

Oslin","Peter Bogdanovich, Carol Heikkinen",country music,"_**River Phoenix shines before passing on, plus the lovely Samantha Mathis**_

Several 20-somethings try to make it in the country music business in Nashville: Miranda Presley (Samantha Mathis), fresh from New York City; Connecticut cowboy Kyle (Dermot Mulroney); ditzy but genuine Southern belle Linda Lue (Sandra Bullock); and the bursting-with-creative-energy-and-confidence James Wright (River Phoenix).

""The Thing Called Love"" (1993) failed miserably at the box office but it's a pretty solid drama revolving around the music biz in Nashville. 

The film isn't redneck-y at all (not that there's anything wrong with that, lol); the people are genuine and likable, if sometimes annoying. The movie has a hip flair and is filled with newer country music (for 1993, that is). Aside from trying to make it in the music business the story naturally revolves around Kyle and James' attraction to Miranda and their ensuing rivalry.

The film never cops a meanspirited vibe, despite one brawl. The viewer gets the impression that these are good, talented people who will remain friends no matter what.

A couple of things make the film worthwhile, for me anyway. One is the magnetic performance of River Phoenix, who was 22 during filming. His face looks like Quorthon of Bathory (when he was in his 20s), if you're familiar with that obscure metal band.

He exudes the brooding charisma of Marlon Brando, just different. Unfortunately, three and a half months after the movie's release River was found dead outside an L.A. nightclub due to an overdose. He was only 23. Samantha Mathis (Miranda) was dating him at the time. 

Speaking of whom, Samantha is the second key highlight of this flick wherein she even outshines Sandra Bullock. Keep in mind that this was the year _before_ Bullock's breakout with ""Speed."" Samantha's beauty is captured well in a couple scenes, like around the 40-minute mark when Linda Lue's beau is passed out on the bed. It's too bad Samantha never broke-out, like Sandra. Her most popular flick is arguably ""Broken Arrow"" (1996) and then she pretty much disappeared from feature films.

A few country stars have cameos, like Trisha Yearwood and Pam Tillis.

""The Thing Called Love"" may not be a great country music film like ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" (1980) but it's pretty solid and highlighted by the brooding charisma of River Phoenix. He was great and it's a pity he died so prematurely.

The film runs 1 hour, 56 minutes, with the the Director's Cut running a couple minutes longer. It and was mostly shot in Nashville, with one scene done at Graceland in Memphis and another one in Santa Clarita, California (the bus stop / cafe sequence where Miranda writes a song).

William Wyler crafts a delightfully frothy caper backed up by wonderful on screen chemistry between Peter O'Toole & Audrey Hepburn. It seems to me that Hepburn always managed to bond with her Male co-stars, and here the interplay between O'Toole and herself is wonderful. Check out a long sequence of events involving the pair hiding out in a closet, it's gold dusted cinema. 

The film's central plot involves Hepburn & O'Toole planning a daring robbery from a Paris museum to keep her art forger Father (a delightful Hugh Griffith) out of trouble, at first the couple are purely business partners with no love lost for each other, but as the story plays out the pair are forced to get along and etc. 

The burglary itself is dramatic, attention grabbing entertainment, and it's also the film's highest point, but overall the film as a whole is simply good romantic fun. Also helps that it features a very tidy shift for the finale to further reward the audience for their time spent with the movie. Throw in dapper turns from Charles Boyer & Eli Wallach too, and it's all good really.

Unfairly forgotten and left in the slipstream of critical darlings Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill can proudly fly its own worthwhile flag. There's nothing preachy or political here, director John Irvin and writer James Carabatsos approach the subject with a refreshing humane honesty, making us viewers privy to the American soldiers mindset as they cope with life in Vietnam before an assault on some turd pile strategic hill, a battle that the survivors of that particular bloody conflict would call Hamburger Hill.

No matter what one feels about the war, the politics of such etc, the fact that quite often Vietnam films zoom in on the misdemeanours and egotistical sides of the American presence in Vietnam, tends to detract from the bravery of men and boys who were doing the job their government decreed they should do. Hamburger Hill addresses this, proudly so. Pace is deliberate and literate, building up to the assault on Hill 937, with little slices of kinetic action inserted along the way to tantalise and torment in equal measure.

Not all the acting is smart, there's a cast of up and coming thesps on show that features some who have gone on to be ""name"" actors, while others that were out of their depth subsequently found a level more befitting their abilities. Yet this is also a cunning tactic in the film's favour, no stars needed here, young adult actors without baggage or headlines kind of feels appropriate for this portrayal of soldiers in an alien world, many of whom would lay their shattered bodies down in the mud at Hamburger Hill. 8/10 || Courtney B. Vance was kind of all over the place in this wasn't he? One moment he's an over-the-top make everything political racist, and the next moment he actually cares about everyone... and then it's back to nothing but race... and then he cares about people. He really needed to pick a direction and roll with it, because he came across as going too places at once.

But otherwise this is the forgotten cousin of Platoon. It's not exactly as good as Platoon, but it is more solid start-to-finish than Full Metal Jacket was.

The strength really comes from an attempt to depict the events without really making anything heroic, or action-hero dramatic. And, instead, they do their best to make it just a straight war movie. No great odyssey, no moral point, no real views on Vietnam as opposed to other wars. Just a straight war movie and nothing.

It's not unlike Saving Private Ryan, in which the film is able to make both a pro-soldier statement while also being anti-war. It's a fine line to walk, but they do it with the skill needed to both show absolute brutality, and the humanity of soldiers that are put in that horrible situation."

This is one tough movie, it pulls no punches and the only surprise is that it was made in 1932, that the film is a grizzled masterpiece is down to the astute direction of Mervyn LeRoy and a quite brilliant performance from Paul Muni in the lead role of James Allen. Based on the real life writings of Robert Elliot Burns, the film is a harsh kick in the guts about the brutal penal system that existed when most of us were mere glints in our Father's eyes. It is part of a Warner Brothers controversial classic's box set that is available on Region 1, and its place on any controversial classic list is worthy.

The film had major impact on reviews of the penal system, it caused uproar in Georgia (the film never mentions Georgia, but they knew it was about them), law suits followed and Robert Elliot Burns himself was constantly pursued by the authorities despite the state being privy to the actual facts of his case. I wont be boorish with the details as it is well documented across the net and those who haven't seen the film really need to address that issue.

Time makes no sense in a basement. It's a totally different world down there and, with HBO and that whole latchkey thing, you could be down there into the early hours of the morning watching wonderful trash.

And this is really wonderful trash.

I mean, it IS a Roger Corman film, and those are known for being cheap B-movie fair of the most entertaining quality. Far better than Troma trash that never really seems to have actual talent.

But, this, well, it was 1990 and it had John Hurt, Raul Julia, Bridget Fonda, and Jason Patrick in it and that already felt like it was seriously pushing the boundaries of what qualifies as a Corman movie. Those are names anyone would be thrilled to cast.

And it looked good, OK, it looked a little 90s B, but there are certainly a lot of movies that look worse than this.

It was Frankenstein cast as kind of science-fiction more than horror, black holes and all, and that alone, is intriguing. I mean, when it was written it kind of walked that line and Frankenstein Unbound does a decent job of walking that line as well.

It's part traditional Frankenstein and part alternate reality post apocalyptic Frankenstein with a wild enough plot to keep the viewer entertained no matter how absurd it feels to write that, let alone read it.

It was 1990, honestly it SHOULD have received more of a showing than simply catching it on HBO late one Saturday when USA's Up All Night was showing something absolutely pathetic. It should have been a little more prime time, it is certainly good enough to carry that weight. || **_Corman returns after 2 decades with a Frankenstein flick_**

A scientist in 2031 (John Hurt) inadvertently enters through a rift in the fabric of time & space, ending up in 1817 Switzerland wherein he meets Dr. Frankenstein (Raul Julia), his creature, Mary Godwin/Shelley (Bridget Fonda) and Lord Byron (Jason Patric). The murderous monster struggles between vengeance and acquiring a fitting mate.

Based on Brian Aldiss’ 1973 novel, ""Frankenstein Unbound"" (1990) was Roger Corman’s return to directing after almost twenty years. For those not in the know, Corman was the king of Indie cult movies from 1955-1971, most famous for his Poe-inspired flicks starring Vincent Price.

While Corman had way more money to work with than back in the ’60s ($11.5 million to be exact), it still wasn’t a blockbuster budget à la “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein” (1994). It’s interesting if you’re a devotee of Shelley’s book and entertaining if you’re in the mood for old-fashioned Gothic horror on a modest budget, but it lacks the magic of, say, “The Pit and the Pendulum” and “The Raven.”

Nevertheless, if you’re a fan of “The Terror,” “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Tomb of Ligeia” and AIP or Hammer films in general, not to mention “The Bride of Frankenstein,” it delivers the goods. Classy Bridget Fonda is a plus on the feminine front while Catherine Rabett is worth a mention. Meanwhile the cheesy monster makeup works and Raul Julia is charismatic as Victor Frankenstein. I shouldn't fail to add that the 1988 ItalDesign Aztek car brings to mind “Back to the Future” and Knight Rider.

It totally bombed at the box office, but it has cult appeal, which is to be expected with Corman at the helm. It was his final directorial effort.

The film is short-n-sweet at 1 hour, 25 minutes, and was shot in the region of Lombardia in north-central Italy. You can’t beat the locations.

Produced by Dore Schary out of MGM, Bad Day at Black Rock is directed by John Sturges and stars Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan, Anne Francis, Dean Jagger, Walter Brennan, John Ericson, Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin. It's adapted by Don McGuire and Millard Kaufman from the story ""Bad Day at Hondo"" written by Howard Breslin. It's shot on location in CinemaScope and Eastman Color at Lone Pine, Death Valley & Alabama Hills in California, with William C. Mellor on photography and André Previn scoring the music.

A classy production that combines elements of Westerns and film noir, Bad Day at Black Rock deals with racism and all the hate and bully tactics that come with such a vile subject. It tells the story of a mysterious one armed stranger, John J. Macreedy (Tracy), who arrives at a tiny isolated town in a desert of the Southwest United States in search of a Japanese-American man. From the moment he arrives he is met with hostility and mistrust. Over the course of the day Macreedy picks apart the town to uncover the secret that the towns folk had hoped had gone away forever.

From the opening sequence of a bright red train rushing towards us, it's evident that we are in the modern day West. It's just after World War II and the horse trails of the old West are now frequented by jeeps and cars. Yet the hallmarks of the old West exists and thrives because of the inhabitants of Black Rock. An ignorant group of people consisting of bullies, drunks and the head in the sand weak willed type. Yet even though the film is set mostly in the blazing sun, in a barren one horse Western town that time forgot, the film exudes a film noir sensibility. Dark secrets from the past weigh heavy on the shoulders of the towns' big players - and Tracy's High Noon like situation is moodily paced by the wily Sturges. In fact, that a film with so little ""gun play"" action can be so tense is actually no mean feat, with him yet again directing an ensemble cast to great effect.

Tracy is at his best when he is as he is here, playing subdued. Here he is a thinking man's protagonist, calm and reflective in the face of constant hostility. That he is facing an impressive line up of heavies really brings home just how thoughtful a performance Tracy gives in the piece. Robert Ryan does yet another fine turn as a complicated villain whose rage is bubbling away under the surface. Borgnine and Marvin are memorably vile as his right hand thugs, Dean Jagger as the drunken cowardly sheriff manages to pang the heart and Walter Brennan is his usual solid scene influencing self. Anne Francis adds the glamour but really - and sadly - it's a nondescript role that the film could easily have survived without.

Clocking in at just 81 minutes the film never outstays its welcome. It looks great on home format issue, and for those interested in commentary tracks, this one comes with a very good one from Dana Polan. Anyone who has not seen this film should try and seek it out. It was considered controversial back on release but now can be viewed as a smart message movie about racial tolerance. Tight, taut and expertly directed and acted, Bad Day At Black Rock is an important film from the 50s that still rings the bells loudly even today. 8/10"

Friedrich Murnau really did pull out all of the stops for this gorgeously complex and beautiful story - that is entirely based on human character flaws that ordinarily might make one squirm... None of the characters actually have names, but George O'Brien is contentedly married to Janet Gaynor, living on their farm with their young child. One day, he happens upon the visiting Margaret Livingstone - an urban sophisticate with whom he is soon captivated. Conscious of his duty to his wife, he is reluctant to join her in the big city, so she rather malevolently suggests that he and his wife fake a boating accident in which she drowns and he survives... Disgracefully, he agrees and so the couple set out on their trip, but when he tries to push her overboard he bottles it and she flees in terror into the city where he finally catches up with her, and craves her forgiveness. Luckily for him, she agrees and the couple spend a charming day together experiencing all the luxuries the metropolis can offer before being caught in the mother of all storms as they head home at the end of their day. Try as he might, though, he cannot put the memory of the other woman behind him, and his thoughts take a much darker turn... The story is basically a tale of good vs. evil, temptation and sin - and not always presented in any clear cut scenario. Despite being a thoroughly odious and selfish man, I didn't hate O'Brien's character - weak and fickle is it was; and the temptress Livingstone isn't hateful either - it's all about human nature and what makes us tick - warts and all. The photography is super - especially in the salon where they are both pampered and seduced, and the storm sequence at the end is also very effective. By 1927, silent films had learned the art of condensing their stories - and this is done really well here, too. The film has a pace that doesn't linger long, and is really a joy to watch."

The Wasp Woman is directed by Jack Hill and Roger Corman and written by Leo Gordon and Kinta Zertuche. A Roger Corman production, it stars Susan Cabot, Anthony Eisley, Michael Mark and Barboura Morris. Music is by Fred Katz and photography by Harry Neumann.

Janice Starlin (Cabot) is the owner of a large cosmetics company, once a successful operation, the company is starting to lose customers who can see that Starlin is beginning to show her aged years. But hope may be at hand form scientist Eric Zinthrop (Mark), who has been experimenting with the royal jelly from a queen wasp, creating a serum that reverses the aging process. She strikes a deal with Zinthrop to fund his research as long as she can be his first human subject...

Schlockmeister Corman obviously took notice of the success of Kurt Neumann's The Fly from the previous year, for here he tries to bring us the female variant on the sci-fi mix up movie for half the budget. It marks the last time that Susan Cabot would appear in film, this also being the last of six films she made with Corman. For a low budget schlocker it's not half bad, the berserker insect/human science is good fun and there's potent thematics within involving the search for eternal youth, drug addiction and the cautionary warning about man pushing science too far. Even the effects, whilst cheap and rightly kept in the shadows for the most part, have an antiquated charm about them. If only the film wasn't so static, so ordinary, for two thirds of its relatively short running time, then this would be talked about as one of Corman's better offerings, especially since the cast are actually fine, particularly the pretty and stoic Cabot.

Most of the film is played out from the offices of a high-rise office complex, this is unusual but gives the film a little uniqueness, with Neumann and his directors managing to set the ambiance at uneasy. But it's mostly talky stuff, meaning mood is built up to the point that when the picture does shift into creature feature gear-budget restrictions mean expectations can't possibly be met; even if what little horror is in the picture is actually pretty spicy: though the makers do miss a trick because it's explained to us early in the piece that the Queen Wasp eats her mate! But Janice has no love interest here, shame that! Fred Katz's music is deliciously mad, at times sounding like Wacky Races on LSD, at others some gentle jazz beat fusion, it's in the right movie, just not used at the right times! The accompanying buzzing sound affect for a Wasp Woman attack, though, is most agreeable. Corman would use the score again for Little Shop of Horrors the following year.

Nobody, you would like to think, would be viewing The Wasp Woman expecting a sci-fi classic, but it's a frustrating watch in many ways, even to the fans of cheapo B movie schlockers. 5/10 || The SFX are so bad it goes beyond charming but they’re only present for like 5 minutes so it doesn’t matter. The rest of the film is actually pretty good or at least was better than I was expecting. Has an ace plot, though similar to The Fly admittedly, but not so similar it copies. My first Corman 2.5/5"

Eventually, he prevails but is what emerges from the surgery really sustainable? This is one of those stories where the underlying morals seeking conformity and acceptance are merged with the promise of largely unfettered scientific advances that pay scant regard to any broader or future ramifications of their progress. It's a bit of a slow start, but an effective chemistry gradually develops between ""Charly"" and his doctor as the ethics start to kick in and we all begin to wonder if (or not) this engaging character is on the right path.

It's directed by Vincente Minnelli, cinematography is by Freddie Young and Russel Harlan and music is scored by Miklos Roza. 

This shines bright as a beacon in how Hollywood used to make a biopic the right way. Not a big commercial success as such, it has however gained critical praise the older it gets. Technically it's hard to fault, the colour lenses in CinemaScope, Roza's beautiful mood accompaniment score, and the direction and acting - with Douglas inhabiting Van Gogh and likewise Quinn for Paul Gauguin (Oscar Winner Best Supporting Actor) - bring this tragic story vividly to life.

Rush is directed by Lili Fini Zanuck and adapted to screenplay by Peter Dexter from the Kim Wozencraft novel. It stars Jason Patric, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Sam Elliott, Max Perlich and Gregg Allman. Music is by Eric Clapton and cinematography by Kenneth MacMillan.

Two undercover narcotic cops get on a downward spiral that they may not return from...

Set and filmed in Texas, Rush is a hot, sweaty and claustrophobic neo- noir. It maybe doesn't have the classic visual tics of yesteryear, but it has photographic style to burn - with Clapton's score suitably melancholic, which in turn is something that sits perfectly with the perpetual sense of doom that pervades the pic. Corruption and addiction lead the way, all while love tries its hardest to break on through to the other side, but we are on a bus to noirville, and noirville is an unforgiving place...

Patric and Leigh are damn fine actors if given the right material to work with, and they carry this with aplomb. Sadly, Allman is a weak villain, maybe because he looks like a Rick Wakeman clone?! While under using Sam Elliott is just a plain waste. However, this deserves its place on neo-noir lists. It is deliberate in pacing, therefore asking for you to buy into the thematics at work, to let them itch your skin, but to do so has rewards, for in true noir style it doesn't chicken out once the end credits have rolled. 7.5/10"

Captain Blood is directed by Michael Curtiz and adapted by Casey Robinson from the Rafael Sabatini novel. It stars Errol Flynn, Olivia de Haviland, Basil Rathbone, Ross Alexander and Lionel Atwill. Music is scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and photography is shared between Ernest Haller and Hal Mohr.

1685, England, and Dr. Peter Blood (Flynn) is unjustly convicted of treason against the King. Escaping the death penalty, Blood and the other supposed rebels are sold into slavery at the English colony of Port Royal. Bought by kindly Arabella Bishop (de Havilland), Blood settles down to work as physician to the local governor. But when the town comes under attack from the Spanish, Blood and his friends seize the opportunity to commandeer the Spanish ship and escape...

And Thus Captain Blood Began His Career Of Piracy. . . With A Ship, A Handful Of Men, And A Brain. . . 

It could all have been so different had Robert Donat not turned down the role of Captain Blood. In came Flynn at the last minute, a swaggering superstar was born and classic cinema got a handful of truly rousing swashbucklers that continue to delight millions even today. Not to mention it also brought further notice of de Havilland's ability, with this picture the first of eight she would make with Flynn. Even though it was seen of something of a gamble for Warner Brothers at the time, the film actually isn't that big in budgetary terms, all the remarkable, then, that Curtiz and his team have fashioned such an entertainingly rousing picture.

Although Flynn gleefully dominates proceedings, and in the process gives the film its only real flaw by rendering much of the other characters to being like awe-struck observers, much of the credit for Captain Blood's success is down to Robinson's screenplay. Running at just over two hours in length, film is chocked full of action, plot and asides to the British monarchy of the 17th century, deftly split into two halves by the wily Curtiz. First half establishes the major players and incidence, taking a good honest man in a hot political climate and forcing him to go rogue. This then fills the second part as Blood becomes the feared pirate of the high seas, and then ultimately his journey back to a life of normality and love flecked happiness. 

In amongst this journey to piracy and back, film is decked out with moments of spectacle. Be it Flynn swishing and swashing with blade, or swinging in on a rope, or the sight of cannons blasting away in tall ship duels, Curtiz ensures the pace is brisk and the adrenaline is often stirred. In the mix is the chemistry between Flynn and de Haviland, which obviously hits the ground running, and two deliciously shifty turns from Messrs Atwill and Rathbone. Stunts are aplenty and although the sets are at times at the bare minimum, Curtiz and his photographers get maximum impact by going for a near Expressionist style. All of which is scored with thunderous verve by master composer Korngold. 

Flynn would better this with both ""The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)"" and ""The Sea Hawk (1940)"", but Captain Blood is undeniably the influential template. 9/10"

Unfortunately I still don't like this film and I wasn't very impressed with it, to me it felt like it dragged on a bit and became boring, and I still hated the old woman.

On the face of it, the plot is really quite predictable, but that simplicity belies the real issues that many women faced when attempting to break free from their class-bound cycle of responsibilities of home and hearth, even in as late as the 1980s. The humour is frequent, dry and pithy with a fun, and quite telling contribution from Maureen Lipman as ""Trish"", the new flatmate who simply adores Mahler. The score could have been orchestrated a bit better - the synthesised sound is a bit amateur; and at times - like the original play - it drags a little, but that all serves to give us a little more of idea as to what makes both of them really tick - she is prepared to sacrifice much for her opportunity. Caine & Walters are superb, plausible and likeable in equal measure delivering a poignant story of salvation for both of them.

The acting is poised and characterful - especially the young ""Anju"" (Kyôko Kagawa) who tries to look out for her initially weak and vulnerable younger brother ""Zushio"" (Yoshiaki Hanayagi). It is beautifully scored with a mixture of Japanese and classical themes that compliment well the contrasting images of poverty, wealth, cruelty and kindness of this story of barbarity and revenge. The cinematography does benefit from a big screen - it makes the story and the imagery all the more impactful, but even on a television this is is two hours that truly keeps you gripped."

With the help of a suitably obsequious character of Thomas Cromwell (John Calicos), the internecine and fickle politics of Henry VIII's court is laid bare for us to watch. Perhaps Burton is a bit overly theatrical at times, but there is a smouldering chemistry between the two; the look of the film is great with superb location and costume detail too.

Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers and Marcia McBroom star as an all-girl rock band, who move to Los Angeles to make it in the music biz. The group is so well-received that they turn the head of eccentric rock producer Z-Man (John Lazar) who becomes their Svengali-style manager and changes their name to The Carrie Nations, all to the consternation of their small-time manager, who's a Greg Brady lookalike (David Gurian). Can the girls survive the pitfalls that come with the debauched rock lifestyle?

Directed by Russ Meyer and scripted by none other than Roger Ebert, ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" (1970) satirizes the previous melodrama from three years prior. The movie telegraphs right out of the gate that it's a joke and not to be taken seriously like the first film (at least, like they _TRIED_ to do with the first film). The cast is killer, highlighted by the three protagonists, especially the underrated Read. 

Also worthy of note besides the key players cited above are Michael Blodgett, who's character takes an interest in the singer (Read); Phyllis Davis as her hip aunt; Edy Williams as an oversexed porn star; Erica Gavin who takes a dubious interest in Myers' character; Duncan McLeod as the aunt's sleazy & greedy financial adviser; Charles Napier as her former-beau; Henry Rowland as Z-Man's employee who (I guess) likes to dress-up as a Nazi; and Harrison Page & James Iglehart who vie for the attentions of the foxy drummer (McBroom).

The best thing about ""Beyond"" is that it's the absolute apogee of the late 60s (being shot in '69) and everything that went with it — the overindulgence in drugs, ""free"" sex, libertine parties, go-go dancing, rock and general debauchedness. There are several noteworthy women, with cutie Read the arguable frontrunner. Also, some of the tunes the band plays are actually catchy. All these factors make for a fun, entertaining flick, which explains how it quickly became a cult film.

Yet its quality is brought down by needless nudity and tame sex scenes that strapped it with a NC-17 rating, thus limiting its general appeal and access to the masses, which could've been easily avoided by wisely trimming down a few scenes. There's also too much fruity twaddle for my tastes and the ""story"" seems to be just one ""wild party"" after another, which gets redundant.

Still, ""Beyond"" is the undeniable pinnacle of late 60's flicks, even though it can't be taken seriously for a moment, which is actually fitting.

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.

The original creators of the seminal Night of the Living Dead (1968) reconvene 22 years later to, well, make some money!

It was a compromised production, with director Tom Savini announcing that the finished cut is not half the film he set out to make. Surprising, then, to find it still works to the point of being viable. It's a very effective zombie pic, one performed with quality by the cast, with the concept of a group of people holed up in a house - under intense attack by the walking dead - still terrifying. It helps to cast Tony Todd in a reimaging of a horror classic, while Patricia Tallman is a fine spunky lead lady horror protag.

Group dynamics again explode, heroes and villains are born, and the creatures are high grade in scary construction. Caveat, though, is that although it's a faithul(ish) remake, where with the new tools to hand it's understandable why the makers thought they could create another horror classic, but one for the 90s horror hordes, it still remains that it's utterly bloodless. While the finale is a bit stinky... 6/10"

The Day of the Jackal is directed by Fred Zinnerman and adapted to screenplay by Kenneth Ross from the novel of the same name written by Frederick Forsyth. It stars Edward Fox, Michael Lonsdale, Terence Alexander, Michel Auclair, Alan Badel, Tony Britton and Denis Carey. Music is by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Jean Tournier.

As the French political climate reaches boiling point over the Algeria situation, underground organisation the OAS plot to have President Charles de Gaulle assassinated. When an attempt fails the OAS members not caught are exiled in Vienna and decide that bringing in an outsider to kill the President is now the best way forward. That outsider is an Englishman, code name The Jackal, a methodically cunning and deadly assassin.

Wonderful, the kind of character driven thriller that has become in short supply over the last couple of decades. It’s all so simple, even sedate, yet this calm approach serves the plotting perfectly. After the initial set ups we follow The Jackal (a super icy turn by Fox) on his mission to kill General de Gaul. His planning, the people he meets, and the people he has to kill to stay one step ahead of the authorities. From cons to weapon smuggling, to disguises and sexual encounters, it’s thoroughly compelling from Jackal’s story arc alone, but the frequent shifts to the hunt for him by a whole ream of suits and detectives is also gripping and suspenseful viewing.

Backing Fox up is a raft quality performers, a cast very much in tune with the material to hand. Delure’s musical composition is purposely of the minimalist breed, Tournier’s photography is period compliant and smooth, while Ralph Kemplen’s excellent editing was rightly nominated for an Academy Award. Zinnerman does sterling work from the director’s chair, amazingly keeping a two and half hour movie free of extraneous scenes or pointless exposition. Everything is relative, it really is a film to stay focussed with, to give it respect by giving it your undivided attention. So go the bathroom before sitting down to view this truly great and smart thriller. 9/10  || A sophisticated adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's thriller about an Englishman codenamed ""the Jackal"" (Edward Fox) who is hired to assassinate Charles de Gaulle, the President of France. His meticulous planning remains almost undiscovered until the redoubtable ""Inspecteur Lebel"" - played by the always under-rated Michael Lonsdale manages to piece together enough information to get on his tail. A workmanlike ensemble cast give extra weight to the lead performances in this intriguing and well put together Fred Zinnemann film. It's huge advantage as a story is it's simplicity - and here we get a drawn into the cat and mouse game unsure who will win right til the very end."

She's ill-equipped for the outside world nor for the affect her beauty will have on those men now around her. Needless to say, ardours are stirred and after a tragedy ensues that does not entirely disappoint her, she realises that a life serving the Lord cannot be undertaken within the confines of a convent anymore.

Unfortunately, she hadn't factored in the arrival of ""Jorge"" (Francisco Rabal) - the handsome and charismatic son of her uncle. Pretty soon she is facing a difficult conflict that will test every element of her faith and her humanity. On the face of it, this is just another romanic melodrama, but there is humour here and Luis Buñuel takes great care crafting an environment in which we can see the eponymous character develop from a shy and introspective woman to one far more aware of life's richnesses - for good or ill. It's also quite a poignant assessment of the role of religion in provincial life as well as providing us images of the stark contrast between rich and poor. Rey features sparingly but effectively and the chemistry between Pinal and Rabal is clear but not obvious - these actors are adding a little extra dimension to the development of the story. In 2024 it's comparatively tame, but in 1961 it must have been pretty provocative and is still well worth a watch."

Now a poorly written logline is unlikely to be the fault of the movie itself, but it does kind of make me question why the movie's even called _3 Women_. Decent chance I'm just not bright enough to understand it, let alone the movie itself for that matter, but I can only bring you a review from how I experienced it, and from that perspective I can say: It's alright. A lot of the style choices did aggravate me, most notably the music (I've suffered through much worse for far less with this subject, but it was still a negative to me). But the two lead performances are what the movie is predominantly hinged on, and both are pretty good. Not **incredible**, but pretty good. I know not adoring this puts me in the minority, but I feel like a lot of people nowadays tend to overvalue a film for no other reason than the fact that it was made before... like... 1987. That's never been a factor for me, and 3 Women honestly didn't do a lot for me.

I couldn't really enjoy this 1993 remake, knowing the so much better original from 1990. || New Dawn - New Day - New Life.

Point of No Return (AKA: The Assassin) is directed by John Badham and written by Robert Getchell and Alexander Seros. It stars Bridget Fonda, Gabriel Byrne, Dermot Mulroney, Anne Bancroft and Harvey Keitel. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography (Panavision/Technicolor) by Michael Ferris and Michael Watkins.

When drug addict Maggie Hayward (Fonda) kills a policeman in cold blood, she is promptly sentenced to death by lethal injection. But maybe there is an out? A chance to work for the government? 

Why so serious?

A remake of Luc Besson's Nikita, this was always going to suffer the usual remake taunts of why bother? Was it necessary etc? Point of No Return is a good honest action movie, it has style to burn, nifty photography and likable leading actors. The action is well staged and thrilling - and Hong Kongish in style, and bubbling away in the writing are themes of identity, absent parents and a delicately off-kilter oedipal angle. The Nina Simone soundtrack is terrific, while Zimmer works around Nina's songs with an aural assuredness that grabs the attention.

It doesn't push any boundaries, and although it has been noted in some neo-noir circles, it is only a borderline entry in that style of film making. But if kinetic is a good word for you, and ultra violence gives you a shot in the arm, then Bridget and her guns are definitely worth a first date at least. 6/10"

A strange choice for Joel's final episode of MST3K, but it's hard to imagine what would be a more appropriate choice. Maybe one of the Russo-Finnish things they covered, like ""Sinbad"", or ""The Day the Earth Froze"" (to end on a high note), or ""Monster-A-Go-Go"" (which embodies the essence of all the crap that MST existed to make fun of.)

I understand why some people don't like Joe Don Baker movies, but my own judgments of his films are influenced memories of one of my best friends in college (since passed away, alas). My friend was an older ex-Army sergeant who was a lot like Baker in many ways, and who would undoubtedly see a lot of himself in Baker's screen persona. A couple of tours of duty in the Army as an enlisted man and non-com had turned him into a self-described ""FFS"" (Fat F***ing Sergeant): an overweight, dyspeptic, burned out, cynical, hard drinking sad sack. But if you got to know him and got past the outer shell, he was one of the best friends a person could ask for; intelligent, loyal, generous, kind, and hard-working to the point of being a workaholic.

I think that my friend would look at Baker's character in this film (and in ""Final Justice"") and see Mitchell in the same way he saw himself: someone who doesn't seem at all glamorous or fancy, but still can do whatever it takes to get the job done.

And that's the whole point of Baker's character in ""Mitchell"": he doesn't look like anyone's idea of an 'action hero', but underneath the flab and the bad attitude is an incorruptible 'real man' who can kick the pretty boys' butts when the chips are down and who stays the course in spite of every obstacle and distraction that would stop a lesser, 'metrosexual' blow comb user. And if the movie does anything well, it at least gets this point across. 

It seems to me that Joel and the gang took any excuse to hammer on Baker when the he and his movie weren't really any worse than most of the stuff that came out at the time. In other words, they struck an attitude and then made up 'straw man' targets to attack to justify their attitude, hoping that the sheer venom of their rhetoric would keep the audience from actually making their own decisions...just like Dennis Miller does in his rants. Baker is somewhat heavy, yes, but he's no Charles Durning or Sidney Greenfield (two actors who you DID expect to have a coronary in any given scene). And his character is somewhat unkempt, but the whole beer/baby oil/revulsion thing they paint for him is at least three notches worse than what the movie presents. You don't believe for a moment that Linda Evans would ever go to bed with Mitchell, but OTOH the results wouldn't be nearly so revolting as Joel and the Bots would have you believe.

So.. no, not a good film by any means. But approach it with an open mind, and you'll have a watchable cop flick with a twist on the usual 'action hero' casting and formula.

Black Narcissus is directed by Micheal Powell and Emeric Pressburger, who both adapt the screenplay form Rumer Godden's novel of the same name. It stars Deborah Kerr, Sabu, Jean Simmons, David Farrar, Flora Robson and Kathleen Byron. Music is scored by Brain Easdale and cinematography by Jack Cardiff.

A group of nuns travel to the Himalayas to set up a school and hospital at the disused Palace of Mopu. Once set up high in the mountains, some of the nuns find themselves seduced by the atmospheric sensuality of the place. Which spells trouble as inner demons start to seep out.

I haven't got much of a review here for you, it really would be redundant due to the widespread availability of detailed works written about the film over the years. Besides which, I can only really agree with 99% of what has been said about the film before. Is there anything new that can be said? I don't think so, really I don't.

Black Narcissus is an experience, a sort of ode to spiritual cinema and a bastion of visual splendour. Some call it a masterpiece, others say it's just shy of being as such, but either way a vast majority of film lovers agree it's film making of considerable skill.

Negatively, however small in the grand scheme of things, it's thin on story and a couple of our lead nun protagonists here are actually too filmy and pretty; I mean I don't intend to insult the thousands of real nuns in the world, but none are surely as foxy as Kerr and Byron as presented here?! You can kind of tell it's the meeting of a visualist and a story teller trying to find a common ground, but the visualist (Powell) holds sway for this one and film lovers the world over are all the better for it.

With a spitfire on form cast, matte paintings and Technicolor so beautiful that eye orgasms are guaranteed, and sensual suspense dripping from the roof, Black Narcissus is landmark British film making. Brought to us by two directors whose every plaudit is definitely justified. 9/10 || Right from the start, Jack Cardiff's magnificent cinematography sets a perfect scene for this superbly directed story of ""Sister Clodagh"" (Deborah Kerr) who is despatched to a remote corner of northern India to establish a school and hospital in an old, cold and windy, palace. Accompanied by a rather curious collection of nuns - Flora Robson, Jenny Laird, Judith Furse and Kathleen Byron, they must combat the elements and their plentiful demons to make their project function - none of this is aided by the presence of the enigmatic David Farrar who seems to bring out the best and worst in both Kerr and the first-class Byron as ""Sister Ruth"" who treads a fine line between sanity and an almost demonic despair. The story addresses many of the issues of post-colonial India, of poverty, malnourishment, illiteracy and Christianity - amongst those who believe and those who want to - and tests the faith of each of the women in differing, potent, ways. Look out for a super performance from May Hallatt as the slightly demented caretaker they call ""Auntie"" who dishes out brutality and sagely wisdom is equal, haphazard, measure. The dialogue is clever - there is humour here amidst the intensity, and the film has a magnetism that generates a genuine feeling of involvement in the lives of these flawed characters. For some, the palace sounds like a Shangri La; for others it is merely a prison with a grand view... || **_Stuck between the carnal and the celestial in the southern Himalayas_**

A group of well-meaning nuns try to establish a nunnery beyond Darjeeling in northeast India at a dilapidated palace-on-the-heights that used to house a harem. Deborah Kerr plays the Sister Superior while David Farrar appears as the agent to the local prince. 

Based on the 1939 novel, “Black Narcissus” (1947) is a psychological drama with the interesting milieu of the awe-inspiring northern India. Being shot in the UK, the scenery is a well-done illusion created in the studio via glass shots and hanging miniatures. The backdrops are enlarged B&W photos, which the art department spruced-up with breathtaking colors using pastel chalks.

While Kerr’s beauty is showcased in the flashbacks, it’s Kathleen Byron who stands out on this front in the last act; she’s breathtaking. Meanwhile Jean Simmons is fetching as a native lass who catches the attentions of the “general” (Sabu); she was only 17 during shooting. On the other side of the spectrum, Farrar does well as the hairy-chested sigma male.

The sets, backdrops and cast are a visual delight, yet the subtexts on the human condition in a fallen world are just as interesting. All of us have to walk the balance beam between the profane and the precious, settling where we think best at any moment. It’s no coincidence that Clodagh (Kerr) and Ruth (Bryon) are similar-looking redheads underneath their habits and they’re both in an unspoken competition with their carnal side stirred by a certain person.

“Black Narcissus” wisely takes the lowkey route. We know what’s going on underneath the surface, but it’s not spelled out. Lesser flicks require a passionate sex scene to ‘wow’ the viewer whereas this one opts for the simple-but-potent clasping of hands.

The movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot at Pinewood Studios, west of London, with some forest scenes done south of London in Lower Beeding, Horsham, West Sussex. The Ireland sequences were shot in County Galway on the Emerald Isle.

I love a good prison escape flick, shown by my love for those two aforementioned productions which do improve on the formula; TSR - one of my favourite films, fwiw - particularly must've took a lot of inspiration from this, I noted a fair few similarities.

With the cast, you have an excellent performance from Clint Eastwood. Patrick McGoohan fits his role nicely, while Paul Benjamin and Larry Hankin are the best of the rest. I would've liked more development for the characters of Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau, who felt a little tacked on. Elsewhere, Danny Glover makes his acting debut in a tiny, tiny role.

I found the pacing to be very good, sure the story I guess is obvious in terms of its direction but I still got tense and edgy whilst watching the escape take place. The ambience of the film is a positive too, with the exception of one moment early on where there's an overly on the nose lightning strike as one of the characters mentions Alcatraz - nothing major, it's a nit-pick and it's my only one so that's a big plus.

Interesting to note this was the final collaboration between Eastwood and director Don Siegel, take out <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/coogans-bluff/"">Coogan's Bluff</a>'</em> and that was an extremely effective partnership - this 1979 release and <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/two-mules-for-sister-sara/"">Two Mules for Sister Sara</a>'</em> being my favourites. || Seen this one several times and still is a well done and straight forward, well shot, escape-thriller with fine performances all around. Nothing fancy and just enough character development to make you care. **4.0/5** || Clint Eastwood is at the top of his game in this thriller. He is bank robber Frank Morris, Incarcerated in one of America's most impregnable prisons, under the menacing gaze of warden Patrick McGoohan. He quickly concludes that he has little left to live for but escape. Together with twins Clarence and John Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau) he puts together an intricate plan to escape their prison by using the utility tunnels to escape the complex then some makeshift inflatables to get across San Francisco bay. The facts of the story mean the ending is never in doubt - insofar as we actually know what the ending was/is! Now that rather detracts from any sense of jeopardy with the screenplay, but is one of the aspects that make Eastwood all the more compelling - his meticulous planning, ingenuity and sheer perspicacity is enthralling - ok, at times a little slow - to watch. He has to deal with the odd internal fracas, most notably from ""Wolf"" (Bruce Fisher) who would have some fun with him, if you get my drift... but none of that detracts him from his goal. Aside from this mission, Don Siegel offers us quite a detailed glimpse into life behind bars towards the end of this crumbling building's life; and we are exposed to the relentless tedium and despair of many which engenders some sympathy - however evil they may have been to be sent there in the first place. What Siegel doesn't really do, though, is use McGoohan to much effect. His usual less-is-more style of performance is certainly here, but all to infrequently to really build an sense of menace. Still, it's Eastwood's film and he is great..."

Now there's no getting away from it for me, I am not a fan of Eddie Murphy in just about any of his guises, and here his interpretation of the annoying donkey does just that - and after about ten minutes of the relentless (unfunny) prattle, I'd have happily paid for him to go to a sanctuary, ideally on the moon. The rest of this is quite entertaining though, with loads of mischief and calamity ensuing as this family has to learn that it's not all about appearances. Judge folks on their actions and who they are and maybe you'll discover that being big and rough round the edges is no bad thing. The suave and debonaire ""Puss In Boots"" steals the thing for me and I did enjoy the idea of the anti-fairy wreaking mischief and not so much cheesy joy.

Jack Hall is certain that another ice age is imminent due to the effects of global warming, but the government just will not listen to him. Sure enough the climate changes and the world is at threat from perilous frozen weather, worse still for Jack is that his son is trapped in New York City!

Roland Emmerich was the perfect choice to direct this particular piece. There is no denying that he has no little panache when it comes to destroying and blowing things up, think Independence Day, Stargate, Universal Soldier and Godzilla. What runs true through an Emmerich picture is that he is great on the CGI money shots and knows how to whet an appetite for destruction. Sadly, what is also true is that his second halves rarely deliver on their promise, so shall it be with The Day After Tomorrow. Even allowing for the expected mawkishness that comes with disaster/survival pictures, this picture relies too much on its contrivances, thus completely losing sight of its eco-conscious heart, something that I'm sure the politically aware Emmerich set out to deliver at the start.

Packing his picture with solid and professional performers (led by the always watchable Dennis Quaid as Jack Hall), Emmerich is all too aware that his money shots are what the popcorn masses have chiefly paid to see. Tornados, floods and the subsequent freeze are all excellent moments in the piece, but now, some years later the film has to be called out for being the shallow showcase that it is, in fact the CGI looks unintentionally artificial. It's a missed opportunity to make a blockbuster with an intelligent heart, and sadly Emmerich, either through boredom or ignorance? failed to seal the deal and craft one of the better genre entries.

Just about average for the destruction sequences, but very little else to recommend here I'm afraid. 5/10 || I gather that climate deniers hate films like this. I would be sad if my political or social stances Completely prevented me from being able to appreciate films that stretch credulity the opposite way from my own views. I mean, I am an ardent atheist and have enjoyed religious films. I am all for science, but science fiction can take a few liberties and shortcuts and if I like it, I will suspend my disbelief. But many people automatically hate what they disagree with.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, as I like extreme weather and other disaster special effects in films. I didn't feel insulted by the perceived intelligence of the plot and dialogue as others seemed to be. I don't watch feature films for the latest information on climate change: the news and documentaries are around for that. The special effects were good enough and - okay — scenes like the quick freezing dropping from the atmosphere is probably total hokey, but it serves the rapid pace of the plot. The idea of what happens with Mexico at the end seems a little heavy handed politically, but I don’t have delicate sensibilities in the political arena, so fine. Yada yada yada: Just entertain me. This one does. || **The Day After Tomorrow ends the world better than most natural disaster films, with an experienced disaster director and a grounded premise.**

Roland Emmerich, the master of disaster, created one of the quintessential apocalyptic natural disaster films with The Day After Tomorrow. Floods, tsunamis, hail, suddenly dropping temperatures, and more all make their way into the perils of this film. The movie follows Dennis Quaid's climatologist as he warns the world of a quickly returning ice age. Once the global freeze catches humanity unprepared, survivors struggle against the impossible temperatures to find shelter and hope. The film sets itself apart with its cinematography featuring the expansive frozen wastelands and iconic monuments captured in ice. Performances are solid with a cast like Quaid, Gyllenhaal, and Rossum. The story is simple, which works for a disaster survival flick. The Day After Tomorrow is special compared to other big-budget catastrophe events because it is a little more grounded compared to some of the more outrageous films of Emmerich's more recent filmography, like Moonfall or 2012 but still benefits from a director that excels at destroying historic landmarks on the big screen."

This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness.

The quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.

One of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fiancé and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.

The trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling ""villains"" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.

My only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley's to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.

**Score:** _87%_ |
**Verdict:** _Excellent_ || I recall the controversy as this was released. Alfonso Cuarón consciously decided to darken this film, and the light-hearted stories of the first two are replaced by an edgier approach to this tale for our wizarding trio. The world's most wanted wizard ""Sirius Black"" (Gary Oldman) escapes from ""Azkaban"" allegedly bent on the destruction of ""Harry"". The script has more by way of addition to the original book, but in a complementary - not detracting way. As the children grow into young adults, we are exposed to a scarier side of their existence - the ""Dementors"" that are supposed to protect the innocent and the ""Boggart"" all serve to introduce a physical fluidity to this shape-shifting environment of peril in which they now exist. The presence of ""Valdemort"" becomes more omnipresent and there is so much more substance to the stories now. Sir Michael Gambon takes over the role of ""Dumbledore"" without quite the presence of Richard Harris, but we can tell now that this series is heading for murky, dangerous, waters..."
16617.0,Mindhunters,Trainees in the FBI's psychological profiling program must put their training into practice when they discover a killer in their midst.  Based very loosely on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None.,"For seven elite profilers, finding a serial killer is a process of elimination. Their own.","Mystery, Thriller, Crime",106.0,2004-05-07,en,6.464,1230.0,2.1546,"Kathryn Morris, Jonny Lee Miller, LL Cool J, Christian Slater, Patricia Velásquez",Renny Harlin,"island, fbi, simulation, training, serial killer, slasher, series of murders, suspicious, fbi agent, suspenseful","Brain Drain!

The Mindhunters of the title are a group of FBI profilers who as part of their training are sent to a remote island to solve a mock crime in a mock town. Their mission is to form a profile of a serial killer known as The Puppeteer, trouble is, is that The Puppeteer turns out to be real and starts picking them off one by one.

Directed by Renny Harlin and featuring a bonkers story written by Wayne Kramer, it doesn't take an FBI profiler to know what sort of film this is going to be. Featuring a cast that contains LL Cool J, Jonny Lee Miller, Patricia Velásquez, Val Kilmer and Christian Slater, Mindhunters is undeniably preposterous cinema for the easily pleased masses, and yet it's still hugely enjoyable and isn't found wanting in the ingenuity stakes. 

The killers secret is closely guarded, which keeps the Ten Little Indians (yes this is another Agatha cover version) like mystery going, and the manner of the deaths have a morbid freshness about them - with one in particular being outrageously thrilling. A few scenes are neatly crafted by Harlin, who is after all is no slouch in the action genre (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight), while the swimming pool finale is taut and tight and the killer reveal genuinely a surprise. 

Yes there's problems abound in the film, but isn't there always in this kind of ""B"" movie hogwash? The cast do what is required as they work through some pretty naff dialogue, and any expectation about caring for any of these characters should be set at option zero. However, it's a nice fit for Harlin, as it finds him comfortable in the knowledge that we want whizz bang murder death kill, and thus he delivers. Expectation of anything else is pure folly and one directs you towards René Clair's excellent 1945 film, And Then There Were None if you need something a bit more solid in your murder mystery diet. 7/10"

This trying mostly translates to failure, and I guess I can see that, but _Chronicles of Riddick_ still had such a massive impact on me, that I still have to recommend it.

_""Threshold! Take us to the Threshold!""_

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || This is very much a vehicle for Vin Diesel to flex his muscles and engage in 2 hours of kick-ass adventure. The plot is pretty unimportant: ""Riddick"" arrives on a planet and is soon hired by Dame Judi Dench to go up against the brutal ""Necromongers"" - a sort of intergalactic cricket led by Colm Feore, who are hell bent on destroying humanity. After quite a long, slow, start it does not hang about; we have loads of decent special effects as he is double-crossed, imprisoned and ultimately joined with Karl Urban and Thandie Newton to take on the army of locust-like beasties. It's not the best of the ""Riddick"" films, but it has a good cast and a half-decent story to keep it off the rocks. Don't look for intellectual stimulation; just think - ice cream for the brain - and you will probably quite enjoy this. I did."

I always enjoy the real versions of animated movies. This was done well. Garfield being pissed off at Odie for John bringing him home. || **A forgettable film, full of problems, and which purges Garfield of the charisma and soul of the original cartoon character.**

I have to say that, although I'm not a comic book fan, I've loved Garfield since I was a child, particularly due to his adaptation into children's cartoons, which I saw in my childhood and loved. I also saw the more modern animations, in digital format, but I can't help but think that the classic material is better, and the stories presented are much more engaging. In any case, trying to compare the 2004 film to any of the Garfield animations or comic books is a real trial by fire: the film is considerably weaker, even though it has certain positive points that deserve our attention.

The film was directed by a certain Joel Cohen, who is not the same Joel from the Cohen Brothers, he is another person with an identical name, who I didn't know. The director doesn't seem to me to have been the best student in the directing class at film school... notice how the film was poorly edited and unfolds unevenly, wasting a lot of time on uninteresting things just to rush near the end. In addition to the pacing problems, the film lacks a good soundtrack and some comic “spark” that gives it soul and charm. Although sarcasm works effectively and is a very solid characteristic of the character, Garfield manages to be funnier and more charismatic than this cat in this film, and most of the jokes sound hollow, especially to adults.

The script, instead of taking advantage of the wealth of Garfield that exists in comics and animations, serves us a story that is dull, uninteresting, poorly written and full of clichés. It seems that the production only had people who didn't like, or didn't know, the character: the film only talks about the friendship between Garfield and Oddie, a cat and a dog who will have to learn to share the attention of their owner, Jon. There is an attempt to do anything more than that by inserting a villain who acts like Cruella De Vil, trying to use animals for his selfish purposes. In the end, he looks like Mufasa in the hands of the hyenas in “Lion King”: the scenes are identical, a copy that shows the void of ideas in that production room.

However, despite all these problems being worthy of consideration, the film has quality elements, starting with the CGI and digital animation, which were inserted into the conventional filming with great technical skill. Even for the beginning of the century, it's a reasonably convincing film, with one drawback: Garfield's character. Being a “live action” film where all the characters, human or not, are real and similar to their animated counterparts, why didn’t they do the same with the orange cat? The cat remains equal to the animated one, and is the only one, brutally clashing with everything! For a practical example, compare Garfield to Oddie or even Nermal: the two characters look much better than the animated cat.

As for the actors, the film seems to have made safe bets on competent people who could add some talent to the film and guarantee a minimum of quality: Jennifer Love Hewitt does a very competent job, but it is a film that she cannot save, she is in a position too secondary to do it; Bill Murray, despite only lending his voice to the cat, is the ideal actor to do it. Not only does he have the most suitable tone and voice, he also has an extraordinary comedic streak and ability to make jokes loaded with sarcasm. However, even he knows this film is weak, despite the cash he received for lending his voice! Stephen Tobolowsky is a weak, pantomime villain, with no personality or ability to threaten, and Brekin Meyer doesn't give Jon a personality worthy of our esteem, he turns him into a sympathetic fool."
9890.0,The Stepford Wives,"What does it take to become a Stepford wife, a woman perfect beyond belief?

A couple (Nicole Kidman & Matthew Broderick) moves from the Big Apple to Stepford, Connecticut, where many of the wives of the village are wholly dedicated to their husbands, home & garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. The husband joins the mysterious all-male organization of the town which seems to be up to something fishy. Bette Midler plays Joanna’s best friend while Glenn Close & Christopher Walken are on hand as high society leaders.

“The Stepford Wives” (2004) is a confused comedic remake of the iconic 1975 film. It starts out like it might be a fun farce, and it is to some degree, but it’s hindered by an annoying stereotypical “gay” character and doomed by befuddled writing, the result of bad-management wherein rewrites and reshoots ruined the story's continuity and created plot holes. 

The most glaring example is the implication that the wives are replaced by robots; for instance, one woman is used as an ATM machine. At the end, however, Joanna (Kidman) discovers they've just been brainwashed by microchips inserted in their brains. If the latter is true, why was there an android version of Joanna? Do the men have a choice of a robot model or a human-with-a-microchip model? Do they choose “accessories”? It’s never elucidated. 

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot in Connecticut and New York/New Jersey.

GRADE: D+ || Despite an A-list cast, this is a really poor and disjointed film that is much more about the stars than it is about any cohesive story. Television executive ""Joanna"" (Nicole Kidman) has burned the candle at both ends for too long, has a bit of a breakdown, and is shunted off to the manicured hedges and lawns of Stepford in Connecticut by her rather insipid husband ""Walter"" (Matthew Broderick). It doesn't take them long to realise that this is conceivably the most sterile, charm free place on the planet. All their neighbours have wives who would vie for the most vacuous woman prize - doting on their looks, their dresses, their hair, their gardens - whilst their men folk, under the watchful eye of ""Mike Wellington"" (Christopher Walker) and his uber-glamorous wife ""Claire"" (Glenn Close) seem to live the life of Reilly. Luckily, ""Bobbie"" (Bette Midler) offers ""Joanna"" the vaguest of lifelines as the only other voice of near sanity in this oasis of feminine perfection, but how long before they succumb too - or can they resist the mysterious effects of the spa and the gentleman's club? There is really very little to like or enjoy in this. For it to have worked, it would have required much more humour and charisma on screen. The narrative meanders in just too flat and stolid a fashion, with little for us to get our teeth into. Middler has probably the best chance at injecting a degree of personality into the thing, but even she struggles with the wordy dialogue and the lacklustre delivery. It looks good, effort has certainly been expended there - but the rest of this is just poor and disappointing. The 1975 film isn't great, but it's way better than this."

So, on to the movie.

I don't need to give the synopsis because you can find it easily.  Did I like it?  At first it was pretty dull and the main character is really an over the top diva.  His dresser works feverishly to please him.  When we later find out something isn't quite right with Sir (played brilliantly by Sir Albert Finney) chaos takes over but Norman (the dresser played by Tom Courtenay) does his very best to keep things together. 

Most of the movies is this one long night and for someone who knows little about theater, the movie gives you a great behind the scenes look at a mid 20th century theater production.  Assuming it's pretty real.  Lots of cool stuff to take in here and this is when the movie really started to grab me.  I started to root for the ""show to go on"". 

The final act is a little hard to swallow but it certainly keeps you thinking up until the end and also makes you really understand the relationship between the Sir and Norman.  

While I do feel this movie was a little over the top, it was by design, I believe.  It was written with Shakespeare as the backdrop and it was also written by a dresser from the 1950's.  My guess, is it was fairly accurate with some added topping to give it a little extra.  Was it a best picture nominee for 1983?

Comedy - _negligible_. Interest factor - negligible. Original cast members - negligible. Audiences watching it in the theatres in 1994 - negligible.  Box office gross - negligible. 

Farting noises - _absolutely_. Cartoon sound effects - absolutely. Disinterested/embarrassed performances - absolutely. Enthusiastic Russian actors who believe they are performing in a masterpiece - absolutely. 

After watching this movie I had forgotten how to smile. I saw somebody else laughing and I had to ask them what they were doing with their face and what the _unusual sound_ meant. || **An unnecessary film.**

Sometimes it seems producers have a hard time understanding when a movie shouldn't be made. The “Police Academy” franchise should have ended in the sixth film, and even then it would be ending up pretty worn out. This film, made several years later, was an effort that was simply needless and certainly leaves no one with good memories.

After seeing the movie, I was really sorry that the franchise ended with such a bad movie. It was something that, for me, should have been avoided. “Police Academy” was one of the most interesting and successful comic franchises of the 80s, and there are still many people who have fond memories of these films today. I myself, as a child, saw them several times on television.

The script is perfectly idiotic and a simple excuse to take some of the characters in the film to post-Soviet Russia, where they must help the local police to fight a big mobster who is turning into an oligarch (one of many that, as we know, emerged from the ashes of the communist regime, fat with shady deals in which the Russian people ended up losing). It's an unhappy, poor script made by incapable people. Humor, on the other hand, is completely absent. I don't laugh for a single minute.

The cast, which until now had been relatively stable (with the absence of several actors starting from the fourth film), had completely collapsed, and most actors refused to be part of this project. George Gaynes is back, but his character, Commander Lassard, looks simply like an old man with Alzheimer's (with all due respect to anyone suffering from this serious illness, don't get me wrong). Gaynes is not funny, and his performance here is disgraceful. Michael Winslow also tries to make some of the jokes he's already used to us, taking advantage of his vocal skills... but he doesn't have the material or time and what he does has no freshness or novelty. Sir Christopher Lee makes a brief appearance in the film, and as far as I can understand, he did so as a favor to the producer. Friendship is a beautiful thing, and also professional courtesy, but I bet Lee won't want to be remembered for this movie (and he certainly won't, he's done better things, as we know). Who ends up standing out in some way is Ron Perlman. The actor, who we know for other, much more dignified works, tried to be funny and give some dignity to his character. Meritorious, respectable, but unworthy of the actor he is. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning.

Are there any redeeming qualities in this film? To be honest, I don't think so..., but even so, I feel obliged to make a small caveat: I liked the fact that they did a lot of the filming in the real city of Moscow and that they used real Russian extras and Russian speakers. This gives the film a certain authenticity that deserves to be highlighted, and which is most lacking nowadays, where any piece of green or blue screen replaces a real set and saves a few dollars on the production budget. However, it must have taken courage and some dose of madness to try to make a film in the midst of the political and military upheavals Russia was experiencing in those years. || <em>'Police Academy: Mission to Moscow'</em> brings this franchise - as it stands - to a close. It's not good, but it's not the worst of the series in my opinion; not that it's far off being so, more the case that I 'enjoyed' it a tiny bit more than the sixth entry.

The cast feels bare-bones, at least in terms of the original bunch of characters. Bubba Smith dropped out for this, which is a loss, so only Michael Winslow, David Graf and George Gaynes stayed to complete the run of appearing in all seven films.

It's actually away from them that you find the interesting performers, as Christopher Lee and Ron Perlman turn up. The former doesn't feature heavily, though the latter does and is alright I guess; as noted already, he is better than last time out's attempt.

On the cast, the film has a crafted sequence at the end where it gives special mention to the key performers... via horse riding, no less. Given the obvious cuts to 'hide' the stunt performers, I'm surprised they went to so much effort for a short moment like that - must've had budget left over!

I'm rather glad to have completed this franchise. Despite that and that none of these flicks scored positively, I actually didn't mind watching them. I might be being generous, but honestly they are relatively simple to watch; the filmmakers had the common sense to limit 'em to 80-90 minutes, which most certainly helps!"

Hour of the Wolf (Vargtimmen) is written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. It stars Max Von Sydow, Liv Ullmann, Gertrud Fridh, Georg Rydeberg and Ingrid Thulin. Music is by Lars Johan Werle and cinematography by Sven Nyquist.

While vacationing on a remote Scandanavian island with his younger pregnant wife, an artist has an emotional breakdown while confronting his repressed desires. 

Is this really Ingmar Bergman's only genuine horror movie? I would argue that pretty much most of his movies have horrific elements. That said, this one is haunting in its dissection of a fragmented mind, to see the unravelling of an artistic persona tortured by repression, doubt and a nightmarish world that he, or us, are not sure exists or not.

When Bergman was at his pomp, he had this knack of drawing in his audience to be part of his plays, so it be here. Sydow yet again gives his all for his director, absolutely sinking into the role of troubled artist Johan Borg. Ullman (playing pregnant and genuinely pregnant with Bergman's child), yet again hits all the emotive discordant notes of a woman in love but fearful of where both her sanity - and that of her husband - is heading.

As Johan's drawings start to take on disturbing overtones (we don't see them, he narrates to his wife but we get the picture), we then get pulled into Bergman's world of flashbacks and the question of reality or nightmares?. Here the director unleashes his weapons of choice, human demons - grotesques, all cloaked magnificently by cinematographer Nyquist who once again follows his leader down the road of chilly expressionism.

Alma (Ullman) quite early on announces that couples who are together for so long start to resemble each other, so is it any coincidence that as things reach fever pitch Johan is wearing lipstick? Are we to buy into the notion that Sydow's character's under Bergman are in fact his alter egos? Does it matter? No it doesn't, for Bergman is a fascinating director (I personally don't like all his films), what you do come away with is a feeling of being invaded mentally - and joyously so. 8/10"

Suddenly is directed by Lewis Allen and written by Richard Sale. It stars Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden, James Gleason, Nancy Gates, Kim Charney and Christopher Dark. Music is by David Raksin and cinematography by Charles G. Clarke.

 

The small American town of Suddenly is gearing up for a pit stop visit by the President of the United States. Unfortunately the President’s visit has attracted the attention of assassins, who hold hostage the Benson family and friends as their home is the perfect viewpoint for a sniper shot at the President…

 

Show me a guy with feelings and I’ll show you a sucker.

 

Sinatra was never comfortable with his role in Suddenly, even before he “requested” it be removed from circulation post the assassination of his friend JFK in 63, there was a feeling within the Sinatra camp that playing such a despicable character would harm his image. More so as it came a year after his Oscar winning performance in From Here to Eternity. Blue Eyes would even try to make good on the characterisation by reversing the roles as it were for The Manchurian Candidate 1962, but of course a lot of things changed after November 22nd 1963. This all gives Suddenly a curiosity value that it actually doesn’t need, for it’s a gripping thriller capable of standing on its own two feet, and it’s boosted by a terrific performance from Sinatra, one of his best in fact.

 

That it was hard to see for quite some time is a shame, because it deserves to be better known. The makers take a hostage scenario and give it a noir edge by way of the conspiracy angle, some paranoia, a family in peril and a strong noir staple of a returning soldier from a war badly scarred by his experiences. In this case John Baron (Sinatra) has the taste for killing, as he is taunted by chief hostage Sheriff “Tod” Shaw (Hayden) about his means and motives, that Baron just likes to kill, Baron repeatedly rants that he was a Silver Star winner, that he killed 27 German soldiers, but this doesn’t hide the fact that he has no compunction about killing the President for money. To him the President is just a mark of no significant interest, Baron is a real cold fish and Sinatra gives a thunderously twitchy coiled spring portrayal.

 

Sinatra is backed up by Hayden doing one of his strong macho type turns, and Gleason scores best of the support actors as a wise old boy who himself was once in the Secret Service. These two bastions of Americana off set the near irritating characterisations of Ellen Benson (Gates) and Peter Benson III (Charney), the former the hysterical female, the latter the annoying kid saying illogical things. However, these two stereotypes don’t harm the picture, because director Allen manages to keep the group under duress dynamic ticking away, smothering it with claustrophobic atmosphere to then unleash all for the explosive finale.

 

It’s set in daylight and visually it’s nothing to get excited about, in fact much of the film is set in one living room, while the patriotism over traitorism is a necessary piece of thematic flag waving. But this comes highly recommended as entertainment as sleepy small town Americana is jolted out of its stupor. 8/10"

Sgt John M. Stryker is a battle hardened Marine who's job it is to prepare his new charges for the realities of war. With no care for making friends, Stryker does what ever it takes to make these men tough and ready for the Pacific conflicts to come. 

Sands Of Iwo Jima is unashamedly proud in its jingoistic fervour, and rightly so. Iwo Jima, and the now immortal portrait of weary American soldiers hoisting the flag atop Mt. Suribachi, has become a bastion of bravery, a beacon of triumph if you will. So it's no surprise to find Allan Dwan's film has no intention if deviating from boasting its colours, and hooray to that. Here as Stryker we find John Wayne giving a bit more to his character portrayal than merely some beefcake winning the war. Wayne puts depth and sincerity into Stryker, an air of believability shines through as he shows vulnerability, we believe he can win this war with his men, but we also see tenderness and it lifts Sands higher than your average war picture. 

Wise old director Dwan (432 directing credits to his name), weaves the picture together with admirable restraint. Fusing actual newsreel footage with his own tightly handled action sequences, Sands plays out as the tribute and rally call that it has every right to be, even finding place in the film for three of the soldiers who hoisted that now famous flag. Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon and John Bradley are the three gentlemen to look out for. The rest of the cast don't really have to do much outside of respond to Wayne's two fold performance, but keep an eye out for a fresh faced Richard Jaeckel as Pfc. Frank Flynn, while I personally enjoyed the brief, but important contribution from Julie Bishop as Mary. 

Wayne received a nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards (too bad for him that 49 contained brilliant shows from the winner Broderick Crawford & a bluderbus turn from Gregory Peck), with other nominations going to the Best Story, Editing and Sound categories. Ironically it was a role Wayne didn't fancy doing, but some encouragements from war veterans humbled him into starring.

Carl Meacham is an atomic scientist, who after passing a cunning test, gets invited to work at a top secret lab out in Georgia by the rather odd looking man known as Exeter. The project is apparently in the cause of finding world peace, and once arriving at his destination, Carl finds other notable scientists are also there, including the radiant Ruth Adams. As things progress things don't quite add up, and this leads to a realisation that the future of Earth could very well be in the balance.

""This Island Earth"" not only divides the casual film viewer, it's also proved divisive amongst the most hardened of sci-fi genre supporters. Some say the story is barely worth a second glance, whilst others point to a distinct lack of scientific nous as a reason to do the film down. To me I find it to be very much on the money for the era it was made. This film comes nearly ten years after America ended World War II with an atomic attack on Japan, when nuclear reactors had been commissioned and were no longer seen solely as a weapon of mass destruction, in short the nuclear age was prominent and very much a reality.

Yes the film is a far fetched fantasy, and it tries too hard to encompass a myriad of plot strands - something which to the younger viewers is likely to fly right over their heads. Yet the value here comes very much in the production as a whole. Marvel at the sets, the model work and the gadgets that feature heavily in this delicious slice of berserker sci-fi. Take in the incredible work of cinematographer Clifford Stine as we find ourselves on a desolate planet. It's a beacon of the genre because it identified the benefits of Technicolor to the sci-fi splinter of film and used it vividly to enhance the story (even if some subsequent home entertainment releases failed to restore it to a print fully worthy of the colour venture). The lovely Faith Domergue and square jawed Rex Reason play our intrepid scientists with verve and vigour, whilst Jeff Morrow is uneasily quirky as the mysterious Exeter. 

Directed by Joseph M. Newman (out of his genre comfort zones) offering up a technically wonderful film, it does make one rue that he didn't make more sci-fi pictures. For this is a shining genre light made at a time when cinema was a craft from all quarters of the medium, for also it's intelligent and knowingly astute of its own time frame. So don't believe the nay sayers on this, because this is a smart and poetic fantasy that also contains genuine moments of cinematic beauty. 7/10 || I remember watching this film on television in the 70s and loving it. Whilst I'm not quite so impressed by it now, it is still quite a clever sci-fi yarn about an alien species, themselves under dire threat of extinction, who come to earth to assemble a team of scientists to help save their planet from an enemy bent on destroying it. Jeff Morrow has the slightly conical head as ""Exeter"" - their leader who recruits Rex Reason (""Meacham"") and Faith Domergue (""Adams""). It is one of the first of these 1950s films that I recall seeing in colour, and that does render the SFX a little bit dated - perhaps a touch too much latex. Good nonetheless."

Dowdy spinster Catherine Sloper is stuck in a rut, she is often made to feel useless by her almost tyrannical father, and her life is ambling along in uneventful boredom. Potential gentleman suitors stay well clear of her, such is her unease with the social graces of the day. Then one day at a society ball she is lavished with attention from Morris Townsend, could this be love? Or is he merely after her inheritance? An inheritance her father will take away from her should she progress further with the shifty Townsend.

A novel written by Henry James (Washington Square) and a successful Broadway play by Ruth & Augustus Goetz (responsible for the film's wonderful ending), The Heiress adapts perfectly to the big screen due to the almost peerless work from all involved in the production. Olivia de Havilland is sensational as Catherine, the tale is about Catharine's transition from put upon victim into a mature, rational wise woman, and de Haviland double deals from the top of the pack - with one particular look towards the end of the play, she may just own the title of worlds best ever icy stare. Ralph Richardson plays the father brilliantly, fusing a trio of character traits with imposing results. William Wyler's direction is right on the money, so it's no surprise to learn that de Havilland requested Wyler for the project, for she must surely have known that he was the man to bring out such a majestic two fold performance.

Montgomery Clift gives a rather more safe than great performance as Townsend, perhaps at times too aware that de Havilland and Richardson were shining bright on set, Clift none the less is one of those actors whose average shows were still better than some of his so called peers' best. Major bonus here is the score from Aaron Copland, jaunty in earlier sections then swirling like a poetic menace in the final third, it's simply beautiful. Tales of bad feeling on the set can be found in various sources, with both Richardson & Clift showing disdain for de Havilland's acting ability. Surely though, one only has to view the film now to see that the off screen tensions lifted de Havilland up to another acting level,  helped by the gifted hands of one William Wyler of course.

A smashing, dramatic and engrossing picture, The Heiress is a must see for those looking for artistic deftness, and to find an ending that is a fittingly memorable piece of class. 9/10 || There are three really strong performances here, but for my money it is Sir Ralph Richardson who stands out. ""Sloper"" is a wealthy surgeon, a widower and father to the naive young ""Catherine"". She (Olivia de Havilland) is shy and usually quite happy doing her embroidery quietly at home. Then her well meaning aunt ""Lavinia"" (Miriam Hopkins) comes to stay and her father thinks that perhaps she can help bring his daughter a little out of her shell. One of the results of this change is a meeting with ""Morris"" (Montgomery Clift). Now whilst he's not exactly penniless, he hasn't anything remotely like her $30,000 a year. She falls completely for his simple charms and swiftly they are talking marriage. Not unreasonably, her father thinks this is all moving far too fast and so suggests a trip to Europe to see if she can get him out of her system. When that doesn't quite work, the father starts to show his true colours and that's just the start of things unravelling for the young woman who is about to be given some very harsh lessons on life. It's a sumptuous looking drama, this, with a fantastically toxic storyline that pits love and affection against selfishness and jealousy - but it does it in a painfully and politely ambiguous fashion. There are so many assumptions being made about what people here think. Not just by the three characters, but by the audience too as we must assess the motives of each. All three have a point to make, valid questions to raise and flaws in their character and that's bound to sow seeds for misunderstandings and mistrust. The novel that underpins this story is one that cleverly looks at the roles of men and women in a society where there wasn't an hint of equality - even when the woman has the cash, but where there was also evidence of decency and pride - good and bad. The denouement is entirely fitting but I felt rather an unsympathetic and condemnatory one that left me feeling sorry for just about everyone left alive. It's a sad film populated with real characters, a dynamic drama and is William Wyler at his best."

When it first came out in 2004 _Super Size Me_ was a hit due to its simple concept and exposé of the fast food industry, specifically McDonalds. To refresh your memory about this documentary classic, here is the official description:

_Morgan Spurlock subjects himself to a diet based only on McDonald's fast food three times a day for thirty days without exercising to try to prove why so many Americans are fat or obese. He submits himself to a complete check-up by three doctors, comparing his weight along the way, resulting in a scary conclusion._

It is a pretty straightforward documentary, Spurlock films himself eating McDonald's for a month and intercuts this with doctor's visits, information on the fast food industry and McDonald's as a company, and conversations with various health professionals. One of the stand out parts for me was when he paid a visit to a school showed the rubbish the kids were being served, and the reaction of the school administrators was interesting. One tried to justify it and laugh it off, whereas one of the ladies from the kitchen was quite resigned to having to serve up this stuff to the kids. She even says something along the lines of ""the kitchen tool we use here the most is a box cutter to open this stuff up"". Spurlock doesn't just leave it at that, he shows another school that serves healthy lunches to its students for around the same price, to show that it can be done.

Throughout, Spurlock doesn't put his own spin on things, but relies on the information presented to speak for itself. The physical effects his diet had were quite shocking. It is by far not a scientific experiment or approach, but it does show what effect regular long term consumption of fast food can have on your body. As such it is a useful reminder of information we already know. Heck, we knew it back then, and if anything, the consumption of junk of shows no signs of slowing down.

I enjoyed watching this again, and definitely think its worth checking out if its been a while since you saw it. In fact with a sequel now out, perhaps this is a great time for a second look."

Translated as ""The Pier,"" the film opens on a Parisian airport pier, where people can watch planes take off and land. The film has no dialogue aside from the narrator and some hushed whispering, so we are told that the unnamed Man (Davos Hanich) remembers being at the airport as a child before World War III, and watching a man fall and die. The image stayed with him forever, as did the face of a mysterious woman who was also there. Paris has been obliterated in a nuclear holocaust, and the survivors have retreated underground. The Man has been taken prisoner by the war's victors -we never learn who ""won""- and is subjected to experimentation by a Doctor (Jacques Ledoux). Other prisoners have died or were turned into vegetables by the experiments, but the Man might be different because he has strong mental images, like the airport, to fall back on.

After a week and a half, he does see images like his central image of the airport. Then, after almost a month, he meets an unnamed Woman (Helene Chatelain). The Man is somewhere in the past, and keeps popping in on the same woman. They tour gardens together, and finally the Man explains why he is there, as the Woman listens patiently. What worries the Man most is that he does not know if he is popping in and out of the past, dreaming the Woman up, or remembering that he really did meet her, and only now thinks of her. The ending is sudden, and memorable.

I forgot this was the basis for Terry Gilliam's best film but what stuck in my head was how this story could have been the Eric Bana point of view of ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" The Man wonders what the Woman must think as he randomly shows up to be with her. Thanks to the O.Henry-like story construction, omnipotent narration, and early 1960's black and white photography, I would compare this to a very good ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Aside from a few seconds of the Woman blinking, the film is all done with still-shot photography and voice over narration. While some of you might be reminded of film strips from your school days, the technique is easy to get used to, and serves as an oral history for the viewer, watching a glimpse of a future war. It is difficult to turn in a performance on what amounts to a series of photographs, but Hanich and Chatelain use their faces expertly. Writer/director Marker does not try to turn this into a science fiction epic, the war is hinted at and the time travel makes little sense. He does hold the viewer's interest by keeping the Man in the dark as well. As he discovers things, so do we. The finale is very sad and effective. I found the musical score a little too overwhelming here and there, but maybe we were experiencing the score based on the Man's reaction to falling in love with the Woman, and thereby sentimentalizing his feelings. ""La Jetée"" is a very strong short film, and it is easy to see why it was turned into the better Gilliam effort. In this rare case, I would have liked to see Marker expand on this sad vision of the world."

The Picture of Dorian Gray is directed by Albert Lewin, and he also adapts the screenplay from the novel written by Oscar Wilde. It stars Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lowell Gilmore, Richard Fraser and Douglas Walton. Music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr. 

Dorian Gray of Mayfair and Selby. 

Oscar Wilde's Faustian tale about a young Victorian gentleman who sells his soul to retain his youth is given a magnificent make-over by MGM. Pumping into it a budget reputedly of $2 million, the look and feel is perfect for this macabre observation of vanity, greed and self destruction. In many ways it's still an under valued movie, mainly because there will always be Wilde purists who think it lacks the writer's poetic spikiness, while horror fans quite often venture into the picture expecting some sort of violent classic ripe with sex, drugs and debauchery unbound. 

Lewin crafts his film in understated manner, never allowing the themes in the source material to become overblown just for dramatic purpose. He cloaks it all with an atmosphere of eeriness, thus keeping the debasing nature of Dorian Gray subdued. The horror aspects here mostly are implied or discussed in elegantly stated conversations, where the horror in fact is purely in the characterisation of Dorian himself. We really don't need to see actual things on screen, we are urged to be chilled to the marrow by his mere presence, and this works because Lewin has personalised us into this man's sinful descent by way of careful pacing and character formation. 

There are some jolt moments of course, notably the famous inserts of Technicolor into the black and white film, the impact of such bringing the portrait of the title thundering into our conscious. However, this is not about thrill rides and titillation, because the film, like its source, is intellectual. Lewin is aided considerably by Stradling's beautiful photography, which in turn either vividly realises the opulent abodes or darkens the dens of iniquities, so just like Lewin, Stradling and the art department work wonders and prove to be fine purveyors of their craft. 

Hatfield is wonderful, it's an inspired piece of casting, with his angular features and cold dead eyes, he effortlessly suggests the black heart now beating where once there was a soul. Yet even he, and the rest of the impressive cast, are trumped by Sanders as Lord Henry. Cynical, brutal yet rich with witticisms, in Sanders' excellent hands Lord Henry becomes the smiling devil like mentor perched on Dorian's shoulder. Dorian and Lord Henry are movie monsters, proof positive that not all monsters need to be seen hacking off limbs or drinking blood. In this case, the decaying of the soul is a far more terrifying experience.

""This is a story of our early America….of the century of conflict with French and Indians….when necessity made simple men, unknown to history, into giants in daring and endurance. It begins in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1759…."" 

Hurrah! What with the film having a reputation as one of the greatest adventure films of all time, that opening salvo for Vidor's movie doubly whets the appetite.What follows is more a case of a visually great picture, dotted with action, that is more about actual heroes than heroic deeds. Certainly the first hour of the picture leans more towards the slow burn than anything raising the pulse. However, characters are well drawn by Vidor and his team, with quality performances to match from the leads, and when the action dose come, such as the excellent battle at the Abenaki village, they more than pay back the patience of the viewer. We need to be forgiving for the overtly racist fervour that permeates the plot, so instead just rejoice in men triumphing over many obstacles, both of the mind and the body. 7/10"

If that battery is dead it'll have company.

White Heat is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted by Ivan Goff & Ben Roberts from a story suggested by Virginia Kellogg. It stars James Cagney, Virginia Mayo, Edmond O'Brien, Steve Cochran & Margaret Wycherly. Music is by Max Steiner and photography by Sidney Hickox.

Cody Jarrett (Cagney) is the sadistic leader of a violent and ruthless gang of thieves. Unnervingly devoted to his mother (Wycherly) and afflicted by terrible headaches since childhood, Cody is one bad day away from being a full blown psychotic. That day is coming soon, and everyone in his way is sure to pay.

Around the time of White Heat being released, two things were evident as regards its star and its themes. One is that it had been a long time since a gangster, and a truly vicious one at that, had thrilled or frightened a cinema audience. The Production Code and a change in emotional value due to World War II had seen the genuine career gangster all but disappear. Second thing of note is that Cagney was stung by the disappointing performance of Cagney Productions. So after having left Warner Brothers in 1942, the diminutive star re-signed for the studio and returned to the genre he had almost made his own in the 30s. He of course had some say in proceedings, such as urging the makers to ensure a crime does not pay motif, but all told he needed a hit and the fit with Raoul Walsh and the psychotic Jarrett was perfect. It may not be his best acting performance, but it's certainly his most potent and arguably it's the cream of the gangster genre crop.

The inspiration for the film is mostly agreed to be the real life criminals: Ma Barker, Arthur ""Doc"" Barker and Francis Crowley. A point of worth being that they were all 30s criminals since White Heat very much looks and feels like a 30s movie. Cagney for sure is older (he was 50 at the time) and more rotund, but he and the film have the presence and vibrancy respectively to keep it suitably in period and in the process becoming the last of its kind. White Heat is that rare old beast that manages to have a conventional action story at its core, yet still be unique in structure and portrayal of the lead character. Neatly crafted by Walsh around four Cody Jarrett ""moments"" of importance, the Oedipal tones playing out between Cody and his Ma make for an uneasy experience, but even then Walsh and the team pull a rabbit out the hat by still garnering sympathy for the crazed protagonist. It sounds nutty, but it really is one of the big reasons why White Heat is the great film that it is. Another reason of course is ""those"" special scenes, two of which are folklore cinematic legends now. Note legend number 1 as Cody, incarcerated, receives bad news, the reaction is at once terrifying and pitiful (note the extras reaction here since they didn't know what was coming). Legend number 2 comes with ""that"" ending, forever quotable and as octane ignited finale's go it takes some beating. 

As brilliant and memorable as Cagney is, it's not, however, a one man show. He's superbly directed by Walsh, with the great director maintaining a pace and rhythm to match Cody Jarrett's state of mind. And with Steiner (Angels With Dirty Faces/Casablanca/Key Largo) scoring with eerie strands and strains, and Hickox (The Big Sleep/To Have and Have Not) adding noir flourishes for realism and atmosphere, it's technically a very smart picture. The supporting cast in the face of Cagney's barnstorming come up with sterling work. Wycherly is glorious as the tough and tetchy Ma Jarrett and O'Brien is needed to be spot on in the film's second most important role; a role that calls for him to not only be the first man Cody has ever trusted, but also as some sort of weird surrogate mother! Mayo isn't called on to do much, but she's gorgeous and sexy and fatalistic in sheen. While Cochran holds his end up well as the right hand man getting ideas above his station.

White Heat is as tough as they come, a gritty pulsating psycho drama that has many visual delights and scenes that are still as powerful and as shocking some 60 odd years since it first hit the silver screen. What is often forgotten, when yet another clip of the brilliant ending is shown on TV, is that it's also a weird and snarky piece of film. All told, it is blisteringly hot. 10/10"

I've previously only watched the Disney animated film and the 2019 television miniseries with Guy Pearce. I also like both of those, they each have things that are inferior and superior to this 1951 film.

Alastair Sim is the best Ebenezer Scrooge of the three, I loved watching him from start-to-finish. Sim's facial expressions are terrific throughout, while his happiness later on is infectious. A top performance!

None of the others massively standout, unlike the aforementioned productions, but George Cole (young Scrooge) is pleasant, as are those who play the ghosts. Other positives include the score, the tension building and the arc of the lead character - given the fact that they make him horrid at the beginning.

The special effects haven't aged well, but that's to be very much expected almost seventy years on - in fairness, they look pretty good for '51. Elsewhere, I found that some of the camera shots are held for too long, while I also wanted more reactions of Sim when he was seeing the past/present/future - sometimes they chose to stick on the 'event', rather than showing Sim.

Those aren't major criticisms at all, just small ones. All in all, <em>'Scrooge'</em> is a very good film - one well worth a view! || I read a review by a critic which stated this is the best adaptation of the oh so familiar story of Charles Dickens’ Scrooge. Not because of advanced production value or cutting edge special effects. In fact, this movie is definitely low tech, being from 1952 as it is.

But now I agree with that assessment. There are three elements that in my mind elevate this production to the top of the pile.   The first is the setting and the mood of the film. This felt like Dickensian London to me, the rough streets and dense atmosphere through the fog and just the look of the people.

The story was also handled with a deft touch. It has been a long time since I have read the novella by Dickens, but this story felt closer to the original. I like the details they added sometimes when Scrooge was with the Christmas ghosts. For one example, when it showed the people selling Scrooge’s belongings, they spoke at some little length, about their lives and about Scrooge. And then later that scene illustrates how much Scrooge has altered, for he interacts with the woman he saw selling his curtains and gives her a raise.

Finally there is Alastair Sims as Scrooge. He gives a multi-layered performance I appreciated more and more as the story went on. He convinced me during his second ghost that he might want to change but probably wouldn’t. He wasn’t there yet and needed the third ghost to get him over the top. His final conversion felt convincing to me, the little and big laughs of his were evidence of a man who knew he had been spared a final tragic chapter in his and others’ lives. || Alastair Sim is in his element here as the curmudgeonly miser who routinely spends his Christmas alone counting his fortune. Luckily for him, ""Scrooge"" receives a visit from his late but not so lamented partner ""Marley"" (Michael Hordern) who warns him that he is to receive three visitors this cold and snowy Christmas morning. These ghosts are to show him was has happened, is happening and might well happen if he doesn't mend his venal and selfish ways. Meantime, in a hovel nearby his clerk ""Bob"" (Mervyn Johns) is celebrating with his wife and five children - including the enthusiastic but poorly ""Tim"" (Glen Dearman). As the dawn approaches, perhaps ""Scrooge"" can find salvation from the home truths being presented to him? This version tells us more of the establishment of the character, aided by a joyous contribution from Jack Warner as his mentor ""Jorkin"" and also allows the supporters more of a role. Kathleen Harrison and Miles Malleson provide some light relief as ""Scrooge"" really does come to realise the contempt and disdain in which he's held by just about everyone - rich or poor. It's Sim, though, who has the character almost perfectly set here. He positively exudes the humbuggery of the role, his facial expressions convey menace, horror, joy and mischief enjoyably and by the conclusion you really do sense that he enjoyed the part as much as I did. The production captures both the emotional and physical frostiness and brutality of the scenario and it really is a reminder of no man being an island - or at least being happy as one. I wouldn't say Sim was better at the role than Sir Seymour Hicks, but he's certainly just as good."

In truth it's all a bit too predictable, but never insultingly so, though research into the real exploits of the brave heroes involved reveals that Hollywood has, well, been Hollywood. Tech credits are a mixture of the brilliant and the poor, but when it involves the aerial sequences the film is stunning, and the makers do a sterling job of making ""Belle's"" final flight suspenseful and emotionally potent. 6.5/10"

Blah blah blah is the feelings I get when I see comments about this being McQueen's answer to The Hustler, the Newman film is firmly ensconced in the hall of classics and rightly so, but this is a different animal that stands up on its own two feet as a great film regardless of comparisons of leading men or films they respectively delivered.

""It's a pleasure to meet someone who understands that to the true gambler, money is never an end in itself, it's simply a tool, as a language is to thought""

Steve McQueen is The Cincinnati Kid of the title, a young man who has an enviable reputation as the pretender to the throne of the king stud poker player. Standing in his way of claiming the crown is the holder of said crown, Lancey ""The Man"" Howard (a wonderfully sedate yet dominant Edward G. Robinson), both men are in New Orleans for the big showdown across the card table.

The film does suffer slightly from a meandering script, though, because you can't help feeling that there is so much more to these characters that needed fleshing out before the big tense showdown arises. However, the cast and director manage to stere the film home with a glorious final third. Suspense and drama start to boil to the surface, the tight knit editing bringing claustrophobic clarity to the enormity of the game.

McQueen is perfect here, cocky and cool in equal measure, yet still infusing the role with stoic heart and honest endearment. Tuesday Weld & Ann-Margret are playing second fiddle in the acting stakes to a delightful turn from Joan Blondell (a little under used though), but both Weld and Margret bring their respective girls' traits to life, with Margret positively smouldering with femme fatale sex appeal. 

Karl Malden is solid and safe, whilst Rip Torn gives an acting lesson in dialogue driven menace. Yet in all honesty it's director Norman Jewison who has the trump card here. Once the game commences, even those who know nothing about a good game of poker are firmly watching every frame, such is the intense way that Jewison has brought the finale together.

No cop outs here, a film about egos, ambitions and personal satisfaction is gloriously laid out for a very enjoyable viewing experience. 8/10 "

The prison genre of film has a very chequered history, and the number of films are many, very much so, both good and bad. It has gotten to the stage where in this day and age we yearn and need more from our prison based films, something more substantial away from rape and violence, away from father figures, or of redemption and friendship bonds. Unfortunately Animal Factory relies on all the clichés of the genre to tell its tale, which is actually at odds with how good a film it is. Deftly performed by the principal cast members, mounted with a keen eye by director Steve Buscemi, and played with an authentic vibe that lures you in and keeps you hooked, but there is unfortunately nothing remotely new here. However, if you are not over familiar with the prison based arc of cinema? Then this delivers rewards, and such is the quality of production, it doesn't deserve to be marked down. 7/10 || Edward Furlong (""Ron"") gets a bit more than he bargained for when his ostensibly routine drugs bust turns into allegations of dealing and a five year stretch in the federal prison.

Fortunately, the experienced and disillusioned ""Earl"" (Willem Dafoe) takes pity on him, and with his protection the young man finds prison life a little more bearable until, he hopes, he can convince a judge that he is worthy of parole. I am afraid we have all seen this before and this iteration is no great shakes. The unremarkable supporting cast deliver the standard mix of recalcitrant characters with depictions of the usual issues of incarcerated racism, bigotry, homophobia - all topped off with a rather weak conclusion that was all just a bit too convenient for all concerned. At ninety minutes, it felt longer and neither the acting nor the dialogue do much to liven the thing up from it's rather ponderous pace nor to really authenticate the scenario. Steve Buscemi directed it, let's hope his next effort is less derivative."

Tod Browning's Freaks is as infamous today as it was back in the 30s when it shook film watchers to the core. Of course time has diluted some of its impact, you can imagine that a modern day horror fan drooling over torture porn et al being completely bemused by the reputation afforded Freaks. Yet it still remains a unique and nightmarish piece of film making, the sort of picture that if someone like David Lynch had made it in the modern era it would be heralded as a masterpiece of daring and genius like artistry.

Browning pulls us the viewers into this bizarre carnival society of oddities who are genuinely portrayed by real people. Their codes and ethics are laid bare, but not in some sort of yearning for sympathy, but in a factual way of life. Browning toys with his audience, planting suggestive images of sexual dalliances and role reversals, then he completely pulls the rug from under us to deliver his flip-flop finale. 

The messages aren't deep, but they need to be thought about. For even as the freaks of Browning's play terrifyingly pursue their quarry through the rain and mud, as the blood freezes and the macabre imagery strikes the senses, it would be a shame if themes such as love and loyalty be forgotten. 9/10 || If I have to be honest, I'd say that I have uncertain opinions concerning this film on the whole. On the one hand, I can't say that I didn't enjoy 'Freaks', mainly because of its nice display of bizarre cast members. On the other hand, I can't help feeling slightly at fault, considering that these were real people who probably suffered a lot in their lives because of their malformations, something they obviously couldn't help. Here's a movie that basically became popular precisely because it's about real life 'freaks' (?) and here's the audience that somehow takes pleasure from a film that consciously makes profit out of unfortunate human beings. Being aware of this, I can't lie and say that I didn't enjoy this movie, because… I honestly did!. I'm not going to say that 'Freaks' fascinated me because of the plot, or the locations or the unspoken moral, because even though all those things were fine too, I mostly wanted to see the film because of its characters, that's the reality. However, I suppose it is not so bad to enjoy this movie because of this reason, considering that these people actually agreed to appear in the movie and the fact that they appeared here, didn't make their lives any better or worse, so in the end… it's not really a crime, but I can't help having vague ideas about it. As the movie begins, we see a scrolling prologue, which pretty much encourages the audience to root for the side-show performers and incite us to feel terrible for them, since people with deformities has been always predestined to the most awful chastisements and degradations… which worked for me!. I felt really bad at first, but in the end, it was comprehensible that this film clearly tries to give a message in a far-reaching and yet hideously pleasurable approach. Therefore, my personal opinion, is that the title 'Freaks', doesn't necessarily have to be a reference to the side-show performers with malformations and perhaps, it may be an allusion to the fully grown characters who were the real freaks because of their wicked hearts.

In 'Freaks' the story revolves around a circus that offers all kinds of shows, including the exhibition of people with malformations as if they were exotic animals. Cleopatra, a beautiful and promiscuous trapeze artist from the circus, maliciously deceives an innocent midget named Hans and makes him believe that she is in love with him. On the other hand, Frieda, Hans' former fiancée, hopelessly tries to warn his beloved one and make him realize that Cleopatra is just making fun of him deliberately and that she's only with him because of his money. Ignoring Frieda's friendly warning, Hans eventually marries the trapeze artist, only to realize that she was indeed poking fun at him from the very beginning and that her only business with him is to poison him to inherit his wealth later. However, the rest of the side-show performers become aware of this and decide to rise up against the vicious Cleopatra and her lover Hercules.

Like I said, the film is remarkably engaging and regardless of the unassuming plot and the short duration, it still doesn't leave the audience with a feeling of disappointment. For the contrary, during that short hour and four minutes, the movie pretty much develops all the necessary conflicts, situations, beautiful music, nice scenarios and perfect interaction between the characters. Tod Browning managed to achieve a highly compelling drama flick with some of the finest and most atypical actors, who captivate the audience with their charm and innocence. Give this movie a chance and decide which ones are the real freaks and which ones aren't."

It's one of the most famous pieces of literature ever written, a genius piece of story telling from the trippy mind of Robert Louis Stevenson. That it has consistently been ripe for film and stage adaptations, and continues to be so since it first surfaced in written form in 1866, is testament to what a devilishly intelligent piece of work it is.

This 1931 version, directed by Rouben Mamoulian and staring Fredric March, may not be 100% faithful to the source, but it's arguably the finest adaptation to screen, led by a superb performance from March and featuring technical guile by Mamoulian and his team. It's wonderfully stylish, and coming as it did before the Hayes Code, it's sexy and dangerous, awash with terrifying cruelty, with the subversive and Freudian psychological beats making for a Gothic horror classic.

I forgot how well this movie holds up.  Now, I'm not a fan of Vince Vaughn or Ben Stiller (most of the time), but, being objective, this is a pretty funny movie with a good plot to it.  It has problems besides casting, but most of those are over in a blink and we're back to the movie.

This is a movie that leans on ridiculous humor, and everyone pretty much stays in their lane with quirks and motivations, and while the abuse humor of Justin Long pushes my boundaries of entertainment, Vaughn's lazy character work breaks it.  I'd say it was a problem with the writing, but the delivery is sloppy even for someone playing a lazy character: the character is someone who knows what needs to get done and can't be bothered to do work, not someone who is too lazy to do what he can do.  

Ben Stiller is over the top, but that's a combination of how the character is written and Stiller's delivery: I clearly don't like the character concept, but without him being an overly nice / secretly evil guy, I'm don't have a real suggestion there.

I'm sure you can make similar arguments for any given character, but the movie is actually so well produced, overall well written, and the performances are funny enough to distract from ""problems"" that if you just relax and watch this movie, you'll probably be laughing all the way up to ""My Milkshake By's All the Boys to the Yard"". || **Dodgeball knows it’s a ludicrous nonsensical laugh fest and embraces all its ridiculous charm to become one of the best sports comedies of all time.**

Dodgeball is one of the funniest, most outrageous movies in existence and is one of my favorite comedies (and sports movies?) of all time! This movie just had every actor in their sweet spot. White Goodman is peak Ben Stiller. Vaughn, Long, and Taylor each feel at home in their roles, and Alan Tudyk’s Steve the Pirate steals the scene every time. Each and every moment of this movie is zany, goofy, and insane, making Dodgeball a quintessential 2000s comedy. Dodgeball gifts the world with hilarious lines to be quoted repeatedly, Chuck Norris gifs, and laughs that keep going long after the movie ends. Plenty of people might disagree, but Dodgeball will forever be one of the best movies of the 2000s and maybe eternity… ok, let’s stick with the 2000s. || Ben Stiller's ""Goodman"" is the epitome of a big time corporate America obsessed with keeping the country fit. ""Peter"" (Vince Vaughn) is pretty much the opposite as his small time local gym is on the brink of collapse. If he can't find $50,000 in double quick time then it's curtains. The only way they can maybe raise the money is to win a dodgeball tournament but when ""Goodman"" discovers this plucky plan, he establishes a team of his own and battle lines are drawn. Of course one team has unlimited resources whilst the other can barely afford to turn the lights on. They do have a secret weapon though - and that's the legendary ""Patches O'Houlihan"" (Rip Torn) who agrees to come and turn his enthusiastic collection of misfits into a cohesive and winning unit. Now there's not the least jeopardy here: it's just a rehash of the David and Goliath story with some dangerous looking ball skills thrown in. Fans of Stiller will probably love it, but I never really was one of those. I found his style of comedy way too in-your-face and not in the least subtle and after a few games with this big red weapon of body-mass destruction, I got a bit bored. It's tempered with a tiny bit of romance thanks to ""Kate"" (Christine Taylor) who'd also like to see ""Goodman"" with some egg on his face but the predictability of the whole film made it quite a long ninety minutes for me with Vaughn adding little to enliven the proceedings. It's very quickly paced and is obviously trying to be screwball but once we've met the characters it just becomes too processional. Nah."

Tom Hanks is a perennial favourite in our house, and his 2004 movie _The Terminal_ is one that somehow I missed along the way. I’ve now fixed that and it’s time to talk about it. Let’s start with the official description:

_Victor Navorski is a man without a country; his plane took off just as a coup d’état exploded in his homeland, leaving it in a shambles, and now he’s stranded at Kennedy Airport, where he’s holding a passport that nobody recognises. While quarantined in the transit lounge until authorities can figure out what to do with him, Viktor simply goes on living - and courts romance with a beautiful flight attendant. _

A man stuck in an airport for months on end, sounds a little far fetched? Not so much - this was actually inspired by the true story of a man named Merhan Nasseri who lived at Charles DeGaulle Airport in France from August 1988 to August 2006, yes, 18 years. He got stuck when his refugee certification documents were stolen from him in France, en route from Belgium to England. It’s an incredible story, and worth reading up on on Wikipedia.

The movie is pretty light and fluffy stuff, and Hanks is well cast as the curious and friendly Navorski. He makes the most of his situation and quickly adapts to his circumstances, and makes a number of friends with various airport staff. He also makes an enemy in the character played by Stanley Tucci, the Customs Director at the airport. 

While at times it felt a bit like _Product Placement: The Movie_, it’s a charming movie that despite a few unrealistic - things like his rapid progress in a English - takes you along for a good fun ride. Hanks is great, his friends are a suitably quirky bunch, and Tucci plays the bad guy really well too. Catherine Zeta-Jones is in this too, but seems a little shoehorned in. There’s enough to work with with the “stuck in the airport” situation and didn’t really need a romantic plot line, but I guess these are the things that get done to make it appeal to a wider audience. 

It’s just been removed from the Netflix catalogue here in Australia - which was the reason I finally watched it - but if you happen to come across it, it’s a really nice film that will warm your heart for a couple of hours. || Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

I should be able to recommend this just based on ""Tom Hanks trapped in an airport"", especially given how popular ""Cast Away"" was.

I really love what they did with him being foreign and trap in an American airport, but being hard-working and intelligent.  I'm sure there is a ""Larry the Cable Guy"" version of this movie when it's a useless American trapped in another country that would be much funnier, but clearly a worse movie.

The progression of Hanks' character is wonderful, and while there are definitely components of this being a romantic movie, it is refreshing to see a movie that can hold the character's romantic motivations in parallel to the story's motivations and allow them to both be and be separate.

Stanley Tucci also does a great job, though its as a very unnecessary villain.  Yes, it's a guy doing his job, but the character is oddly motivated for someone trying to score a promotion: something they specifically point out in the movie.

My point is that not only it is a well-made, well-performed movie, but it manages to be something larger and highlights problems with us a humans, society and bureaucracy. || I may have watched The Terminal a while after it first came out, but I remembered no details, so I took the opportunity o watch it on Netflix recently. Whether or not I watched it before, I may not remember the details very well now either. It is a quiet movie with a slow moving plot. It stands in direct counterpoint to Spielberg’s Schindler’s List, which was slow moving in a way, but it had as a backdrop the murder of millions of people and one man’s character growth towards a time when he would try to save some of those lives. It’s quiet tone is interrupted by spurts of emotional and physical violence. The Terminal does not offer such exclamation points to add to suspense and tension.

That is not to say The Terminal is boring, though some may find it so. It is a character study of a man in limbo, neither in the United States nor able to leave it. He has left his country to go to New York City, and there is a coup back home, and since the United States does not recognize the new government, he is stuck in a section of JFK airport. The story is very loosely based on the story of an Iranian man. He was apparently paid to use his story, but they ended up only using the concept behind it.  

His situation reminded me of the short story I had to read back in junior high, The Man without a Country, written by Edward Everett Hale. It told the story of a fictional soldier who was charged with treason along with Aaron Burr, and who cursed the United States saying she wished he would never have to hear about the U.S. again. He was sentenced to live out his life on board various ships with nobody ever mentioning his country in his hearing again.

But back to the movie. The story is full of small moments showing **** adjusting to his limited new environment: trying to feed himself, helping a few others whether they want help or not, finding ways of amusing himself or keeping busy and, inevitably, slowing becoming involved with a flight attendant he sees often.

Most movies need a bad guy and, as if his situation wasn’t giving our hero enough headaches, the security head played by Stanley Tucci periodically plots to get our stranded traveler arrested so that huge will be relocated and therefore someone else’s problem. But I will let you discover all of the intricacies of the plot for yourself, as well as learn what is in the can of peanuts he carries around. In total The Terminal is a pleasant enough watch, but one perhaps you will want to watch while doing housework, or multitasking in some other way."

I've heard this film a long ago, but I never interested to watch it. We can't avoid them, because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion, they will pop-up and that is how I watched this now. I know it is a silly comedy, because in a real world this thing never happen. So knowing this is only for cinema, I prepared to enjoy whatever it offers. But I must say, even though my rating is not big, I kind of enjoyed it.

Nobody watches this without knowing its synopsis. So you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do. The rest is how it is developed; including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch. So much cliché, but entertaining with some good scenes and lines. The actors were excellent. The make-ups were not flawless, but worked okay, especially for a comedy. Because if there is an error, it will going to appeals from the comedic side.

So the overall film was better than what I presumed all these years. Glad I saw it, it's nothing like those silly comedies I've seen. I've seen many imposter themes, but this is refreshing. All the above, this is a one off film, that's the best thing about it. You know, sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios. Thanks for that, there's no follow-up for this with a B movie cast and crew. This is a very much watchable film, not comedy riot, but fairly does its job.

_6/10_ || Best movie ever. I mean does it get any better than this? Look I felt it was total metal. And I am a heavy metal maniac that gives everything 89/100. So there. Now there is comedy, there is suspense, there is disguise, there are trannys (or is it trannies here in Lithuania or whatever who knows?) and the movie addresses race relations which is very important because people pretend they are metal and still listen to f'n tarja, you know?
Bottom line: you will laugh,you will fall over, you will learn a lot and there are two hawt chicks. What else could you ask for? || ""White Chicks"" is a film that sparked mixed reactions due to its premise of black actors dressing up as white women, a concept that some found confusing and potentially controversial. Despite concerns about blackface and whiteface, the movie managed to navigate this sensitive territory at a time when such issues were not as heavily scrutinized, allowing it to avoid significant backlash.

The film's creative humor and unique concept contributed to its enduring popularity, with audiences still enjoying and quoting it years after its release. While the portrayal of black men disguised as white women may seem unrealistic due to the obvious nature of their disguises, the movie's over-the-top and comedic approach adds to its charm and entertainment value.

Ultimately, ""White Chicks"" is a lighthearted and cheesy comedy that aims to entertain rather than offend. Viewers are encouraged to approach the film with a sense of fun and appreciation for its playful and exaggerated take on gender and racial dynamics. By embracing the movie's humor and acknowledging its intentions, audiences can enjoy a comedic ride that offers a break from the seriousness of everyday life."

It's the delicate mechanics of the film that work best - James Garner (""Duke"") is reading a story to dementia suffered ""Allie"" (Gena Rowlands) about the shenanigans of a young couple in the 1940s without us necessarily realising how poignant and apposite his story is. Gradually we become more invested in their lives and as the story starts to knit together, we start to appreciate just how hard it can be for a couple where one has this most cruel of illnesses. Good performances all around, and from Joan Allen as her interfering mother make this an engaging drama with a sharp end! || Touching!

Despite evidently not watching this until today, I've always heard about the sad tag that many associate with <em>'The Notebook'</em> - and I can see why. Given I didn't know anything other than that, I was not anticipating how the film portrays its story - which is effective and rather heartbreaking. I'm not one to get properly emotional to movies, though hit the feels this one does still certainly do.

The film features impressive performances from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, as well as James Garner and Gena Rowlands. In smaller roles, Joan Allen and James Marsden are relatively solid too. If I had to nitpick, which it would very much be, I would've shortened the run time ever so slightly; could've been wrapped up quicker, but no biggie. || **_Love story in the 1940s near the coast of South Carolina_**

An aged man at a nursing home (James Garner) reads a romantic tale of two young lovers around the WW2 years (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) to a woman with dementia (Gena Rowlands). Sam Shepard plays the young man’s father while James Marsden is on hand as his competitor.

""The Notebook” (2004) comes in the tradition of romantic dramas like “Message in a Bottle,” “A River Runs through It” and “Legends of the Fall.” It may not be as good as “River,” but it’s not as contrived as “Message” and arguably on par with “Legends.” There are bits that also bring to mind two movies from 1991, “Paradise” and “The Man in the Moon.”

If you appreciate any of these flicks, you’ll probably like this one. Rachel is a highlight, naturally, and you can’t beat the 1940s milieu. The end goes on a little too long, however.

It runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot mostly on location in the greater Charleston area, as well just outside Montreal for the wintery battlefield sequence and Los Angeles for the rocky beach scene.

There’s some thought gone into the script and the plot here, and though I felt the acting all a bit flat, it still manages to use it’s visual effects imaginatively as it supposes just how time travel might occur and at how it might impact on two young men who had rarely ever left home. There’s a little bit of romance for “David” with the helpfully gullible “Allison” (Nancy Allen) and also just an hint of plausible science that attempts to visualise just how it all might have worked, as opposed to some “TARDIS” style arrangement where you just change the scenery.

Sex with his pal “Lily” (Marion Cotillard) and his licence to drive a taxi. Then his phone reminds him that to achieve the latter he will have to, temporarily he hopes, forgo the former and get to the licensing centre. By way of some celebratory foolishness, though, he doesn’t have it long as he drives his cab like he rides his bike, and the local constabulary aren’t so impressed. Luckily, it’s the pretty hapless “Émilien” (Frédéric Diefenthal) who apprehends him and he has bigger fish to fry with some elusive bank robbers. He reckons he can use his new friend’s driving skills and intimate knowledge of the city to help him track the criminals down (he can’t actually drive!) and so now an unlikely pairing is born. Luc Besson has crafted an entertaining movie here that is a spoof of just about every cop/buddy-cum-heist film you’ve ever seen and for the most part it works. There is plenty of action on the streets, but there’s also some good fun to be had as the bromance develops and it soon becomes clear that “Daniel” would make a far better gendarme than “Émilien” ever would. Add to the mix the latter man’s frustrated affection for his colleague “Petra” (Emma Wiklund) and his ineptness seems to know few bounds. Both Naceri and Diefenthal work well together presenting an engaging, borderline slapstick, comedy that ends with an enjoyably high-octane homage to the “Italian Job” (1969) before scenes that might hint sequel!

This has plenty of traditional comedy stunts, a dynamited dam and slapstick fisticuffs but it's the trains that steal it for me. There are an astonishing, and entertaining, selection of contraptions that run on rails here for Keaton to use for travel and to maybe even escape his pursuers. People sedately seated in carriages filled with black smoke does raise a smile. The story itself does run a little too much to melodrama for me at times - but that was perhaps not helped by the rather soporific accompaniment that let it drag a bit.

They function as a team because they shouldn't - and that is where much of the humour and the potency of the drama comes from. The animation is stylish and the hues and shades are particularly effective at illustrating their environment and at complimenting the humorous elements of their detective work.

A constant in all these machinations is her butler-cum-confidante ""Clancy"" (Charles Bickford) who has worked for the family all of his life, earned a position of considerable trust and influence, and like his boss becomes concerned that the fight isn't being fought fairly and in the best interests of the community. It's a little reminiscent of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939) in that it shows a plucky, if naive, young person determined to try and make a change in a political world stacked in favour of the vested interests, but that aspect of the plot isn't really brought home so much as the increasingly romantic elements of her relationship with ""Glenn"". It's more Barrymore and Bickford who inject a sense of power into the thing whilst the enamoured couple try to get their act together.

It is priceless to watch the Goldie Hawk character go from snooty, haughty rich bitch, to a sensitive self-deprecating amnesiac mom who is not cut out for motherhood and in over her head.  What she learns about herself doesn’t come from her memory, but from what the Kurt Russell character relates to her, so she hears how she had sex with him their first date and she says, “I’m a slut.” Sexist, of course, but at least she is saying it about herself, and she does come through for her ‘family’ in the end.

Five strangers on board a train and are joined by the mysterious Dr Shreck, he's a fortune teller and offers to read their Tarot cards.

Five men, five stories, Werewolf, The Creeping Vine, Voodoo, Disembodied Hand & Vampire. Dr. Terror's House Of Horrors is one of those films that had a big impact on me as a child. When it was shown on British TV, the next day in the play ground would be kids talking about it, well those kids (un)lucky enough to have parents who would let them watch it that is! I finally got to see it one night in the 70s when my parents were out, I can even remember the time and channel it was shown on, in fact I can still remember now the feeling of dread that took over me as Christopher Lee is pursued by a severed hand, checking under my bed before turning the lights off.

Now that's the beauty of horror films isn't it? Sure enough this Amicus compendium looks a trifle clunky now, but really we shouldn't be judging it by a new age standard, we should be judging it by the 1965 time frame and embracing the totally creepy vibe that infiltrates this particular railway carriage. The Werewolf and Disembodied Hand segments are great pieces of horror, while the others make up for in style what they lack in genuine horror. Peter Cushing, Alan Freeman, Roy Castle, Donald Sutherland, Kenny Lynch, Bernard Lee and of course the irrepressible Christopher Lee, I thank you all for leaving an indelible mark on me as a youth, it's a mark that I proudly wear to this everlasting day! 8/10  || Peter Cushing is spookily menacing here as ""Dr. Schreck"" who joins a group of passengers on a late night train journey where he offers to read their tarot cards. Despite the sceptical objections of fellow traveller Christopher Lee (""Marsh"") he proceeds to read to each fellow passenger a future full of, well, terror... The film acts out each scenario as depicted by the doctor's tales in graphic, gory - though, it has to be said not very scary, detail. The supporting cast deliver these well - especially Phoebe Nicholls and Bernard Lee; Roy Castle not so much.

The Last Starfighter is directed by Nick Castle and written by Jonathan R. Betuel. It stars Lance Guest, Robert Preston, Catherine Mary Stewart, Dan O'Herlihy and Norman Snow. Music is by Craig Safan and cinematography by King Baggot. Story sees Guest as Alex Rogan, an everyday teenage boy who upon breaking the high-score record on a trailer park arcade game, suddenly finds himself recruited by an alien defence unit to fight an evil army out in space. 

The advancements of computers and all their devilish electronic off shoots have rendered many of the pioneering effects films of yesteryear as rudimentary antiques. Where once films like ""Tron"" and ""The Last Starfighter"" blazed the trail that many would follow over the years, now they seem, if you believe the multitude of new era reviews for them, to hold only nostalgia value to video game players who were still at school in the early 1980's. That's something of a disservice, for although they do indeed rely in the main on effects work and razz dazzle 80's credibility, the stories are enjoyably fantastical and not without thought and merit. 

The Last Starfighter is one of the better ones because it manages to be both an exciting and sweet picture, one that is completely disarming. Certainly it marries Spielberg homespun values with George Lucas operatics, but in the form of its teen protagonist it also dots the fantasy canvas with angsty worth. So much so that now when one revisits the film with older eyes, we can appreciate more fully that young Alex is in a rut, the crossroads of his life, a life he's struggling to make sense of. Also more appreciation can now be made of the relationship Alex has with Grig (O'Herlihy), his flight navigator up in the galaxy, someone whom he calls a Gung-Ho iguana! This relationship is nicely drawn, here is where Alex finds not only his friend, but also his father figure, something he doesn't have the privilege of down on Earth.

Whilst up there fighting an intergalactic battle, Alex on Earth has been replaced by a Replicant Beta Model to ensure he is not missed. Here is where much of the film's fun is gleaned from. Interesting to note that originally this arc in the film wasn't to be that huge, but test screenings encouraged director Castle into a rethink. And the film is the better for it as the Beta tries to keep the flame going with the girlfriend (Stewart adorable girl next door type) and ensure he's not found out by any Ko-Dan spies! Here Guest earns his corn, it's a very good duel performance from the youngster and it's a shame his career never really took off post the film's release. 

However, none of this means the film is full of depth, it still remains a very simple story full of fantastical incredulity. But the underlying message of improving oneself, not settling for second best, is rich and puts some potency in the narrative. Still, it's safe to say that most tuning into The Last Starfighter want whizz bang space adventure frolics, which thankfully we do get. The effects are of course variable, though not as cheap looking in High Definition as one expected, while the action is nicely constructed by Castle and his team. The villains led by a Po-faced Norman Snow make their mark, while Robert Preston, a legend to Western and film noir fans in the 40's and 50's, gives a wonderfully sweet and affecting turn as Centauri, the game inventor who whisks Alex away to the planet Rylos for his life changing challenge. 

More than just a film for nostalgists and gamer types, Last Starfighter is pretty solid entertainment from its core to the outer layers. 7/10 || Didn't grow up watching this, though sort of heard of it over the years, but gave it a watch and immensely liked it, even with the cheesy game-like graphics/effects. Lots of fun and liked the lead actor, Lance Guest. Definitely has some replay value down the road. **3.75/5** || **Overall, it's a decent movie, if not a very good one.**

There is no doubt that, if there is something that marked sci-fi in the 80s, it was arcade games and the popularization of information technology and the personal computer, with the potential that this allowed in everyone's life. However, I have some doubts about the quality of the films it spawned.

In this case, the film begins by showing us a young teenager addicted to a gaming machine who, after beating the last levels of the game, is taken in a futuristic car by a stranger to discover that everything the machine showed was real, and it was in reality true training to find and recruit space pilots for a war in a faraway galaxy, in the best “Star Wars” style. Of course, the movie also has a hormone-filled romance in the middle.

Upon seeing the film, I was a little skeptical about the script and its verisimilitude, but after a bit of reading, I came to discover that, nowadays, there are a lot of digital military systems, and even weaponry, that are made in such a way that be more easily controlled by soldiers who have already had some contact with computer games, and have some dexterity with this type of entertainment. This is something quite ingenious, and also perverse, on equal measures: ingenious because of their pragmaticism, perverse because it puts ""innocent"" video games on an equal footing with real weapons, which destroy and kill real people. Philosophies aside, the film seems to me more accessible and more interesting than others of the same genre and from the same era. The script isn't particularly clever, and it's not difficult to predict the course of events, but it does things reasonably effectively.

The cast is not the strong point of the film. We don't have any major actors involved here, and the whole movie looks like it was made with fairly amateur actors. Lance Guest was credible in the role of the hero, and he does what he needs to, but without great competence and in a relatively weak way. Robert Preston is a little better, but he doesn't have much to do other than be the movie's Yoda. Catherine Mary Stewart appears simply because someone thought the hero had to have a minimally attractive girlfriend.

Technically, the film bets heavily on cinematography, which is reasonably well done, and on good visual and sound effects, which do their job well and look realistic, even if they are a huge distance from what we can do today, which makes the film quite dated but still nice."

Tragically I am a Batman. An obsessive Caped Crusader comic-book collector until 1972 when my evil mother tossed the entire bunch in the garbage. My cousin was Spider-man. His noble mother preserved his collection with plastic envelopes and to this day they remain in pristine condition. 

What's truly tragic about being a Batman is that, despite Nolan's recent attempts (and questionable sincerity), the best Batman movie hasn't been made yet. As far as we know, with Batman's fate resting with Warner Bros, David Goyer, Zak Snider and Ben Affleck, the best Batman movie will not be possible for another decade or two, maybe three. I await thee Dark Knight.

Again to my cousin's good fortune, the best movie about Spider-man has been established for quite some time. In fact, as a benchmark, it is arguably the best comic-book super-hero movie ever made. I didn't much love Sam Raimi's first Spider-man, and wished my mother could have disposed of his last entry, but _Spider-Man 2_ was, and is, the ultimate movie adaptation from comic-books to the movie screen. 

I was living in Shanghai in the summer of 2004 where I had to commute 3 hours on a hot and dizzy day to see it in English, and was fully rewarded for the effort. I was thrust into a imaginary super-hero world far more pleasing than anything I could remember since childhood. The 3 hour commute back home seemed like a breeze because Spider-man 2 awoke the wonder-struck boy inside me. It reminded me of a happy youth I forgot I had. It felt like Spidey was on the subway with me and would protect me from any harm. And he was just a boy himself! Batman? Who's that?

For a super-hero story, nearly everything is perfect in this movie. Doc Ock couldn't have been better. He looked exactly the way he did, at the height of Stan Lee's eminence, in the brightly coloured panels fighting Spider-man in 1968. And sounded just like I imagined he would. Peter and Mary Jane were in their element and their friendship and romantic undertaking actually mattered. The story and action played out the way a comic book should. It was both intimate and fantastic. Trippy, wonderful and scary. It was like growing up all over again. The climax was a bit too flashy, loud and over-the-top at that time, but by today's standards, when compared to climactic train-wrecks in _Man of Steel_, _Iron Man 3_ and _The Avengers_, it's perfectly splendid.

We are now being helplessly bombarded with comic book movies attacking us from every direction, all of them trying to out-do each other, jumping one shark after another. Every marginal superhero from Dr Strange to Shazam is being dusted off and hurled onto the big screen for our insatiable happy-childhood-appeasing appetite. The Marvel of Disney is launching at us one theme-park roller-coaster ride after another. Sony, with their Amazing Spider-man abominations, has completely lost it. Fox's X-Men and Fantastic Four proliferations hit the wall long ago. And DC, under the reigns of Warner Bros, has transfigured into its own worst enemy. A wretched mutation not even the Joker finds amusing.

Turns out Sam Raimi's _Spider-Man 2_ is the gold standard by which all comic-book movies, certainly those of the super-hero variety, are and, evidently, will be set. Lucky cousin. || I don't think anyone can review this movie better than what Roger Ebert said about it back in 2004: ""It's a real movie, full-blooded and smart, with qualities even for those who have no idea who Stan Lee is. It's a superhero movie for people who don't go to superhero movies, and for those who do, it's the one they've been yearning for.""

I also don't think any film has so eloquently defined a hero the way Aunt May does in a wonderfully heartfelt and poignant scene half way through the film.

I do think the villain of Doctor Octopus is underdeveloped in both logic and motivation (although Alfred Molina is great), Mary Jane Watson is too dependent on the men in her life, and the friendship arc between Peter and Harry is a bit contrived, but none of these flaws affect what is otherwise a beautifully constructed film and a worthy sequel to the original. || Sony did a great job of focusing on what really matters in this movie - the character. Here we see a relatable Peter Parker who can't seem to catch a break and when he does it just feels so satisfying to watch him rise up from all the challenges he faced."

While Duff's portrayal alongside Chad Michael Murray brought a modern twist to the classic tale of Cinderella, subsequent installments in the franchise have failed to live up to the same standard.

The franchise seems to be struggling to recapture the magic of the original film, instead resorting to unnecessary side stories and deviations from the core Cinderella narrative. It appears that attempts to replicate the success of the Walt Disney and Roger and Hammerstein versions have fallen short, leading to a sense of fatigue and irrelevance surrounding the franchise.

Despite the star power of Selena Gomez in ""Another Cinderella Story,"" the film failed to reach the heights set by Hilary Duff's portrayal. Similarly, Lucy Hale's ""A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song"" was criticized for its lackluster execution and departure from the essence of the Cinderella story.

""Sofia Carson's ""A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits"" attempted to capitalize on dance elements reminiscent of ""Grease,"" but ultimately fell flat, marking a low point in the franchise. Laura Marano's ""A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish"" was deemed the weakest link in the series, solidifying the downward trend in quality.

As the franchise continues with new installments, the lackluster reception of recent films has dampened enthusiasm for further entries in the series. Viewers may find it challenging to engage with future releases given the disappointing trajectory of the franchise."

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || I'll never forget the iced-held river scene. At least I've watched it ten times.Clive Owen and Keira Knightley are my favorites. || Clive Owen is the eponymous leader of a cohort of the Sarmatian cavalry - on their last mission after a 15 year attachment to the now retreating Roman army. This mission requires them to head to the northern reaches of Britain - beyond Hadrian's wall - to rescue a family whose teenage son is a favoured godson of the Pope. The Saxons are menacingly poised above the wall, heading south and Merlin's Woads are all around, seemingly quite content to let the Romans and the Saxons sort it out between themselves and then take the prize from the weakened victors. This is an ok adventure yarn with a decent cast of British stalwarts - Ioan Gruffudd, Ray Winstone, Joel Edgerton and Hugh Dancy amongst his comrades, as well as Mads Mikkelsen and his hawk all trekking the country fighting as they go. The photography is good, and the battle scenes - especially on the frozen lake is also quite effective. Sadly, though the lead acting is really lacklustre. Clive Owen, Ray Winstone (with his baby's arm holding an apple) and Saxon chief Stellan Skarsgård are all really poor - with very little by way of decent dialogue to help them out either. Keira Knightley turns out to be quite proficient with an arrow but otherwise very little of this is on target. Despite a nice bit of singing from Lisa Gerrard, I cannot imagine this got a cinema release - but it just about kills an overlong two hours on the telly if it's wet outside."
2048.0,"I, Robot","In 2035, where robots are commonplace and abide by the three laws of robotics, a technophobic cop investigates an apparent suicide.

I, Robot has a fan base that I'm glad to say has kept this film from drifting down into the depths of bad blockbuster sci-fi ratingville. I remember upon the film's release how so many people were wary of if Will Smith could carry the film? The concerns from Isaac Asimov's fans about a sacrilegious take on his legacy etc etc. Truth is is that I, Robot is an amalgamation of sci-fi ideas, from the suggestion of Asimov to the novel of the same name from Eando Binder, it's a mix that ultimately gives us a cop versus sci-fi conspiracy picture, that is sure as hell entertaining if taken on popcorn terms.

Having just watched this again for the first time in a year or so, I found that it still hits the mark to me as a real tidy genre piece with a solid heart beat to keep it thought provoking. A futuristic mystery is smartly realised by Alex Proyas' directing in the manner befitting the subject, and of course Will Smith handles the entertaining action lead role with much ease. However, the main triumph (outside of the story) is Alan Tudyk as our computer generated protagonist Sonny, the voice and humanist movements are brilliantly brought to life by him and it's a real pleasure to observe.

Great visuals (Oscar nominated), top story, kinetic action, better than average acting (though Bridget Moynahan struggles to convince as a boffin at times), and we get a perfect nights entertainment for someone looking for a rental that safely delivers what it says on the robotic shaped tin. 7.5/10 || Will Smith does paranoid and grumpy, and he does it very well. But then he does pretty much every role he plays very well. A vision of the future we're all expecting to happen, and the only nice people are robots. || Will Smith is a cop who detests artificial intelligence with a vengeance; despite the fact that he has a substantial part of his body made up of enhanced prosthetics after a car accident. When an executive from the world's largest robot production company commits suicide, he has to investigate and soon discovers a plot to take subjugate humanity. ""I Robot"" is a clever exposé on how AI could take over the world; largely by capitalising on the indifference of people, our obsession with convenience and reliance on technology. Smith and Bridget Moynahan - and Alan Tudyk as ""Sonny"" a rogue robot designed to reveal the plot - turn in good fun performances as we try to stop the robot revolution. It's quite a well written, stylishly presented and pacily directed couple of hours."

The Bourne Supremacy takes Bourne to new heights with bigger set pieces and effects as well as new depths by exploring more of Bourne’s mysterious past and trauma. The action in Supremacy is cranked up with a larger budget allowing more exciting sequences with multiple car chases, explosions, and hand-to-hand fights. This sequel also highlights Bourne’s spy craft and skills at infiltrating. He pieces the clues of a mystery together by stealing information, flipping sources, creating new contacts, tapping phone lines, and more. In addition, matt Damon shows more of Bourne’s struggle and agony in this film as he discovers more about his past and is disgusted with his past misdeeds resulting in a quest for some sort of redemption. The Bourne Supremacy takes everything from the action to the storytelling to the next level with that sequel that, in my opinion, is the best of the franchise. || ""Jason Bourne"" (Matt Damon) lives quietly with girlfriend ""Marie"" (Franka Potente) until a CIA-Russian deal goes wrong, their safety is compromised and after moving around from pillar to post trying to stay one step ahead of their pursuers - tragedy ensues. All of which drives the highly trained assassin to the conclusion that the CIA have screwed up his life for the last time - and he sets out for answers, and revenge! It hasn't quite the style of the first film, but as sequels go it's a strong, gripping effort with Brian Cox reprising his role as ""Ward Abbott"" and Joan Allen entering the fray as the CIA Deputy Director ""Landy"" who sees ""Bourne"" as a lethal threat who must be apprehended and/or eliminated at all costs. As with the first film, the story sticks closely to Robert Ludlum's book and Paul Greengrass picks up well from Doug Liman with a pacy and exciting story of betrayal and manipulation. Great stuff."

Previously, I had really enjoyed Buster Crabbe's presence in the post-Weissmuller era of Tarzan, and I have had the DVD of Hodges' 1980 'Flash Gordon' for eons, but wanted to first get to the root of the phenomenon by checking out the serials. Fortunately, in purchasing a 50-film pack, 'Nightmare Worlds' from Mill Creek, it was included.

The 12 episodes of the 220-minute serial were well-edited into the fine flow that this version I saw had, and the special effects and production values were quite decent--you could tell it had been made both by a high-quality studio, in Universal, and by directors quite used to the serial format, in Ford Beebe and Ray Taylor.

There are some goofs (for example, when Ming's henchmen are looking at a mountainside for the four protagonists, and five are shown), but it's action-packed, with interestingly stylized wipe-edits, and I can see how it later influenced the likes of both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.

Essential for any fan of the genre, and worth both purchasing and rewatching if you, like me, are a work of a remarkable director at the pinnacle of his profession."

His prognosis is not very good, but he is determined not to succumb to the fear and intimidation of his oppressors. One night in his cell, he observes that the door that holds him is made of oak and other, softer wood - can he find a way to escape before he faces the inevitable firing squad? It's the meticulous pace of this that is really effective. Leterrier is super as we, the audience, feel like we are sharing his daily risks. Day to day, never knowing whether he will survive. Surrounded by fellow inmates who may (or may not) be trustworthy. When he is unexpectedly saddled with a room-mate his choices and options become limited and imperative - and right to the very end, we are never quite certain as to what the denouement may bring. Mozart could never have imagined that his ""Kyrie"" and his ""Agnus Dei"" pieces could ever have been used to such chilling effects and the whole film just reeks of peril and authenticity right from the start.

I know I did many (many) years ago, but I recently had a chance to watch it again. It was worth the time. It features Cary Grant and Myrna Loy doing what they do best. He is a wisecracking husband and father who seems smart at times, but slightly daft at other times. He loves his wife and kids, but gives them a hard time when things go the wrong way. But not in a modern hurtful way. Myrna I remember easily from the Thin Man films and she is a natural at this. She deadpans a lot of her lines, but check out her facial expressions. She accomplishes a lot without seeming to try. Some of the situations are predictable, but often I found myself laughing even when I had a good idea what was coming. It is very well-written.

When there are more sick ones than well ones, the sick ones will lock the well ones up.

The Snake Pit is directed by Anatole Litvak and adapted to screenplay by Frank Partos, Millen Brand and Arthur Laurents from the novel written by Mary Jane Ward. It stars Olivia de Havilland, Mark Stevens, Leo Genn, Celeste Holm, Glenn Langan, Helen Craig, Leif Erickson and Beulah Bondi. Music is by Alfred Newman and cinematography by Leo Tover.

Olivia de Havilland plays Virginia Stuart Cunningham, and film chronicles Virgina's time and treatment in the Juniper Hill Mental Institution.

""It was strange, here I was among all those people, and at the same time I felt as if I were looking at them from some place far away, the whole place seemed to me like a deep hole and the people down in it like strange animals, like... like snakes, and I've been thrown into it... yes... as though... as though I were in a snake pit...""

It's still today one of the most potent and important screen explorations of mental illness and its treatment. Backed by an astonishing performance by de Havilland, Litvak and an initially sceptical Darryl F. Zanuck (20th Century Fox supremo), led the way in bringing to the masses the subject and to treat it with stark realism. Quite often it's harrowing as entertainment, with Virgina's fractured mind laid bare under duress of treatments now seen as antiquated.

It's true enough to say that some of the story features simplistic motives and means, these come as a product of the time the picture was made. But with Litvak (Sorry, Wrong Number) and his principal crew members researching the subject thoroughly, the end result is an incredible blend of dramatic heartfelt suspense and rays of humanistic hope. As Virginia weaves her way through this maze of psychological discord, with flashbacks constantly adding layers to the character's make up, Litvak presents a fascinating portrait of asylum life and the people who resided there, both as patients and staff.

Some scenes are brilliantly crafted, either as visual expansions of the story or as shards of light in a dark world. One sequence sees Litvak track ""dancing"" silhouettes on a wall, and to then do a pull away shot upwards to reveal Virginia in the snake pit, the impact is stark in its magnificence. Another sequence takes place at a dance for the patients, where a rendition of Antonín Dvorák's ""Goin' Home"" turns into something quite beautiful, a unison of profound optimism that strikes the heart like the calm after a storm.

Leo Tover's (The Day The Earth Stood Still) crisp black and white photography is perfectly in sync with the material, and Newman's (Wuthering Heights) magnificent score bounces around the institution like a spectral observer. With de Havilland doing her tour de force, it could be easy to forget the great work of Genn and Stevens, the former is a bastion of assured calmness as Dr. Mark Kik, the latter as Virgina's husband Robert underplays it to perfection and he gives us a character to root for wholesale.

It has to be viewed in the context of the era it was made, but its influence on future movies and awareness of mental health treatments in the real world should not be understated. A brilliant production that demands to be seen. 9/10"

It's an adequate story this, with decent enough effects and plenty of dog-fights, but the attempts to drag these characters into the 1980s has only limited success. What works about the characters in the books seems almost parodied here, and despite a scene in a nunnery where the young ""Jim"" simply refuses to be parted from his ultra-velcro'd skimpy towel, the rest of the film is pretty unremarkable. I think it most unlikely that these stories will ever see the light of day now - they are hardly politically correct even in the most tolerant of households, so it is a bit of shame that this bland effort will be his only cinema outing.

I believe that all the girls would love this movie  ♡ || Jean-Luc Godard's first two films (<i>À bout de souffle</i> and <i>Le petit soldat</i>) were thrillers that drew inspiration from American noir, but <i>Une femme est une femme</i> (A Woman is a Woman, 1961) shifts gears drastically to a riff on American musical comedies, with the characters occasionally singing and dancing, and the camera jumping between realistic depictions and these musical interludes. But as one of the seminal figures of the French New Wave with its desire to shake up conventions, Godard added some elements of his own. As the film opens, the soundtrack keeps cutting abruptly in and out, an aural equivalent of the unsettling jump cuts with which he started his career. There are allusions to his earlier films and to his New Wave peers, and just a touch of sarcastic allusions to French political tensions.

The plot is fairly simple: cabaret dancer Angela (Anna Karina), who is clearly not looking to buck any traditional sex roles in an age of dawning feminism, wants a baby. Unable to get it from her partner Émile (Jean-Claude Brialy), she gradually welcomes the advances of Émile's best friend Alfred (Jean-Paul Belmondo). The way in which this triangle ultimately works out is a little surprising considering that it was made in 1961. The most appropriate adjective overall for this film is ""cute"". The characters spend a lot of time bickering, but always with witty ripostes. Karina here is not yet the great actress of later roles, and Godard uses her instead as essentially a Barbie doll (nice to look at, not much there), but it works well enough for this particular story. The film was shot with no fixed script, and while it's not a free-for-all, there are clearly improvisational elements here that only add to the film's charm, such as the characters' encounters with everyday Parisians in street scenes. || Jean-Luc Godard's first two films (<i>À bout de souffle</i> and <i>Le petit soldat</i>) were thrillers that drew inspiration from American noir, but <i>Une femme est une femme</i> (A Woman is a Woman, 1961) shifts gears drastically to a riff on American musical comedies, with the characters occasionally singing and dancing, and the camera jumping between realistic depictions and these musical interludes.

Sophia Loren is the woman and Marcello Mastroianni the man and the results of these three short scenarios are really quite funny. The first sees her as ""Adelina"", married to the jobless ""Carmine"" and reduced to selling illicit cigarettes on the street whilst doing her best Queen Anne impersonation of being eternally pregnant. Why? Well she has discovered that so long as she is expecting she is pretty much untouchable by the carabinieri - and boy can she exploit that loophole, much to the exhaustion of her poor, and penniless, husband. Next she is ""Anna"" - the bored wife of a successful Brussels bureaucrat who takes struggling artist ""Renzo"" on a trip in her Rolls Royce - which he duly prangs. Let's just say - she doesn't exactly hang around to help with the tyre change. Finally, my favourite of the triptych. She is ""Mara"" - a lady who likes to entertain fine gentlemen in her apartment. One afternoon she espies some young eyes watching her from the neighbouring apartment. Dressed only in a sheet she flirts a little, only to discover that when he walks into view, he is a priest. ""Umberto"" (Gianni Ridolfi) looks like butter wouldn't melt but is immediately smitten by this sophisticated woman, much to the furious annoyance of his grandmother (Tina Pica) and to her travelling date ""Augusto"" (MM). When the young man declares a change of heart on his life of religious observance, the three adults have to find a way of putting him back on his true path - but will they manage? The central feature is just a little short, the first maybe a touch too long - it does (no pun intended) rather labour the joke, but the concluding part is funny with the accumulating chemistry between the two stars and the savvy Pica working well to finish off a story of mischief in which it's usually Loren who pulls the strings. Mastroianni is very natural here and I couldn't help but feel sorry for him as he seemed to end up out-manoeuvred however he played his cards. It's got a jolly Trovajoli score that substitutes quite nicely for dialogue some of the time, and is really one of De Sica's easier films to sort of glide through, enjoyably."

All the while, though, we are aware that this epitome of deportment has a bit of a past with the roguish arts master “Lloyd” (Robert Stephens) and is currently keeping the shy “Lowther” (Gordon Jackson) company on their frequent weekend visits to his ancestral Cramond estate on the Firth. She is rather effortlessly coasting through life, believing herself invulnerably perfect as she manoeuvres her favourites as if they were porcelain chess pieces. One of them, though, isn’t so happy being the pawn and in the best spirit of the worm that turned, could maybe bring this whole glass edifice crashing about their mentor’s ears. As “Miss Brodie” herself puts it, this is very much a story of “do as I say, not as I do” and Maggie Smith is super in the role. Her perfect attire, posture and clipped accent all work really well but so does her frustrated sexually charged rapport with Stephens whose own performance as the seedy but probably a great deal more honest philandering father of six also manages to get your skin crawling. Much as he was back in 1949 in “Whisky Galore”, Gordon Jackson also shines as the rather meek and feeble ditherer and I often think that Johnson maybe watched a cobra a few times to get ideas for her own character - one desperate to see the end of what she saw as a toxic influence. The original novel has been adapted so as to reduce some of the free kirk mentality but it’s still quite a potent tale of idolisation, indoctrination and hypocrisy that Ronald Neame has structured to allow Smith and Stephens to own as the girls to share the limelight and we do a fair degree of squirming.

So says the icy cold broken wrist killer!

Phillip Raven is a hit man of no obvious moral fibre, he literally will kill anyone for the right price. After fulfilling a contract for the chocolate munching Willard Gates, he finds himself pursued by the law on account that he was paid by Gates with stolen money. Raven sets out for the ultimate revenge and dovetailing towards the explosive finale with him is sultry conjurer Ellen Graham and honest cop Michael Crane.

Based on the Graham Greene novel ""A Gun For Sale"", this is not a straight out adaptation, the plot has been re-jigged with very impressive results. The most enlightening thing I found when reading up on the film was that the studio were so blown away by the efforts of Alan Ladd as Raven, they turned the script around to make him the film's chief axis, and boy what a smart move that was for this is Alan Ladd's show all the way.

Ladd plays Raven with brilliant icy veneer, he's cold and devoid of emotion, his only trip to anything resembling caring is an affinity to cats - because in his own words, ""cats don't need anyone, they are on their own, just like me"", the result is one of the most unnerving killers put on to the 40s cinema screens. Veronica Lake is the stunning female of the piece, she glides through the picture with ease as Ellen, a character with her own issues, but thankfully she's integral outside of any sort of romantic plot, even though she is the only one who gets close enough to Raven to learn anything about what makes him tick. 

Robert Preston as Michael Crane was to be the pics focus but he becomes a mere side part thanks to Ladd's barnstorming show, and unsurprisingly Laird Cregar is suitably shifty as Gates. It's a fine film in its own right, it's tightly filmed, wonderfully scripted and contains a great noir ending, but ultimately it's all about the cold as death hit-man Raven - and of course the great performance by the man who played him. 8.5/10"

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is directed by Martin Ritt and adapted to screenplay by Paul Dehn and Guy Trosper from the novel of the same name written by John le Carré. It stars Richard Burton, Claire Bloom, Oskar Werner, Peter van Eyck, Sam Wanamaker, Rupert Davies and Cyril Cusack. Music is by Sol Kaplan and cinematography by Oswald Morris.

Disillusioned spy Alex Leamas (Burton) returns from Berlin and is required to ""come in from the cold"" and work in a stable everyday job environment. But this is just a small piece of a much bigger jigsaw… From start to finish this is a deliberate downer of a movie, the complete flipside to the spy adventures served up in other high energy filmic quarters. Filmed in coarse monochrome to set the mood, picture is often depressing, overtly talky and complex in its characterisations and narrative bent. However, those things are not hindrances, for this is undeniably adult stuff, oozing with intelligence and intricacies for the mature film fan, a clinically spun web of pawns, manipulations and distrustful men. The Cold War backdrop is marked as deathly cold, where the grey weather is only matched by the colourless complexion of Burton's depressed spy. As the twists rack up and the tension noose is tightened, Ritt and his cast of excellent performers are only interested in keeping it real, right up to, and including, the devastating finale.

Not one to turn to when in need of a pick-me-up, or in fact a film you want to watch perennially, but certainly it's a piece of work that serves to remind us that intense well written and performed cinema is always available to view when the mood fits. 8/10 || **_Talky, brooding B&W spy drama during the Cold War with Richard Burton_**

In the early ’60s, an alcoholic British intelligence agent (Richard Burton) is sent behind the Iron Curtain to East Germany disguised as a defector, but intending to spread disinformation. 

Based on the 1963 novel by John le Carré, ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" (1965) is a realistic spy drama and NOT an action thriller in the mold of James Bond. It’s similar to another flick based on a le Carré book, “The Russian House” (1990), which ironically starred Sean Connery. Both movies are dialogue-driven and their depiction of intelligence work is decidedly mundane, static and cynical, which isn’t to say they’re not worth checking out for those interested. The tone is similar to “36 Hours” with James Garner from the year prior.

Burton locked horns a bit with the director and the tense atmosphere on set was heightened by the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, Burton’s wife, likely due to costar Claire Bloom’s romantic history with Richard. Claire plays the librarian, Nan Perry.

The movie runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Ireland’s Ardmore Studios and England's Shepperton Studios with exterior scenes done in Dublin; for instance, Smithfield, Dublin, was used as the location for the Berlin checkpoint at the opening.

GRADE: B- || There's an authenticity about the performance from Richard Burton in this cold war thriller that, alongside some well paced direction from Martin Ritt really helps it hit home. His character (""Leamas"") is assigned one final task, to deal with the duplicitous Peter van Eyck (""Mundt"") who appears to be systematically removing the West's reliable sources of information. What follows is a far more psychological cat-and-mouse game as he gets apprehended, and has to play a very dangerous game balancing the needs of his mission with his own survival instincts - all of this without much clue as to whom he can really trust and against a backdrop of thinly veiled prejudices. John le Carré's books were always packed with detail - and that detail carries well into this film, it offers a richness to the proceedings that ensures we are drawn into the plot like a mouse after the cheese. Claire Bloom adds a diversion to the intensity - but in a sophisticated fashion - maybe she's just innocent, or could she actually be involved? Oskar Werner, Robert Hardy, Michael Hordern and a rather menacing Beatrix Lehmann all play important cogs in the wheel too. It's a watch that requires a degree of concentration - like the story itself, blink and you might miss something... important!"

Meantime, his wartime captain ""Marco"" (Denzel Washington) is recovering from an injury sustained during an ambush - only he is struggling to reconcile his memories of that event with those being put forward by ""Shaw"" and, almost verbatim, by his fellow soldiers. Upon more detailed investigation, ""Marco"" stumbles upon the most unique of conspiracies that calls him to question not just his own sanity, but the nature of events both past and present. The more he digs, the more doors close before him and pretty soon both he and we know that there is some sort of conspiracy that goes right to the heart of American democracy. The story has been updated from the original and that helps it to stand on it's own a bit more. Washington is effective, as is Schreiber as the plot thickens and the prospects of a terrifying form of psychological warfare begin to loom large, presenting us with a story of manipulation and power-lust that is distinctly Machiavellian. Meryl Streep does OK, but sadly her's is the role that comes off worst by comparison with Angela Lansbury from first time round. The former is undoubtedly an accomplished actress, but somehow she doesn't quite exude the same degree of toxic charm. It also really does take it's time to get going, but once in it's stride it offers us quite an intriguing, if wordy, look at just how the American political establishment might work, and how it might, equally, be up for shrewd exploitation.

This user comment is my own personal feelings, it is not a review that I make in the hope of turning anyone's opinion to that of my own, no mater what anyone says or does, my feelings for the film will never change.

I see a smartly crafted movie about fear and hope, a community living in fear of the outside world, I see involving characters to follow with interest, I see a gorgeous setting that intrigues and engages me.

Manoj Night Shyamalan's fourth mainstream picture is now, as we can all agree, a victim of a terrible marketing campaign, wasn't it? For there are horror elements in the film, of which I don't wish to spoiler write about, the horror elements are there, they just aren't the boo jump scary monster variety that many had hoped for. The ending to the film disappoints many it would seem, but it doesn't to me because it is here that the film has most resonance and the point is well and truly made. It's acted out with style from the majority of the cast, and Shyamalan directs with a steady caring approach. It's not without flaws for sure, but this is a very tidy piece that's saying quite a bit if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board. All told, it's a very solid and thought provoking piece that's made with much film making care. 8/10 || Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

Being this is in the Shamallama-verse, it catches a lot of flak for having a ""twist"", and being a bit of a intellectual weight lift, but even knowing the ""twist"", I find it to be a very interesting watch.

A blind protagonist is immediately interesting to me because it tends to lend itself to the non-traditional elements of a movie and is usually very refreshing for those of us that watch a lot of movies.

Bryce Dallas Howard, especially, does much of the heavy lifting in this movie, but there really is a stacked cast that all give a good amount of quality support through their roles: it's not just about the blind girl travelling for days through the woods, it is about the community.  Stories that focus on things larger than a single person as a ""character"" tend to lose people as they like to immerse themselves in a character and still feel they're bigger than the world in the setting.

The initial concept of a ""big bad wolf"" in the woods is interesting, but they do go a different way with it: they're almost a society of creatures the way they're given to behave where werewolves might have actually been a more effective choice for a ""monster"".

Likely this has been spoiled for you, but if not, then you should definitely give it a shot, and if so, then you should see how it is for yourself."

I'm not a fan of drug humor, ""because he's HIGH"" isn't a good enough joke to me, but this felt like a spiritual successor to ""Dumb and Dumber"" (another movie that is funny, but I'm not a huge fan of).

John Cho and Kal Penn work amazingly together, so much so that I'm honestly surprised there isn't a web series of ""Harold and Kumar"" skits (and if there are, then happy day) trying to wring blood from stone.

The story has a great structure: a clear antagonist, clear love interest, a goal, plenty of adversity, and lots of quality character interaction.

Of all the boring premises, a legal requirement is a really boring choice.  Forcing a marriage is not only not relatable for America (Mia's country of origin), but also not exciting to watch Anne Hatheway reject guys and have to settle.  And all the while they ignore the obvious solution.

There is a lot of fun with the idea of a American princess just having fun with a lot of resources, and touching bits with her using her power for good.

Sadly, again, the movie doesn't feel like it does anything special, despite all the ""pizazz"" they layer on.

Again, it's good, but it is weaker than the original, and unless you have the background of that movie, you're not missing anything by skipping this one. || Just as slow as the original, but I'd argue it's a better film overall.

There isn't much between the two films, I admit. However, I found <em>'The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement'</em> more enjoyable than <em>'The Princess Diaries'</em>. The plot is probably just as interesting, but there's less cringe in this one and the villains are a big improvement.

Anne Hathaway (Mia) is very good once more, while Julie Andrews (Clarisse) does solid things again. John Rhys-Davies (Mabrey) and Chris Pine (Nicholas) are top additions, great casting on the latter by the way given it's Pine's feature film debut.

I also said in my review of the 2001 film that I don't like fictional places in live-action, non-fantasy productions. That's still the case here, but I didn't actually mind it all that much to be honest. ""Genovia"" is way more believable here, thanks to us actually getting to see it for real - as opposed to it just being referenced.

As noted, there are still a few cringey moments and it does run too long. There are some sweets parts, though. It's also kinda weird that, technically, Mia and Nicholas are related; a number of generations back sure, but still...

A sequel that (minorly) improves on its predecessor, that's always a positive in my book."

Antartica, and an expedition is about to uncover a battleground for Aliens and Predators.

Whoever wins, we lose! So ran the tag line for Paul W. S. Anderson's prequel (?) to two fanatically worshipped franchises. Little was Anderson to know that it was the majority of cinema goers who would feel that they had ""lost"" their cash on coming out after watching this miss-matched effort. Though in truth nobody could seriously have expected a film to rival the best of both serials (Alien, Aliens & Predator), it's still right that us fans should expect the formula to be respectfully adhered too. We want character build up, we expect a group dynamic to function, and we definitely want the baddies to stay just that, as baddies.

It's not a total loss, though, even as Anderson all too quickly hurtles towards his ""humans caught in a cube like puzzle box"" blood bath, there is just enough back story and anticipation to tickle the tongue. In fact, when it all goes pear shaped and Xenomorphs, Pred-Rastas and humans are all lined up for slotting, it's damn near exciting stuff. While the pyramid/cube/maze design is pretty awesome. However, then the plus points are vanquished as the film quickly becomes kiddie friendly as gloop gives way to strawberry jelly, featuring a turn of events with our ""heroine"" that's so clumsy I'd be surprised if Anderson sleeps at night.

Still, it's obvious that Anderson loves both franchises and he in no way would have wanted to make a stinker. But he has made a very average movie, one that's got two things in its favour. One being that is the neat middle section, the other that it's not half as bad as the messy hack job that was AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem in 2007. 5/10 || I can honestly say, that this is one of the most under-rated films of 2004.

Not because it was good, just because it was panned so fucking hard by critics! I think this is mostly due to the fact that it was being compared to both the Alien and Predator series, which is fair enough, but it was never going to be what either of those films was.

Ultimately it's downfall came from some poor dialogue, and trying to reach a larger audience. Where Predators was a film that you didn't need to have watched all the others in order to follow, it was still fundamentally a Predator film, aimed at the Predator-loving market. AVP on the other hand used references to the older films, but then completely threw the canon out the window and went for a larger fanbase. And whilst it worked to some degree (my grandma liked it) it wasn't enough of a step in either direction. AVP was complicated as a stand alone, and disastrous when compared to anything else in the franchise except perhaps its sequel Requiem (and maybe Predator 2 or Alien3).

Honestly I think the film works as an archetypal film in the realm of both Alien and Predator, just not a sequel or prequel to either. The lead protagonist is a woman by the name of Alexa Woods, portayed by Sanaa Lathan (Blade, Contagion) who was clearly meant to be a modern day Ripley, and catastrophically failed at doing so. The Predators were as cool as ever, and people complained that in the latter half of the film they weren't as ghostly as in Predator/Predator 2, but we've already had two whole films of that, and these were juvenile Predators, so it sort of made sense that they were a tad more restless.

Bringing Lance Henriksen (Damien: Omen II, Piranha II: The Spawning, The Terminator, Aliens, Alien 3, Pumpkinhead, The Quick and the Dead, Mind Ripper, Scream 3, The Lost Tribe) back was an awesome decision, one that was probably lost on the audience who had not seen the Alien series.

Tommy Flanagan (Smokin' Aces 1 and 2, Sin City, When a Stranger Calls [2006], Gladiator, Braveheart) is another an actor I love, it was a shame his character (Mark Verheiden) was so underused. Ultimately, the film is a good one to pick up and put down, don't think about it too much, don't compare it to the others, go in with your only expectation being that it's a monster-movie, then you won't come out too disappointed.

-Gimly || If Paul WS Anderson had just taken a moment longer to look at the casting here, he might have had a decent property. A solid conflict between the ultimate ninja ""Predator"" and the ultimate killing machine from ""Alien"". Why didn't he? Instead, we find a truly C-list bunch of acting fodder exploring a temple wherein, aeons ago, these two titans of terror battled it out. On arrival in the sacrifice room, they inadvertently release some eggs, and some ""Predator"" creatures, and soon some of them are on the menu for both as a battle royal looms. The special effects are good, and the action elements work fine too. I even found myself taking sides - just not with the humans, who deserved every tortuous chewing, stabbing and nasty involuntary caesarians that they got. It's paced well, it looks eerie and sinister, and the ending is quite exciting - it's just a real shame the writing and the acting are really mediocre. Teed up for a sequel too - I can only hope it ups it's game for that!"

2. I grew up watching this movie with my dad over and over, so it has a good deal of nostalgia for me.

The reviews to “The Forgotten” couldn't be more opposite, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since some of the best artistic items polarize opinion. The film admittedly has weaknesses and those who don’t like it zero-in on these flaws.

In style, it is similar to ""The Mothman Prophesies"" (2002), but not as good, intricate or artistic. There are similarities to The X-Files with the two protagonists, one being a female redhead, searching for the truth in what is essentially a sci-fi/mystery tale with the government somehow being involved.

Because of the highly mixed reviews I was watching the first 15 minutes only half-attentive, but when Telly (Moore) confronts Ash (West) and subsequently teams-up with him my attention perked up. Ash is an ex-NHL player who's given up on life and turned to alcohol to drown out his sorrows. What tragic event happened that would cause him to throw in the towel and turn to the bottle? I'll leave that to you to discover.

Anyway, remember the great masculine actors of the past, like Charlton Heston, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and perhaps even Marlon Brando? There was just something about them that set ’em apart and made you take notice when they were on screen. Dominic West is such an actor. He's reminiscent of James Remar, whom you might remember as Ajax in ""The Warriors"" (1979).

The subplot of Ash's drunkenness struck a chord with me because I know people, incredibly talented people like Ash, who've essentially given up and given in to alcohol, wasting their lives away. Not to mention the fact that I've been seriously tempted to give up as well at times (albeit not to alcohol). I can relate and I'm sure you can too.

As noted, the film is a sci-fi/mystery tale and therefore the explanation (no spoilers) is rather outlandish, but not necessarily unbelievable. ""Flightplan"" (2005) was a similarly-themed film; although its explanation was not outlandish, just totally unbelievable. So if you can't handle outlandishness I suggest you forget ""The Forgotten.""

""The Forgotten"" is essentially a story of love v.s. cold analytical thought. Personally I fall right in the middle between these two dynamics. This conflict is what made the character of Spock so fascinating. Remember the Star Trek episode ""This Side of Paradise"" where he was able to walk free of his strict adherence to logic and experience the warmth & joy of love for the first time? At the end of the episode he sadly states that it was the first time in his life that he was truly happy.

""The Forgotten"" is a story of tortuous struggle and potential triumph, for both Telly and Ash. Although logic is important, love is more powerful. Not to mention warmer and life-inducing.

The film is short and sweet at a mere 1 hour and 26 minutes before credits. The DVD features an extended cut with an alternative ending wherein the possible conspiracy is less malevolent. Watch the theatrical cut first and then simply go to the deleted scenes section and watch the two deleted scenes and the alternate ending (unless you want to watch the ENTIRE film twice, that is; it's just not necessary). I'll say this: the kissing scene should have never been omitted. It works. But perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to paint Telly as a potential adulterer, which isn't a bad thing.

Don't listen to the grumps who didn't 'get' ""The Forgotten."" The reason they didn't 'get' it is because their pendulum veers too heavily toward cold logic, but they don't have to stay that way. :)

Lancaster plays his role in a measured and entirely convincing fashion as he foils the almost perfect effort from an entirely convincing Booth who elicits sympathy and exasperation in almost equal measure. What's also quite effective here is that the story isn't full of contrived pitfalls and disasters. It's a story of humanity with it's roots in a plausible scenario (of the time, anyway) that has provided these two, perhaps despite themselves, with a true and lasting affection. It's much more of a drama than a romance, and really is worth an hour and half of your time."

The writing is quickly paced and frequently quite witty, with engaging and cohesive efforts from the two at the top of the bill, but also from the briefly used Bill Nighy and the always reliable Wilton who has considerable skill when it comes to comedy timing and accompanying facial expressions. I can't say I've ever seen a collection of vinyl LPs used as an offence weapon before, and that sets the tone for the entertainingly spoofy daftness of the proceedings that isn't maybe the most original ninety minutes of cinema you'll ever have seen, but it stays the right side of slapstick and is good fun throughout."

Murder on the orient Express is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted to screenplay by Paul Dehn from the novel of the same name written by Agatha Christie. It stars Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, Jacqueline Bisset and John Gielgud. Music is by Richard Rodney Bennett and photography by Geoffrey Unsworth.

1935 and the Orient Express is on route from Istanbul to London. On board is legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. He is called into investigative action when a passenger is found brutally stabbed to death, just as the train is ground to a halt due to heavy snow. This will not be easy for it's a case where any number of the passengers appear to have links to the deceased.

The best of the big screen adaptations of Christie's Poirot works, ""Orient Express"" is given a consummate sheen by director Lumet and his all star cast. Finney's Poirot has a hard edge to him, which is perfectly in keeping with the story that unfolds. From the beginning, which brings a sad and potent piece of news to our viewing experience, right to the Poirot deconstruction of the crime-perpetrator-motive sequence, picture has dark tints framing the array of thespians gathered for the occasion. The setting is gorgeous, but the confines of the period train add credible claustrophobic tension to the plot, and the reveal, while not surprising to the observant, is still a doozy that is given added emotional heft by a neat character development.

Darker than you may expect, but still a bunch of fun to be had playing spot the star and deducing who has done the foul deed. 8/10 || Albert Finney is magnificent as Agatha Christie's ""Poirot"" in this murder mystery set amidst the luxury (and isolation) of the Orient Express train as it travels from Istanbul to Calais, getting stuck in a snow drift en route. A cast to make your eyes water all vie for the responsibility of murdering oriental pottery collector Richard Widmark. Why, we ask, so brutally murder a guy who collects ancient urns? Well Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery and Ingrid Bergman are just a few of the suspects under the scrutinous eye of our travelling Belgian sleuth. Sir John Gielgud plays the butler with a similar sort of reverse snobbery that won him an Oscar for ""Arthur"" (1981) and the imperious ""Princess Dragomiroff"" is played to perfection by Dame Wendy Hiller. A superbly paced and structured bit of direction from Sidney Lumet leaves you guessing for almost all of this two hour cat and mouse chase.."

RELEASED IN 1977 and directed by Michael Anderson, ""Orca"" stars Richard Harris as a Newfoundland fisherman trying to make some big money by capturing a killer whale for a marine park. Unfortunately he ends up horribly botching the job, which incurs the vengeful wrath of the father killer whale.

Coming out two years after the blockbuster “Jaws,” this is sort of a knockoff, but it’s too different in story/tone to be cheap imitation, although there are obvious similarities: The last third of the film involves a boat crew sailing out to sea to take on the oceanic antagonist; and another scene where an individual slides down a leaning platform toward the marine creature. In any case, “Orca” may not be technically as good as ""Jaws"" but it certainly has its unique attractions.

The story is a maritime tragedy and utterly serious in tone with no lightness to be seen, like in “Piranha” (1978). The melodramatic plot basically inverts Melville’s “Moby Dick” wherein in the whale takes the place of bitter Ahab. The score by Ennio Morricone (e.g. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"") is equal-parts beautiful, touching and haunting. Also, the casting is great: Harris is perfect as the aging sea salt, Charlotte Rampling is super sharp & intellectual as the cetacean biologist, Will Sampson (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") is great (and clichéd) as the Indian sage with his wise, foreboding words and Bo Derek is, well, you know.

In addition, the Newfoundland locations are fabulous and, at about an hour and a half, the film is short and sweet; so there's not much filler. That said, people suffering ADHD might complain that the pace is a little slow at times.

A couple of notable scenes come to mind: The unsettling sequence where Orca's mate aborts her calf while strung up on the vessel; and the one where Orca causes mass destruction in the village at night whereupon Nolan (Harris) gazes at the havoc while the whale jumps in and out of the water in elation.

Let me close by emphasizing that “Orca” is NOT a Grade B creature-on-the-loose flick (e.g. 2000’s ""Crocodile""); it's a serious and moving tragedy.

1492.0,1492: Conquest of Paradise,1492: Conquest of Paradise depicts Christopher Columbus’ discovery of The New World and his effect on the indigenous people.,"Centuries before the exploration of space, there was another voyage into the unknown.","Action, Adventure, Drama, History",154.0,1992-10-09,en,6.3,862.0,2.4413,"Gérard Depardieu, Armand Assante, Sigourney Weaver, Loren Dean, Ángela Molina",Ridley Scott,"indigenous, the new world, discovery of america, native american, 15th century, conquistador, age of discovery","**_Ignore the Columbus-hating critics, this is an artistic historical adventure_**

Ridley Scott’s “1492: Conquest of Paradise” (1992) came out seven weeks after “Christopher Columbus: The Discovery” (1992) both of which tackle the same historic tale in celebration of its 500th anniversary.  The latter was directed by John Glen who’s no slouch as he helmed five James Bond flicks in the ’80s.

This film is more artistic and epic, being longer by 34 minutes, whereas “Discovery” is compact, not to mention it focuses on the set-up to the expedition while “1492” is more concerned with what happens after Columbus hits ground on the other side of the Atlantic. Moreover, “Discovery” sticks to the first voyage whereas “1492” includes additional expeditions.

Both bombed at the box office, but they’re each worth checking out and comparing if you like real-life adventure. “Discovery” is more balanced in regards to the three acts and doesn’t bog down with events in the New World, but “1492” is a must if you want to see what happens beyond Columbus’ first voyage. It provides no less than 75 minutes of material beyond the events of “Discovery.” 

The weakest part of “Discovery” is the voyage itself, which runs half an hour and is twice as long as the same in this film. While it’s difficult to make a long ship journey involving only males dramatically compelling, “1492” is a way more convincing (and artistic) rendition of the Atlantic voyage.

While “Discovery” has the superior cast, Gérard Depardieu is more convincing in the role of Columbus compared to Georges Corraface when you consider historic artist depictions. Corraface, by contrast, comes across as the cliched Hollywood version of the explorer, which doesn’t mean he’s not effective. In any case, I like the way each version points out Columbus’ positive AND negative qualities.

Meanwhile Armand Assante (Sanchez), Sigourney Weaver (Queen Isabel), Michael Wincott (Moxica) and Frank Langella (Santangel) are all memorable. But don’t expect Marlon Brando or females on the level of Catherine Zeta-Jones and voluptuous Tailinh Agoyo. Speaking of the latter, the women on the islands are overtly top nude, as was the case in “The Bounty”; just a heads up.

Monkey-see-monkey-do critics jumped on the hate bandwagon when “Discovery” and “1492” were released as soon as they smelled blood in the water. However, neither film is even close to being awful, as they claim. Like I said, they’re definitely worth seeing if you prefer historical adventure in the mold of “Mutiny on the Bounty” (1962) and “The Bounty” (1984).

One of the reasons “Discovery” and “1492” bombed was because Columbus was no longer viewed in a positive light by 1992 due to the preachin’ of Lib academics who denounce the explorer as evil incarnate. But, let’s face it, the European colonization of the Americas was BOTH a blessing and a curse, yet arguably more of a blessing since it introduced to the New World the written language, the horse, the wheel, wagons, stagecoaches, firearms, trains, industry, advanced architecture and so on.

And let’s not kid ourselves with the Lib fantasy that the Americas were a Garden of Eden before Euros arrived. There was constant fighting between many “Indian” tribes, who are actually the progeny of settlers from Asia. There was also slavery, massacres, heinous torture of captives, gross human sacrifice in Mesoamerica to nourish their gods and headhunters in the Amazon. Need I go on? The idea conveyed in “The New World” (2005) that AmerIndians had never experienced envy/rivalry and didn’t even know what a lie was is utterly laughable. I’m speaking as part-Abenaki.

The movie runs 2 hours, 34 minutes, and was shot mostly in Spain and Costa Rica.

This film is almost, but not quite, exactly what the lurid title would suggest. It's definitely going for shocks as its primary source of horror, with a lot of this being truly hard to watch (I saw the uncut version, with animal cruelty intact, and I can see why they're cut from most versions, although there is a certain level of hypocrisy in condemning those scenes if you eat meat - and I doubt everyone who has ever criticised it were all vegetarian or vegan - unless you think that what goes on in slaughterhouses is any kinder that the animal slaughter depicted in this film, or that recording it somehow makes a moral difference), and has well earned its reputation for brutality. However, there's a deeper element to the horror. All the violence and cannibalism and rape is truly gruelling to sit through, but the scenes between those are, in their own way, just as grotesque.
As strange as it may sound, one film that this strongly reminded me of was The Searchers, reminding us of the fact that so-called ""primitive"" peoples are separated from us only by circumstance, that there is nothing making the ""civilised"" world inherently better, that the wilderness is always right next door.
Of course, this is rather problematic in itself. Because, in case the title didn't clue you in, this film has no interest in being sensitive. It is still exploitative. The question this film poses is more along the lines of ""are we truly any better than nasty primitive violent cannibalistic tribes?"", and certainly has far more in the way of contempt for civilisation than compassion for the supposedly ""uncivilised"". It's a common refrain by now; ""Cannibal Holocaust claims to be satirising exploration while also being itself exploitative"". This criticism... I understand it, but I feel it relies on a verbal sleight of hand. An ""exploitation film"" may contain the word ""exploitation"", but it is not the same as exploiting people.
That said, we mustn't forget that the native actors in the film genuinely were mistreated. They weren't treated all that much better by the real film crew than by the in-movie one. Some of the stuff that happened on the set of this makes Kubrick-making-The-Shining look like the Buddha. There's no real way around it, the set of this movie was an abusive environment. The director of this movie, Ruggero Deodato, is an abusive arsehole who was particularly nasty to women and native actors. Fuck him.
And yet, I still can't help but be fascinated by the film, even if I don't necessarily want to ever see it again. There is certainly some craft to this. From Riz Ortolani's beautiful score providing an actually effective counterpoint to the incredibly brutal scenes of horror to the raw documentary style that strips everything down to the most naked barbarism, this is a film that has an aesthetic you won't see in many others, at the very least. Even now ""found footage"" is as family a horror subgenre as ""monster movie"" or ""slasher"", this, along with Blair Witch, still holds up as something special. Sure, the framing device may be unorthodox in modern examples of the genre, but the bits that are in that style genuinely do feel like we're watching somebody's last moments on film. The acting is... variable, which sometimes breaks the illusion, but, perversely, it helps in a way that a lot of the cast seem genuinely uncomfortable, so don't HAVE to act for a lot of it.
And yes, this is very influential. You can see all the familiar tropes of the found footage genre, right down to the cast being massive arseholes that you kinda want to see eaten by the end. Yes, as I say, the framing device is unorthodox, but it's not like there's no reason for it to be in the film or anything. It goes without saying that it would be a very different film without it, and probably wouldn't have nearly as many reviews on here. The footage story is of course where most of the scenes that fans of ""extreme cinema"" remember are from, but the frame story is part of the reason why this still an independent cult following outside of people who will simply watch anything with enough mutilation in it. The most targeted part, in my mind, comes when we see the footage of the in-film documentary ""The Last Road to Hell"", and the opening credits are in the same style as the actual opening credits to this film.
But there comes a point if we have to ask how genuine this is? Is this film truly a critique of colonialism and exploitation, or is it just trying to make pretensions to something more than a schlocky cannibal flick? Is it just trying to make you feel less guilty for watching it, or more guilty?
I don't think there are any easy answers. This is a wholly unattractive film, and knows it. The cruelty is both a means to and end and an end in itself simultaneously.
All in all, Cannibal Holocaust isn't necessarily a film I can in any good concience recommend, because my God is it hard to watch, nor can I really say I'm even glad it exists, knowing what went on behind the scenes, but I can say the world of cinema would lose something tangible if this film were deleted from history. For better or for worse.
OK, so today I've been writing various quick reviews-from-memory of various randomly selected movies I've seen before, and this was meant to be one of those, but ultimately this review turned out way longer than expected, so I hope I actually said anything worthwhile in that whole length rather than just rambling. Not sure why this of all films got the extended review for today, but I guess it is a film that sticks in your mind, and due to its nature it's not something many people are willing to see so it's easier to say things that haven't been said ten billion times already, so I guess the combination of those two factors resulted in me feeling I had the most to say about this one. Whatever the case, I hope I actually DID say something worthwhile lol."

Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate and Catherine O'Hara are, honestly, the only reasons this was watchable, for me personally at least. If it was a film with a lesser known cast, I wouldn't have any positives for it.

For a festive flick, it's a little too mean-spirited. Of course that's the way these films usually go so the eventual pay-off can occur, though with this it's a bit too the other way and the aforementioned pay-off isn't all that pleasant. You gotta make the characters way more likeable if you're only gonna redeem them a tiny bit.

This, is an unusual horror to review. It’s rather uncommon for the same director, in this case Takashi Shimizu, to remake his own original film for an entirely different audience. Most would push their original creation onto the masses and convince them, with glorified persuasion, to withstand subtitles and invest the time into the chilling ghost story.

Yet Shimizu thought it would be apt to direct his own film again. Admirable? Yes, it ensured he received total creative control over the studio and producers. Necessary? No. Somehow, by remaking the exact story with essentially the same spine-tingling sequences, Shimizu downgraded the atmospheric aura of ‘Ju-On’, resulting in nothing more than a Japanese ghost boy releasing his inner cat and his ethereal mother croaking the life out of anyone who visits the cursed house. That’s the plot synopsis, right there.

Well, there’s a tad bit more to the mystery, however Shimizu’s insistence on haphazardly fracturing the narrative between present day and the past week consequently confused audiences rather than enthral. There’s no logic behind the structure. No foundational development. And certainly no characterisation. So the abrupt switching back and forth held no purpose, other than to illustrate a host of jumpy death sequences. Some effective apparitional imagery heightened the tension, particularly the surveillance footage sequence and bedroom scene that made me frightened of my own bloody duvet when I was an innocent boy, yet negated by the bland acting from every single actor.

Buffy has no more vampires to slay or Daphne has solved all remaining mysteries (take your pick...), and so she’s left wandering aimlessly around Tokyo with just one facial expression. Confusion. Pullman contributed nothing. And even Kayako herself, Fuji, was grossly misused during moments of tension-raising buildup. The final expositional flashback sequence, revealing to us why the house is now essentially cursed, was rushed and overwrought. Then concluding the entire feature on a frickin’ jump scare that looked cheaper than Kayako’s mascara. By the time the credits roll, you’ll be thinking to yourself “...why are these Americans in Tokyo anyway?”.

I just...don’t understand how Shimizu can make his remake so unprogressive in terms of quality. He had another shot at bettering his original, overcoming previous criticisms, yet failed miserably. I’m open to the idea that The Grudge is a product of its time, comprising of several horror traits that the previous decade had commonly exploited. And I appreciate it stuck to its J-horror roots. But damn, this has not aged well in the slightest. The core is there. I can visibly see the contents. Yet, either due to Shimizu’s inability to improve in directorial control or studio interference, The Grudge growled like a ghoulish kitten instead of exhuming a ghostly lion’s roar. Y’know, because Toshio opens his CGI mouth and a cat noise comes out? Urgh, whatever. Couldn’t think of anything..."

Much like the original film, Alfie finds himself surrounded by beautiful women with a different one to jump into bed with each night. He treats both them and his friends like dirt, but doesn't care when he knows his charm can replace them.

If the original film contained a plot that would make the world blush when looked through a contemporary lens, then 2004's _Alfie_ attempts, in a way, to update that story for its modern audience.

As is typical with remakes of old British films, the location has been moved to appease its American audience but a tacit nod to the Cockney charm of _Alfie_'s original actor (Michael Caine) in the form of Jude Law.

To his credit, Jude Law does emanate charm in the same way that Caine did in 1966, mercilessly moving on from one relationship to the next without worry about consequence. However, with Alfie remaining English in New York, this has the unfortunate effect of making him stand out, and when a protagonist is clearly designed not to be likeable, then by having him contrast from the surrounding cast just alienates him further.

In addition, with the persistent nods to high fashion, Alfie isn't even relatable for most people as ""that laddish friend"" they once knew, and he comes across as both pompous and arrogant.

The story lifts large parts of the original, but seems to drop many of the subtle links between Alfie's relationships making him appear far more crass. Retained is Alfie's smoking habit, which is out of place in a modern film made all the worse by the inexplicable removal of why smoking was relevant to the original story.

Overall, _Alfie_ is a complete mis-step made even more uncomfortable by the emergence of the #MeToo movement. || Some films just don't need an ""update"". ""Alfie"" certainly didn't. Certainly Jude Law has a certain je ne sais quoi reprising the Michael Caine role as the womanising philanderer. His normal hump 'em and dump' em strategy is soon seriously compromised by his inability to ""perform"" and this has all sorts of ramifications on his shallow existence (relocated to New York in this version). Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon fail to help lift this great looking but intellectually void film get going, and Law - though every inch the dapper, gorgeous, gigolo to look at - just hasn't the charm or sleaziness of Caine. It does have a decent soundtrack, but not the same with out Cilla Black..."

She is well respected by her peers and seems to be the epitome of the hardworking 1950s British housewife. Until, that is - a policeman arrives at her door and her world starts to cave in. Now we know from fairly early on that ""Vera"" likes to help girls out. To be fair - there are plenty of them who are eligible. Raising a family when rationing was still around, jobs thin on the ground and their men folks usually keen to run a mile (if they even knew/or cared) was a daunting prospect to many a young woman, bereft of familial or state support. She didn't take cash for her carbolic and syringe services, she just thinks she is doing the best for all concerned. Needless to say the morals of the time did not necessarily concur, the law certainly didn't - and so we are faced with a rather well presented and written analysis of the antiquated and illiberal situation in which many women found themselves. The film doesn't attempt to moralise - it allows each of us to observe her activities and to evaluate - almost on a case by case basis - the relative merits of her interventions and I think that is particularly effective when stimulating the debate that this film is bound to create. The supporting cast including a career defining contribution from Daniel Mays as her conflicted son ""Sid"", Eddie Marsan and Heather Craney allow the story to spread out covering not just the actions of ""Vera"" but also of the complicity - sympathetically and/or venally motivated - by those in the medical profession and those in the community who had less scruples in monetising the misfortune of others. Above all, this is thought provoking - there is no simple answer to what's going on here, and for that Staunton (and Mike Leigh) are to be commended.

Two boys living with their father (Dermot Mulroney) in rural Georgia near Savannah (where the film was shot) try to eke out a living off the land. Chris (Jamie Bell) is about 16 and Tim around 10; both manifest their grief over their dead mother and the challenges of their destitute isolation in different ways: Chris gets in trouble with the law while Tim strangely seems preoccupied with consuming non-edible items. Their father's brother (Josh Lucas) comes to visit and seems affable enough, but there's a wild, sinister glint in his eyes. No wonder, he's inwardly frothing with hostility and greed.

David Gordon Green's ""Undertow"" (2004) is a bit reminiscent of Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) in that both are realistic dramas focusing on youths in rural areas and both offer a dreamy viewing experience. Each tries hard to enchant with their movie magic. Unlike ""Days,"" however, ""Undertow"" is rooted in Southern Gothic. Of the two, I favor ""Undertow.""

After viewing the director’s awesome ""Snow Angels"" (2007), easily one of the greatest dramas ever filmed, I decided to give this one, his previous film, another chance. I'm glad I did because ""Undertow"" is the type of movie that improves on repeat viewings.

But these types of arty flicks aren't for everyone. Those bred on modern blockbusters will likely find ""Undertow"" dull, meandering and pointless. I myself wasn't all that impressed the first time I watched it. I didn't hate it; I just didn't ""get"" it. I'm glad I gave it a second (and third) chance, however, because ""Undertow"" succeeded in pulling me in under its spell. You just have to be in the right mode for a film of this ilk.

The ""dreamy"" quality noted above is facilitated by Philip Glass' mesmerizing score that plays during the opening and closing credits. It's simple and repetitive, but spellbinding. I've gone to the credits a few times just to enjoy this brilliant piece.

Being a Southern Gothic drama/thriller, ""Undertow"" has a cool Southern ambiance with focus on the rural underbelly. Other films that are successful in this regard come to mind: ""The General's Daughter,"" ""Ode to Billy Joe,"" ""I Walk the Line"" (with Gregory Peck, 1970), ""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Squirm,"" ""The Man in the Moon"" and ""The Skeleton Key."" If you have a taste for these types of films, including the aforementioned ""Days of Heaven,"" you'll likely appreciate ""Undertow."" The difference with “Undertow” is that it concentrates so exclusively on pastoral paucity that it cops a poetic post-apocalyptic ambiance.

The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes. Kristen Stewart has a small role in the first act.

decide now to see the entire series, and in order, but really who's to
say?). Instantly, such trusted, bankable actors as Cary Elwes and Danny
Glover give it credibility, just as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford gave
such films as 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' way back in days gone
by. This was much better than I felt parts 3 and 5 were, by the way. || With no obvious connection between them, two men awaken to find themselves chained to the plumbing at opposite ends of a room. ""Adam"" (Leigh Whannell) is a photographer, the other is ""Lawrence"" (Cary Elwes), a doctor. Each have a micro-tape in their pocket and the only tape player in the room is nestled neatly in the hands of a corpse situated on the centre of the floor. A bit of ingenuity is needed to obtain the kit to play the tape and hopefully get some clue as to why there are there. Suffice to say that they do not like what they hear, and with the clock ticking they will have to learn to trust each other whilst having quite a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. Meantime, the police (Danny Glover) are interviewing a woman who might have managed to escape from a similarly orchestrated predicament. Might there be any way that she could help track down this devious mastermind who doesn't ever actually do any of his own killing - he just manipulates with astonishing purpose. Elwes and Whannell (who also wrote this) both deliver really quite strongly here as does their claustrophobic and distinctly unsanitary prison environment as the story tells us via contemporaneous and flashback imagery a little of their stories and of just why they have attracted the attention of this vengeful ""jigsaw killer"". It's not especially graphic, this film, though there is a fair smattering of gore - it's the psychology that helps it to deliver better. There's always that element of what might we do to survive, or - maybe more apposite - what might we be prepared to do to others. The writing also helps it along with the exasperation of all well exemplified without just resorting to loud voices and expletives. In the end, I found that I did actually care what happened to these men - but with the clock against them, what are their chances? It's tense and compelling and reminded me a little of ""Se7en"" (1995)."

I remember when it was released in 2004, there was a big hurrah about ""the"" bath scene, many vitriolic complaints about how slow it was, how not scary it was et al. Birth is many wonderful film making things, of course not all of those things will resonate or enthral many of the movie watching populace, yet there is such craft on both sides of the camera here, and an atmospherically ambiguous bloodline pulsing throughout, that marks it out as a particularly striking film.

Plot finds Nicole Kidman as Anna, who is about to be re-married but finds her world tipped upside down when a young boy (Cameron Bright) arrives on the scene and announces he is the reincarnation of her dead first husband...

Director Jonathan Glazer and his co-writers Jean-Claude Carrière & Milo Addica are purposely being vague, I mean lets face it, the topic to hand is exactly that, vague, and ripe for countless hours of discussion. The film simmers along deftly, meditations on love, grief and anger are skilfully portrayed by all involved. Even a birthing tunnel metaphor doesn't come off as self indulgent, from the off Glazer wants and gets those interested in the story to buy into the hypnotic qualities on show. To jump on board with Anna's fragility while all around her battle for rhyme or reason with her mindset.

In truth it's a hard sell as a piece of entertainment, there's still today, over a decade since it was released, people miffed that the hinted at supernatural elements are not key to the narrative. While the thin line of good and bad taste - and maybe even pretentiousness - is being tested by the makers, but the charges of Birth being dull are just wrong. It never shows its hand, the mystery always remains strong, while Kidman and Lauren Bacall are reason enough to admire the acting craft on show.

Hated by many, inducing even anger in some quarters, Birth is a tantalising picture. A conundrum designed to get a response, for better or worse. 8/10"

I enjoy how the film starts out, as it introduces the characters and tells some backstories. However, once the film becomes more serious it kinda loses its edge for me. When it's less so though, it's good. The animation is very nice, even if the humans look a tad iffy especially with their expressions.

Another part I don't love is the villain, Syndrome. I feel like he's a bit tame, I never once felt fear/angst from the guy at all. A much more devilish, deceptive bad guy would've been far better. I didn't even realise it's Jason Lee who voices him either, it oddly doesn't sound like Lee to me.

Talking of mishearing the voice cast, am I the only one who thought it was Jodie Foster voicing Elastigirl? Violet kinda sounds like Aubrey Plaza too. I think I may need my ears tested... Elsewhere, it's cool to hear (correctly, this time) Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone.

Don't get me wrong, this is certainly a film worth watching 100%. I just would've loved a greater threat to the protagonists. Lastly, the end scenes, though amusing, feel like a collective of end credit jokes rolled into one. That's a minor complaint, mind. || I sort of watched them out of order. I wasn't really privy to the existence of The Incredibles until my fiance wanted to rent the sequel...and then I went back and watched the first one.

I have to say that I liked 2 more, but only because it looked like a period pop art piece and the first one you really didn't get that feel. It was clearly set in the early 60s, but you didn't get that whole esthetic as much as you did in the sequel and that was the biggest draw I had to it.

That being said, it was't bad.

Sociopolitically I liked the line about when everyone has super powers no one does. It registered loudly to someone that works in history. So the plot, on that basis, was compelling.

And I am sure that if I had seen them in order I'd like it just as much.

The sequel, the main draw that sucked me in was the look of the film. Here it was the quasi-family struggles which, again, seemed to be highlighted a little better in the second film. Still, it was there enough, the work-life balance to draw you in, and the absurdity that the work was being a hero was entertaining.

As was the reason they had to go underground which, again, was done a little better than when the MCU tried it...but still not elaborated on enough to make it as interesting as it could have once been.

In any case, it's still an entertaining cartoon. And you can see where the creators took what worked in the first one and elaborated on the concepts until they popped. || It's got a sort of ""Batman"" meets the ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" feel about it as the ""Parr"" family try to get on with their lives after their brave and courageous superhero existence was kiboshed by some daft lawsuits and government cold feet. Thing is, there's no such thing as a well-earned retirement and just over a decade after they were consigned to obscurity, dad ""Bob"" is summoned to a top secret summit where he quickly discovers that it's going to take all of his - and his family's -considerable powers to stop the world from imminent destruction. No, the plot is hardly original - or incredible - but the script and characterisations here are really in kilter as the creatively animated adventure hots up. There's fun in the dialogue for the kids and grown-ups alike, and though maybe a bit on the long side, it's a lively tale of espionage and science with it's fair share of gadgets, gizmos, family strife and even an impenetrable, armoured, steel baddie. The pace becomes hectic and enjoyable and the action builds up nicely before a denouement that isn't the best - it just screams sequel at us. This needs a big screen to enjoy it at it's best and has some engaging, spy-themed, nostalgia for those of us north of forty too."

A boy from Grand Rapids, Michigan, is at the age where he no longer believes in Christmas, as far as Santa, his elves and flying reindeer go, but a magical train appears in front of his home on Christmas Eve and whisks him away on an adventurous trip to the North Pole with several other kids.

“The Polar Express” (2004) was based on the 1985 Christmas book and was the first mainline movie to use motion capture animation for all its characters beginning to end (think Gollum from “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy). Some people think the animation is weak, but I feel it creates its own world and has its own charm. It holds up as long as you can adapt to those creepy dead eyes of the characters.

Some people love this movie while others think it’s weird, like a Twilight Zone Christmas flick. Roger Ebert, for instance, loved it and gave it a perfect grade. I’m sorta in the middle. I see its good points and appreciate them, like the haunting winter ambiance, parts of the trip to the North Pole (e.g. the quasi-rollercoaster ride) and the kids’ investigation of the Christmas factory. But there are some meh parts and dubious sections like the whole last act with the multitude of elves and the towering Santa who looked like he was modeled after 6’5” Christopher Lee with a pillow strapped to his mid-section.

The movie’s interesting in some ways but also quaint in a cheesy way, as well as peculiar and lifeless.

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.

GRADE: C || No matter how many times I watch this, it always brought me to tears!

I only wish that I got to see it in 3D at the cinema. || Watching The Polar Express is not an annual event for me, but I believe I have seen it three times and would not nix the idea if someone were to suggest watching it again.  I feel a connection to it for an odd reason: my wife and I volunteered one Christmas season to be elves serving cocoa and dancing for an actual Polar Express narrow gauge train ride when we lived in Maine. (Though I can assure you our dancing was not as acrobatic as what you see in this movie.)

The animation feels a little odd at first, but I stop noticing it each time I watch it. The story turns the train trip to the North Pole into a real thrill ride for the children on board, especially for our hero boy, voiced by Tom Hanks. In fact, if you are a Hanks fan, settle in, because he does multiple voices here, including one that sounds remarkably like Gilbert Godfrey to me.

I try to avoid punching holes in the plots of Christmas movies. Half the point is that they will include unlikely events all leading to the miracle of Christmas ending. You want logic; pull out the old algebra textbook!"

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || Chucky has gone to seed!

It would be pure folly to have expected Seed of Chucky to be a brilliant entry in the Chucky franchise, the big-wigs pulling the financial strings behind the scenes clearly had no idea what had made the series popular in horror circles in the first place.

Bride of Chucky (part 4 for anyone counting) was bold and it worked, it managed to be that rare old thing of a horror film able to marry up horror and comedy for good entertainment purpose. Unfortunately everything about Seed of Chucky is lazy and weak. There is no story of substance here, it is neither funny or scary, the parody and self awareness the makers go for runs out of steam after 15 minutes! When the writers are reduced to a masturbation sequence to get their meta kicks then you know there's problems. 3/10, and that is purely for Jennifer Tilly and her delightful way of not taking herself seriously. || Really crazy and weird movie.

866.0,Finding Neverland,"During a writing slump, playwright J.M. Barrie meets a widow and her four children, all young boys—who soon become an important part of Barrie’s life and the inspiration that lead him to create his masterpiece. Peter Pan.",Where will your imagination take you?,"Drama, Fantasy",106.0,2004-10-17,en,7.322,3611.0,2.1177,"Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman, Freddie Highmore",Marc Forster,"london, england, stroke of fate, becoming an adult, parent child relationship, faith, widow, theater play, theatre group, author, illness, children's author","He is the irrepressible spirit of youth.

Under pressure due to his success, in a token socialite marriage, playwright J.M. Barrie is less than enamoured with his lot. Then whilst out walking his dog in Kensington Gardens, he meets widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her four young sons, George, Jack, Peter and Michael. It is the start of a long lasting friendship that revitalises Barrie and brings about his masterpiece, Peter Pan.

OK, lets get the grumble out the way, you know the one, the one that so many are quick to mention. No this is not a definitive take on J.M. Barrie and this time in his life. Much like Allan Knee's play, ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"", from which this is adapted, there are liberties taken and it's most definitely chronologically unsound.

But this is not a biography is it? This is basically asking what sort of man conceived the magical world of Peter Pan? It's a celebration of childhood, life, whimsically asking us if it's wrong to keep the inner child in us all locked away as adulthood takes control? A tale of comedy blended with tragedy, from which glorious art is born to live long and forever, the kind that will be touching generations long after we have left this mortal coil.

Elegantly crafted by director Marc Forster and his screenwriter David Magee, Finding Neverland could so easily have given way to over sentiment and floundered in the search for emotional kickers. Yet it doesn't because Forster (immeasurably aided by the lush cinematography by Roberto Schafer) has created a quaint Victorian world, a world where fantasy is never far away. What emotion is here (and there is lots of it) sits perfect within this setting. We are actually being asked to be Barrie himself, the makers daring us to not be swept up in the magic being born. Wonderful, wonderful stuff.

Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Barrie, delicately fusing childish playfulness with inner sorrow, Depp doesn't put a foot wrong. It will be a crime if this multi talented actor doesn't finish his career with the highest acting honour on offer, the Academy Award for Best Actor (nominated three times, including this performance), it's practically impossible to imagine another actor in this generation nailing the role of Barrie like Depp does. Playing off him expertly is Kate Winslet as Sylvia, raw and honest like, it's emotionally driven and gnaws away at the audience's heart strings. Yet it's young Freddie Highmore as Peter that steals the show. Very much the film's heart, his relationship with Barrie has a grace about it, with Highmore (just 12 at the time) able to portray a subtle tenderness that drives the relationship forward.

Nominated for seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture), Finding Neverland won just the one for Jan Kaczmarek's poignant score. It matters not, because to me at least, this will forever be a personal favourite film. Something that just like Peter Pan himself, will never ever get old. 10/10 || It can be just a little bit twee at times, this, but it's still quite an enjoyable look at the inspiration behind J.M. Barrie's timeless ""Peter Pan"". We start inauspiciously, though, as his latest play garners mediocre reviews. The pressure is on - he (Johnny Depp) must write something successful else risk his relationship with impresario Frohman (the very sparingly used Dustin Hoffman). Luckily, he encounters some children in the park playing with their mother ""Sylvia"" (Kate Winslet) and there starts a friendship that sees them all, and their dog ""Nana"", provide him with some much needed food for thought. There are some flies in his ointment, though. The young ""Peter"" (Freddie Highmore) still craves the return of their late father and her mother (Julie Christie) is entirely unsure of his motives and of his commitment. It's this latter concern that grows more important as he becomes more and more integrated with and fond of this family. Barrie comes up with an imaginative plan that might help the young ""Peter"" and his mother move on with their lives before we all discover that the children are in for another tragedy sooner than later, too. There's something touchingly straightforward about this drama and that's largely down to the engaging efforts from Highmore and his fellow siblings as they mess about and play at being children, dealing with grief and progress in their own way. There's a sub-plot illustrating his own troubled marriage with ""Mary"" (Radha Mitchell) which doesn't really add much, indeed, Depp himself doesn't really do much more than gently guide the story along as we watch the power of imagination and good will empower these young people, as it did so many others in ""Neverland"" and beyond. It's about healing, sure, but it's also about adventure and excitement and the thrills of being alive and young, invincible and immortal."

He's a charmer is that one, but she knows he cannot be trusted. That's successfully proven when she gets herself caught up in a drug smuggling caper and confined to a 40-to-a-cell women's prison with only one fairly hapless Foreign Office gent telling her how sticky her wicket is! Can she be rescued? Can she get back to her beloved? Of course there's not a jot of jeopardy to any of this, and in the intervening three years since the first film this character has lost much of her charm and punch. In many ways this just mirrors that story only it's not so innovative any more. There's still plenty to poke fun at amidst her sexist and accident-prone environment and Zellweger really does have the character down to an hapless T now, but I just felt I knew what was coming long before it did and the writing this time around defers all to often to the soundtrack. It's amiable enough, but a little tired and predictable. || <em>'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'</em> is a totally pointless sequel. There isn't really anything substantial that happens in this, it basically goes in one big circle before finishing how it started; aside from one minute-long detail. Admittedly, it does manage to avoid being bad.

Renée Zellweger remains a plus, as do Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. With that said, this film adds nothing new to their characters, they are just replicas of themselves from the 2001 original. The film (as before) does have a charm to it, which saves it from a lower rating... too generous?"

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Seen this one many times over the years and still a lot of fun. Solid adventure-comedy with Nicolas Cage in his element with this sort of material. Diane Krueger's performance was a bit iffy at times but she had some okay scenes and never can go wrong with Sean Bean playing the villain, though the character is made out to be smart when all he does is some online searches and stealing from others. **3.75/5** || _**Modern ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in America**_

If you can imagine a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type story taking place in modern America, you'd have a fairly good idea of what ""National Treasure"" is like. Nicolas Cage plays the Indiana Jones-type treasure hunter, Benjamin Franklin Gates, accompanied by his partner (Justin Bartha) and romantic interest (Diane Kruger), the latter a historical document scholar who gets dragged into the wild proceedings.

THE PLOT: Gates feels he has no choice but to audaciously steal the Declaration of Independence to save it from his nemesis (Sean Bean). The document has an invisible clue on its flip side, which supposedly leads to a vast, coveted 'national treasure.' Can Gates successfully swipe the document, elude the Feds, and ultimately find the ancient fortune before his murderous, greedy rival? And can he simultaneously ""get the babe"" as well? 

""National Treasure"" put a big grin on my face throughout its entire runtime. Like 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" you're not supposed to dwell too deeply on the events because, if you do, the implausibilities will start to mount up. Nevertheless, even though this was made to be a fun, eminently entertaining ride, it still somehow stimulates ruminations and interest in American history. Not a bad byproduct, no? 

A handful of miscellaneous items: 

* Diane Kruger, who played 'the face that launched a thousand ships' in 2004's ""Troy,"" is sharp and all-around pleasant on the eyes.
* The score is modern with thrilling orchestrations intermingled with HEAVY progressive guitar riffs. It was composed by, believe it or not, Yes' guitarist/songwriter Trevor Rabin. Like ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" this is a soundtrack worth owning; it's that superlative.
* The protagonists are all likable; heck, even the head Fed, played by Harvey Keitel, is likable.
* The chases are thrilling.
* The film was shot on location in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York City.
* Jon Voight plays Gate's father.
* Like ""Raiders"" this is a family-friendly experience -- upbeat with no needless cussing, sex or gore. The movie leaves you with a good feeling.

CLOSING THOUGHT: Despite the fact that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it 'thumbs down' -- Roeper even calling it 'Howling, howling BAD' -- ""National Treasure"" was a huge hit with audiences in 2004. This shows that critics like Roeper see WAY too many movies. They can't even lighten-up enough to enjoy a fun, thrilling, historically-stimulating popcorn flick. Implausible? Yes (at times, anyway). Bad? No.

Make no mistake, ""National Treasure"" is an entertaining quasi-believable adventure film. It's got the mojo.

The movie runs 2 hours, 11 minutes.

Luckily we didn't pay full price. I hoped for a film about one of the greatest warlord of all time but what I got was something about a crying homosexual wimp. || Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut.

Alexander is directed by Oliver Stone and Stone co-writes the screenplay with Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis. It stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins, Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Christopher Plummer. Music is by Vangelis and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.

Alexander is an historical epic based on the life of Alexander the Great.
Off the bat I have to say that this ""Final Cut"" version of the film is the only one I have seen. Upon its initial home format release - the first theatrical version - I lasted an hour and 15 minutes before growing restless and sought enjoyment elsewhere. Consequently as a massive fan of historical epics through the years, it has been a constant nagging itch for me to see Alexander in its entirety. So with Oliver Stone tinkering away with versions - convinced he has made a worthwhile epic - I finally delved in.

The Final Cut, as far as I'm aware, is a vast improvement on that savagely received theatrical release, well that is said by those who tried again instead of calling quits at the first production. Straight away I could see the difference, where once was a plodding first hour, now sits a vibrancy, with Stone seemingly saying that he can do great action and drama, just please hang around during all the historical chatter, sexual connotation, family strife and conquering machinations, and I will enthral you as a whole.

By his own admission, Stone reveals he took on a most complex historical character and in his eyes has made a film to befit such complexity. We get a splintered narrative, as we kick off with the crux of Alexander the Great, the leader, while Alexander's childhood and family forming is interspersed at various junctures. The battles are high in intensity and blood letting - exhilarating at times - but more crucially they let us engage with the tactical ""ahead of their time"" manoeuvres of Alexander the Great. This version mostly flows alright, and I got to feel how Alexander's mind was working in the process, even if come pics closure I didn't fully know the man.

Epically cast of course, some of them work, others not so much. Farrell's looked odd, in the way that Pitt's was in Troy (released this same year as Alexander), but apart from the accent issue he grows into the role and is fiercely committed. Jolie is just wrong for the role of domineering Olympias, worse still the scenes she does with Farrell are damp and threaten to derail the drama already built up. This latter point is more annoying given a great thread involving Dawson as Alexander's wife Roxanne is built up superbly, only to not be pulled until some drama very late in the play. The rest of the cast come through as ok for period flavours (expected for Hopkins, Plummer and Meyers, interesting as regards Leto).

This is not the life ambition masterpiece Stone wanted to make, even if he proclaims on the extras that he's happy and content with The Final Cut version. This cut still shows some cracks, but these are not seismic enough to hurt the film. For there's a lot of grandeur, blood stirring and thought gone into the production, and there's a lot to be said for that in this day and age of soulless cash making filmic exercises. Honourable failure then? Yes for sure, but a better film in this form than some may have thought possible back in 2004. 7/10 || _**Alexander’s conquests from Greece through Persia into northwestern India**_

After being tutored by Aristotle (Christopher Plumber), Alexander (Colin Farrell) takes over the Macedonian throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 after his father is assassinated (Val Kilmer). Over the next 13 years he, amazingly, conquers the Persian Empire and heads into India before finally turning back. Anthony Hopkins narrates as Ptolemy in his old age while Angelina Jolie plays Alexander’s snake-loving mother. Rosario Dawson plays his wife acquired in Bactria (in what is today part of Afghanistan).

Oliver Stone’s “Alexander” (2004) was a challenging undertaking and has many attributes despite not being as compelling as the contemporaneous “Troy.” It’s a colorful, entertaining epic with a great cast, awesome battle scenes, exotic locations/sets and a fine score by Vangelis. Naturally the storyline is not as one-dimensional as “Troy” seeing as how it involves a movable empire traveling across western Asia.

Historically-minded critics complain about the sequence where Alexander's fatigued soldiers request not to push further into India in favor of returning to Macedonia to see their families again. Alexander denies their request and does something that paints him as an unreasonable tyrant. In real life Alexander pondered their demands for a few days before agreeing to turn back and didn't execute anyone, which showed what a compassionate, merciful leader he was. However, this dubious sequence was simply Stone’s amalgamation of several mutinies during his conquests, which was placed at that particular point in the story for dramatic reasons. Besides, the movie certainly illustrates how Alexander brought the light of civilization to his foreign subjects and was accepting of their cultures, wanting to unify the many tribes under one banner, so to speak.

The scenes with Val Kilmer as Alexander’s father are entertaining while the ones with Angelina Jolie get boring after the first two or three. We get it: she loves snakes, hates her husband and thinks Zeus was Alexander’s father. Half of the sequences with Jolie could’ve been cut with no harm done, which would’ve helped momentum.

I didn’t have an issue with Alexander’s relationship with his childhood friend, Hephaistion (Jared Leto), since it’s clearly depicted as platonic in the sense of David and Jonathan in the Bible (see 2 Samuel 1:26). In the film the two are depicted as having a loving friendship wherein they occasionally hug and that’s it. I occasionally hug my best friend too, but I only sleep with my hot wife. 

As far as Alexander being bisexual, there’s zero historical proof of this. Yes, the kiss between Alexander and Bagoas (Francisco Bosch) was mentioned by Plutarch who lived in the Roman Empire 200 years later but, assuming it happened, it doesn't mean much. Some cultures in history kissed on the mouth when greeting, like Russians; it’s a social tradition and has nothing to do with sexual desire. To put it in perspective, imagine a filmmaker saying Trump was gay 2327 years in the future even though he had numerous women, marriages and children in his life. It's slanderous and can be attributed to Stone's catering to Liberal propaganda as opposed to historical reality. In short, he played the homosexual card to be ‘hip’ and give his movie Lefty ‘edge,’ but it backfired because it bombed at the box office. Still, the scene in question is brief and all it suggests is that Alexander experimented with homosexuality once after partying which, let’s face it, is something Greeks are known for (although Alexander would argue that he’s technically Macedonian, lol).

If you can ignore that glaring flaw, there’s a lot to appreciate in “Alexander” since Stone is unquestionably a top-of-the-line filmmaker. And the flick certainly inspires viewers to look up the real history.

The film was shot at Pinewood Studios & Shepperton Studios, both just west of London, as well as Morocco and Thailand (it’s pretty easy to figure out which scenes were done where).

There are no less than four cuts of the film available: The theatrical cut runs 2 hr 55 min (175 min); the 2005 Director’s Cut runs 2 hr 47 min (167 min); the so-called Final Cut from 2007 runs 3 hr 34 min (214 min); and the 2013 Ultimate Cut runs 3 hr 27 min (207 min).

The story is dark, certainly, but here is plenty of humour and shagging as the story unfolds. We are deliberately left to judge the extent to which ""Angel"" is being truthful, fanciful or just plain enthusiastic, and we are also offered a fairly unique take on how vengeance might be applied.

With that said, <em>'Christmas with the Kranks'</em> certainly starts brighter than it ends. I found fun in the opening portion, especially with the two leads. I didn't like the ending as much, I found it too sappy and untidy. The run time is short though, so that doesn't hamper things much.

Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis are enjoyable at the forefront of the film, with Dan Aykroyd joining them in that bracket with his arrival. The rest of the cast are fine. The plot isn't anything majorly fresh, but it entertained me enough. Fun film. || **_Harmless Christmas fun with Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd_**

When the Kranks’ daughter goes off to Peru after Thanksgiving, they decide to skip Christmas and spend the money on a Caribbean cruise, but their neighbors browbeat them for it. At the last minute, they decide they have to celebrate the holiday anyway, but how will their offended neighbors respond?

“Christmas With the Kranks” (2004) is one of those Christmas flicks that you can just roll with and enjoy or be a Scrooge and pick apart. As far as the latter goes, what’s wrong with NOT blowing money on Christmas lights and so on? Who joins the Peace Corps to help out the world and comes back in a month? If you can ignore such questions, it’s entertaining enough and warmhearted.

While everything is usually exaggerated in movies, especially ones like this, there ARE neighborhoods in which neighbors are coerced into displaying unison decorations for the holidays.

The movie runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in studios of the Los Angeles area, e.g. Downey, with second unit work done outside Chicago.

Based on Anne Holm’s novel “North to Freedom,”  “I Am David” (2003) is an indie drama/adventure by Paul Feig (writer/director). The movie effectively reminds us that there was an Iron Curtain from 1945-1989 and that crimes against humanity were pretty much business-as-usual for Communistic governments in USSR and Eastern Bloc countries. 

The tone is realistic and low-key with a balance of cruelty, mundaneness, tenderness and amusement. Don’t expect earth-shattering events. The human potential for ugliness & atrocities or beauty & goodwill is explored. There are stereotypes but so what? Stereotypes are stereotypes for good reason (they’re often TRUE). This is a testimony to those who escaped to freedom or died trying. It’s relatively moving, but in a subdued way.

You may like _Closer_ because of its flawed characters and their doomed relationships. I like it because it's square. The assorted combinations of love and friendship, scorn and resentment, among two males and two females are literally geometrical. Typically, the dependable love triangle pits three characters together, often a heterosexual convention establishing a male lead zig-zagging between two females, or a female lead choosing between two male suitors. What if we include an extra character? How many triangles can be made with four individuals? Four! And _Closer_ expertly covers them all. Next time you see it, draw out a square with each character occupying a corner. Then connect each of the couplings and triangles as they occur, beginning with Julia-Jude-Natalie. Jude falls for Natalie, introduces her to Julia who gets intimate with her camera. The Jude-Clive-Julia triangle is a clever one. Clive is introduced when Jude seduces him online pretending to be Julia who he meets at the aquarium. Often when a movie script or stage play adheres to a strict formula, it turns out flat and predictable. Not _Closer_. Applying a quadrangular network forces each character to cover all the bases, tagging up every way possible, pushing each juncture to the limit. || Writer ""Dan"" (Jude Law) likes to spend his evenings, when not with his American girlfriend ""Alice"" (Natalie Portman), teasing other blokes on sex-chat sites. One night he sets up doctor ""Larry"" (Clive Owen) with a promise to meet at the aquarium with ""Anna"". The horned up physician duly turns up, only to discover that meantime ""Dan"" has vengefully despatched the real ""Anna"" (Julia Roberts) - his part time lover/photographer, to unknowingly meet him instead. Embarrassed looks, sighs and ""Larry"" feels like a prat but, maybe the outwardly rather aloof ""Anna"" is interested? What now ensues is all a bit entertainingly far-fetched as an unwitting ménage-à-quatre emerges, becoming increasingly more intimate, then loving, then manipulatively toxic. Are any of these people destined to find happiness with any of the others. Quite frankly, do they deserve it and do we care? I've always found Owen as wooden as a washboard, but here - especially sharing the screen with an on-form Portman, he actually seems to be able to act (a little). His character, I found, comfortably the most odious of the four. Portman is the star of the show, though. Her portrayal of the needy sex kitten vacillates from provocative to desperate with a compelling ease. There's frequently some vitriol in the writing and the juggled storylines well paced as this story of unlikeable people moves along quickly. I think this might work well on stage, it has a characterful intensity to it, but on screen it's well worth a watch - even if it's all a pretty grim appraisal of human behaviour. || ""_What's so great about the truth?

Ocean's 11 was a slick movie, ultra cool and up there with the best as regards superior remakes. Ocean's Twelve is a waste, a film coasting on star appeal, a picture desperately trying to cram as much into its screenplay for fear of failing.

The plot shoots off in a number of directions, yet incredibly it still wastes most of the cast who have all been held over from Ocean's 11. This time Catherine Zeta-Jones joins in for some weighty dressage and Vincent Cassel is along as some sort of break-dancing Raffles dude. There's the odd in-joke that works, while the by-ply between the principal players (Clooney/Pitt/Damon) holds a modicum of entertainment value. However, once the dust settles on the myriad of schemes and scrapes, you are left with a sequel of a remake that is almost everything the other film was not. Boo. 4/10 || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend, at least for fans of heist movies.

This is a refreshing twist on heist movies, actually a combination of twists: payback revenge and criminal vs criminal.  This qualifies alternative motive to the crimes and because of the high stakes of competing thieves, we certainly get a complex heist.

The problem with this movie is that Benedict's move against them is the most interesting part, but is relegated to the beginning of the movie.  Most of the thief vs thief action is obscured to hide information from the audience, causing the movie to explain and even re-explain things that have, are, or will happen in the movie which, honestly, just pads the run time without making the movie more entertaining.

Without a doubt, the movie is still good, but not nearly as good as the first in the series. || No it's not good. I guess a lot of people like it, a lot of people hate it... and I fall into the hate it camp.

The problem is the plot, as so many others have no doubt pointed out. It makes sense on the surface level... and is so absolutely surface that when they try to add a twist or two it come across as an insult to the viewers.

It is one of those films where the entire responsibility is left on the writers, the plot just doesn't work for an Ocean's movie. The twists don't work. They tried to re-capture the magic of the first one, and, although the 3rd was able to do it well enough, 12 fell flat.

It was a simpler time and this film shows that. Barret Oliver as D.A.R.Y.L is a great main character , he his curious , oddly different and curiously smart...way too smart.

Falsely imprisoned for fratricide, Geoffrey Radcliffe (Vincent Price) takes a drug to make him invisible and thus escape. But as he sets about trying to clear his name, the side effect of the drug, gradual madness, threatens to usurp his plans.

It was never going to be up on the same level as the first film, The Invisible Man (1933), a genuine classic Universal Studio production that does justice to the great H.G. Wells writing. But instead of going for a lazy cash in, this sequel puts its own stamp on the invisible man premise and rounds out as an intelligent story with dashes of humour and sadness placed within. John Fulton's effects work is still amazing for the era, the cast list is boosted by the likes of Cecil Kellaway, Cedric Hardwicke and Nan Grey, while the finale is rewarding and worth waiting for.

Faults? A couple, such as the real murderer is revealed too quickly, thus we lose mystery momentum, and director Joe May often lets the pace sag. But these fail to stop the film from achieving its entertaining aims. It hardly constitutes horror as such, but there's good dramatic worth, berserker science and a cast making the material work. 7/10 || This is quite a good, if a little preposterous sequel. Vincent Price - or, that is, his voice - owns a successful mining business who is framed for killing his brother. With but two hours to go before he goes to the gallows, he turns to his friend who has devised a secret drug that can render the user invisible - but at a cost: continued exposure leads to madness. Once he has used the drug to escape from prison, he attempts to track down the real culprits from his close confederates - including Sir Cedric Hardwicke, John Sutton and a glamorous Nan Grey. The ever vigilant ""Inspector Sampson"" (an on-form Cecil Kellaway) is also on the trail of the transparent fugitive and all in all, we have a decently paced mystery thriller with some quite fun dialogue and special effects that bely that fact that this was made at the very start of WWII with not much of a budget."

The score is hauntingly effective as both battle prejudice, jealousy and enmity from high and low society; with plots for revolution against the rather despotic rule of Louis XI never far from the theme. Chaney's make up is not great, even by the standards of the day, and it would not look out of place in a ""Tarzan"" film, but that matters little to the wonderfully evocative efforts from director Wallace Worsley to enshrine this classical story of lust, power and sadness to film, with a narrative that emphasises more of the emotional aspects of the story than many of it's successors.

Now we know that the last encounter between the father and son had led to the latter banishing the former from their home, so what might the younger man do now? Much is made of the last few scenes from this film, but I think this story is more interesting when we consider that the real thrust of it has nothing at all to do with colour, but with a sort of cultural evolution. Of a rebellion against a religiosity that older, often themselves from persecuted generations, people are desperate to see continue despite it being something that their offspring cared far less about preserving. ""Jakie"" has been brought up by two loving and caring people, yet he has chosen a path that creates an insurmountable barrier - but need it be. Is it just belligerence? Intolerance? Ignorance? The acting, writing and the singing, unfortunately, don't really do it any favours - the sound quality and the production limitations render the numbers a bit wooden and sterile, but as a technical example of where films are heading - and of the freedoms of expression that they were soon to provide - it's worth a watch."

The humour is, mostly, cleverly woven into a story with plenty of action, and a little romance. Admittedly, it does feature some slapstick - not my favourite form of comedy - but it is timed to such perfection as to be more art than acting; and once the tumultuous storm descends at the end, the staging effects are cleverly devised and, of course - there are opportunities a-plenty for our young lad to learn how to tie complicated nautical knots; pilot the steamship and come to the rescue...!

Rico Bandello quickly rises through the gangster ranks, earning himself the nick-name of Little Caesar. As he sets his sights on the top boss job held by Pete Montana, Rico knows the heat is closing in - fast.

Though not the first gangster picture to hit the big screen, Little Caesar is undeniably one of the genres landmark pictures. Adapted from W.R. Burnett's (High Sierra) Al Capone inspired novel, Little Caesar would go on to influence many of the genre highlights that followed, while in the process typecasting its star and icon, Edward G. Robinson. What is perhaps the first striking thing about viewing the film now is actually just how un-violent it is in context to what would follow it, and yet it never needs to be because this is not just about a violent uprising. With the advent of sound proving to be a winner with the fact that it's set outside of prison walls. The gangster genre by and large up to this point in 1931 consisted of mob characters behind bars, the sight of Rico about town amongst the noisy hustle and bustle surely would have depression jaded cinema goers, director Mervyn LeRoy exploits this by utilising opened the eyes and ears of the paying public.

I wasn't around back then so have no on the spot frame of reference, but the professional critics point to many allegories that reside within Little Caesar's structure. Talk of paranoias and conformities during economic collapse, which are for sure points of reference for those so inclined to analyse and dissect Caesar as a whole. Yet to me it's a gangster picture first and foremost, outlaying the rise and fall of a very dubious man with big ideals above his relatively small social standing. Rico has ruthless violence constantly itching to burst out, add in definite hints of sexual ambiguity and this makes him a troubling yet most intriguing character. That it works so well obviously is down to Edward G. Robinson's portrayal, big bulging eyes and snappy slang phrases (this themselves must have really hit a chord with the viewersback in the day), Robinson gives the performance that so many have imitated over the years, where he probably defined the archetype in the process.

It does look a little dated now, but of course that is only natural,  but this is a powerful film that rises above merely being a hoodlum based piece. Producer Darryl Zanuck wanted something different for this burgeoning genre, and with the might of Warners revelling in the power of the talkie movie, they all crafted one hell of a picture that enthrals still today as much as it has influenced through the decades. Things most definitely changed with Little Caesar. 8/10 || Edward G. Robinson is great in this early gangster talkie. He is ""Rico"", a clever and ambitious petty thief who decides it's time to move to the big city. Initially, he goes to work for ""Sam Vettori"" (Stanley Fields) but not long after, the local Crime Commissioner ""McClure"" is assassinated. Luckily, his buddy ""Joe Massara"" (Douglas Fairbanks Jr"") is working at that self same club, and manages to warn ""Rico"" ahead of the subsequent police crackdown. It is now that he starts to smell an opportunity. First his boss, then the bigger boss ""Pete Montana"" (Ralph Ince) are toppled. Even his pal ""Joe"" and his gal ""Olga"" (Glenda Farrell) are not immune from his increasingly megalomanic tendencies. The thing I didn't especially like about this film is the ending - it is just a little too tame, but otherwise this is a solid effort from Mervyn LeRoy that really did bring out the best in Robinson with a quickly paced and enjoyable film."

Coming in at just over a quarter of an hour, I've spent longer watching the last two minutes of a basketball game when I didn't even care about who won. 

While I don't think it was a waste of my time, it didn't really add anything to my day, either. Maybe I'll have to come back and review this if the film sticks with me, but I can't imagine this will do so. It's not my first experience with surrealism, and I'm certainly not the type to ponder of the concept for hours, especially not recently. I'd also argue that this film does nothing to provoke thought on its own. It might be a guiding point to long sessions of thought regarding existence and meaning, but I'm not sure how many people would get there without reading up on the film and surrealism at the least.

Out of MGM, Fury is directed by Fritz Lang and stars Spencer Tracy and Sylvia Sidney and features Walter Abel, Bruce Cabot, Edward Ellis and Walter Brennan in support. It's adapted by Lang and Bartlett Cormack from the story ""Mob Rule"" written by Norman Krasna. Loosely based around the events that surrounded both the ""Brooke Hart"" murder in 1933 and the ""Lindbergh"" kidnapping/murder case in 1932, the story sees Tracy as Joe Wilson, an innocent man who is jailed and apparently killed in a fire started by a rampaging lynch mob. However, as the lynch mob go on trial for his murder, Joe surfaces but is twisted by thoughts of revenge on those who happily watched him burn.

Widely and rightly considered a classic, this first Hollywood outing from director Fritz Lang is a remarkable look at mob violence and one man's limit pushed to its breaking point - and then some. That Lang survived studio interference to craft such a penetrating study of injustice is a minor miracle. Fury is neatly put together as a story, the calm before the storm as Joe & Kath are brought to us as the happy face of Americana. Then it's the middle section as rumours run out of control, the dangers of idle prattling rammed home as things start to escalate out of control - culminating in the savage assault on the jail (a gusto infused action sequence indeed). Then the fall out of mob rule actions, the court case and Joe's malevolent force of vengeance, that in turn comes under scrutiny.

The film was said to have been Lang's favourite American film, which is understandable given it bares all his trademarks. The expressionistic touches, shadow play dalliances and supreme cross-cutting between tormentors and the tormented, for sure this is prime Lang, with no frame wasted. While it's no stretch of the imagination to think that Lang, having fled Nazi Germany, was pondering what he left behind as he moulded the picture together. Of the cast, Tracy is majestic as our main protagonist, while Sidney is brightly big eyed and hugely effective as the moral centre of Joe's universe.

Controversial at the time, the film has naturally lost some of that controversial power over the decades. However, as the film points out with the lynching statistics, there was once a time when inhumanity was able to rear its ugly head in the blink of an eye. Fury serves to remind two-fold that not only is it a potent social commentary, but also that it's a damn fine piece of skilled cinema. 9/10"

In comparison to the 1921 silent version, Cukor's a much better director, though Rudolph Valentino's better as Armand Duval. Both versions are intriguingly different, and Henry Daniell's just great as the villainous Baron. Essential viewing, especially for fans of Garbo and classic tearjerker films. || Greta Garbo ""Marguerite"" is on wonderfully seductive form in this classy adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' story. She is the comfortably off courtesan kept by the wealthy ""Baron de Varville"" (Henry Daniell) who is introduced to the handsome ""Armand"" (Robert Taylor). He falls for her hook, line and sinker - but she isn't just going to take him in her arms. He is young, handsome, naive - and skint, but he has a certain charm! Determination is also one of his qualities as he vows to take her away from it all to a quite recluse in the country where she can recover from a mysterious ailment. The intervention of the young man's father (Lionel Barrymore), puts a fly in this ointment - he pleads with her not to toy with his son's affections, nor to tarnish his reputation - and she returns to her old beau and his chequebook... It's the ultimate menage-à-trois. The witty and popular woman having to face the grim choice of a loveless relationship, or a penniless one... Cukor sets a high standard; he allows the story to evolve slowly and delicately. The production looks great with wonderful attention to detail, and there is a chemistry between Garbo and the very young Taylor that is quite enthralling. Needless to say, Daniell is his usual dastardly self as the Baron, and Jessie Ralph also detersives notices as ""Nanine"". Although the 1926, much shorter, version of this is interesting - it features Paul Robeson - this is my favourite version by far."

Wuthering Heights is directed by William Wyler and adapted to screenplay by Charles MacArthur & Ben Hecht from the novel of the same name written by Emily Bronte. It stars Merle Oberon, Laurence Olivier, David Niven, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Flora Robson. Music is scored by Alfred Newman and cinematography is by Gregg Toland.

OK, so it's only a part of Bronte's classic novel, and yes some liberties have been taken, but Wuthering Heights is still a wonderfully involving picture. Expertly played by the actors and directed with adroitness, it's a haunting tale of tragedy, love and passions never to be sated. Moodily photographed by Toland, who won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in the process, tale unfolds in flashback style that's aided by retrospect narration from Robson's wily house keeper Ellen Dean. Characters are perfectly formed as children, expanded upon into adulthood; with Olivier and Oberon coming into their own on the acting front, then the story reaches its denouement to leave the viewer flushed with emotion. All given dramatic impetus by Alfred Newman's sweeping score.

1939 was a stellar year for classic cinema, Wuthering Heights is deservedly a part of that upper echelon number. Brilliant. 9/10 || I venture to suggest that this wonderfully evocative adaptation of Emily Brontë's classic story will never be surpassed. The novel is essentially a tale of lost love and the trio of Merle Oberon (""Cathy""), Laurence Olivier (""Heathcliffe"") and David Niven (""Edgar"") manage to encapsulate all the emotions of sadness, of bitterness and of despair superbly. ""Heathcliffe"" is the abandoned boy brought to the home of the wealthy ""Earnshaw"" family by Cecil Kellaway where he gradually falls in love with daughter ""Cathy"". When the old man dies, his son ""Hindley"" (Hugh Williams) inherits, treating ""Heathcliffe"" as little better than a servant before he eventually drives him away. When he returns wealthy, many years later, he discovers ""Cathy"" now married to the debonair, if rather dull, Niven. What happens now is the stuff of English literature at it's most enigmatically dramatic. Whilst the screenplay does skim over much of the detailed characterisations, and some of the sub-plot from the book, it nonetheless captures the spirit of the story in both an atmospheric and charismatic fashion - with Flora Robson at her melancholic best as the recounter of our tale. Oberon and Olivier are excellent at conveying the sense of distress and longing and the cinematography of the bleak, but liberating, Yorkshire Moors all contribute to an engrossing, really rather sad story."

They're obviously meant for each other, but then tragedy strikes, and their ideal life together is no more.

The great Ronald Colman and the lovely Greer Garson are fantastic together.  No one was more perfectly suited to this hard-hitting romantic drama than these two.  In the novel by James Hilton, Smithy, the character played by Colman in the film, is supposed to be somewhere in his mid-twenties, while Colman was about fifty when he did this.  But since it's Ronald Colman, hey, let's face it: no one in their right mind is going to be complaining.  Plus, it helps that the span of time covered in the story is at least ten or twenty years.


The plot is so tricky and involved, you must pay close attention and remain awake and alert throughout the course of the film.  But every moment is worth it.  As you watch, you want nothing more than to see these two wonderful people find happiness together.

The coat is the thread (no pun, intended) linking the themes of greed, ambition, deceit, lies, love, aspiration and decency; but it also has some morals of it's own. As with many a talisman, it supports the good and delivers evil on those deserving - and the five stories, especially Laughton and Robinson's are short but engaging reviews of the aspirations and sins of it's owners.

After viewing this comic masterpiece I find during my research that the real miracle here is that the film ever got made in the first place! Coming as it did in 1944 wartime the film literally takes the rise out of everything held so wholesome in those troubled times. Preston Sturges has in his sights promiscuous servicemen, small town mentality, and the church, and it all makes for a complete riotous piece of work. Throw into the pot that Sturges cast the pristine Betty Hutton as a man mad airhead with few morals of note, well you can see that Sturges was pushing the censors as far as he could.

Trudy Kockenlocker (Huton) gets drunk one night and has a night of passion with a soldier, in the morning she has sketchy recollections but thinks she may have married the guy? and not only that, she then falls pregnant.  Of course sure enough the soldier has long since gone as well. This turn of events is a big no no and Trudy's on & off boyfriend Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken) gets landed with the tag of being the Father. This sets us on an hilarious journey as Norval winds up being sought after by the authorities for a number of crimes he is oblivious to committing, thus is no hope for the couple unless a miracle can save them...

The performances here are sublime, both Hutton & Bracken seem to be having a competition to see who can out zany the other the best in each scene, and it really results in comedy gold. All the other actors give special shows as well, William Demarest is top dollar as Trudy's Policeman Father, Brian Donlevy, Diana Lynn & Akim Tamaroff are all in on the fun, and no frame is wasted, no line is a throw away, it's all right on the money. The direction is as flawless as the writing and it is just further proof that Preston Sturges was one of the greatest comedy directors to have ever worked. If you aren't holding your sides in during the final scenes here then you need to seek medical help immediately, either that or pray for a miracle...

10/10 in every respect."

We are in the college town of Harper, Connecticut, one day a man known only as Wilson arrives, he's a member of the War Crimes Commission, in short he's a Nazi Hunter. On his radar is the man thought to have invented the Nazi Death Camps, Franz Kindler, surely such a despicable and low human being is not residing in this lovely little place?

The Stranger finds director (and star) Orson Welles fusing two rather interesting facts, fact one is that this picture, coming at a time when Welles was really struggling as a viable artist, is one of his most conventional pictures, fact two is that it's also one of his finest achievements. All Welles' traits are here, the expert use of shadows and lights, tricksy camera angles, buildings carrying auras. A clock tower at the centre of the piece is a foreboding character all by itself, listen out for the clock tower dongs and I swear to you they sound like a death knell beckoning us in to its belly, this is Welles crafting wonderful atmospherics to enhance the mood in this small and picturesque town. 

Yet it's probably with his acting performance that he achieves the best rewards, it's made clear to the viewers from the off that Welles is the villain of the piece, it's not in question, the issue is if he can avoid and escape the clutches of Edward G Robinson's determined Wilson?. Here Welles excels because this is no cartoon cut out Nazi portrayal, this is cold and calculating stuff, cynical with devilment seeping from his pores, he arrogantly believes that he is just and correct at every turn. Loretta Young (Mary Longstreet) plays off of Welles very well, on the surface it looked like she wasn't being asked to be anything more than a foolish love interest, but as the last quarter arrives she gets some meat to chew on and aided by Robinson in perfectly restrained form, gives us a finale that in true Welles tradition is as memorable as it is unfeasibly gorgeous. 

It's a fitting end to a truly great picture, highly recommended viewing, tight, tense and terrific. 9/10 || This taut and suspenseful thriller finds a devilishly clever Edward G. Robinson (""Mr. Wilson"") on the trail of the Nazi who allegedly devised the whole concept of mass annihilation in the concentration camps. Having released one of his erstwhile minions ""Meinike"", he hopes that he will lead to him the big fish. Well he does, sort of - but suddenly disappears in a small town leaving ""Wilson"" with little to go on but his target's infatuation with all things horological. Enter a typical, recently married, couple - the ""Rankins"" (Orson Welles & Loretta Young) on the surface, a perfectly average pair but one whom ""Wilson"" suspects has a sinister past and so he sets out to prove this. Welles is not great here, but workmanlike with this acting performance (he directed this too); Young a little too over-the top an times, but the last 20 minutes are gripping and psychologically charged - there is a palpable feeling of evil and menace as ""Wilson"" cleverly manipulates the situation to try to reel in his catch. Welles fares better with the direction - he builds a tension that, even though we know fairly early on who is whom - keeps us interested right til the end."

Carrol Naish, Edward Arnold",George Sidney,"musical, annie oakley, sharpshooter, wild west show","Annie get your gun, your man and lift the ceiling off of those rafters.

Out of MGM, Annie Get Your Gun is primarily directed by George Sidney and adapted for the screen by Sidney Sheldon from the book written by Dorothy & Herbert Fields. It stars Betty Hutton, Howard Keel, Benay Venuta, Louis Calhern & J. Carrol Naish. Music is by Irving Berlin and photography is by Charles Rosher. It is a Technicolor production. It's loosely based on the life of sharpshooting Annie Oakley and this film production comes after the immense success of the stage play that began its run in 1946. Plot sees Hutton as Annie Oakley, a simple backwoods kinda girl, who after beating famed sharpshooter Frank Butler (Keel) in a contest, goes on to be world famous. But with fame comes tribulations, not least is that she has a thing for Frank.

Ebullient and colorful musical that asks you to leave history at the door and just enjoy the ride. The film famously had a troubled production, Judy Garland (Annie) had to leave due to ill health, Frank Morgan (Buffalo Bill) passed away and George Sidney was the third director to work on the film after Busby Berkeley and Charles Walters had left the lot. Even after the new cast and team reconvened there was bad feeling on set, with most of it aimed towards Hutton purely because she had replaced Garland. Post the film's major success, a dispute between MGM and Irving Berlin meant the film was pulled from circulation in 1973 and wasn't seen again till 2000. Thankfully since then a whole new era of musical fans can now enjoy, along with the older supporters, this marvellous piece of entertainment. With show stopping tunes like ""Doin' What Comes Natur'lly"", ""You Can't Get a Man With a Gun"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and ""Anything you Can Do"" bursting out from the screen like rays of sunshine, it's film to light up the darkest of days when you're feeling blue. Oh and for the record, Hutton is an absolute delight, attacking the lead role with a zest that belies the bad time she was getting off camera. Great comic timing, too. 8/10"

Unlike the 1937 version; this becomes more of a romance - as you might expect given the leading performers; and as such it loses much of it's grittiness and the tension is much more tied to their relationship than to their exploits in hostile territory.

Noisy and intimidating but no real danger to anyone, which is just as well because the sheriff ""Bleeker"" (Robert Keith) is about as effective as a chocolate teapot. Anyway, ""Strabler"" takes a bit of a shine to local gal ""Kathie"" (Mary Murphy) but that all changes when he discovers she is the daughter of the policeman. He is soon otherwise distracted by the arrival of the ""Beetles"" - a group of erstwhile pals lead by ""Chino"" (Lee Marvin). Old grudges and testosterone take over and what starts as an uneasy truce soon borders on open warfare - helped by local vigilante ""Charlie"" (Hugh Sanders) who is trying to goad the townsfolk into taking action of their own. It is odd to say this about an whole town, but there is a certain claustrophobia to this drama. The gangs' grip on the place is intimidating to watch, much less to have to live in, and Brando and Marvin are strong sparring partners. The build up is tense and you can sense the palpable apprehension amongst the populace as our anticipated denouement looms. Thing is, though, the interventions of Murphy and an unwillingness from director Laslo Benedek to maximise the peril here, means that the film quite suddenly stops being menacing and starts being quite soppy. It didn't need a battle royal at the end, but somehow the conclusion just underwhelmed and was more of a damp squib. There is a paucity of dialogue - which always suited Brando, and the photography with/on the bikes works really well enhancing the tautness of the first half hour, but then it just peters out...

The action unfolds in story-telling within story-telling. This is a film about truth. Whose truth? That is the unfoldment. In a perverted way, this amazing piece of work has become predictive of Western corporate banking. Perhaps you'll see what I mean at the end of the film. || **It's a film that might scare modern audiences a bit, but it deserves the opportunity we want to give it.**

In addition to having a very strong film industry, Japan is a country with a very rich past that we in the West tend to devalue. A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese.

The film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual.

The film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy.

The film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama. On a technical level, I think it's impossible to avoid noticing the quality of the sets and filming locations, as well as the sharpness and quality of the cinematography."

It's a small ship with a big task. Sail round the world to Tahiti and procure some breadfruit trees then take them to the Caribbean for use a fodder for the slaves. Right from the outset, we realise that Captain Bligh (Trevor Howard) is not a man to mess with. He is a brutal authoritarian who punishes the slightest of misdemeanours from his crew mercilessly. As the voyage proceeds, fresh water runs short and the food starts to move about the plate by itself, the men turn to Lt. Christian (Brando) for some sort of relief. The two officers are pretty much at odds from the start with the flamboyant subordinate quite a contrast to the ship's more hardened master. It's their arrival on the island that finally causes the men to reach breaking point and for Christian to execute the unthinkable in maritime law. The story is history, so we now what happens as Howard turns in a remarkably convincing effort - his deep and gravelly voice helps too - as the commander who would rather water the trees than his men. Richard Harris, Hugh Griffith and a face of recognisable Britons pad out the crew effectively and the aesthetics of the production, especially at sea, are powerfully illustrative of the dangers to the sailors of the sea and their taskmaster. It does fall away a little towards the Pitcairn aspects of the story, and I just didn't love Brando's accent/overly theatrical effort - but is still well worth a watch."

Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte is directed by Robert Aldrich and written by Henry Farrell and Lukas Heller. It stars Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Joseph Cotton, Agnes Moorehead, Cecil Kellaway and Mary Astor. Music is by Frank De Vol and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc.
 
It’s 1927, the Louisiana plantation home of Sam Hollis (Victor Buono), and Charlotte Hollis (Davis) is having an affair with a married man, John Mayhew (Bruce Dern). After a heated argument between Sam and John, John is brutally slain by an unseen assailant, only Charlotte appears on the scene covered in blood. Then it’s the present day and just Charlotte and her house keeper, Velma (Moorehead) live at the Hollis mansion, Sam having passed away many years ago. Charlotte is mentally scarred from the echoes of the past, she’s a recluse and seen by the townsfolk as the local mental case. As developers try to plough a road through the Hollis home, Charlotte sends for her cousin Miriam (Havilland), but then strange things start happening and Charlotte might once and for all tip over the edge.
 
A bit long at 2 hours 13 minutes and a bit too bonkers at times, Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte still comes out as glorious Guignol entertainment. The setting is perfect, a Baton Rouge locale of whispering trees and ominous foliage, the Hollis mansion a place of dark secrets, shadowy halls and mental disintegration. Biroc’s black and white photography seems to revel in the misery and emotional turmoil that blows about the place, and the brilliant Aldrich unleashes delirious turns from Davis and Moorehead as the others play perfectly restrained foil. There’s a strong mystery element driving the plot forward, because what we think is true may not actually be the case? The narrative deftly reveals back stories as film progresses, hints at means and motives dangle tantalisingly in the Gothic tinged air, and then the finale doesn’t disappoint, it has some surprises in store and closes the picture down handsomely.

The title does the film no favours at all because it kind of reeks of daft Z movie origins, in fact if I hadn't looked up some research on the film prior to viewing it, I would have expected a comedy! This is an interesting variant on the much loved Daniel Defoe story about Robinson Crusoe, only as the title suggests, this is set on Mars. Whilst orbiting Mars, Commander Kit Draper is forced to eject and is stranded on Mars with only his wits and Mona the monkey for company. Here he has to source all the basic ingredients to stay alive, but he finds that mans need for companionship can trouble the mind greatly, and not only that, he finds that he is not alone after all, and the visitors that turn up are not exactly of the friendly kind..

This is a very solid and intelligent sci-fi picture, dealing with isolation and the will to stay alive, Robinson Crusoe On Mars is very much a film that relies on story over style, that it succeeds is with much credit to Paul Mantee as the lonesome Draper, carrying the film for two thirds on his own (except for the wonderful Mona Monkey of course), he infuses emotion and credibility in abundance to lift the film way above average. 7.5/10 || Batman dies.
But he dies early in this film, so that isn't a spoiler.
This is one of those ""think piece sci-fi"" films from the sixties and seventies. It's sort of a sister piece to films like ""Silent Running"", ""The Andromeda Strain"", and a few others that go more into psychology than action.
Still, there is action, or at least the semblance of action due to smart writing and directing.
An astronaut finds himself alone on Mars after Batman dies. Okay, it isn't Batman, but it is Adam West.
We're wondering if he is imagining the strange things going on, or if they're real. And there are strange things happening.
And those ""strange things"" get wilder and wilder and more sinister, but is this a dying man's last dream? Or is it real? We're left with believing it is real."

From one perspective it's a fight for freedom, from the other a response to dangerous insurrectionism. What makes this drama stand out is the degree of impartiality with which it depicts the story. The French are still licking their wounds after leaving their Indo-Chinese empire and are desperate to avoid another defeat here. The local population are poorly educated and hopelessly outgunned but have the advantage of mobility and surprise as they seek to emulate their Oriental contemporaries. Neither side shies away from acts of brutality and that's depicted poignantly here with anyone in uniform a target for the rebels and any one at all a target by way of response. It has the feel of a docu-drama to it, with the characterisations of ""La Ponte"" (Brahim Hadjadj) and ""Col. Mathieu"" (Jean Martin) acting well as a conduit for both sides of a story that saw losers on every side and tested the humanity of each as any semblance of decency or a code of war went swiftly by the board. It's not just both sides here that are exposed to judgment, but the pretty hapless UN doesn't really come off any better (perhaps restricted by a potential French veto?). The photography and visual effects are very effective at presenting us with a largely urban war zone in which collateral damage was inevitable, and seemingly a price both parties were prepared to pay. The history of the scenario and it's results are fact, but Gillo Pontecorvo uses quite a considerable degree of creativity and sensitivity in demonstrating just how desperate times can result in desperate measures - and maybe even a little grudging respect. At times, the violence is claustrophobically presented and it's never an easy watch."

When dealing with a show I loved as a kid, I refuse to try to separate the adult viewer and rate it more harshly. The memory and the childish feelings I had for it are wrapped up in its value for me. For example, I am an atheist, so the nativity story doesn’t carry a religious message for me, but I can appreciate its function in the story, and I read a lot of other fictional mythical origin stories without being cynical.

It is funny that our minds connect the jazz theme with Christmas, when it is, well, jazz. Also an oddity that Bill Melendez was the producer, director and voice (such as it was) for Snoopy. They used children for a lot of the voices, rather than adults simulating child voices. 

It would be interesting to learn how children nowadays respond to seeing this old show for the first time, after being exposed to many other modern shows and animation techniques, video games, etc. || This is about the real meaning of Christmas...and the few haters of it are the pretentious that really don't like Christmas movies and are prejudiced against religion.

If you get beyond that, it's a heart-warming story with a lot of little sub stories to keep kids and adults with ADHD focused on the screen.

Originally intended as a searing epic by director Sam Peckinpah, Major Dundee was taken away from his guiding hands post production and edited into an almost incoherent mess. Here in the new millennium we are able to see a restoration of the film with added scenes that gives the film are more cohesive structure, and yes it improves the film ten fold because the characters have flesh on their bones. Yet still we are only really glimpsing three parts of Peckinpah's vision since there is another 30 minutes of film seemingly lost forever, and that is a crying shame because this film could have been a Western masterpiece had it been allowed to flourish.

There is still a lot to enjoy here though, Major Dundee leads a rag tag army of Union soldiers, Confederate rebels, convicts, loonies, and a one armed James Coburn into Mexico to hunt down an Apache army who are responsible for deadly attacks on U.S. bases in Texas. It's not so much ""The Dirty Dozen"", but more like the dirty army! And in the main here it's the fractious nature of this assembled army that gives the film its vigour and selling point. Almost certainly the film is one of the forerunners of Vietnam allegories, and like it or not it's the thematic undercurrent of soldiers under prepared that keeps the pic above average.

The cast are fine, it's like a roll call for the macho assembly, Charlton Heston is Dundee, a big square jawed brash man who tries to keep this army in line whilst dealing with his own nagging ego. Richard Harris owns the film as Tyreen, his on going personal war with Dundee gives the film added impetus. James Coburn plays a very interesting character, but it's a character that demands more time on screen than we actually get (perhaps the victim of the cretinous cuts?), and it leaves a hankering feeling that never quite leaves you.

It's a fine journey, it's a fine character piece, and everyone also note that the wide screen shoot is gorgeous, but at the end of the day Major Dundee is only hinting at the genius that would deliver The Wild Bunch four years down the line and Straw Dogs two years later, but it could have been so very different...

Forgive them for they know not what they do. 7/10 || ***Harsh, dense Peckinpah Western with Charlton Heston, Richard Harris and James Coburn*** 

A disgraced Major (Charlton Heston) guilty of making a tactical error at Gettysburg is assigned to command a dull P.O.W. camp in the New Mexican Territory. After some ranchers and a cavalry unit are massacred, the glory-seeking Dundee (Heston) seizes the opportunity by illegally crossing into Mexico to wipe out the Native raiders with a dubious team consisting of Union troops, Confederate prisoners, civilian mercenaries and a couple scouts. Richard Harris makes his debut as the dashing leader of the Confederates while James Coburn plays the lead scout. Brock Peters appears as the black sergeant whereas Ben Johnson and Warren Oates play Rebel soldiers.

This was director Sam Peckinpah’s third Western after “The Deadly Companions” (1961) and “Ride the High Country” (1962); and would be followed up by the heralded “The Wild Bunch” (1969). It’s not as good as “Ride,” but it’s superior to “Companions” and “Bunch” IMHO. The main reason I don’t favor “Bunch” is because it’s about a bunch of dirtbag thugs for whom I could care less. “Dundee,” by contrast, has several interesting, more worthy, protagonists.

The script was loosely based on historical examples (e.g. the Dakota War of 1862) mixed with the plot of Moby-Dick, as well as elements of Lawrence of Arabia and classic John Wayne/Ford Westerns. The questionable group assembled to invade Mexico is a microcosm of the USA with the conflict between Northern and Southern soldiers, the rising complication of freed blacks, civilians & their guns and an AmerIndian scout.

There’s a depth to the proceedings that makes the first half almost impenetrable. But, if you concentrate, there are a lot of riches to glean and you can’t beat the superlative cast with Heston and Harris shining in their conflicting roles. Meanwhile Senta Berger and Begoña Palacios are noteworthy on the female front.

The movie reflects the harsh realities of horse militarists on a mission in the Southwestern wilderness in the late 1800s. But it was reportedly a troubled production (of course, which large-scale production isn’t?). At one point Peckinpah got too dictatorial during the filming of a particular scene and disrespected Heston from afar with rude verbiage. Charlton, on horseback, bolted toward the director with saber drawn to which the much smaller director took off out of Heston’s reach.

The theatrical release ran 2 hours, 3 minutes while the restored 2005 version added 13 minutes and featured an (optional) new score, which is the version I viewed. The movie was shot entirely in Mexico.

GRADE: B/B- || There were quite a few westerns made that featured famous actors - one in blue, the other in grey, having to work together after the end of the American Civil war. This one pitches Charlton Heston as the eponymous leader of a troop tasked with bringing to heel some Apache who are raiding from Mexico. When I say troop, I really mean a disparate bunch of ill-disciplined ne'er-do-wells, and only the strength of character of Heston and his Confederate opposite number ""Tyreen"" (Richard Harris) is going to get them across the border to tackle their formidable foe. Oh - and this whole thing is illegal... What now ensues is quite an engaging battle of personalities between Harris and Heston, with a good ensemble effort from the likes of James Coburn, Slim Pickens and Jim Hutton, that delivers an episodic style adventure movie with little jeopardy but plenty of action, quippy dialogue and some big hitting actors. It's a bit on the long side, it takes a while to heat up, but when it does there is plenty to keep it moving along apace. Not great, nor is this anyone's best work, but the cinematography is grand and the story is good."

It has an octuple, episodic, narrative that marries his own development as a man and an artist with the quite literally revolutionary goings on as his country is, frequently quite brutally, coming into some some semblance of cohesive existence. It focuses on the role of the church in this most religious, and superstitious, of nations and offers us a much less aggressive correlation between the communist Soviet threads so often prevalent in sate backed movies made at the time and of those iconic figures so prominent in Russian history. The imagery is creatively bamboozling at times; the story doesn't follow any linear a-b-c narrative and we are presented with an oblique interpretation not just of his life, but of life in an embryonic nation that is emerging from an almost primitive existence - and that is fascinating (if not always easy to follow and/or comprehend). It is the vision of the man in the title, but also of the man behind the camera - a startlingly effective sequence of beautifully photographed concepts that offer layers of complexities depicting human nature in pretty much all of it's guises. Surprisingly, for a film in excess of three hours, it flows effortlessly with Anatoliy Solonitsyn conveying an overwhelming sense of humanity with his character.

Robert Bresson uses this scenario to compare and contrast the treatment of this animal with the way people treat each other - generous and engaging when they want something; brutal and selfish when they have or don't want it any more. This film offers us a depressing, yet curiously uplifting at times, view of the fickleness of youth and the intolerance of age - subtly.

Point Blank is directed by John Boorman and collectively adapted to screenplay by Alexander Jacobs, David Newhouse and Rafe Newhouse from the novel The Hunter written by Richard Stark. It stars Lee Marvin, Angie Dickinson, Keenan Wynn, Carroll O'Connor, Lloyd Bochner and Michael Strong. Music is by Johnny Mandel and the Panavision cinematography (in Metrocolor) is by Philip H. Lathrop.

Betrayed by wife and friend during a robbery, Walker (Marvin) is left dying on a stone cold cell floor at closed down Alcatraz...

Pure neo-noir, a film that could be argued was ahead of its time, given that it wouldn't find a fan base until many years later. Yet it deserves to be bracketed as a benchmark for the second phase of noir, a shining light of the neo world, experimenting with techniques whilst beating a true film noir heart.

The story is deliciously biting, pumped full of betrayals and double crosses, fatales and revenge, death and destruction. It even has a trick in the tale, ambiguity. It all plays out in a boldly coloured Los Angeles, the photography sparkles as Mandel lays an elegiacal and haunting musical score over the various stages of the drama. The talented Boorman has a field day with the elements of time, shunting various strands of the story around with sequences that at first glance seem out of place, but actually are perfect in context to what is narratively happening, the director gleefully toying with audience expectations. While suffice to say angles are tilted and close ups broadened to further style the pic.

Then there is Walker, a single minded phantom type character, played with grace and menace by Marvin - who better to trawl the Los Angeles underworld with than Marv? This guy only wants what he is owed from the robbery, nothing more, nothing less, but if the meagre reward is not forthcoming, people are going to pay with something more precious than cash. His mission is both heroic and tragic, with Boorman asking the viewers to improvise their thought process about what it all inevitably means. Funding the fuel around Marvin are good players providing slink, sleaze and suspicion.

Deliberate pacing isn't for everyone, neither is stylised violence and stylish directorial trickery, but for those who dine at said tables, Point Blank, and Walker the man, is for you. 9/10"

Jean-Luc Godard's <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i> would delight one set of viewers and infuriate another. How does one even give a star rating to this?

In May 1968, Jean-Luc Godard was permitted to film the Rolling Stones over several days in a London studio as they gradually fleshed out their now classic song ""Sympathy for the Devil"", and so one might expect simply a documentary about a rock band's creative process. However, over the last year Godard had broken ties with conventional cinema (even in its zany French New Wave form) and was now interested in using film to agitate for the Maoist philosophy that he had latched onto as the Zeitgeist for this era. Consequently, hardly have we seen the Stones at work before Godard cuts to completely different footage centered around the reading of strident political texts. Over the course of the film we repeatedly go back and forth between the Rolling Stones in the studio and political shots: Black Panthers sitting around a junkyard and advocating revolution, a woman spray-painting Maoist slogans over London walls, a comic book shop as a metaphor for American imperialism, etc.

Even if the juxtaposition is jarring and indeed rather silly, the Rolling Stones portion of the film is satisfying for fans of this music. The viewer gets a sense of how the song ""Sympathy for the Devil"" went from merely a product of Jagger's imagination that he has to teach Keith Richards to ultimately the ample rendition with conga and backing-vocals that was finally released. Probably unbeknownst to Godard himself at the time, the film also serves as a portrait of Brian Jones' breakdown only about a year before his death: he's sometimes present in the studio, but he just sits in the corner, neglected by his bandmates and strumming a guitar that isn't even miked.

The rest of the Stones, however, are clearly enjoying themselves. It's amusing how Jagger's English working-class accent, itself quite fake, immediately shifts to an imitation of some old American bluesman as soon as the recording of each take starts; rarely have I got such a vivid sense of how much blues meant to this generation of English youth. The last shot of the band in the film, presumably after recording wrapped on ""Sympathy of the Devil"", is a longish jam session. Another delight of this film for music lovers is that we can see in full colour how recording studios looked in the 1960s with the technology and sound insulation strategies of that era. (Everyone's smoking constantly, too. The place must have smelled like an ashtray).

What, then, of the political bits? These would weird out anyone not familiar with Godard's earlier work of the late 1960s, but if one watches his films chronologically, then there is a clear progression from WEEKEND, his last relatively conventional film: again we see a breakdown of 1960s consumerist society depicted through militants holding guns versus prostrate figures red with (intentionally very fake) blood. Anne Wiazemsky, who had acted in Godard's immediately preceding films as a symbol of rebellious youth and now the director's second wife, appears as the personification ""Eve Democracy"". Unable to answer anything to her interlocutor's questions but ""Yes"" or ""No"", she mocks what Godard saw as the impotency of bourgeois representative democracy, where the people have no other way to effect political change except to vote for or against a candidate, a process that happens only every few years even as the nation is confronted by pressing challenges.

Godard's politics during this time were wonky and it's hard to tell just how seriously he believed in Maoism, or whether the 38-year-old director was just trying on a fad to be closer to the youth. And yet, for viewers interested in history and especially this turbulent decade, the political scenes too hold a lot of interest. In the comic book shop segment, the camera pans slowly across the shelves, presenting a variety of pulp literature and pornography that is utterly forgotten today. Didactic as the scenes of the Black Panthers and Eve Democracy might be, even they can be appreciated as a time capsule of 1960s fashion thanks to their colourfully dressed characters."

But as Antonioni moved to the United States and began shooting ZABRISKIE POINT, ultimately released in February 1970, he now captured a counterculture that was tougher and politically radical, with Black liberation movements and university students advocating in-your-face or downright violent methods for effecting social change.

In southern California, a young man named Mark (Mark Frechette) flees a university sit-in after shooting at one of the riot police besieging it. A young lady named Daria (Daria Halprin), who works as a secretary for a large real estate developer building out in the desert, is driving to Phoenix for a meeting. They cross paths when Mark, who proves to have some training as a pilot, steals a light plane from an airfield for a little joyride. He buzzes her car for laughs. When he finally lands, Daria quickly overcomes her fear at this aerial taunting and falls for him. They spent an afternoon together in the desert, at the eponymous point in Death Valley. Yet while these two young people in love enjoy this brief splendour far away from it all, they must eventually return to civilization, and then things come to a head.

ZABRISKIE POINT was a critical failure when it was first released, and I was expecting to dislike it. However, the film's flaws are few and, among everything else the film offers, forgivable. One of those flaws is the acting during the relatively brief portion when the two leads meet. Frechette and Halprin are extremely photogenic and fashionable -- it's hard to believe they weren't established Hollywood bombshells, but rather amateurs and they had actual counterculture credentials. However, as much as they provide the film visually in moments they appear alone, during their brief time together they have zero chemistry and the dialogue they exchange is delivered clunkily.

The other flaw is the characterization of Mark: by the end of the film, Daria has seen things that stir her to anger and lead her to question the conventional society in which she works. However, the script (a collaboration between Antonioni, longtime collaborator Tonino Guerra, and Sam Shepherd) never explains why Mark is so bent on destruction. The audience just feels that he's a delinquent with emotional problems, and that makes it difficult to sympathize with him.

Yet in spite of those weaknesses, this is not at all an unenjoyable film. Forget the stupid interaction of Mark and Daria. Instead, just soak in Antonioni's visual poetry as captured by cinematographer Alfio Contini. The Italians must have been delighted by what they found far away from their native land. California of this era is revealed in all its peculiar grandeur, both the urban sprawl of Los Angeles (already utterly hostile to pedestrians) and the unforgiving but strangely beautiful desert. Most of Antonioni's trademark mise-en-scene from the Italian films is preserved here in this foreign location. Unexpected, however, is the savage ending -- sometimes dubbed ""the violent scene"" -- where the film makes its strongest blow against complacent bourgeois culture. One wonders if Antonioni had seen Jean-Luc Godard's 2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D'ELLE, with its capstone unveiling of consumer products, and thought ""I can one-up that."" The result is a feast for the eyes.

It's curious too how the passage of time can endow a film with poignant resonances beyond what the filmmaker could have intended. Antonioni shot this film in 1968-69 when the counterculture was a brave new world, but audiences today will see it as a vivid document of a past now half a century gone, and the thought that all this colour, idealism, fashion and design is long dead smarts.

Antonioni's loose trilogy consisting of L'AVVENTURA, LA NOTTE and L'ECCLISE might be the best introduction to this filmmaker, but I am glad I have explored his other work, and while ZABRISKIE POINT is notably flawed compared to its predecessors, it has haunted my thoughts in the weeks after I screened it, and that says a lot to its credit."

These are all flawed folks - there are few saints here, though the permanently sozzled ""Vereshchagin"" (Pavel Luspekayev) does have something of the genie about his abilities to appear just when necessary, as does the rescued ""Sayid"". The desert photography sets the scene nicely and the whole film neatly contrasts the honourable and the absurd of humanity. All it really needs is a bit of Ennio Morricone. Worth a watch."

...when you got the fuzz and the mafia after you.
 
Charley Varrick is a quality caper movie courtesy of director Don Siegel and backed up by a wonderful understated performance from Walter Matthau as Charley Varrick. Varrick along with his partners rob a small New Mexico bank, but instead of the usual decent haul they find that they have nabbed over $760.000, sadly for the boys it is mafia money that the bank was laundering. Varrick is a smart cookie and thinks it should be given back, but his young greedy partner insists that it's a chance of a lifetime and convinces Varrick that they should keep the cash. This not only brings the law after them but also sadistic hit-man for the mob, Molly, and he is cruelty personified. Can the boys flee the country in one piece?
 
This is a delightful film that relies heavy on character development and strength of plot. Siegel gets fine performances from the supporting cast to back up the cunningly sedate lead turn from Matthau. As Siegel left Dirty Harry behind, where 1973 saw the sequel Magnum Force released (Ted Post directing), the director gives us a complete opposite to the machismo of Harry Callahan. Matthau’s Varrick is low-key and hang-dogged, but below that sleepy exterior beats the heart of a cunning devil and he’s the one with all the aces up his sleeves.
 
Andy Robinson as Varrick's partner Harman Sullivan is all twitchy and on the edge, whilst Joe Don Baker as hit-man Molly is simply magnetic in his icy portrayal. Lalo Schifrin again scores for Siegel with great results, and the photography from Michael Butler is very rich indeed as the locales seep with that bleached dried look. This is great storytelling with suspense and no little action (the opening robbery and the finale involving a car and a plane joust are quality Siegel constructions), but most of all it's a film to remind you that cinema can be great without crash bang wallop every ten minutes. An excellent heist and escape movie. 8/10 || When a bank robbery goes wrong, “Charley” (Walter Matthau) and his friend “Harman” (Andrew Robinson) just about manage to escape with the loot, but along the way his wife “Nadine” (Jacqueline Scott) gets herself killed. These folks are meticulous at cleaning up after themselves and thinking they have eradicated all possible leads to them they return to his motor home. That’s where the next shock comes from. They’d expected a few thousand bucks. Instead, there is over $750,000 lying on the floor. “Charley” quite quickly assumes, correctly, that this isn’t legitimate money and they are in way more danger from the mob than from the feds. That turns out to be true as “Boyle” (John Vernon) hires their enforcer “Molly” (Joe Don Baker) to get their cash back and to suitably reward the felons who pinched it. With “Charley” now engaged in trying to get them to safety, he has to expose himself to some unsavoury characters to get passports and the like - and that’s what ultimately puts them in peril. What chance they can make it to safety - with or without the money? I preferred Matthau in his comedy roles, but he holds this together well as “Molly” gets ever closer and more nonchalantly violent with just about everyone he meets. It’s not often you get a denouement set in a junkyard with explosives and a crop duster but Don Siegel manages to build the tension nicely as we head to that almost comedic but action-packed conclusion."

Sisters is directed by Brain De Palma who also co-writes the screenplay with Louisa Rose. It stars Margot Kidder, Jennifer Salt, Charles Durning, Lisle Wilson and William Finley. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Gregory Sandor.

When newspaper reporter Grace Collier (Salt) observes what she perceives to be a murder in the apartment across the street from her own, it proves to be the catalyst for a trip down a dark psychologically damaged street.

To be honest here, the continuous complaints about De Palma being a Hitchcock clone got boring around about the mid eighties. As Hitch is my personal favourite director it has never bothered me one bit that he homaged and borrowed from the great man's cannon, in fact I have always found that when on form it was great to have someone like De Palma to keep the suspense thriller genre going. It's not as if he's the only one who owes his career to director's from the past really is it?

Sisters is a wonderfully trippy suspenser, where De Palma lifts from some great Hitchcock motifs to portray a clinically edgy story based around an article he read about Siamese twins Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova. Infused with technical flourishes such as split screens, POV filming and close quarter framing, the director is donating his own blood for the veins of the piece. Suspense is rarely far away, be it characters in some sort of danger, or the possible discovery of a body, there is no pause for pointless filler fodder. While twists and revelations engage the brain instead of insulting it, something many of today's horror/thriller directors could learn to ""homage"" from actually, and a nightmare section of film literally unfurled out of the minds eye is top draw.

Herrmann was enticed out of near retirement to score the music, the genre and themes at work in the story ready made for his skilled compositions. The score in all essence is lifted from his own major works for Hitchcock, with added sections taken from Jason and the Argonauts and Mysterious Island, but reworked in such away it drifts a perfectly off-kilter vibe across production. Kidder and Salt do great work in tricky roles, and Finley is suitably edgy. Durning is a little wasted, though, but it's a small complaint in the acting area. There's a couple of plot holes and one turn of events that just doesn't make sense, but this is a prime De Palma thriller and a good starting point for anyone interested in his work. And yes! For anyone who really isn't bothered about someone homaging a past master. 8/10"

Trilogy of Terror is directed by Dan Curtis and written by Richard Matheson and William Nolan. A 1975 American TV movie, pic has Karen Black in three stories playing different women who each venture to the world of horror.

TV Horror Movies from the 1970s have long since proven to give fond memories to many of us who viewed them through youthful eyes back in that decade. Of course when revisiting them now with mature frame of mind etc, they mostly prove to be a little cornball, cheap, and just not very good in the grand scheme of things. Mostly that is, for there are a few exceptions that still has one just a little bit edgy as we remember how we felt when first catching a sneaky chiller. For sure we don't find ourselves hiding behind the pillows this time, but we still feel a wave of nostalgic terror coursing through our veins.

Trilogy of Terror is one such film that holds up for most of a certain age. No getting away from it, it's all down to the ""famous"" third segment in the trilogy, which finds Black menaced by a cursed Zuni fetish doll. Anyone with a fear of inanimate toys/ dolls etc coming to life was terrified by what Dan Curtis and his team managed to achieve on the screen - and yes even today the fear factor can still gnaw away at the senses. The other two stories were not about terror, choosing to side with a more Twilight Zone approach, which is no surprise with the great Richard Matheson on pen duties, but these are actually better appreciated by a more mature audience as they show some depth to the story telling.

With the much missed Black on terrific form closing out the deal, Trilogy of Terror deserves the love and respect it garners even today. 8/10"

Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk.

11558.0,Silver Streak,"A somewhat daffy book editor on a rail trip from Los Angeles to Chicago thinks that he sees a murdered man thrown from the train. When he can find no one who will believe him, he starts doing some investigating of his own. But all that accomplishes is to get the killer after him.","By train, by plane, by the edge of your seat - It's the most hilarious suspense ride of your life!","Comedy, Crime, Romance, Thriller, Action",114.0,1976-12-03,en,6.7,339.0,1.097,"Gene Wilder, Jill Clayburgh, Richard Pryor, Patrick McGoohan, Ned Beatty","Arthur Hiller, Colin Higgins","two man army, kansas, usa, train, theft, false accusations, semiautomatic pistol, sleeping car","**_Drama, romance, crime, mystery, comedy, adventure, suspense and action on a train_**

A book editor traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago by rail (Gene Wilder) supposedly witnesses a crime while partying with a secretary (Jill Clayburgh). He suddenly finds himself embroiled in a dangerous conspiracy. Richard Pryor plays a helpful thief, Ned Beatty a passenger, Patrick McGoohan a smooth art expert, Richard Kiel a heavy and Len Birman a cop.

""Silver Streak” (1976) meshes Hitchcockian murder thriller with the amusing antics of Wilder and Pryor for an entertaining train flick. As my title blurb states, it expertly mixes genres into a fun and compelling rail ride.  

If you like train flicks like ""Runaway Train"" (1985), ""Transiberian"" (2008), ""Train"" (2008), “Night Train” (2009), ""Beyond the Door III"" (1989), “The Cassandra Crossing” (1976), “Breakheart Pass” (1975) and “Horror Express” (1972) you’ll also enjoy this one. It’s as good or better than most of ’em. It just includes amusement along with the life-or-death thrills à la the 80’s Indiana Jones adventures.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in SoCal, including Century City (studio), Union Station in Los Angeles, South Pasadena (New Mexico train stop), the Mojave Desert (the ranch with the plane) and Brea (the redneck sheriff’s office), as well as Alberta (the prairie scenes), Locust Hill in Ontario, Union Station in Toronto and Northwestern Station in Chicago.

The star of the whole thing is the charismatic chanteuse “Francine” (Liza Minnelli). She a bit of a dreamer who encounters the opportunist sax player “Jimmy” (Robert De Niro) at a party in New York that is celebrating VJ Day in 1945. She isn’t much interested in the patter he has been trolling out to every woman he has met all evening, but a combination of circumstances see the two spending an increasing amount of time together and gradually falling in love. Both have their individual ambitions, too, though, and as she begins to find success thanks to a supportive producer and he likewise with his new jazz venue, their relationship is destined to be bumpy and probably short-lived. The story itself really isn’t much to write home about, nor is the style of production that suggests Bob Fossé-light from start to finish. It’s the Kander and Ebb songs from the pitch-perfect Minnelli and some equally smoky and classic music from the likes of Clarence Clemons that submerges us in a post-war city desperate for dreams, and for dreams that can come true! Moreover, it illustrates quite clearly that nice doesn’t always win, ruthless is usually the last to leave the party and that the lyrics of “New York, New York” are a potent assessment of a place where nobody ever sleeps, because they are trying to burrow the bed from under someone else. The last half hour is really just a well choreographed series of numbers from a star whom De Niro charmingly but sparingly complements, and to be honest I found it more a film I could listen to that watch. Big screen audio does the trick but if you are not into musical theatre, then maybe don’t bother."

Not only did Ross direct this film, which was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, but he also helmed ""The Goodbye Girl,"" which received five nominations. Out of the twenty acting nominees that year, seven were from two of his films.  If you love ballet, you will love ""The Turning Point."" If you have flashbacks to your little sister's bit part in ""The Nutcracker"" the same way military veterans flashback to combat, you might still like ""The Turning Point.""

Deedee (Shirley MacLaine) is a former dancer now running a ballet school with her husband Wayne (Tom Skerritt) in Oklahoma City. The American Ballet Company comes through, and Wayne and Deedee reunite with all their old friends and rivals- both ingredients can be found in Emma (Anne Bancroft). Emma and Deedee competed for the same part back in the day, but Deedee ended up pregnant and Emma went on to be a star of the company.

Deedee, however, gave birth to Emilia (Leslie Browne), who is now a supreme dancer in her own right. She joins the company, and Deedee and Emilia move to New York City for a summer. Childless Emma makes herself Emilia's surrogate mom, and Deedee finds herself in the arms of old crush Rosie (Anthony Zerbe), never living the life Emma lives. The two head for a collision course on the very night of Emilia's lead debut.

While I am not a big ballet fan, I am a big fan of good acting. MacLaine and Bancroft nail their parts. Ross never lets one actress overshadow the other. Both of them are equally heroic and flawed, so the viewer cannot come down on one side or the other. Leslie Browne is hot and cold as Emilia, letting her great dancing speak for her character. Mikhail Baryshnikov is very effective in a clicheed role as the company horndog Yuri, who quickly beds Emilia. While Wayne is wishy-washy, we find out why at the end of the film, and Skerritt holds his own.

As with ""The Goodbye Girl,"" Ross directs with a vengeance, never letting the camera stop. He is not show-offy or pretentious, but he keeps things going at a fast clip, even the dance sequences. They do not run too long or too short, but are brief enough where you can still appreciate the pure athleticism of the performers. I have not been in awe of dancers like this since I sat through the original ""West Side Story."" Watch for a wonderfully edited sequence where a fantasy dance between Yuri and Emilia turns into the two making love, a perfect blend of cuts and musical accompaniment. I do complain that the film runs about fifteen minutes too long, and some closure with Deedee and Rosie would have been nice.  ""The Turning Point"" is not everyone's cup of tea, but the actors and direction save it from being just another melodrama."
