It's quite easy to see how many subsequent films or concepts it may have spawned as it takes much from musical theatre and high drama and mingles them into something that's a sort of an hybrid of the ""Man from U.N.C.L.E"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"". Williams also wrote much of the of the original soundtrack with a few power ballads packed in to keep the pace moving along and it's worth sticking about for the credits. It has dated, but I still enjoyed it."

No, the story isn’t especially novel or original but there’s a lovely chemistry between Grant and Caron that reminded me a little of the “African Queen” (1951) and the girls contribute amiably too.

It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is one of those films that as a child I went to the cinema to watch and then proceeded to talk about it enthusiastically in the playground for weeks afterwards. So I find myself here in my middle age with mixed feelings after just revisiting this extravaganza for the first time in many a year.

It's very much a film of three parts to me, and each part impacts differently on the entertainment scale. The first part of this multi cast piece is as madcap and as mirthful as you could honestly wish to see, but this sadly ill prepares you for a middle part that outstays its welcome to the point that you can't believe they stretched it to an original cut of 3 hours! The final third of the film saves it from smug overkill because by now you have invested so much time into the film, you thank the gods for any sort of frivolity - and thankfully the film does lift you back up to the happy place that you had visited an hour previously.

The cast are fine, where some brilliant shows are mixed in with the merely acceptable ones, and I wouldn't want to be so churlish as to dissect each actors respective show. However, as a Phil Silvers fan I'm rewarded plenty enough and as a Spencer Tracy acolyte I'm burning candles again in his honour. Yet it's Ethel Merman as Mrs. Marcus that lives long and glorious in the memory here, and honestly I feel the film is worth a watch purely just for her. The set pieces are fine and the stunts are truly a feast for the eyes, but ultimately one comes away thinking this film should have been a masterpiece instead of the overkilled and overlong experience that it is. 6.5/10 || _**Epic screwball comedy-adventure with an all-star cast is overlong**_

Released in 1963, “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” is grand comedy-adventure about several motorists in the remote desert of Southern Cal learning of a buried cache of moolah in Santa Rosita State Park along the coast 200 miles south. A mad scramble to get to the money ensues. 

The cast is superlative with too many old-time greats to cite. The opening is compelling, the first act culminating with an amusing sequence where Jonathan Winters’ character levels a gas station in the desert. The wild close with the fire truck ladder and corresponding hospital gag is also superb entertainment. The middle of the film, while fun, can get tedious because emptyheaded shenanigans can only hold your interest for so long. In other words, the movie’s just too long for such madcap misadventures.

Nevertheless, it’s a fun, energetic flick with top-rate locations and this is the only way to see so many classic celebrities on screen together.

The theatrical cut runs 2 hours, 41 minutes whereas the longest cut runs 3 hours, 30 minutes. There are several other cuts. It was shot entirely in various areas of Southern Cal.

GRADE: B- || Maybe not since Michael Anderson managed to put together a stellar cast for his ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" (1956) have we seen quite such an ensemble group of famous faces peppering a light-comedy. This time, it all starts with Jimmy Durante being thrown from his crashing car and surviving just long enough to tell the gathered crowd of a $350,000 fortune buried under the ""Big W"". Initially the gang decide to work together to find and share the loot, but they can't agree on a formula to distribute it and so quickly it's every man (or dame) for themselves. How to get there? Well there are cars, trains and even an aeroplane put to good use as their ""Wacky Races"" style antics see friends and families fall out, fall in, row, squabble and use quit a bit of ingenuity to get to the Santa Rosita State Park first!. Meantime, disillusioned cop ""Culpeper"" (Spencer Tracy) is fed up with his measly pension provision, and it's likely to be his final act to try and locate some stolen cash. Yep.  The self same $350,000! He's no fool and as he learns of this group of treasure hunters, he decides to let them do the all of the heavy lifting then just pop up and wave his badge. Can it be that simple? Well, first of all these disparate folks have to find it - and as their journey gradually fills with acrimony and mistrust, you wouldn't want to bet on it. The star here for me is Terry-Thomas, a Brit who happens to be travelling in his car and who picks up the family from hell. They are led by fiery matriarch (Ethel Merman) and her drip of a son and pretty quickly their driver is in on their not-so-secret gig and devising some suitably mischievous plans of his own! Mickey Rooney's ""Ding Bell"" is also in on the chase; there's Phil Silvers rather over-acting as ""Otto"" and a slew of other familiar faces like Andy Devine, Zazu Pitts, Peter Falk - even Buster Keaton makes an appearance which is apt for the conclusion is straight out of one of his slapstick efforts from forty years earlier. At 3½ hours duration, it's too long. The action is fun for a while as they scramble for advantage but once we've met each of them and got to know their foibles the joke starts to wear a little bit thin and I found it really sagged, repetitively, for an hour in the middle. The occasionally pithy writing quickly gives way to a clunky screw-ball style that was as predictable as it was strained. The stereotypes of the plucky Englishman, the harridan mother-in-law, the ditzy gal - they all all work for a while but soon become a bit laboured and though it does liven up at the ending, I could probably have done with that about an hour earlier. It's fun at times, but I prefer a little more subtlety in my humour - and there's very little of that here."

The story provides for an amiable clash between old and new money, but is really about the nature of true affection and decency. There's not really anything unpredictable about the plot nor it's evolution, but seeing these four folk on screen together does remind us of just what style and star quality is. Even Mitchum keeps his tongue in his cheek and there's also an enjoyable turn from Moray Watson as the aspiring writer-cum-butler who looks upon the antics here with a sympathetic if somewhat bemused attitude. It's aptly titled and worth a watch."

Would you kill for a cotton mill?

Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. Song of Solomon 2:15

The Little Foxes, made in 1941, was the third and final collaboration between the legendary Bette Davis and the great director William Wyler. Their first film together was Jezebel (1938) and the second was 1940’s The Letter.

Down in the deep South at the turn of the century, a deal’s going down to bring the cotton mills to the cotton…and cold, hard cash into the hands of the greedy, conniving Hubbard clan. Ben Hubbard, the brains of the operation, and his brother Oscar, need $75,000 more to close the deal. Their sister, Regina, desperately wants a piece of the action, and she expects her portion of the money to be put up by her husband, Horace. However, she and Horace have not been on good terms for quite some time, plus he has been in Baltimore for several months being treated for a serious heart condition. Undaunted, Regina sends her 17-year-old daughter, Alexandra, to Baltimore to bring him home. Once he is reinstated in the household, he makes it clear that he opposes their shady dealings. But Horace is weak and hasn’t much time to live. Smelling blood, the foxes begin to close in…

The film was nominated for Best Picture of 1941, but was beat by How Green was My Valley. Bette Davis was nominated for Best Actress, and both Teresa Wright, in her debut, and Patricia Collinge were nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Bette Davis was beat by Joan Fontaine for Suspicion, and the Best Supporting Actress Award went to Mary Astor for The Great Lie. However, it’s a cryin’ shame that Herbert Marshall, an excellent actor whose name is all but forgotten today, was not even nominated for his heart-wrenching and eloquently underplayed performance in The Little Foxes.

In his younger days, throughout the 1930’s, Herbert Marshall was in high demand as a romantic leading man. It’s my opinion, though, that it was as the wise, gentle, and doomed Horace Giddens that Marshall gave the greatest performance of his career, at over fifty years old.

Five original cast members reprised their roles from the Broadway production: Charles Dingle (as Ben Hubbard), Carl Benton Reid (as Oscar Hubbard), Dan Duryea (as Leo Hubbard), Patricia Collinge (as Birdie Hubbard), and John Marriott (as Cal).

Lillian Hellman wrote the screenplay, adapting it from her hit stage play, and in fact added one character who was not be found in the original work: Alexandra’s boyfriend, David Hewitt (played by Richard Carlson). The reason Hellman gave for this change was that the story needed another sympathetic male character in addition to Horace Giddens.

The Little Foxes is melodrama of the highest order, but certainly won’t appeal to everyone’s taste. Personally, this is one of my favorite films, and probably my favorite film that deals with such dark themes as are touched upon here. I recommend watching it with a thoughtful and patient frame of mind, and the next time you get together with your family for Thanksgiving or whatever, you can be thankful that, no matter what quirks your dear relatives might have, they can’t possibly be as bad as the Hubbard clan. I hope. || Bette Davis heads an impressive cast in this cracking tale of the ruthless ""Hubbard"" family who dominate the town of Linnet at the start of the 20th century. Davis is ""Regina"" who lives a grand existence with her daughter ""Alexandra"" (Teresa Wright) and two brothers ""Oscar"" (Carl Reid) and ""Ben"" (Charles Dingle) living next door. When a business opportunity presents itself to them, she manipulates her daughter into having her terminally ill, but largely estranged father ""Horace"" (Herbert Marshall) return home so he can chip in the much needed funds. He's a actually quite a decent fellow who has little truck with their exploitative ways, so declines to get involved. This pitches the daughter - who has issues of her own with her loathsome cousin ""Leo"" (Dan Duryea) and her would-be beau ""David"" (Richard Carlson) - into a familial game of chess in which she can only lose. The drama is complex, devious and palpable; Marshall is superb in the role of the sickly but determined husband with Dingle also good as the almost as underhand brother and, of course, Davis in her element as the matriarch who thinks she's doing the right thing, but only so long as it's on her terms. The films addresses many issues that resonate even now about the ""Deep South"" - bigotry, racist attitudes and the sense of superiority that prevailed. William Wyler was usually to be relied upon to deliver a strong story, well paced, well cast and well put together - this is certainly one of is best."
15393.0,Play Misty for Me,"A brief fling between a male disc jockey and an obsessed female fan takes a frightening, and perhaps even deadly turn when another woman enters the picture.",The scream you hear may be your own!,"Drama, Thriller",102.0,1971-10-01,en,6.604,524.0,1.2694,"Clint Eastwood, Jessica Walter, Donna Mills, John Larch, Jack Ging",Clint Eastwood,"disc jockey, stalker, obsessed fan, jaguar car, suspenseful","Well if you are going to play away Dave...

Dave Garver (Clint Eastwood) is a late night disc jockey in Carmel, California. Whilst his girlfriend is out of town he meets and beds a fan named Evelyn (Jessica Walter) who turns out to be the mystery caller to his show who sexily requests the Errol Garner classic tune ""Play Misty For Me"". Thinking that his night of passion with Evelyn is purely a one off, he starts to become concerned as Evelyn refuses to leave him alone, and things are about to get very out of hand and become very disturbing for all involved.

This was Clint Eastwood's first stab (hrr hrr) at directing and it proved to be a very commendable effort as he directs himself in the picture, polishes the production across the board, and then wrapped the film on time and under budget, quite an achievement and it's no surprise that he went on to be a big hitter from behind the camera right up to this present day.

Play Misty For Me is a truly tight and engrossing picture, and certainly more of a character study than its slasher shell would suggest. Eastwood (playing against type) plays Garver perfectly weasel like, and it's because of his selfish sexual proclivities, and all round disdain for his actions, that the maelstrom that comes his way is kind of like the reckoning. The picture firmly belongs to Jessica Walter, though, her turn as the irrational psychotic in waiting, Evelyn, is truly magic, lacing sympathetic sadness with outright moments of terror, believable to the point of forcing the audience into an uneasy understanding. It's a mystery (and a crying shame) that Walter didn't go on to be a big star because the marker for major talent was right here.

Edgy and darkly fascinating, Play Misty For Me stands up today as a right on the money thriller, and not even the sight of Clint in his over large white underpants can dim the films appeal. 8.5/10 || Not convinced it's necessarily a great film per se, but <em>'Play Misty for Me'</em> really does a very good at unsettling the viewer!

Jessica Walter is the sole reason for that. As good as Clint Eastwood is, as he makes his directorial debut, Walter gives a superb performance as the unnerving Evelyn Draper - one that'll live in the memory, for sure. Elsewhere on the cast, it's neat to see Don Siegel - one of Eastwood's long time collaborators - make a cameo.

I have some minor remarks about this, like the editing is a tad iffy in parts, but all in all nothing important. I'd recommend this, to put it simply."

When ""Louise"" (Ann-Margret) writes to say that she will soon visit with her fiancée - A Spanish aristocrat; this throws quite a spanner in the works for ""Annie"". Luckily, ""Dude"" is determined to rope in his contacts to try to help her impersonate the grand role she has represented herself as having - despite trying to get a the biggest deal of his own over the line. This causes no end of chagrin for the undoubted star of the picture - Peter Falk. He is the right hand man who gradually watches the planning and organising of this charade subsume everything else, and it's slowly driving him nuts. To be honest, the central portion of this comedy also drove me a bit nuts too. It borders too closely on the farcical, with Ford trying far too hard and seeing only fleeting appearances from the increasingly sidelined Davis. It steadies itself better for the last twenty minutes or so, but is really just too long with the joke too thinly spread and the slapstick humour all a bit too in-your-face for me. The writing is generally good, though, with some fine quips - especially from Falk, and the film looks great whilst taking a gentle swing at the political class as they all flock to the side of this minor Count from Spain. I did quite enjoy it, but sadly it isn't one of Frank Capra's more focussed efforts, nor is it one of his more poignant or amusing stories."

Released in 1993 and directed by George Sluizer from a novel by Tim Krabbé, ""The Vanishing"" is a crime drama/mystery/horror about a man (Kiefer Sutherland) whose girlfriend goes missing during a trip in Washington State (Sandra Bullock) and he searches in vain for her for years. After he starts a relationship with a new girlfriend (Nancy Travis), the abductor (Jeff Bridges) finally contacts him. Will he find his former girlfriend?

This is the second time the director shot this same story; the first time was the 1988 Euro film of the same name. The stories are identical except for the final acts and the fact that this newer version has a better character/part for the new girlfriend (Travis). Both films are worth catching, but I prefer this one for reasons explained below. Fans of the first movie object to the changes, arguing that the producers of this version were pandering to North American tastes. While this may be true, it's also likely that the director didn't want to make the same exact movie. After all, we already have the first version, why make an exact duplicate with different actors and locations? Besides, what's wrong with appreciating BOTH versions? My comments below reveal why Sluizer wanted to change things up a little with this version.

Audiences may have rejected the film at the box office on the grounds that they weren't used to Bridges playing a contemptible villain or Sutherland playing the good guy, but they're both fine in these roles, particularly the former, who's great and fascinating to observe. One thing that keeps you watching during the drama of the first two acts is to find out what his motivations are. But, as hinted above, it's Travis who steals the show, at least as far as protagonists goes. Perhaps audiences didn't receive her or the movie well because her character's merely a waitress whose story arc doesn't end in a reversal of fortune, which is in contrast to the typical movie heroine. Who knows? I think she's awesome.

In any case, if you like psychological drama/thrillers like ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987) and ""Single White Female"" (1992) you'll appreciate ""The Vanishing.""

The movie runs 109 minutes and was shot mostly in Washington State, but also Cody Tunnel, Cody, Wyoming (the tunnel sequence) and La Canada and Long Beach, CA (the diner and pool hall scenes respectively).

GRADE: B+

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've watched the movie)

While the first film could be interpreted as a commentary on nihilism, since the villain wins and the hero loses, it doesn't HAVE to be interpreted this way. After all, it's a simple fact of life that sometimes evil wins a battle now and then; and sometimes A LOT of them, but this doesn't mean evil wins the war, so to speak. If there's ultimate good then evil will eventually have its day of reckoning.

In any event, the 1988 movie ends on a decidedly downbeat note. And this is why I appreciate this newer version: While it is also downbeat, and evil wins to a point, the changes in the final act show good triumphing over evil, not to mention perseverance over intellect and love over absence of love. The subtext is all about freewill – freewill to kill for no good reason and freewill to kill for good when absolutely necessary. The theme of the first movie is limited in that it drives home the first point whereas this version drives home both, and is the better for it."

The results of that opens his eyes a little to the realities of life but now he struggles with adjusting and this leads to a sense of loneliness, isolation and even paranoia. The film is accompanied by The Who's eponymous soundtrack and it's at these points it is most effective, presenting a poignant and rather bleak look at pre-Thatcherite Britain that illustrates just how little hope there was for many and at how almost tribal existence could be on the streets fuelled with conflict, depression and confusion. At times it's a really intense and well focused drama and Daniels is ideally suited for his character. The rest of it is all a bit so-what, though. This hasn't aged particularly well and though maybe unfair to review 40-off years later, it's largely lost what impact it certainly had at the time and is largely devoid of even the darkest of humour to lighten the downbeat mood. Sure, it's brutal and violent at times, the language is honest and authentic and it depicts elements of racism and intolerance effectively, but the plot is a little like life itself. A meandering and frequently disinteresting series of occurrences that rarely merit remembering. It started many a career but somehow even that just seems to reinforce it's stereotyping analysis of society - as Franc Roddam saw it.

Whilst I wholeheartedly agree with other amateur reviewers on line that stress you have to put yourself back to 1951 to appreciate the film more, it still doesn't take away from the fact that the film is one of the poorer offerings from the disaster/sci-fi genre of years gone by.

The methodical build up of characters is fine for adding weight to the final reel, the effects are solid for the time, and the ending has an element of heart tugging hope to it, but the film still remains a drawn out laborious watch. 

No amount of shouting about lack of budget and the time frame of its birth can't detract that the film over relies on heavy dialogue to keep the viewer interested. This is all well and good if the pay off is handsome in the extreme, which sadly isn't the case on this occasion. 

I have taken myself back to 1951, and for that reason alone I give it the average rating of 5/10, while I certainly have no hesitation in recommending this to genre fans for at least one watch. It deserves to be looked at, and it deserves respect of course, but that doesn't mean it's particularly above average either. || Entertaining enough apocalyptic disaster film from the 1950s has some absolutely adorable miniatures and one awful matte painting at the end.

In the Chesapeake Bay region, a brother & sister try to overcome their childhood trauma living on their aunt & uncle’s ranch. The sister is married with a kid while the brother is mute, working the farm. A missive from their dying mother brings buried memories to the fore while a mysterious old mirror unleashes a deadly… boogey man.  

“The Boogey Man” (1980) is a psychological slasher that borrows from “The Exorcist,” “Halloween” and “The Amityville Horror,” although it had the smallest of budgets of these, only costing $300,000 with John Carradine as Dr. Warren being the greatest expense (all of his scenes were shot in a day).

There are similarities to soon-to-come flicks like ""Nightmare"" (1981) and ""Luther the Geek"" (1989). If you like those and the tone of, say, ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"" (1972) and ""Don't Go in the House"" (1979), check it out. The Chesapeake Bay area is a highlight, as is the realism and mood, but the story is kinda tedious, not to mention a little baffling. It doesn’t help that the female cast is subpar compared to any of the Friday the 13th films. 

The film runs 1 hour, 22 minutes, and was shot in Maryland, as follows: Bel Alton (brick house with the well), La Plata (Lacey & Willie’s childhood home), Port Tobacco (cemetery and church) and Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The barn interior scenes were done at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California.

The Changeling is directed by Peter Medak and co-written by Russell Hunter, William Gray and Diana Maddox. It stars George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Melvyn Douglas, John Colicos and Jean Marsh. Plot finds Scott as John Russell, a music composer whose life is shattered when an accident kills both his wife and young daughter. Relocating to Seattle, Russell rents a large Gothic style mansion from which to bury himself in his work. But he soon discovers he is not alone in the house, there is a ghost here and it desperately wants his help with something...

Not a teenager or a scantily clad bad actress in sight here, for this is a traditional haunted house spooker for the adults, one that has a distressing mystery at its core that's just aching to be solved. Chief writer Russell Hunter has based much of the film on an incidents that happened to him in real life when he moved into a house in Denver. If you believe him or not is not really the point, because it does not take away from just how well executed The Changeling is, both as a scary movie and a well thought out drama. There's limited characters in the narrative, thus keeping the film free from filler and the clumsy character set-ups that mar so many horror films these days. It's also worth noting that it doesn't suffer from dating either, as Nicole Kidman starrer The Others proved 21 years later, a haunted house tale can be effective in any decade if the writing and direction is spot on. The Changeling has both, plus a towering and believable performance from Scott leading the way.

Medak clearly knows that an imposing house is a key element. Utilising the big spaces to emphasise Russell's loneliness, he sweeps his camera around the sets (this is not a real house, it's a brilliant mock-up creation by the designers) to give the feeling of a spirit observing proceedings. The house is always a main character and acts as the perfect backdrop to some ghostly goings on (excellent work from the sound department too). The chills are genuine, the attic room is creepy personified, a rubber ball, a wheelchair, a bath sequence, an old water well and even the gentle tinkling from a music box, all induce the hairs on the back of the neck to stand to attention. And there's a séance! Oh yes indeed, a séance that's tape recorded, more chills down the spine on the way there as well. All played out to some lush unholy musical arrangements from Ken Wannberg (the music box theme composed by Howard Blake).

Setting it apart from conventional haunted house movies is that it has a most intriguing story to tell. One of murder, greed, deception and grief. The latter part is often forgotten when talk of The Changeling arises. John Russell is absolutely stricken with grief, this stops him from being one of those characters who you shake your head at because they refuse to leave a clearly troubled house. His grief process, which makes him the ideal host for what this spirit wants, means he has no fear, some unhappy ghost can't hurt him anymore than he is hurting anyway. It's a neat and seamless meditation on grief that's threaded into the story. The last quarter of the film slips into action territory, which is a little jarring given the smooth pacing Medak has favoured up to that point. But although the scares have gone, the intelligent story has come full circle and the film closes down triumphantly without copping out or having resorted to unimaginative formula.

An essential viewing for those who like haunted house movies; especially if you like slow build and genuine mystery as well. 9/10 || _**George C. Scott grapples with a haunted house**_

A grieving composer (Scott) rents a mansion in Seattle that’s been unoccupied for a dozen years and starts a relationship with the Historical Society agent who offered it to him (Trish Van Devere). Unfortunately, the manor has a shameful history and weird things start happening.

""The Changeling"" (1980) is haunted house horror in the tradition of ""The Legend of Hell House"" (1973), ""The Evil"" (1978) and ""The Amityville Horror"" (1979). While it's not as good as ""Amityville Horror,"" it's pretty much on par with ""Legend of Hell House"" and “The Evil” and would influence future ghostly flicks, like ""The Ring"" (2002). 

The writer of the book and co-scripter, Russell Hunter, claimed the story is based on his experiences while living in the Henry Treat Rogers mansion in the Cheesman Park neighborhood of Denver in the late ’60s.

For me, the apparition is accorded too much power by the scriptwriters in the second half and this provokes a “Yeah, right” response rather than scares or awes. A good example is setting a house on fire at will. Why Sure!

Trish, by the way, was Scott’s wife from 1972 until his passing in 1999.

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, Seattle, and New York City (Lincoln Center), with one scene done in Toronto.

That film, of course, was SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER (1977). This film is what happens after you pop a little too much amyl nitrate and start to operate under the delusion that crossing Busby Berkeley with the Continental Baths has blockbuster written all over it. Nominally a pseudo-factual relating of the formation of the Village People, there are several other story threads, one which somehow involves the American Dairy Association (don't ask). Now obviously, no one is here for plot development; they're here to camp away a few hours - and in that regard, the ""Y.M.C.A."" sequence delivers: Acres of well-oiled male flesh in startlingly-brief man-Dukes; slow-motion examinations of new techniques in pommel horse; dozens of soapy young men crowding the shower, getting clean before having a good meal or doing whatever they feel (all strategically sudsed to maintain that PG-rating). Otherwise, it's over two hours of mostly cringe-worthy thesping (as actors, the Village People make Bruce Jenner look like the Village People); cringe-worthy dialogue; and yawn-inducing attempts at narrative.

1623.0,Brubaker,The new warden of a small prison farm in Arkansas tries to clean it up of corruption after initially posing as an inmate.,One man against a cruel system.,"Crime, Drama",125.0,1980-06-20,en,7.071,478.0,1.8807,"Robert Redford, Yaphet Kotto, Jane Alexander, Murray Hamilton, David Keith",Stuart Rosenberg,"prison, undercover, liberation of prisoners, arkansas, prison warden, based on true story, prison brutality, abuse, 1960s, prison farm, prisoner abuse","Corruption and Murder told with cathartic style.

It's odd that whenever talk of Prison base films crops up you rarely see Brubaker mentioned as a viable piece of work, which to me personally is a damn shame because it's origin source provides a worthy story to be involved in. 

Based on the writings of Tom Murton, a Prison Farm Reform Warden in Arkansas in the late 60s, the corruption and murder the film deals with is a very frightening reality, and although this film is obviously fictionalised to a degree, the evidence of the main themes can be found from many sources. 

Robert Redford plays the title character who chooses to go into the prison farm as a convict to see at first hand how the Farm is run, what he sees shocks him to the core, which in turn rightly shocks the viewer as well. After learning all he needs to, he comes forward to take control of the Farm and tries to put an end to the torture, corruption and dank depression that is rife at the Farm. He has to deal with many obstacles along the way, and it's the strength of the man that has the viewer firmly onside all through the film. 

The acting is emotionally spot on, the title role calls for a cool persona to not get flustered when faced with mounting resistance, and Redford delivers in spades. The main supporting cast of Yaphet Kotto, David Keith, Morgan Freeman, and Jane Alexander do very good work (believable), whilst the direction from Stuart Rosenberg (""Cool Hand Luke"") is paced to perfection. The story is grimy and gnaws away at you, and then we get the ending that frustrates as much as it lifts the spirit, this is in my opinion a criminally undervalued piece of work. 8/10 || One of the top 3 prison based movie ever made but highly underrated, sometimes I feel really so sad when see that there are many many top class movies from 80""s & 90""s are very underrated while they need or deserve a really very high attention and fame too,and this one ""Brubaker"" is one of them. || **_A maverick prison warden uncovers corruption and tries to make positive changes_**
 
In 1967-1968, a state penal farm in Arkansas gets a new warden (Robert Redford) who discovers condoned sexual abuse, severe beatings, electrical torture and extortion by inmates with guns who work as ""trusty"" guards (to save money otherwise spent on salaried guards). Then there’s the lousy quality and meager amount of sustenance for the inmates on a penal plantation that marketed enough produce and dairy products to create profits in the millions.

“Brubaker” (1980) is a fictionalized detailing of Tom Murton’s 1969 book, Accomplices to the Crime: The Arkansas Prison Scandal. It’s a realistic prison drama with the expected grunginess and brutalities revealing how the penal installation was basically a means for the government to make money by treating inmates like property (slaves) to be used, abused and, when necessary, secretly thrown away in holes on the grounds.  

The movie’s not as dramatically compelling as it could be since it refuses to permit its characters more human dimension and flesh out interest, yet it raises interesting ideas. For instance, corruption exists when it is knowingly allowed at the higher levels of authority. How can you be an idealist in a world that is not ideal? Do you compromise with the corrupt powers that be in order to get SOMETHING done, or do you take the attitude of no compromise, period? The latter takes true dedication to noble principles, but what good is it if it prevents you from making positive changes?

The movie “Serpico” (1973) shows that it can be done with challenging consequences. I’ll leave it to you to discover how this one pans out.  

A young Morgan Freeman shows up in the first act as a deranged prisoner in solitary confinement. He would of course go on to star in the more popular prison flick “The Shawshank Redemption” (1994), both movies shot in the heart of Ohio about 90 miles from each prison location. I should add that, while “Brubaker” is not popular like “Shawshank,” it was quite successful at the box office.  

Unsurprisingly, it’s is a mostly male story, but Jane Alexander has a pretty beefy role as a public relations specialist for the governor while Linda Haynes appears as a play thing for one of the corrupt trustys.

If you’re in the mood for a flick in the mold of “Cool Hand Luke” (1967) and “The Longest Yard” (1974), “Brubaker” should fill the bill.

One last thing, the ending was glaringly borrowed for “Dead Poets Society” (1989).

The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes, and was shot at the former Junction City Prison Farm outside of Junction City, Ohio, as well as nearby New Lexington and Fairfield County Fairgrounds in Lancaster.

I think what happened to me was exactly the same as what happened to most people: when I saw this movie for the first time, years ago, I didn't understand a thing. That went on for a long time: whenever I saw this film, I ended up not understanding it. That ended today, when I saw it with a friend of mine, who also likes cinema and who told me _“you have to keep two things in mind: the first is the non-linear narrative, sometimes with very subtle changes; the second is that most of the film is not real life, it is a dream of the protagonist”_.

If there are films that are almost perfect, this one is close to it, although it is not easy to understand, and it is necessary to watch it five or six times to understand it well. I had already the experience that David Lynch's films are not easy... I had my first contact with the director a few years ago, with _Blue Velvet_, and I realized that he makes hermetic films, with implicit ideas and dreamlike suggestions, which often (almost always) escape our eyes. I like that: it's a challenging kind of cinema, which makes you think and moves you. It doesn't mean that I understand everything! And today, talking with my friend, I finally managed to understand this film better. Initially made in 1999 as a pilot episode for a TV series, it was made into a feature film after TV producers rejected the product. The very way Lynch took his failure and turned it into one of his biggest hits is remarkable, revealing his style and persistence.

The film is really good, and I believe that, by commenting on what I learned today, I am already helping those who want to see it and understand it. If we pay attention, it indicates the moments when the main character falls asleep (right at the beginning) and wakes up again. And I think I can still say, without revealing too much, that the party at the film director's house, very close to the end, is the key scene to understand more than half of the plot, which basically focuses on a young woman, who goes to Los Angeles with the dream of becoming rich and famous and fails in that desire, combining this frustration with a huge love heartbreak, and the loss of her own moral values ​​and innocence.

The cast is perfectly up to the challenges they're getting from the director, and it's amazing to see Naomi Watts here. This film truly symbolizes the start of her career, as she only did a few minor jobs, in Europe and the USA, until making this film. She is truly excellent, managing to capture all our sympathy and make us like her character. To a certain extent, I think the actress saw a lot of herself in the character she played: she also had a dream of succeeding in her career, and she also suffered to achieve it. Also, Laura Harring did very well and deserves praise for her work. Justin Theroux, who played director Adam Kesher, makes a welcome and solid contribution to the work of the actresses, even though this film is clearly dominated by them.

Technically, this is a film class at all levels. In addition to the brilliant direction, Lynch bets a lot on cinematography. Here, it is worth seeing how he uses the locations he chooses, the cityscapes, and some techniques such as zoom, close-up or blur, to convey messages to the audience about the characters' state of mind. He also makes good use of color, vibrant and beautiful, with the colors red and blue having a particularly important meaning for understanding the film. The film has some intense nude and sex scenes, and a very slow pace that is intentional. The settings are also very important: sometimes, the arrangement of props and the way the actors relate to them helps us to understand what we see, but this is really subtle, and you have to be attentive. Finally, a very special word for the hypnotic and almost unforgettable soundtrack, signed by Angelo Badalamenti, which is worth listening to, from the main leitmotif to the songs, happy and carefree, in the style of the 50s. || A woman involved in a car accident emerges with amnesia and with the help of a would-be starlet they try to get to the bottom of who did what to whom and why. Thereafter it twists and turns like an adder on steroids - but to what end? Sorry, but I just didn't get it. I'd ask what is it really about, but I am not sure I'd believe anyone who actually claimed to know. Is it really about anything tangible at all or is Lynch daring the audience to admit that they are too dense to grasp the ""creative concept"" here? It is a well put together piece of cinema, and we do get good performances from Naomi Watts and Justin Theroux, but I just don't inhabit the parallel universe in which this is all set, and it was wasted on me."

 ★★★★

The best 'hip hop horror' out there, and yes there are actually quite a few. But I think that this one can be liked by fans that aren't big fans of hip hop either because it boasts of such great quality and director Ernest Dickerson definitly knows his horrors with plenty of homages to old Italian horror, as well as serving as sort of a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in an urban setting.

Snoop Dogg plays the 'boogeyman' and he does so really well, it was written with Snoop Dogg in mind so it works really well.

Never aging Khalil Kain has one of the leads, he was also one of the leads in Dickerson's 1992 movie JUICE starring Kain, as well as Tupac Shakur and Omar Epps.

'Scream Queen' Katherine Isabelle plays his sister, and yeah overall not a whole lot to complain about. It certainly is a whole lot better than the IMDb rating would suggest."

The film opens with a shot of a memorial wall in praise of the San Francisco Police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty, a SFPD badge is prominent as the camera scrolls down the ream of names on the wall. Cut to a rooftop sniper shooting a girl taking a swim in a swimming pool, cut to the coolest looking cop you have ever seen making his way to the rooftop scene, he stands and surveys the whole of the San Francisco bay area, this is, his area, and we know we are in for a very special film indeed. 

Dirty Harry is now something of an institution, the film that pushed the boundaries of cops versus bad guys movies, some of the film's dialogue became part of modern day speak, and it's the film that propelled Clint Eastwood into the stratosphere of super stardom. Often tagged as a fascist film, I think it's more a cynical look at the rights of criminals because Harry is everyone who has ever been a victim of crime, he will do what it takes to take down the criminals festering in society, you break the law and Harry will get you any way he can. Here Harry is on the trail of Scorpio, a ruthless sniper killing at random, Scorpio kidnaps a teenage girl and demands $200.000 from the city or she will die in the hole he has her buried in. Harry is just the man for the job of delivery boy and this sets the wheels in motion for what becomes a personal crusade for Harry to take Scorpio down at all costs. 

Director Don Siegel crafts a masterpiece here, creating a western within the big city landscape, the pace is energetic at times yet reeling itself in to provide genuine suspense when needed. Siegel should also be praised for sticking by Andy Robinson as Scorpio, for it's an insanely great performance from him. Yet it might never had happened since Robinson was petrified of guns, but Siegel stood by him and coaxed him through it. The result is a maniacal turn that scares and amuses in equal measure - witness his mad singing during a bus kidnap scene, you will not know whether to laugh or be afraid. 

Yet as good as Robinson is, he gives way to a seamless piece of magnificence from Eastwood as Harry Callahan, note perfect and enthusing the role with the right amount of dynamic cool and gusto, it's no surprise that the character became a cinematic legend after such a great acting performance. Finally I must mention the wonderful score from Lalo Schifrin, jazz/electro/beat combinations segue perfectly into each scene with maximum impact to cap off one of the finest films of the 70s, and if you don't believe me then you can go argue with Harry. 9/10 || The directing is remarkable but, the most interesting side of this film is the character created by Eastwood, a policeman who decides to take the law by his hand disregarding any kind of right or procedure.

Quite like his characters in the far west ... but in nowadays U.S.

The story itself is, plainly, bad and grotesque. || Recently I've considered drastically negatively re-appraising Clint Eastwood's work, both directorially and as a thespian, as a knee-jerk reaction to his constant defense of the more racially-bigoted face of conservative America, but because of what his work has meant to me as a cinephile over the years, plus in tribute to everyone else's work involved in this film, particularly director Don Siegel's, that simply wouldn't be fair.

As well, you're basically getting, boiled down in its 103-minute timespan, 45 years after the fact, the main dilemma facing the USA. Whose rights are more important--the good guys' or the bad guys'? If they're equal, should they be considered equal, and what does that mean to the law enforcement and judicial systems?

Quite simply, THE most important American-made film of the past 50 years. NOT my very favourite (that's '2001: A Space Odyssey'), but the most significant.

And it hasn't aged a single day because of it."

Norman Jewison contrives to reconcile sometimes quite brutal stories of religious prejudice with a defiantly gentle, joyful communal spirit in a thought-provoking and personable fashion.

In 1984, an Iranian doctor in Michigan (Alfred Molina) insists on visiting his family back home after ten years and insists that his wife (Sally Field) & daughter come along for a 2-week trip. They are horrified to discover that the doctor has no intention of going back to America and holds them hostage in Tehran with his family, abusing the wife. To make matters worse, Iran was at war with Iraq at the time and bombing raids on Tehran were not uncommon. Can they make it back alive?       

""Not Without My Daughter"" (1991) is based on Betty Mahmoody's real-life account of the same name, co-written by William Hoffer and published in 1987. The movie reminded me of “Midnight Express” (1978), which is interesting since Hoffer also co-authored the book that movie was based on, published in 1977. Both stories are about Americans trapped in Muslim nations. Everyone knows Turkey isn’t so religiously strict, but Billy Hayes in “Midnight Express” was stuck in prison there and it was a harrowing experience (read the book as it’s naturally more factual than the movie). Betty wasn’t in prison in Iran yet she was still very much a prisoner and the experience was just as harrowing.

The movie doesn’t paint all Iranians as evil, as some criticize. It just shows how the rights of women are seriously limited in such a legalistic patriarchal society. It also effectively shows how an otherwise good person can become an altogether different one under the influence of a dubious communal spirit. This happens all the time. Have you ever had a friend who acted one way in private, but very differently in a social situation with questionable peer pressure? Perhaps you yourself have done this; I have. It’s the same principle in this movie except that the “community spirit” and corresponding peer pressure involves male-dominated Islamic culture and the mistreatment of women.  

The daughter wrote her account of what happened in her 2015 book “My Name is Mahtob,” which basically corroborates her mother’s version of events while trying to be sympathetic to her father. She became a Christian and essentially points out how genuine Christians (as opposed to nominal ones) are persecuted in America by the secular religion of LIEberalism, which is ironic since America is supposed to champion religious & ideological freedom. It’s just a different kind of persecution than what Mahtob & her mother experienced in Iran.  

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot mainly in Neve Ilan, Isreal, but also Ankara, Turkey (the closing scenes) and Atlanta, Georgia (the Michigan scenes).

This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.

I found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.

As far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.

The movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit “splattery” but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.

The ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable. || I went into this having only seen 'The Book of Eli' by these directors, The Hughes Brothers. I quite liked that film, although I did feel their vivacious stylizations interfered with the telling of the story. Seeing this earlier film of theirs confirmed that suspicion, though it's still a fine film. Though Johnny Depp (the brothers' 5th choice for the lead) does a fine job as the film's protagonist (I haven't read Alan Moore's graphic novel yet, so I can't say how this filmic adaptation compares), it certainly would have been interesting to see how any of their previous choices would have done (in order of their preference): Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Connery, Jude Law and Brad Pitt (but especially either of the first two). It has a fine supporting cast, is beautiful to look at and is consistently intriguing. I especially liked Heather Graham (I think this is solidly amongst her best work), Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and, most significantly, Katlin Cartlidge. Boy, do I ever miss her in films made ever since. || From Alan Moore, the Hughes brothers and Johnny Depp

RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""From Hell"" details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detective’s interest.

The film was based on Alan Moore’s graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his ""gruff"" version of Frederick Abberline with an ""absinthe-swilling dandy,” referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, there’s no evidence that Abberline “chased the dragon” or that he had “psychic visions.” Speaking of real life, Moore’s graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book “Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution.” This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.

“From Hell” plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are “Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed” (1969) and “Taste the Blood of Dracula” (1970). “From Hell” even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society ‘gentlemen’ in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammer’s Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic, and England (Boscastle & Goldings).

Gandolfini is, however, completely unconvincing as a senior officer who appears to have little humanity or grasp on the reality of the scenarios presented to us by Rod Lurie. Clifton Collins Jr offers the best effort from amongst the cast with his portrayal of the troubled ""Aguilar"", but I couldn't quite make out just what the role of the duplicitous ""Yates"" (Mark Ruffalo) was meant to represent - maybe I had just given up by then. I reckon this might have made for a decent read; allowing us to inject character traits into what personalities are on offer here using our own imagination. As a piece of cinema, however, it is little more than a vehicle for a star who is nowhere near his best working with a story that stretched my imagination just a bit too far for far too long."

As with 2001: A Space Odissey, it is needed a reading of the actual explanation for the events to fully understand the original idea ... if you are interested in such explanation ... || ***Cult flick with sophisticated themes, great cast, but meh story***

Released in 2001 and written/directed by Richard Kelly, ""Donnie Darko"" is a drama/fantasy starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled California teen dogged by apparitions of a man in an evil rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit several crimes, after he narrowly escapes a peculiar accident concerning a jet engine falling from the sky. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Holmes Osborne & Mary McDonnell his parents, Drew Barrymore his teacher, Katharine Ross his therapist, Jena Malone his girlfriend, Noah Wyle his science teacher and Patrick Swayze a self-help guru. Patience Cleveland is on hand as Grandma Death.

While the movie flopped at the box office, it has since become a serious cult hit. I saw it recently for the first time and went into it cold without knowing anything about the intricacies behind the plot. The only thing I knew was that the kid was harassed by an ee-vil bunny apparition. The film mildly works as a high school drama with a satirical smirk. But the story's just not engaging enough on that level. While the movie has some quality women, it fails to capitalize on their presence (Barrymore, for instance, is barely in it). But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does.

By the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn't fit. And the movie simply wasn't entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I would've given the movie a mediocre 5/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters.

The film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Director's Cut runs 20 minutes longer. It was shot in Los Angeles and surrounding areas (Angeles National Forest, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, Burbank & Calabasas).

GRADE: B-

ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read unless you've seen the movie):

My casual interpretation turned out to be one of the alternative explanations of the movie, the so-called ""Donnie Is Shown the Future"" explanation, which suggests that Donne is shown the future via the future ghost of Frank and so he sacrifices himself at the end to save everyone. But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation.

A couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was ""all just a dream,"" which is too clichéd and idiotic to even consider.

The 'official' interpretation I would've never pieced together because it's just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: It's the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on. Google it and you'll see that the Tangent Universe explanation ties up all the loose ends. || A complete mind-bender of a movie that put Jake Gyllenhall on the map, introduced the creepiest rabbit costume of all time, and may make you surprisingly tear up to a remake of Tears for Fears ""Mad World."""

The cast and characters are what sets this above the majority of the studio's other work, with so many memorable ones involved. John Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) make for an outstanding duo in the lead roles, they are truly perfect for their respective roles.

Elsewhere, you have the excellent Steve Buscemi portraying Randall to terrific effect. There are also memorable roles for James Coburn (Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia) and Bob Peterson (Roz). You, of course, also have Boo (Mary Gibbs) who is simply adorable.

Everything else from the plot to the animation is fantastic, too - I have no faults with this film. Funny, wholesome, entertaining and touching. I see they're creating a television series, <em>'Monsters at Work'</em>, which could be good given it will have the same cast.

The animation is enjoyable to watch, the writing is quickly-paced and quite wittily observational at times and the characters - especially ""Sully"", are creatively personified and engaging. Luckily, the yelling brats are kept to a minimum and what we end up with is a sort of, well, love story.

There's some fun to be had in super-powerful action heroes, bulletproof martial-arts, guns with unlimited ammo in their magic magazines. But this was just silly, bordering on stupid.

Hal Larsen (Jack Black) only ever dates beautiful trophy women on account of advice he received on his death bed from his father. However, a chance meeting with a self-help guru helps him to see inner beauty first and foremost. Soon after, he falls in love with his boss' severely overweight daughter, which as it raises eyebrows everywhere the couple go, Hal is oblivious as to what everyone else is on about.

Tender, sweet and subtle are not words one readily attributes to the Farrelly Brothers, but in Shallow Hal they have managed to blend all three with their penchant for close to the knuckle humour.

Gwyneth Paltrow in the dual role dons the fat-suit and once again showcases her unheralded comic timing, while Jack Black proves ebullient and engaging in a role that calls for him to shut out what he is actually meant to be seeing. In support Jason Alexander gets the weasel best friend comedy sidekick role, and is wonderfully abhorrent and good at keeping the cards close to his chest.

It's never uproariously funny, but it doesn't need to be, it tickles where it needs to, and it prods the emotional psyche with requisite impact. In a world that has become obsessed with the girth and weight of a person, especially with women - and as it happens is led by Hollywood, Shallow Hal is refreshing entertainment. 7/10 || ***Fun romcom with a worthy message***

A shallow man (Jack Black) from Charlotte, North Carolina, falls in love with a 300 lb. woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) after Tony Robbins enables him to see inner merit. Jason Alexander is on hand as his best friend.

“Shallow Hal” (2001) is a romcom that’s both amusing and meaningful. The movie stresses the importance of inward beauty, which Hal was incapable of seeing because of his focus on solely physical attractiveness. When the latter is removed through Tony Robbins' mesmerism he's finally able to see the former. Whiney libs that are unable to grasp fantasy and humor might be offended by the fat jokes, but the overall moral is commendable.

The flick scores pretty well in the feminine department with Paltrow in her prime and never looking better, speaking as someone who was never overly wowed by her. She’s jaw-dropping here and the movie doesn’t fail to spotlight her beauty. Other beautiful women are featured, like Susan Ward as Hal’s neighbor, Jill.

The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in Charlotte, North Carolina.

GRADE: B+ || Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Now, I'm honestly not the biggest fans of this cast: Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jason Alexander, but that's not to discredit their acting abilities, and I don't just limit that to these performances as everyone did a great job.

Because of the complexity of the story itself, they clearly wanted to make this as silly and palatable as possible so everything essentially has rounded corners and rubberized edges.  Hal is purposely left as a generic stock character to endear the audience as lesser but relatable, when it's actually a representation of the expectant audience.  Mauricio is clearly a similar representation of our self-loathing, self-sabotaging selves: anytime we actually get something we think we might not deserve we take it away.  Even Rosemarie is a generic representation of women's self-view (granted it is wildly simplified in this ""guy's"" movie), and by ""blurring"" the view between taught beauty (very clearly Jack learned from his dad) and personal connection you're able to find real happiness with people that might actually matter to you past an image.

I and the movie aren't ""glorifying fatness"" (people say weird stuff), you should of course continue to work and be the best version of you that you can be, but ""but he/she/it is fat"" shouldn't be the only factor.

It touches on real issues in the work and that ruins the escapism for me a little bit, but it does it in such a odd, fun, philosophical way it's easy enough to overlook."

“When a Stranger Calls” (1979) is low-key horror mixed with detective drama/thriller. I say “low-key” because there’s little-to-no gore, although there’s suspense, chases and flashes of violence. It’s very polished and was obviously influenced by the artistic “Halloween” (1978) except with a very human antagonist as opposed to the indestructible Michael Myers. Then there’s the big city detective element à la “Dirty Harry” (1971) and “Tightrope” (1984), but with a pot-bellied, average-guy investigator (Charles Durning).

The film’s best known for its harrowing opening sequence, which was borrowed for Wes Craven’s “Scream” (1996) with Drew Barrymore taking over Carol Kane’s role.

It’s a work of art with a rich, atmospheric score by Dana Kaproff. Unfortunately there’s a little too much drag time in the long mid-section, which wouldn’t work for modern viewers with ADHD. Then there’s the individual unconscious in the closet with no wounds (rolling my eyes).

The movie runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles.

Harry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he's a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.

Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.

Director Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.

The characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious ""who done it"" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.

Owls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10 || Alright first lets start with my problems with this movie.
Some of the effects do not hold up and that can take away from the magic or suspense.
The child actors are not very good at acting in this movie.
 It is way to easy to nitpick this movie and all the nitpicks can be very distracting.
I think the main theme was used way to much in the beginning and that kind of took the magic out of the main theme for me.
I personally did not get sucked into this world which made me kind of bored at times.
People love the harry potter movies but these movies don't really click with me when it comes to characters, the lore, and the magic and I think the full story of harry potter is to drawn out and I just want the movies to get to the point.
For me if the ending of the film is not very satisfying my respect for the movie drops a ton and I don't think the ending of this movie was very satisfying!
The villain in this movie is super basic.
Now on to the good stuff!
I like how most of the scenes build up the characters, show us some magic, and it builds up the mystery!
I like the sets and costumes a lot!
I like most of the music! || _Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone_ is a masterclass is world building. This movie's world breathes and slowly discovering every inch of it is a joy, from Diagon Alley to Hogwarts Castle.

I would not say the story is overly brilliant, but that is just a catalyst for the world in this first film. Despite its minor drawbacks, it does enough to intrigue the viewer and kept me engaged.

The performances are a little off, which is expected as this film is primarily carried by three twelve-year-olds. But they get better as the film progresses and the adults in the film are able to bring the average up with their amazing performances.

Overall, this movie suffers from being dated with poor effects, CGI, and some rough child acting. Never-the-less, it manages to create an experience like no other and I expect the films to do nothing but improve from the initial entry.

Their tumultuous relationship, peppered with plenty of pithy dialogue and partnered with an outstanding collection of songs from award winning lyricists Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, James Hanley and Grant Clarke just makes this an excellent piece of theatre on a big screen.

The deed, well that is to rid the kingdom of a pesky dragon - ""the Jabberwocky"". Right from the get-go, the would be fairy tale romance is so implausible as to go from mildly amusing at first to downright irritating after about ten minutes. Thereafter, a cast of British theatrical stalwarts and comedians do try to keep this film vaguely entertaining, but the humour is just far too contrived and piecemeal. Palin works hard, but the exhaustion in having to stretch this thinnest of stories out for 1¾ hours is writ large on his face until, by the end, even he looks like he is thinking - ""Please, let's just get this over with"". ""Star Wars"" fans might spot ""Darth Vader"" himself and from a star-spotting perspective, there is some value in the film but otherwise it is a poorly conceived and executed attempt at a fantasy adventure and my money was always on the dragon!"

When he's caught speeding on the way to Paris and pursued by the police, Michel kills the officer. Desperate to collect some money owed and make his escape to Italy, he hides out with Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American girl he had slept with once and who is oblivious to the danger he's in.

This is one of the most influential films of all time in its liberal use of jump cuts, in idolizing American noir films and transferring that aesthetic to a foreign country, and its allusions to other films and even self-referentially to itself. Goddard left plenty of signs that he was seeking to overturn the staid French mainstream tradition, such as when Michel rebuffs a hawker selling <i>Cahiers du cinema</i> (the French film magazine), or when Patricia interviews a film director named Parvulesco, who is none other than Godard's New Wave comrade-in-arms Jean-Pierre Melville.

<i>À bout de souffle</i> is undeniably dated. Even knowing all that context around its creation and reception, I found it hard to be really bowled over and cannot award the film a full five stars – and I am a great fan of Godard’s subsequent work. Still, there's a lot to like. I'm particularly fond of the film's dialogue, which revels in French slang that hitherto had not been consider ""proper"" for art, most of which goes over Patricia's head and some of which Michel explains. In that sense one might compare the film to Raymond Queneau's novel <i>Zazie dans le métro</i> from the same time. The sexual frankness of its young characters might surprise younger viewers who would place this social upheaval to later in the 1960s. || Jean-Paul Belmondo spends much of this film in just his boxers after his ""Poiccard/Kovacs"" character pinches a car, kills the pursuing police officer and the ends up taking refuge with his new journalism student friend ""Patricia"" (Jean Seberg). She's not quite aware of the extent of the trouble her new beau is in when he sets about trying to convince her that he has some cash coming and that they should go and live in Italy. His identity isn't exactly unknown to the cops either, and with his face plastered over the front page of every newspaper in Paris, his chances of attaining his idyll are beginning to look remote - especially as he has precisely no self-awareness as he travels the city for all to see. Of course, it has to be only a matter of time before ""Patricia"" finds out the truth about him - but what will she decide to do? It's essentially a two-hander between the pair and they gel well as the story gathers pace. Seberg's character is engaging and it's easy to see why she falls for the enigmatic and charming criminal who exudes about as much menace as a wet cabbage. There's a fun interview scene when she is charged with quizzing the writer ""Parvulesco"" (Jean-Pierre mMlville) - a rather pompous individual who announces his life's ambition is to become immortal and die. I guess that might have been how ""Poiccard"" might have looked at things too - though maybe not the second element too soon. Now the editing. Hmmm. It's messy. Might that be deliberate or just an intern with some sellotape and a blunt razor blade? It's another talking point for this quirky and entertaining crime drama - with a difference."
16441.0,The Beastmaster,"Dar, is the son of a king, who's hunted by a priest after his birth and grows up in another family. When he becomes a grown man, his new father is murdered by savages and he discovers that he's the ability to communicate with the animals, which leads him on his quest for revenge against his father's killers.","Born with the courage of an eagle, the strength of a black tiger, and the power of a god.","Fantasy, Adventure, Action",118.0,1982-08-16,en,6.3,419.0,1.6494,"Marc Singer, Tanya Roberts, Rip Torn, John Amos, Rod Loomis","Don Coscarelli, Don Coscarelli, Paul Pepperman","sacrifice, magic, sword, tiger, pregnancy, sorcery, sword fight, murder, severed head, massacre, battle, animals, witchcraft, dead dog, sword and sorcery","_**Dynamic Marc Singer, stunning Tanya Roberts, horrific creatures and cute ‘n’ cuddly critters**_

Seeking vengeance for the murder of his adopted family & tribe, a warrior named Dar (Marc Singer) goes after the man responsible, high priest Maax (Rip Torn). On the way Dar enlists an eagle he names Sharak, a pair of thieving ferrets named Kodo and Podo, and a black tiger called Ruh. Tanya Roberts is on hand as Kiri, a woman Dar finds alluring while John Amos appears as Seth, a formidable bodyguard. 

“The Beastmaster” (1982) came out during the sword & sorcery glut of the early 80s. It may not be as great as “Conan the Barbarian,” but it’s superior to “The Sword and the Sorcerer,” both released earlier the same year. 

The film has a fitting cast and features a nice mix of horrific, dynamic and cute. The witches and winged creatures fit into the horrific category while Singer presents a dynamic protagonist. He’s 6’2” and lithe with a masculine face despite the (dirt) blond hair. He seems smarter than Schwarzenegger and lacks his cumbersome bulk. Meanwhile this is a great flick for animal lovers and you’ll probably want to go out and buy a ferret or two.

Tanya is stunning as usual, but appears too thin. She’d look better in “Sheena” (1984) and, especially, “A View to a Kill” (1985). Unfortunately, she never advanced to anything greater than these films; but at least we have these to remember her.

Unlike “The Sword and the Sorcerer” and “Conan the Barbarian,” which came out 3-4 months prior, “The Beastmaster” failed to generate similar box office earnings. It only garnered $14 million from its $8 million investment. Nevertheless, it’s an entertaining early 80’s sword & sorcery flick

The movie runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Valley of Fire State Park in Overton, Nevada, as well as Pyramid Lake & Semi Valley, California, both northwest of Los Angeles in the high country.

GRADE: B || **It deserves to be forgotten.**

Who doesn't like a good dose of cheese? I think almost everyone likes it, but I don't know if things work the same way in cinema. It's really hard to see this film in its entirety because kitsch bad taste dominates.

It all starts with the script, which is so stupid that I confess I got lost in it, and that doesn't usually happen, even when the movies are really bad. The cinematography, of misty tones and unpleasant to the eyes, does not obscure the poorly elaborate sets and costumes worthy of a poor comic. Of course, the main actors appear in far fewer clothes when they have to. After all, certain things always sell a movie, no matter how bad it is. The cast is dominated by Marc Singer and Tanya Roberts. I think they were never good actors, despite her having participated in a film from the 007 saga. Even so, in the midst of a cast of amateurs with very little talent, they look like two movie stars.

I'm a little surprised that they made a sequel to such a poor movie, but it was the 80's, and the likes of that decade are considered dubious in almost everything up to the present day."

She is despatched on a cruise liner where she meets the married ""Jerry"" (Paul Henried) and though there is a semblance of a romance, it can come to nothing and it is only after a long, occasionally torrid but always riveting series of scenarios, that we begin to arrive at anything that might resemble a conclusion. Irving Rapper does really well to allow Max Steiner's score and an excellent Casey Robinson screenplay to empower his stars to create and develop characters in whom - especially Davis - we can readily invest. I have never been Henreid's biggest fan, I always found him just a little bit insipid, but he works well here as does a really on form Cooper in the role of her mother. Seen very recently on a big screen again after almost 80 years, and it has lost none of it's style, panache and wonderfully paced sense of the dramatic. Great stuff!"

A critical part of WWII gets the big epic cinematic treatment, with all star casting and lots of noise. Though purporting to be exactly how things were during this particular battle, a pinch of salt is also needed. Much of the film is taken up with laying foundations for the air-sea engagement of the title, political posturing and military machinations are joined by needless sub-plots. The dialogue is often cheese laden, some characterisations equally so, while the splicing of real life footage and other war movie moments start to detract. However, the last third of film is thrilling and worth waiting for, a whirl of battle action as the Pacific conflict comes vividly to life both visually and aurally. 6.5/10"

katharine hepburn has easily become my favorite jo march. in reality, this film is probably five stars for the first half, and two for the second.

one thing i really liked about this version compared to the others was the subtle forshadowing of key events. beth's introduction shows her with a cold and a broken piano, and i liked how she begged her sisters to find an imperfection in her, but they couldn't. her desperateness to fit in with them. a subtle hint at her fear of being left behind. then amy's first scene has her getting in trouble for doodling in class, which shows us early on that she is artistically aligned, though perhaps not completely encouraged, which makes her decision to go with aunt march feel all the more justified. and jo is right away mischevious, working for her aunt but intentionally acting lazy and boyish. as someone who believes jo to be transmasc more than a lesbian (though she could be both), i felt that the first half of this was way more in line with how i imagine jo in my head.

the only character who feels a bit underdeveloped to me is meg, but this is likely because her character falls intro tropes typical of female characters in this era. they don't see the need to break the mold with her. it's times like these, though, that i miss the precision and delicacy of gerwig's adaptation.

i will also add that this is my least favorite laurie and marmee. laurie still has a fun dynamic with jo initially, but christian bale will always be my favorite, even if i believe gerwig understood his character more than anyone. and marmee, besides her incredibly kind nature, didn't stand out to me here, though we can't all be susan sarandon.

oh, and i didn't know how to include this in my review, but i also really loved that jo stepped asside at the family gathering to talk to beth in heaven. that she never forgot her and spoke to her about things that'd make her happy, like the family being back together again. it's a really cute detail that adds a lot to their deep love for one another."

Why two actresses? Well that's because Luis Buñuel has decided to tell this entertaining story using a couple of timelines that show just how this rather stayed and sophisticated man fell under the spell of his servant and of how their relationship evolved (to put it loosely) over time. These actresses are not, however, different to illustrate the passing of time - more to demonstrate the different and frequently contrasting personalities presented by ""Conchita"". We, like the passengers on the train to whom the story is being regaled, vacillate between laughter and despair as this curious character study unfolds/unravels before us in a quickly paced hundred minutes of lively cinema. The dialogue is pithy and potent - it also leaves us to make our own judgements on the characters and upon their flaws and foibles. Perhaps she is a tease? Perhaps he is a gullible old fool? Perhaps she is unhappy at being the object of an unsought affection? Perhaps he is more predatory than he might outwardly seem? Perhaps none of the aforementioned apply? Well we must judge for ourselves. It does require a bit of concentration, this film - and that's no bad thing because there is lots going on for us to enjoy with some fine and intimate photography from Edmond Richard to keep it personal and interesting too.

Dressed to Kill is directed and written by Brian De Palma. It stars Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Ralf D. Bode.

Brian De Palma continues his commitment to Hitchcock thrillers with this erotic and lurid slice of entertainment pie. Plot in short order finds a razor wielding blonde woman on the loose in the city. A high class prostitute, a psychiatrist and the son of a victim try to solve the mystery before they themselves fall to the blonde killer.

De Palma throws it all at the audience here, merrily pushing people's buttons as he goes. He uses all the tools and tricks of his trade for maximum impact, blending a number of genre staples and churning out a hyper stylised neo-noir that gleefully toys with audience expectations. Oh the plot is bonkers, deliriously so, but De Palma is a crafty pro who deftly marries up the excesses of the plot with virtuoso camera work, and not content with that he then brings Donaggio's musical score into play to ensure the viewer's senses are tingling.

Unsurprisingly for the director, Dressed to Kill is sexually charged and violent, from the steamy beginning that ruffled feathers in a number of quarters, to the outrageous coda at the end where De Palma homage's himself, it's a film revelling in its schlocky being. However, it still has time for dramatic suspense and dangerously sensual mysticism, reference an extended section of film that sees Allen's hooker pursued relentlessly through the perils of the subway system, and a sequence played out at an art gallery without dialogue as we become Dickinson's disoriented eyes. Then there is the key murder scene, a dizzying array of slashes and cartoonish blood, it's purposely excessive and followed by screw tightening suspense that sets up the rest of the movie.

De Palma and his on form principal cast members are having fun, how could they not with such trashy material to work from? Is Dressed to Kill phobic and misogynistic? Well plenty of people think so, in fact there was quite a fall out when the film was first released, when De Palma was subjected to the ire of a few minority groups. Judge for yourself is the only way to go really, but personally in amongst the schlock I feel there's comment on the dangers of fantasising beyond your realm, or of unfaithfulness, maybe even that America is itself irresponsible for its treatment of women on film? Of course it could just be De Palma at his most playful? Sitting there giggling to himself as others lose their cool… 8/10 || Following a housewife’s brutal murder, the only witness to the incident teams up with the woman’s son to try to find the culprit which leads them to the patient of a psychiatrist who treated her and tries to stop the killer from striking them in order to cover the crime.

This one turned out to be quite the rather enjoyable effort. A lot of the film’s great parts come from the manner in which this one deals with the expectations featured here of the film by following so close to its influences. As it follows so close to the main format here, as the general structure employed here comes directly with the structure of having the first half focus solely on the victim to get killed off and then morph over into the investigation into the incidents, that makes for a great deal of fun here as it deals with the few changes to be had with the storyline. That familiarity lends itself a great deal to the overall manner in which this one moves along as that keeps this one a lot more entertaining than it really should be without a whole lot of slashing action throughout here. With a big emphasis on the murder investigation and her involvement in the procedure, there’s a nice emphasis here to follow up the later adverts of that ones’ followers in a distinctly European manner by introducing not only the main investigation from the police but also going rather nicely into the amateur investigation by way of a piece of evidence only briefly glimpsed during the incident that becomes a central part of the investigation. These elements all give it a rather distinct and pronounced atmosphere to these brands of films which really lets it dwell in that type of sleaze far more comfortably than would be expected, not only from the type of nudity but also the rather stark sex scenes and frequently intoned psychosexual themes from the killer’s motivation which is straight out of that particular school of thriller which makes this one connect quite well there. Even with some incredibly well-done stalker scenes, including the opening attack in the elevator, the subway sequence or the finale at the office which give this some rather suspenseful stalking as well to balance it all with plenty to like. These don’t help the fact that there’s just not a whole lot of slasher action here, as the more thriller aspects here dominate this one so it doesn’t have a lot of stalking scenes and the body count itself is so low as to not really offer much in the way of bloodshed or gore. Those looking for a straight-up slasher won’t be interested in this one at all.

Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Full Nudity, Graphic Violence and several intense sex scenes. || It is an enjoyable film...but one with several natural endings. And that kind of makes for a fail. You're ready for the movie to be over after it concludes and then you wait until it concludes again, and then you wait until is actually concludes.

However, it is tense, which is a De Palma hallmark, he knows how to make for a tense thriller, and that is where the appeal is, that is what really sets Dressed to Kill above a lot of other films. It plays on the nerves."

Done right after the glory that was The Empire Strikes Back and released to a public that had forgotten who Flash Gordon was or what the 1930's serials with Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe represented. Although the public was drooling desire for more high tech special effects and serious Space Opera, Flash went in the opposite direction and brought Campy back with a style all his own. This movie PERFECTLY recreated everything that those early B&W serials threw at those screaming kids sitting up in the movie theater balcony. Not to mention that the actor recreations were done as if the drawn characters came to life and leaped out of the funny papers to star on the silver screen. Max von Sydow IS Emperor Ming. Brian Blessed IS Prince Vultan. Sam Jones and Melody Anderson came in as the unknowns they needed to be and stole the show. The ONLY downfall to this movie was the fact that it did so poorly at the box office and never received the sequel it hinted at in its ending. || Campy and fun science fiction fantasy-adventure flick has some cheesy but colorful and good production designs and the performances for the most part were fine, with Max Von Sydow lending prestige to a goofy character and Sam J. Jones was okay in the lead, but he's really not asked to do a whole lot (both in acting and fighting) while Melody Anderson was alright though the ""romance"" between her and Flash Gordon was a bit forced. And for its time, I thought the special/visual effects were adequate, superior to the likes of Superman 3 & 4 released years later (1983/1987). Enjoyable time waster and would probably revisit again. **4.0/5** || Now then, anyone who thinks that Max von Sydov's best film was ""the Seventh Seal"" (1957) really does need to get their priorities right: forget Ingmar Bergman - it has to be this marvellously camp effort from Mike Hodges and Dino de Laurentiis that allows him to act the megalomanic whilst dressing up like the best panto villain you're ever likely to encounter. Sam J. Jones is the eponymous hero who, alongside the rather hapless Melody Anderson (""Dale"") and Topol's slightly demented scientist (""Zarkov""), falls prey to the mischievous games of ""Ming the Merciless"" as he toys with the Earth. Once the intrepid trio arrive on ""Mongo"" they must fight for their very survival. In the case of ""Flash"", the poor fellow - who spends much of the film like a startled rabbit in the headlights - has to defend his virtue from the positively predatory ""Princess Aura"" (Ornella Muti) who's supposed to be betrothed to ""Barin"" (Timothy Dalton) who is, himself, constantly sparring with Brian Blessed's ""Vultan"" - king of the hawk-men. Add in the wonderfully creepy Peter Wyngarde as ""Klytus"" and Margiangela Melato as his villainous deputy ""Kala"" and we have the perfect ingredients for almost two hours of classic comic book action in the best tradition of ""thwack"" and ""pow"". The thing is 40 years old now - hence it's re-release on the big screen - and it doesn't look like any efforts have been made to improve on the original. The effects are therefore pretty ropey, the CGI as obvious as the delightfully cheap and cheerful costumes of the lizard-men and the munchkins who are dressed much like the playing cards from ""Alice in Wonderland"". Freddie Mercury and Queen provide a bit of added ""glamour"" to the proceedings with their title song and the eagle-eyed amongst us might just spot a 30 year old Robbie Coltrane in there too. Escapist nonsense? Sure - but it is still all good, uncomplicated, fun with it's tongue in it's cheek and just about everything else in leather, lycra and/or tights!"

It's a raging ""B"" schlocker, but a fun one. Filmed in ""CineMagic"" in New Eastman Color 5250 no less! It essentially pits the crew, three men and one woman, in a situation where they land on Mars, gel in various ways, then start going out onto the Red Planet itself to gather information etc.

Their explorations start off innocently enough, but soon they start to sense that the planet is becoming a bit hostile. Time to head home, if they still can. The dialogue and performances here are all pretty nondescript and the interiors are all standard studio lights and buzzers. It's the photographical effort to create the Martian landscape by shooting everything through red filters that is bit more innovative. It doesn't really work as it's nigh on impossible to discern the characters from their surroundings, but at least it shows that someone was at least trying something different. It's a bit long, but still just about watchable and no worse than a load of these 1950s American sci-fi efforts.

The only interesting and innovative point in this one is that we have a woman as Harry's partner. Eastwood keeps nailing his role but that's about it.

A foreseeable plot with quite a mediocre development.

Probably, the best in this one is the music. || Here's a seven-point suppository!

The Enforcer is directed by James Fargo and collectively written by Harry Julian Fink, Rita M. Fink, Stirling Silliphant, Dean Riesner, Gail Morgan Hickman and S.W. Schurr. It stars Clint Eastwood, Tyne Daly, Harry Guardino, Bradford Dillman,  DeVeren Bookwalter and John Mitchum. Music is by Jerry Fielding and cinematography by Charles W. Short.

Dirty Harry Callahan is tasked with foiling a terrorist organization made up of supposed revolutionaries. However, when he's partnered by a rookie female cop he's far from best pleased and feels sure she's out of her depth.

This is the third entry of what would eventually become five Clint Eastwood starring Dirty Harry films. Sensing the need to inject a bit of freshness to what was obviously going to be a safe ""no nonsense cop"" formula, the makers introduce a nifty complexity to Callahan's world by pairing him up with a female cop - one that's fresh out of school. So with Callahan's propensity for being irked about partners in general, and his suspected misogyny dangled by his superiors, this is a forward thinking turn of events by the writers.

From a narrative stand point director Fargo (for his feature film debut) doesn't deviate from what made the previous two films a success. Pacing is steady so that this allows dramatic character interplays to breathe, and forceful action sequences bounce into the fray at various junctures. This is not however detrimental to the story, which zips along and is punctured by customary Dirty Harry humour. The relationship between Harry and Kate (passable but not quite a great casting choice) builds through various stages, from begrudging mentor and pupil beginnings, to something that actually ends up rather touching.

Sadly this ""Dirty Harry"" film lacks great villainy, the People's Revolutionary Strike Force come off as a mixed bunch of psychos and confused hippies, with not enough screen time for their leader (Bookwalter) to impact greatly on proceedings. Be that as it may, there's enough for Callahan to chew on, with the gruff straight talking cop surrounded by the usual moronic bureaucrats and handy allies (the always great Albert Popwell in a customary appearance). Where it stands with fans of the Dirty Harry series as a whole is unclear? for The Enforcer appears to now be fondly remembered more the decades have passed. But it certainly is no dead loss and a strong 7/10 rating I feel is fully justified. || Not as enjoyable as the first two, but <em>'The Enforcer'</em> still entertains.

Clint Eastwood is again excellent in reprising the role of Harry Callahan, while the support cast is spearheaded by the likes of Tyne Daly and Harry Guardino. I don't really have much to say that's different from the 1971 and 1973 films, in that it's a fun flick that is paced well; even if, again, it is a drop from its two predecessors."

The opening chunk of <em>'The Gauntlet'</em> is promising, I liked what I was seeing and what was being crafted together. It never quite reaches the heights I thought it might have, though that doesn't stop the fact that this 1977 film is still very good.

Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke team up yet again, as seen in many other productions from around this era. Of the five I've currently seen with those two, this is the most I've enjoyed them as a pair - especially Locke. Pat Hingle and William Prince are the most noteworthy of the rest.

I found the two leads to be entertaining and the plot to be strong fun, there are a lot of neat practical set pieces used which are pleasing. As for things that stopped me from loving this release, one would be the ending - which is good, but could've perhaps been greater - and the villains - who are a little meh, character-wise anyway.

All in all, a film that is very much worth watching in my opinion."

Is he out to kill Cameron just to get a good scene or two from him? Or is he actually a caring person who would never hurt a fly? You won't know until the film is just about over.
Basically, Cameron is on the run from the Law. He stumbles into a film set and (perhaps) causes the death of the film's stunt man. Ely Cross, the director, offers Cameron a place to hide from the Law if he'll replace the stunt man until the film is done shooting. Cameron agrees.
From that point, nothing is what it seems. The film blends the real with the surreal world of filmmaking that will have you smiling throughout.
High Points are the Soundtrack and Barbara Hershey. Barbara has never been more beautiful here, and she gives the performance of a lifetime. Location filming was at the Del Coronado Hotel in San Diego. The same hotel was used for Some Like It Hot. || I'd like to embellish the previous review... CaptNemo did a good job summing up the movie, but there are a few other interesting things that can be said about it. My short summary is that this is probably the best ""meta"" movie, or movie about making movies you'll find. I discovered the film on cable TV, and immediately fell in love with it. A short time later I came across the Brodeur novel in a used bookstore, and bought and read it immediately. The novel is quite dark, and has a number of plot issues. In several ways the movie is more fun and better than the book. But it's a *quite* different story.
 
One area I disagree with CaptNemo is where he said that you find out everything at the end of the movie... I don't find the end of the movie completely illuminating -- some things are fairly clear, but there is much that's still open to interpretation... which is one of the things that makes it so fun to watch again!

I only owned the laser disc edition of this movie for many years. I only recently acquired the DVD to have it in a more modern format to show to friends. And so then I discovered the commentary, and only as a result of that commentary I found out about the documentary film about the movie, ""The Sinister Saga of Making The Stunt Man."" If you're a fan of this movie, the documentary is a must-have!

Regarding the movie-within-a-movie, it's difficult to say if it would have been a good movie or not. Is Eli Cross a good director? We don't really know. We're only offered tantalizing glimpses of his work. It would have been nice if the DVD special features included the screenplay of the movie-within-a-movie, or maybe even stitched some of the scenes together, like was done for the DVD of the movie-within-the-movie in Joe Dante's ""Matinee."""

However, it is poorly communicated, and it was poorly communicated in the sixties when this was made. 
Perhaps it made some sense to people as far back as 1960, but I don't get it.
Sinatra and the others are supposed to be ""cool"", but all they do is act like they have superiority complexes, and everyone else buys into it.
This is usual for all the brat pack movies then and the brat pack movies today.
It was actually worse with the old Ocean's Eleven.
I was thoroughly bored with every scene, and didn't care one white about Sinatra and his group. Maybe Peter Lawford was okay, because he seemed bored by the whole ""superiority"" thing, too. And maybe Sammy Davis Jr. 
No one else.
There were other heist movies. ""Five Against the House"" was the top one, and although I wasn't overly fond of it, that one still gets three times the rating I give this.

Bored with the relentlessness of it all, he puts in his papers to the chagrin of his commanding officer. With two weeks left to go, he is flying a reconnaissance mission over Bosnia when he is shot down, his pilot murdered by rogue troops and he is forced to flee for his life - pursued by a ruthless sniper - whilst his task force colleagues try to find and rescue him. Based on a true story, it is actually quite a well paced manhunt with plenty of peril and pace. What diminishes it is the really poor choice of actor to lead. Wilson plays the disinterested flier well enough at the start, but as things heat up on the ground he really isn't good enough to hold the film up en seul. Gene Hackman is his boss (Adm. Reigert), and he isn't really up to very much either - though he does do the slightly gung-go ""go get our boy back"" role well enough. The premiss of the genocide being perpetrated on the locals is writ large, and having seen much news coverage at the time of this largely forgotten Balkan war, the story is not without it's potency. It is quite watchable, but is still a somewhat light-weight depiction of a truly difficult situation. || Behind Enemy Lines is one of those movies that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, a straightforward action thriller with high-stakes chases and explosions. The plot is predictable, filled with familiar tropes and moments that feel like they were borrowed from other war films and stitched together. It doesn’t have much depth or originality, but it still manages to be entertaining. The directing leans heavily on fast cuts and a hyperactive camera style, which can feel excessive at times, but it keeps the pacing tight. The cinematography does a decent job of capturing the tension, with some impressive aerial shots and a gritty, cold war-zone atmosphere.

What carries the film is the acting. Owen Wilson, stepping away from his usual comedic roles, delivers a solid performance as the lead, and Gene Hackman brings the expected level of authority and gravitas. The script is functional but nothing special, just enough to push the action forward without adding much depth to the characters. The score complements the tension well but isn’t particularly memorable. Despite all its flaws, I still found myself enjoying it. Maybe it's the mix of solid performances and non-stop action, or maybe it's just one of those movies that works as a guilty pleasure."

A choppy mess! The changing of history is kinda irrelevant in films of this type, you tend to go in just wanting to be thrilled and tingled. Sadly this can do neither and can only light the fires of a youthful audience interested in the pretty stars on show. It's western genre movie making 101, MTV video style. There's no flow or reason for instances, the characterisations veer from possibly interesting to sideline dummies. 

It was held back for release by the studio for two years +, and tinkered with by Jack the Ripper in the editing room, so it's hardly surprising it was a major flop and didn't even make enough money back to pay for the post party cakes.

Literally fresh out of prison, Danny Ocean is busy setting up a seemingly impossible robbery. The plan, along with ten other experts he has roped in, is to rob the main vault at Las Vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.

The original Ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an OK film, more watchable for the Vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of Rat Packers than for any purpose or structure. That this Steven Soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. Some would put a case up for the cast of Soderberg's film using stars to entice the audience in? But really at the time of release it was a stretch to put George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (all excellent here) on the same pedal stool as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin.

The most striking thing about this remake is that the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves, mainly because they are not being asked to over exert their performances from their very astute director, they really are just asked to turn up, enjoy each other's company and deliver one of the coolest pictures to have been made in the decade.

The film is purely out there to entertain, it has geniality pouring out from every frame, this is a character based heist caper full of laughs and derring do shenanigans - even Don Cheadle's ill advised (and pointless character arc) cockney accent manages to create smiles instead of being an on going hindrance. Some critics said the film is far too shallow to have any real worth! What the hell do they want? So the crooks are nice guys, it's a refreshing change to see a Vegas sparkling bright without any seedy undercurrents, where these robbers aren't using AK 47s to obliterate the opposition, it's wits and dashes of cool that fills out their respective armouries.

The soundtrack and scoring are themselves cool characters in the piece, whilst a big shout out goes to the bona fide stunt work from the wonderfully elastic Shaobo Qin - which merely puts another cherry on this already delightful cake. All the cast (too many to mention) are great, from Andy Garcia's suave and mean boss, Terry Benedict, to Julia Roberts' (walking like a goddess) Tess Ocean, all things in the film deliver a feel good movie that when all put together, and all things considered, is a film made by lovers of the medium for, well yes, lovers of the medium itself! 9/10 || Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

As far as heist movies go, it's excellent, but I think I'm very picky when it comes to heist movies.  In order to get me behind the criminal protagonist, it needs to be overly complex, but not complicated, and there needs to be an alternative motive, such as ""get the girl"".

This entire franchise does a decent job of this, keeping the motives and implementations interesting.  Part of the problem with that is that because of how complex the heist is, have the movie is an explanation of how the heist is going to happen (with JUST enough information left out for misdirects), then there is the actual heist, with some misdirects, and an explanation of the gaps, if not the heist itself, then a resolution.

That's the formula for every heist movie ever, which is part of what makes it boring.  It has to be special to really grab a audience and make it memorable.

This movie does all this with a great cast, and certainly enough production value.  While it is certainly really interesting and entertaining, I can't really say its a great movie.  We can chalk it up as personal bias, but I do think everyone should see this version as it has some historical value and is well worth the watch. || **My favorite movie of all time! A must-see!**

Ocean's Eleven greatest strength is its emersion of the audience into the midst of a story already in motion. The pacing isn't weighed down by exposition; instead, the viewer discovers important history and surprises simultaneously as the characters on screen. The absolutely brilliant cast is effortlessly charming, whose antics and charisma fuel the movie to be a wonderful ride from start to finish. You can't help but feel welcomed into Danny Ocean's crew. With amazing acting, storytelling, clever twists, and exceptional directing, Ocean's Eleven is a must-see and my favorite movie of all time. As a young teen who stood firmly in the grunge camp of wearing ripped jeans and rock 'n' roll t-shirts, Ocean's Eleven convinced me that every now and then... suits are cool too."

And then there were...too many.

From Agatha Christie’s highly acclaimed novel, originally published as Ten Little Indians, comes this mediocre “thriller”. With an all-star cast, including Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Houston, Louis Hayward, and Roland Young, and directed by Rene Clair, you’d think you were in for one of the all-time great mystery thrillers of the ‘40’s. Especially considering the material it came from: Christie’s expertly-written, suspenseful, and at times downright frightening novel is a great read that I highly recommend to anyone whose nerves can handle it. It’s one of the greatest stories of human corruption and brutality, of heinous crimes committed by a twisted mind, ever written.

Bottom line: the film is a bleak and utter disappointment.

I then found out that the movie was actually based upon the stage play version, also written by Agatha Christie in 1943, four years after the publication of the novel. She rewrote the ending, reportedly feeling that the original ending would be too depressing for wartime audiences…making the very title no longer applicable! Instead of the dark and bloody climax of the novel, she went in for a “happily ever after” love story.

Miss Christie, what were you thinking?!

If the production had been adapted from the novel instead, perhaps it could have been a good, worthwhile film. Although, the movie was also made during wartime; hence the usage of the alternate, rather than the original, ending.

Ultimately, the film never reaches the level of shock and suspense that is inherent in the novel. The only positive thing I can say is that the cast was competent, and Walter Huston definitely stood out.

Overall, you’d be better off reading the real And Then There Were None. In the film, there were too many left. || This is a superbly directed (by René Clair) adaptation of one of Agatha Christie's more intriguing murder mysteries that I don't think has been surpassed in the 75-odd years since it first hit the screen. A great ensemble cast are invited to weekend on a remote island by a couple they have never met. Once on the island, their host - by way of a record - accuses each of them of committing heinous crimes; then slowly - but surely - they start to drop like flies. I suppose I have to warn that in the vernacular of the 2020s, this film contains language and terminology that we might find offensive nowadays, but suspend the correctness for 100 minutes and you'll get a great murder mystery featuring a super cast - especially Barry Fitzgerald (""Judge Quincannon""); Louis Hayward (""Lombard"") and June Duprez (""Vera"") ; as well as some classy contributions from Judith Anderson and Sir C. Aubrey Smith and some clever staging/dialogue with a genuinely good ""whodunit"" ending with a twist. As with a few Christie stories, it's quite plausible that anyone did it and on stage it wasn't always the same character behind the plotting - so don't assume you will know who is the cunning brain behind it all if you've seen any other iterations."

Then his world comes, quite literally, crashing about his ears and he finds himself in jail explaining what happened to psychologist ""McCabe"" (the sparingly used Kurt Russell). It's a story of jealousy that leads to suicide, disfigurement and presents us with a rather stark indictment of this man's rather shallow and selfish life. His decline all starts when ""Julie"" - who seems quite a bit more invested in their relationship than he does - gets a bit jealous of his flirtations with ""Sofia"" (Penélope Cruz) who was dating his best friend ""Shelby"" (Jason Lee) until he brings her along to his party.

Which, if any of the scenarios unfolding is the true one? Are any of them? The story itself is not especially innovative. What does impress here is Cruise playing a character that is pretty unlikeable and he does it well. He imbues ""Aames"" with characteristics that made me feel a life behind bars was just about right. Unfortunately, I felt Cruz's ""Sofia"" character a bit under-developed but there are plaudits for Diaz who really does deliver her role of the jilted, besotted, lover convincingly. It takes too long to get up to speed, and there is too much dialogue but the last hour presents us with quite a compelling look at self-destruction in a man ill-equipped to deal with anything he hadn't already dealt with using his silver spoon and good looks.

""Lantana"" is an Australian drama from 2001 about four couples in the Sydney area (where the film was shot). There are some important peripheral characters as well. The husband of the main couple is a detective going through a mid-life crisis (Anthony LaPaglia). His wife (Kerry Armstrong) knows something's wrong and is getting counseling. The marriage of her counselor (Barbara Hershey) is also troubled due to the death of their young daughter 18 months earlier. The woman the detective is having a fling with (Rachael Blake) lives next door to a couple whose marriage is the only solid relationship in the story (Vince Colosimo & Daniela Farinacci). Or is it? When one of these women turns up missing the counselor's husband becomes a suspect (Geoffrey Rush).

The reason the film's called ""Lantana"" is because lantana is a tangled shrub common in Australia, which represents the entanglements of the lives of the characters. It also symbolizes marriage since lantana has a sweet but bitter smell: it's beautiful with its flowers, but has ""stings""; its branches weave together in a complicated way and in the story a woman is caught in the complexity of it.

""Lantana"" is the antithesis of big, dumb, effects-laden ""blockbusters,"" which oddly enough often become boring with their overload of ""exciting"" things going on. ""Lantana"" effectively shows that ordinary life is more interesting and compelling, if done right. Human nature is explored through a blend of passionate emotions, misconceptions, betrayals, anger, premature conclusions, vanity, duty, ethics, lies, honesty, loyalty, repentance and restoration.

Three of my all-time favorite dramas are ""Grand Canyon” (1991), ""Snow Angels"" (2007) and “Pulp Fiction” (1994). I place ""Lantana"" in their company. That's how exceptional it is.

The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute.

With slight modifications, Sheena is basically a female version of Tarzan and was the first female comic book character with her own title, debuting in 1937 in Great Britain and 1938 in America. The first jungle girl in adventure fiction was Rima from the 1904 book by William Henry Hudson “Green Mansions,” which was made into a movie starring Audrey Hepburn as Rima in 1959. DC Comics later had a short-lived series called “Rima the Jungle Girl” in 1974-75. Model Irish McCalla depicted Sheena in a TV series that aired for one season from 1955-1956.  Meanwhile Marvel Comics developed their own Sheena-like jungle girl named Shanna the She-Devil, which debuted in a short-lived series in late 1972; she was subsequently a guest character in issues of Ka-Zar and Daredevil. Lorna, Nyoka and Jana (aka Jungle Girl) are other comic book jungle heroines, amidst others.

I note the history of jungle females to illustrate their comic book ties. It’s no surprise, therefore, that the movie “Sheena,” aka “Sheena, Queen of the Jungle” (1984) plays like a comic book on screen. Everyone knows going in that the plot, dialog and acting of a film like this will be of the comic book variety with a similar tone to Tarzan flicks or Indiana Jones. What's magnificent, awe-inspiring and ""A"" level are the African locations (Kenya), the entertaining array of animals, the grand score and Tanya Roberts in the titular role.

As far as the African locations go, if you're bored with your every-day locale, this movie is the perfect antidote. It's virtually a two-hour tour of some of the most gorgeous African scenery you'll ever feast your eyes on. Concerning the animals, there are elephants, rhinos, hippos, chimps, giraffes and more; all real and no CGI. As for the score, it's pleasant and meditative; reminiscent of ""Chariots of Fire."" And Tanya Roberts, what can I say? She's a stunning example of womanhood; so is France Zobda as Zanda, but she’s a villain. 

I never concern myself with ratings when watching films, but I couldn't help but be a little surprised by the PG rating here because Sheena (Roberts) is shown TOTALLY nude on a few occasions and prances around throughout the flick in a ridiculously skimpy leather bikini (Zanda is also shown nude getting a massage). Yet it struck me that the nakedness/semi-nakedness is portrayed in an inoffensive way like Eve in Eden before the fall and the consequent awareness of evil. In other words, there's an almost child-like innocence and purity to Sheena even though she's a quite skilled jungle warrior. I commend the filmmakers for capturing this quality. For this reason I don't feel the movie is inappropriate for kids, despite the nudity.

While Siskel & Ebert laughed at “Sheena” on their show in 1984 and wrote it off as a “bad movie,” it’s very effective for what it is: a comic-based flick about a beautiful, but formidable jungle woman, a journalist she meets (Ted Wass) and their fight against evil oppressors. What were they expecting, “Chariots of Fire” or “Gandhi”? Films should be critiqued according to what they ARE and aspire to achieve, not what they aren’t. My appraisal reflects the happy medium between the Grade B plot, dialog & acting and the Grade A African locations, animals, score and Ms. Roberts.

The film runs 117 minutes.

This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.

Fellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).

With those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.

Leaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.

There are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.

More importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...


Verdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.

5/5

- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine || An epic movie if I ever saw one. Captivating and just plain fun to watch. This movie is, indeed, art. || Tolkien’s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.

RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. 

The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        

This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating. 

There are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  

Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. 

Despite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.                      

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.

It makes a play at it in the very start of the film. It loudly proclaims that, HEY, WATCH THIS MOVIE, IT'S ABOUT FREE SPEECH AND THE HOLLYWOOD BLACKLIST!!!!! And it does it as loud as it can...

...and then it kind of forgets what the movie is about up until the last 15 minutes.

However, the bulk of the movie does seem like the kind of film that would fit in the Hollywood Blacklist Era. The plot, the acting, the setting, all seems to be very much a 1950s feel good movie...

...and then it veers off again and delivers on the 1st Amendment moral to end the film with a light heavy hand...if that makes sense.

So, it feels disjointed, but in a way that oddly fits the premise to begin with. Almost as if it is trying to be a movie in a movie, which might have been the point.

There are maybe two people in his life whom he has made some sort of connection with.

A combination of his own inherent insecurities and this way more palpable threat lead Nash to a paranoia that threatens to destroy himself and everything he holds dear. It's also a testament to Howard's direction that he manages to create quite a menacing character from the usually charming Christopher Plummer, whose ""Rosen"" is a dab hand with an hypodermic. Crowe is at his best here, his portrayal of this frankly rather selfish and obnoxious man is almost perfect and though I can't say I ever liked the character, nor felt especially sorry for his predicaments, I did feel invested in just how he could emerge from the internal conflicts he faced unsure of what was true and what was not. A bare minimum of romance to clutter it up and both Harris and Connelly contributing well to a story of a flawed yet brilliant human being makes this well worth a few hours."

Essentially this is a two hander between two actors who work well together, who use a potent - and sometimes humorous - story and script to offer us an insight into an evolution of the need for the survival into one enhanced by an increasing mutual affection. They both have their flaws, their bigotries - but when it comes down to it, their adventures illustrate the very pointlessness of these traits and that message is clearly augmented by the attitude of the decent ""Muller"" and also by many others whom they encounter on their trek for freedom. The story addresses political and racist issues with a punch, we are never faced with pontification here, just with an opportunity to realise for ourselves how petty and stupid some of our irrational attitudes are.

Apart from being a **GREAT** courtroom drama_(which some people don't think this movie is)_, this movie is so much **FUN** and **ENTERTAINING** to watch.Especially because of the characters of _Charles Laughton_ and _Elsa Lanchester_. But _Tyrone Power_ and _Marlene Dietrich_ were convincing too in their portrayal of an _innocent, afraid for his life man and a disloyal, unloving, poker faced wife_ respectively.

Some people might say that they predicted the ending half way down the movie but i am not quite sure as to how they predicted the **ACTUAL ENDING** before it really unfolded before their eyes?

This movie is great not only in the part played in court but also in the scenes shot in _Sir Wilfrid Robarts's_ office(also due to _Miss Plimsoll's caringly lovably irritating character!_).

Perhaps the people(the minority I'd like to believe) who don't think this movie deserves the high ranking and rating that it's got saw this brilliant piece of art as more of a suspense thriller.But I loved this movie as a delightfully ENTERTAINING, MYSTERIOUS, DRAMA !

I rate this 10 just because I haven't seen any other CLASSIC courtroom drama that was intense throughout(barring some light hearted scenes with Sir Wilfrid Robarts) and yet in the end I somehow felt light-hearted and had a smile on my face rather than a thought provoking look on it.

The commentary in the ending credits was innocently adorable for our times of social networking _""The management of this theater suggests that for the greater entertainment of your friends who have not yet seen the picture you will not divulge to anyone the secret of the ending of Witness for the Prosecution!""_

And mind you I am a _big fan of 12 Angry Men and How to Kill a Mockingbird!_ But this movie too is equally good in a different way altogether! || I'm constantly surprised that women's hats don't provoke more murders.

Leonard Steven Vole finds himself on trial for the murder of a wealthy widow from whom he has inherited a fortune. Top barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts takes up the defendants case, but he, along with everyone else, is stunned when Vole's seemingly loving wife Christine turns up to testify against the defendant.

Based on Agatha Christie's successful 1953 play, ""Witness For The Prosecution"" benefited from fine tuning from master director Billy Wilder and writing partner Harry Kurnitz. Here the dialogue becomes razor sharp and the characters are fully realised with quite wonderful results, but chiefly the masterstroke here is not letting a court room drama become just that, a court room drama. The film plays out with no wasted scenes, no moments of boredom, and it has such vim and vigour you sometimes forget that there actually is drama in the story.

The cast here are on fine form, Wilder had wanted to work with Charles Laughton for some time, and it's obvious that both parties here are getting the best out of each other. Laughton is a pure delight as Robarts, a sharp tongue, all bluster and cheeky into the bargain, his interplay with Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's real life wife Elsa Lanchester) is quality, and it's another testament to Wilder's genius for putting them together. Tyrone Power, in what would be his last completed film before sadly passing away, is devilishly smart as Vole, whilst Torin Thatcher is great as the gruff prosecution barrister Myers. Yet as good as they all are, they all sit in the shadow of Marlene Dietrich and her turn as Christine Vole, sultry and femme fatalistic, it's a sizzling performance that crowns this delightful film.

It occurred to me overnight that it's probably the closest film that Wilder got to being Hitchcockian, and I'm pretty sure the big master of suspense himself would have enjoyed this one. It's a mystery that is dramatic, it's a thriller that is also funny, it's pretty much a multi genre classic. 9/10"

It's Will Smith who takes centre stage after his gold medal victory at the Tokyo Olympiad in 1964 and like many other pugilists in history, his character offers the down-trodden, working class, an inspiration. With sweat, tears and hard work he can escape the ghetto and have his fame and fortune, so why not them? What Michael Mann now proceeds to do is offer us a biopic of this man - of his peccadilloes, his religious beliefs, his persecution by the government when he refuses to be drafted to Vietnam and of some of his friendships with the great and the good of the equal rights movement that were gaining in prominence and effectiveness under the likes of Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles). We are presented with a plausibly flawed individual, but one who is a proud and savvy man who knows just how to push the buttons to keeps his life-blood's publicity machine going. To that end, here, Smith is well supported by Jamie Foxx's ""Bundini"", the long-suffering Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver) and by Jon Voight as his follicularly challenged media foil from ABC television - Howard Cosell. It's Smith that rather underwhelms. He delivers the set-pieces well enough, presumably he could rehearse them - but the rest of his persona is all rather weak, undercooked and I felt really over-written. There's way too much melodrama and speculation and not enough of what made the man an household name (and favourite) in the first place - his fighting.

Once there, she befriends ""Avigdor"" (Mandy Patinkin) and his fiancée ""Hadass"" (Amy Irving) and her association with them gradually makes her realise that there is much more to life than books and philosophy. Life must be for living. Except, well perhaps no-one would be prepared for the favour her new friend asks of her; one that compromises the very purpose of her study and search for independence. It's at this point that what was a powerful and personable drama starts to come off the rails. There is a cruelty to the narrative that no amount of power-ballading is going to mitigate. I went from being broadly engaged by the ""Yentl/Anschel"" character to being really rather disgusted by the selfishness on display. Certainly that's partly a testament to the acting of Streisand and to the scene-stealing Irving, and it's a potent indictment of marital traditions that don't just exist within the Jewish community, but I still found the preparedness of this would-be scholar to engage in something quite so unkind rather put me off a story about which I no longer cared. The production design is authentic looking and the supporting cast for the first part of the film are engaging, lively and even a little mischievous. ""Papa"" and ""A Piece of Sky"" clearly demonstrate the Legrand/Bergman/Streisand partnership at it's most musically powerful but in the end did this film show us a woman bent on self-improvement or one just concerned about herself? I think however pertinent the purpose of a film may be, it's important for the audience to feel some sympathy with the plaintiff, so to speak. Here I started off like that, but quickly felt a lack of objectivity around the development of the lead characterisation led to the creation of a persona I didn't especially respect and I certainly didn't trust."

What might they do to secure a share of his loot? Might they even slay the fatted calf himself? Well that's the mystery part that Julian Fellowes and an on-form Robert Altman deliver in this quite quirkily crafted upstairs/downstairs whodunit that swipes at just about everyone from all levels of the social scale using cruelty, lust and loads of dark, often sarcastic, humour in the process. Ryan Philippe is the obvious fish out of water amongst their glittering array of Knights and Dames, but he brings a freshness to his rather odious character (""Denton"") and in many ways provides a good foil to the otherwise rather well trammelled plot portrayal of the landed vacuous and the well meaning; the pompous and the selfish. It is well written and well paced after a bit of a slow start that serves to introduce just one too many a character all at once. Kristin Scott Thomas is a natural for these sort of parts; Stephen Fry delivers effectively as the policeman ""Thompson"" and, of course, Dame Maggie Smith is another who takes to these roles like the proverbial duck to water. Now it is a bit long, but when juggling so many characters, potential red herrings, character assassinations and general mischief then I think this is probably about the shortest it could be.

A father and son (Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger) are correctional officers in Louisiana who live with their father, a former corrections officer and hateful racist (Peter Boyle). After overseeing the execution of a black man (Sean 'Diddy' Combs) a couple of tragedies compel the father, Hank (Thornton), to meet the struggling ex-wife of the executed man (Halle Berry).

The cast, locations, score and directing are all excellent. The problem is the contrived script, which tends to focus on the worst in humanity and sometimes creates a feeling of surreal un-reality. As far as the former goes, the first half features ugly racism, prostitution (and the corresponding overt sex scene), hate, a prison execution, an unforeseen suicide and a sudden hit-and-run. If you can handle all that in the first 55 minutes, you might appreciate this movie.

Some of these sequences work (the prostitute scene and the execution) and some don’t (the racism, suicide and hit-and-run). The latter ones have a sense of unreality either because of dubious writing or weak execution, or both. Take, for instance, the racist remarks by the old patriarch (Boyle). They come off unbelievable and laughable (or maybe they wanted them to come off laughable?). With better writing/acting/directing they would’ve worked.  Or take the hit-and-run: it’s totally off-camera; and the segue into the aftermath is weak. The viewer is left asking, “What just happened? Did I miss something?” As for the suicide, it was just unconvincing in more than one way.

Halle won an Oscar for her performance, but I found her miscast. She was too white, too intelligent and too young/gorgeous for the role. As for being “too white,” her son would’ve had lighter skin. In regards to being “too intelligent,” when she has a long talk with Hank on the couch I didn’t buy her character. It came across as an obviously enlightened Berry ACTING uneducated and low class. As for being too young/hot, are we to believe she’s been drinkin’ and smokin’ for ELEVEN YEARS waiting for her former husband to be put to death without any dudes sniffin’ around and no worse for the wear? She should’ve been made up to look older or, at least, more drained. Instead, she looks fresh and thoroughly beautiful from head-to-toe.

Despite all these considerable negatives, the movie conveys a well thought-out message and contains some worthy intricacies, not to mention it refuses idiotic political correctness. For instance, the prisoner honestly admits what he did was wrong and accepts his fate as just, even while he’s clearly repentant. Moreover, the wife wants nothing to do with him and only visits for the sake of their son.

A critic wrongly argued that a certain character was a hardcore racist and wouldn’t have such a “sudden change of heart.” Well, this critic wasn’t watching closely. At the beginning of the movie this character was well into the process of metamorphosizing from his father’s odious mindset. Yes, he does something hateful with his rifle near the opening, but this was a PERFORMANCE for his dad who was peering through the window with approval. In short, the hateful patriarch still exercised his insufferable iron will over the family even while he was restricted to a wheelchair and stroller. The film’s about freeing oneself of that power and that hate; and much more.

The movie runs 1 hour, 51 minutes and was shot in Laplace, Louisiana, and Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola.

A few years before the fall of the Soviet Union, a boozy English publisher named Barley (Sean Connery) is sent a mysterious manuscript via a beautiful Russian editor named Katya (Michelle Pfeiffer), but it’s intercepted by British intelligence and Barley is coerced into going to Moscow & Leningrad to meet with Katya and the writer of the documents (Klaus Maria Brandauer), which contain technical data that calls into question the quality of the Soviet defense weaponry. Meanwhile both British and American agents (Roy Scheider, James Fox, et al.) surveil Barley’s activities.   

Based on John le Carre's novel, ""The Russia House"" (1990) is a spy drama/romance and NOT an action thriller in the mold of James Bond. Its considerable attributes include spectacular (and rare) on-location work in Russia (shot just a couple years before the fall of the USSR), Jerry Goldsmith's sumptuous jazzy score with Branford Marsalis playing soprano sax and, of course, the notable cast. 

The film is aesthetically pleasing and the love story is effective, especially its culmination, but the spy yarn didn’t interest me. This may because I didn’t utilize the subtitles and therefore missed a lot of the highly accented verbiage, which is a mistake when a movie is dialogue-driven, like this one. The depiction of intelligence work is presumably realistic (as opposed to 007), but static, boring, cynical and with little human decency.

Next time I watch it I’ll be sure to use the subtitles.

The film runs 2 hour, 3 minutes, and was shot in Moscow & Leningrad and points nearby; as well as Lisbon, Portugal (Barley’s flat); Bowen Island, British Columbia (American Intelligence 'safe house'); and London (book fair & jazz concert), as well as nearby Pinewood Studios.

GRADE: C+/B- || Sean Connery at least looks like he's having some fun in this otherwise rather dry adaptation of the John Le Carré tale of Cold War espionage. He's ""Barley"", a publisher who is recruited by MI5 to investigate a secret document sent from the USSR purporting to itemise their nuclear arsenal. Needless to say both the British and their CIA counterparts are wetting themselves at the very thought of this being real, but that needs to be verified - and that's where they recruit ""Barley"". He travels to Moscow to meet the author, codenamed ""Dante"" (Klaus Maria Brandauer) and it's whilst there he becomes increasingly distracted by his ""editor"" (Michelle Pfeiffer) - a woman whom his source claims never to have met! As the plot develops, it becomes clear that strings are being pulled but also that ""Barley"" is beginning to think on his own, and not necessarily with his brain either. Will he stick to the plan or will he throw a spanner in the works of his Western handlers? It's a solid enough story but it's padded out far too thinly. There's no chemistry between the characters from Connery and Pfeiffer (and her ropey accent) and though there are plenty of red herrings to fuel the intrigue, that's all delivered in a remarkably sterile and disjointed fashion. Le Carré's stories always focussed on detail and this film rather skirts over that in favour of developing the burgeoning romance, and that rather neuters the sense of suspense that's also not really helped by the blandness of James Fox and Roy Scheider. It's watchable, but nobody's finest two hours."

<em>'Dragonslayer'</em> is just about good. I like some of the locations used as well as the, admittedly dated, special effects. As for my dislikes, those would be the cast, characters and story. I had a fine time following all three, but I didn't overly care for any of them - I didn't feel attached.

Peter MacNicol, who I always remember from 1997's <em>'Bean'</em>, is alright as Galen, if unspectacular and mostly forgettable. As are the rest of the cast in truth, I can't say their performances will stick in my mind either unfortunately.

I can see how some people would enjoy this. I did, just not majorly. || _**""Jaws"" in Medieval Times, except with a Dragon**_

A medieval kingdom is harassed by a dragon, apparently the last of its species. Those in government decide to appease the horrific beast with regular sacrifices of virgin maidens, which are selected through a questionable lottery system. When the King's daughter is picked for sacrifice, the monarch employs a sorcerer's apprentice (Peter MacNicol) to slay the dragon.

""Dragonslayer"" (1981) takes the ""Jaws"" route by not fully showing the beast until well into the second hour of the film. Prior to that moment the film expertly builds up a heap of horrific anticipation concerning the creature. The first virgin sacrifice scene is particularly terrifying. When we finally DO see the monster it's not a let down. Despite the film's age, this has to be one of better dragons to appear in cinema.

I've heard some complain that MacNicol was wrong for the role of the protagonist. I disagree. He's easy to relate to because he's a flawed human being with naive, boyish qualities, not a larger-than-life superhero, like Conan or Beastmaster. I've also heard some complain that the heroine, Caitlin Clarke, is too ""man-ish"" looking. Well, duh, that fits into the whole sacrificial lottery plot. When Caitlin ultimately (and uncertainly) dons a dress & make-up she's woman enough.

The Dark Age sets/costumes/locations really impressed me. If you're in the mood for a top-of-the-line medieval flick with castles, dungeons, forests, villages, fair maidens, kings, sorcerers and caves, this one fills the bill.

""Dragonslayer"" was an inexplicable flop at the box office when it was released, perhaps due to the glut of sword & sorcery pictures in the early 80s. But that doesn't mean you can't discover it (or rediscover it) and savor it now.

The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in Scotland (Skye) and Wales (Snowdonia & North Wales) with studio stuff done at Pinewood Studios, near London.

A hard as nails cop reluctantly teams up with a wise-cracking criminal temporarily paroled to him, in order to track down an escaped convict cop killer.

The mismatched buddy buddy formula exploded onto the screen here in a ball of violence, profanity and pin sharp one liners. It also launched Eddie Murphy into 1980s stardom. Directed by Walter Hill and starring Nick Nolte alongside Murphy as part of an electrifying black and white double act, it's unrelenting in pace and bad attitude. It could have been so different though, with the likes of Stallone, Reynolds, Pryor and Hines attached at various times for lead parts, it now is written in folklore that Murphy got the break and grasped it with both hands (he was actually fired at one point mind!). Thankfully the problems behind the scenes were resolved to give us a classic of its type.

A big success for Paramount it paved the way for more choice same formula pictures in the decade, but few were able to be so course and daring with the racial divide explosions. Murphy is outstanding, quick as an A.K. 47 in vocal delivery and with visual comedic ticks in full effect, he plays off of the also excellent gruff rough and tough Nolte superbly. Unsurprisingly the plot trajectory is simple enough, but such is the writing and performances (James Remar, Sonny Landham and David Patrick Kelly in support) it's one hell of a live wire ride from start to finish.

In amongst the verbal and action carnage you find plenty of 80s pop culture, with a blunderbuss sound track and a score from James Horner that pings around the Los Angeles locales (he would rework it for Arnie starrer Commando in 1985). This points to a time where now it is perceived as being tactless and a relic, and yet it instils realism as it captures the zeitgeist of the era. So not one for the easily offended then, but for nostalgics and those interested in the expansion of the action comedy formula, then this is a must see that still delivers high octane entertainment. 8/10 || Entertaining buddy action-comedy that features a good antagonistic relationship between Nolte and Murphy. The plot isn't the strongest but the action/fight scenes were alright. **3.25/5** || Back to the old school. Love this movie. This is when cop movies started to have some comedy in it."

RELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Rob Cohen, "" Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" stars Jason Scott Lee as the martial arts superstar, tracing his early life in Hong Kong to his fresh start in the San Francisco area where he starts a martial arts school, meets his babe (Lauren Holly) and moves on to TV and Film. He must boldly face many enemies along the way, including his childhood demon. 

This is basically a rags-to-riches flick and ranks with my favorite films due to its excellent meshing of dynamism, fun and potent drama. I haven’t seen too many martial arts flicks, but “Dragon” is easily the all-around best of those I’ve seen. It mixes real-life with Hollywood mythmaking, which is what many cinematic biographies do, e.g. ""Buffalo Bill"" (1944) and ""Braveheart"" (1995). In these types of movies the gist of the story is true, but it's mixed with numerous fictional or even fantastical elements to make the protagonist a larger-than-life hero, but also to entertain the audience because real-life is always more mundane and therefore dull. And movies are made primarily to make money through entertaining, not to relay the truth in exact detail. 

Right from the get-go the film telegraphs that it's a mythmaking account when Bruce takes on the arrogant British sailors at a dance. He throws one of them and the sailor topples 3-4 other men accompanied by the sound of a bowling ball striking pins (lol). While this particular episode never happened, occasions LIKE IT did, even if it was to someone other than Bruce. The same is true with other sequences, like the fight in the gym, which never happened. But, again, events LIKE IT have.   

The movie is really meant as a celebration of Bruce Lee, his phenomenal expertise in martial arts and the genre he made popular. If you're looking for an actual biography of his life check out the two biographies listed below (under “WRITERS”). 

Speaking of which, “Dragon” was partially based on the autobiography of Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce’s wife). Someone offered that she couldn’t possibly have been happy with the film since so much of it is fiction (for instance, Bruce didn’t injure his back as depicted, but via lifting weights). Actually, she was happy with the final picture. But why did she allow so many things to be embellished? Simple: Because the embellishing fed into the Bruce Lee legend from which she benefits.

In any case, there are a lot of martial arts thrills mixed with the drama with an exciting action scene occurring roughly every ten minutes. The film gives the protagonist & a few others power over time and space. Of course, one cannot do in real life many of the things these characters perform due to the restrictions imposed by Newton's Laws but, hey, it’s entertaining. This factor explains why “Dragon” has been criticized for springing from one thing to the next too quickly, never pausing long enough for any strong emotion to resonate or for us to feel we really know the man beyond his proverbs. I disagree; I sensed strong emotion on several occasions, like when Bruce exclaims to Linda: “You make be believe I can do anything” or when he wildly screams at her to leave his hospital room, not to mention his outstanding meltdown later in Hong Kong (I’ve had a few of those in my life, so I know).

Speaking of Linda, Lauren Holly is just mind-blowing in her physical prime.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours and was shot in California (San Francisco, Los Angeles & Valencia), China (Macau) and Hong Kong. WRITERS: Three screenwriters wrote the script based on the biographies by Linda Lee Cadwell (Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew) and Robert Clouse (Bruce Lee: The Biography).

There are certain films that, despite being forty or fifty years old, seem to maintain all their relevance and pertinence. These films generally surpass the test of time and continue to win new audiences, generation after generation. On the other hand, there are films that are a portrait of the time in which they were made, and belong to that specific time and need to be understood in the light of that particular moment.

The plot unfolds during the Korean War, which occurred shortly after the Second World War and divided two countries that are still at war, although it is a frozen conflict. The action focuses on a mobile medical unit near the front line, where a group of doctors and nurses seek, through humor and sarcasm, to lighten the tense environment and forget the surrounding danger, ignoring and mocking their superiors. As you can see, we cannot understand the film without delving into the mentality of the 70s. At a time when American youth were shouting for peace and against the war in Vietnam, what film would make more sense than a comic parody of the army? Korea had been recent and did not have the almost sacred nature of participation in the Second World War, it was acceptable to play with that and have bearded doctors, 100% hippie style, drunk or semi-drugged, doing antics that, in real circumstances, would lead them to court-martial. If this film had been released just ten years earlier, we would have had something totally different, but this is the decade of Flower Power, of peace and love.

Robert Altman provides reasonably effective direction. The recreation of the time, and the environments of the military field, is done with technical care. There was a lot of authentic war material that could be used in the design of sets and costumes, and it is quite likely that some witness told what those mobile health units were like, and what was done there. However, the script lacks unity and cohesion, and resembles a collage of comic or sarcastic episodes without much relationship between them. It was a bad script, and I can't understand how it won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The type of humor is another additional problem: our sense of humor has changed a lot in just a few decades and our sensitivity does not let jokes in such bad taste escape like those that occasionally happen here, particularly those aimed at female characters.

What saves the film ends up being the enormous capacity for improvisation and creativity that the cast used in the project. With less than competent screenwriters and insufficient material to build characters, the director seems to have had the intelligence to give the actors enough margin to fill in the gaps, molding the characters in their own way. This is what Donald Sutherland did, ensuring a very strong and charismatic lead. It's not even close to the actor's best, but he managed to pull it off with flying colors. Elliott Gould and Tom Skerritt follow him closely, and form a consistent core cast, with characters good enough to sustain the action. Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman and Roger Bowen provide indispensable support.

At the time, the film was a success, as expected, and even led to a TV series. And today? Almost no one remembers anything, and to say that this is a classic seems to be a huge exaggeration. At that time, the film had a guaranteed audience. Today, with world peace declining at the expense of growing conflict between the USA, Iran, China, Russia and other powers, we can no longer call for peace without calling for the rearmament of our countries and their allies. At a time when we already live in a “pre-world war” environment, a film that ridicules the army has no room to flourish."

I was never that smitten with this film many years ago on my first viewing, but now, with the advent of time, I like to think I view films with newer and wiser perspectives. Sadly I can't say that One-Eyed Jacks has left me anything other than frustrated and cold with disappointment.

Marlon Brando took over directing duties from Stanley Kubrick after the two giants fell out about the direction the picture was taking, this let Brando loose to shoot for 6 months on a film meant to be wrapped in two. Now this may be the main problem to me because the film is painfully devoid of major fleshing out of the characters, scenes are not expanded and there are obvious gaps due to mass editing cuts. It reads on the screen that our protagonist gets sentenced to 5 years in jail, two seconds later we see a bearded haggard man escaping prison chained to another inmate, next shot he is clean shaved and it seems we have missed some important chat between the two escapists. On it goes throughout the picture, I'm sure that the final elongated cut (rumoured to be between 4 & 6 hours) would have been a joyous experience, but as it is we get a cut down 141 minutes of film that rather outstays it's welcome. And to get through it you really need to believe in patience being a virtue.

Brando of course holds court and is never less than interesting, and at times he sizzles and dominates the screen in the way that Marlon was want to do. But the whole performance has the reek of over indulgence about it. Making it more about the actor than the actual narrative. Along side him, Karl Malden is solid and gruff as the villain of the piece, but Katy Jurado is badly underused and seems like an afterthought to be an important character. Sadly, too, Pina Pellicer struggles to convince in her only American film, but naturally that is not important in the context that she was to take her own life at the woefully young age of 29 (depending on what site you believe as regards age at death). The bright spot here is the cinematography from Charles Lang Jr at the various sites in California, it is simply gorgeous, check out the coastline shots and take it all in. I personally feel that this film is one that Brando fans choose to ignore the major flaws with. His name some how making the end product seem better than it actually is. In its longest form I'm sure it ""could have been a contender"" in the great Western stakes, as it is it remains average and something of an unfulfilling disappointment. 5/10 || _**One of the GREAT Westerns**_

Dad Longworth (Karl Malden) literally ""takes the money and runs"" as he leaves his young partner in crime, Kid Rio (Marlon Brando), behind to rot in a Mexican prison. Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance in mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Katy Jurado) and step-daughter, Louisa (Pina Pellicer), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the town bank (Ben Johnson and Sam Gilman), as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa. 

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is. 

Not only is ""One-Eyed Jacks"" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films. What makes it so great? Several things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's more of a slow drama Western than an action/adventure. When the action comes, however, it's quick and realistic.

There are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him.

I would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth: Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of capture or death. The safest and most promising route was the selfish one. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.

The problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us or coming back to bite us in the hind end, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is suddenly threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he tries to get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.

Another theme is how love is tied to redemption. Both Dad and Rio are criminals, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill anyone, he doesn't even want to see his nemesis; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story ""One-Eyed Jacks"" wouldn't be half the film it is.

In addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa ""from the beanfields,"" as Dad puts it.

Love goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).

One of the best qualities of ""Jacks"" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects, except for the opening credits & corresponding score. Thankfully, the rest of the film isn't.

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool ""cool"" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood). The main difference between ""Jacks"" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that ""Jacks"" has a worthwhile story, which can't be said for most Italo-Westerns; also the anti-hero in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.

The film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, the crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982) pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admitted to it.

Pina Pellicer does a notable job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa. Spiritually-speaking, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error after getting drunk, on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in someone's metamorphosis.

Unfortunately Pina committed suicide a few years after ""Jacks"" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue.

""Jacks"" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Peninsula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the few Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean (you'll also see it at the beginning of 1954's ""Garden of Evil""). Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.

GRADE: A || This gets off to a strong start with the nonchalant ""Rio"" (Marlon Brando) and his pal ""Dad"" (Karl Malden) relieving a bank of it's golden pesos. Their flight doesn't quite go to plan though, and in need of fresh horses they are forced to separate. It's ""Dad"" who heads off in search of the stock but forgets to come back for his buddy who is apprehended by the pursing police. Five years later and ""Rio"" is intrigued by a proposition by ""Amory"" (Ben Johnson) that could net him quite a bit of cash and give him a chance for revenge on his now sheriff comrade in the town of Monterey, Thus far it's teed up to be a solid revenge western but once he arrives, the thing rather quickly descends into a soppy drama with ""Rio"" becoming sweet on the young ""Louisa"" (Pina Pellicer) who happens to be the step-daughter of ""Dad"" and his new wife ""Maria"" (Katy Jurgado). Might his desire for vengeance now be being tempered by an even greater desire? I found it really only Johnson who delivered well here as his character talks a good game but actually has a yellow streak a mile wide. Slim Pickens also chips in amiably as the lecherous bully of a deputy ""Dedrick"" but I didn't really find either Brando or Malden to be especially menacing here, nor really is there much going on as it enters it's lengthy brooding phase. The last few minutes provide us with a conclusion, of sorts, but that's all a bit rushed and really quite weak - as if nobody could quite have the courage to end the story decisively one way or the other. It's looks good with some fine photography setting the scene, but it's one of those westerns set at the end of that way of life and it just seems to meander along disappointingly."

Every once in a while, when Hollywood is stuck for new swashbuckling ideas, they turn to the writer of ""The Three Musketeers"", ""The Man In The Iron Mask"" and ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"", one Alexandre Dumas père. Which of course is no bad thing as long as the adaptation is given care and consideration - which hasn't always been the case. So when it was announced that the director of Waterworld, Kevin Reynolds, was to direct the latest version of ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"", many feared the worst. Made for around $35 million, Reynolds' film fared OK at the Worldwide box office, taking in around $76 million. Yet although far from being a flop, it upped and vanished rather quickly and was barely given a mention come the arrival of 2003. Thankfully the film gathered momentum with the rental releases and is now firmly established as a much loved genre piece.

On the two big hitting movie internet sites, Rotten Tomatoes & IMDb, the film scores 75% and 7.5 respectively, that's about right I would say. Reynolds' film doesn't bring anything new to the table as regards the story, but if it isn't broke then why fix it? Staying safe and true to the spirit of the source, Reynolds has simply crafted a rip roaring movie about betrayal, torture, faith, revenge and love. The makers have costumed it up and added the necessary sword play ingredient. All that was needed was for his cast to deliver performances worthy of such period shenanigans. And he got them.

James Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes. Two years away from playing Jesus Christ, the role that would make his name known, Caviezel had prior to Cristo looked anything but a leading man. But here he finds a role to get his teeth into and it's a comfortable fit, and crucially he seems to be having a good time with it. No such point to prove for Guy Pearce (Fernand Mondego) though, for he already had ""L.A. Confidential"" & ""Memento"" under his belt. Here he gives it the full pompous villain act and struts around like some dandy spoiled brat. It's a film stealing performance that shows that the guy who played Mike Young in Aussie soaper Neighbours, has indeed come a long way. Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Abbé Faria, gravel voiced Michael Wincott does a nice line in sadistic bastard as the Château D'If governor, Armand Dorleac. While Luis Guzmán as Jacopo is fun comic relief and Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedès Iguanada is both sensual and heartfelt.

Never over camping the movie, Reynolds keeps it pacey and dots it with smart set pieces and memorable scenes. Backed up by an on form cast and a sure fire source story to work from, ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" turns out to be period winner. So see it if you haven't done so already. 8/10 || Jim Caviezel is adequate, no better, as the wronged ""Edmond"" who gets caught up in a Napoleonic conspiracy that sees him confined on a remote island prison from which no-one escapes alive. His situation seems hopeless, until he receives an unlikely visitor - the elderly Abbe Faria (Richard Harris), who has been trying to tunnel his way out but took a bit of a wrong turning! The two become firm friends, and his parting gifts to the younger man are the secrets of an immense treasure - and his bodybag - that might enable him to seek revenge on ""Fernand"" (Guy Pearce); ""Villefort"" (James Frain) and ""Maurice"" (Christophe Adams) whose machinations stole a great chunk of his life, and cost him the love of ""Mercedes"" (Dagmara Dominczyk). His vengeance is cleverly structured, he determines to allow each of these people to turn on each other - using their own greed and mistrust to destroy the other. Alexandre Dumas wrote a great story, with loads of intrigue - yet somehow this iteration doesn't really get going. Too much of the build up is abridged (or just not there at all) and that makes the rest of the story weaker and less engaging. The production is adequate, the costumes and look of the film are good, but the pace and performances are both about box office than about characterisations. I felt indifferent about all of them - even the naive young ""Albert"" (Henry Cavill) whose character is actually quite pivotal in the book, helping remind ""Edmond"" of the humanity he once had before incarceration. There are way better versions of this story - notably the Robert Donat one from 1934, and I'd recommend that instead, any day. || Well, it's not one quality... but I like to do a thumbs up or thumbs down approach. If the movie entertains a thumbs up, if it doesn't a thumbs down. Seems simpler than debating on a 4, a 5, a 6, whatever.

This is also kind of why I want to be able to review individual actors, just so I can write a memo to Guy Peirce and tell him that he needs to stop doing period literary pieces and go back to making films that don't require ascots and puffs.

And this brings me to the point in the review where I question why I know what the difference between an ascot and a puff are.

Anyway, self-reflection aside, the problem is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a thrilling adventure novel that is best epitomized by the writings of Dumas in all his pulp adventure glory... or if the story lasted in popularity for a century or so too long and now has to be regarded as a drama and treated with all the seriousness of a mature literary classic.

It teases with both and never settles on either. It kind of comes across that Wolpert, the writer, understood that Dumas was a pulp adventure writer but Reynolds, the director, thought Dumas was as serious as Dante.

It makes you feel like you are sitting in two different worlds. It kind of feels like you are watching a movie that wants to be a fun adventure yarn about revenge and prison breaks but every time that beast tries to escaped, it's forced back into it's cage by directorial gods of pretentious pompery.

This is the type of movie that you'd get if the director of ""Taming of the Shrew"" thought everything Shakespeare wrote was ""Richard III""... it's unsettling how deadly serious it takes itself."
2637.0,The Mothman Prophecies,Reporter John Klein is plunged into a world of impossible terror and unthinkable chaos when fate draws him to a sleepy West Virginia town whose residents are being visited by a great winged shape that sows hideous nightmares and fevered visions.,The future is not unknown.,"Drama, Horror, Mystery",119.0,2002-01-25,en,6.203,1160.0,1.9864,"Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, Debra Messing, David Eigenberg",Mark Pellington,"small town, dreams, based on novel or book, paranoia, motel, hallucination, bridge, omen, tumor, west virginia, grief, premonition, urban legend, warning, disaster, hospital, reporter, psychic, car wreck, police sergeant, phone call, christmas, death of wife, mothman, mysterious events, chemical plant","***Haunting Mystery with Supernatural Elements – Reverent, Beautiful, Brilliant***

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Mark Pellington, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" details some of the strange events that occurred in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, from November 15, 1966, to December 15, 1967 (13 months). The movie, however, transplants the events to the year 2001.

PLOT: Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife, Mary (Debra Messing). He mysteriously shows up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where he develops a relationship with the sympathetic police sergeant, Connie (Laura Linney). Many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie mothman-like entity, similar to the one Mary saw before she died. A researcher (Alan Bates) believes that the ‘mothmen’ exist on a sphere beyond human comprehension and that they can foresee impending calamities. Is the ‘mothman’ sighted in Point Pleasant warning the citizens of one? If so, what is it?

This is not a monster movie or a slasher horror flick; if you want that see “Mothman” (2010), which is actually pretty good for a TV creature feature (and interestingly links the mothman to the unjust slaying of Cornstalk, aka Hokoleskwa, in 1777). “The Mothman Prophecies,” by contrast, is a supernatural/mystery story with cogent creepy mood. Every element skillfully works: acting, story, editing, score, cinematography, locations, effects, etc. Underneath the film’s eeriness there’s an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality while the ending is strangely touching.

One critic claimed that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. But this is untrue. The film is intricate and respects the intelligence of the viewer. Questions are raised with varying possibilities. The answers are there, but you may have to watch it a few times to discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have ""ears to hear"" and be willing to work for them.

My initial interpretation was that the ‘mothmen’ are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humanity by predicting great calamities but can be misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell, my interpretation was that the mothman somehow brought Klein to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the mothmen are good in nature.

I've come to see that this interpretation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a rare film that’s genuinely intriguing and filled with gems to mine, even if you’ve already seen it several times. It’s so artistic that it’s a pleasure to behold over and over.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 59 minutes and was shot in Kittanning, Pennsylvania (substituting for Point Pleasant), Pittsburgh (the factory and city scenes, etc.) and other Western PA towns. WRITERS: Richard Hatem wrote the screenplay from John Keel’s book.

GRADE: A

INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MOTHMEN *** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don’t read until you view the movie).

The ‘mothmen’ are evil spirits or fallen angels (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures, which never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather dark disturbing, obviously-malevolent winged-creatures. It’s the same thing with the actual appearances of the creature (freeze frame the images).

A mothman CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)?

The bible calls Satan the ""prince of the power of the air;"" hence, his filthy underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus speak through a phone that's not plugged in or perhaps manipulate a traffic light. They can mimic the voices of dead loved ones or even take human form, like Indrid Cold, Mary or the male nurse who insists that Mary's drawings are of ""angels"" and then mysteriously vanishes.

The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from “hell” (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin people’s lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human suffering (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity & ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family, career & respectable social life). Also, they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders.

The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for millennia and therefore see things 2-3 moves ahead of humans; they use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy. Since their M.O. is to “kill, steal and destroy,” they feed on death, destruction and torment and therefore venture to the places where great tragedies will transpire, like the Silver Bridge collapse.

The saved police woman at the end was number ""37,” historically a numerical symbol of The Christ, which shows that her submersion in the river and figurative resurrection is a type of the Anointed One. Yet she is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are destructive and manipulative could now flip-flop into the deception that they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Klein and Connie in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.

The film powerfully illustrates that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are malevolent beings who purpose to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal or lead to great suffering. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with the Creator through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement and utilizing the armor of light."

Personally, this movie ranks among my top 25 films of all time. While there may be some plot holes and issues that some viewers may not appreciate, the music is outstanding and the storyline itself is intriguing.

The cast, including both lead actors and supporting roles, deliver exceptional performances that help drive the narrative forward. Despite any flaws, I believe this movie is unfairly dismissed and deserves more recognition for its quality."

First off, I did enjoy <em>'The Adventures of Huck Finn'</em>. The main reason for that is Elijah Wood, who is honestly tremendous in the role of Huckleberry Finn. I've only, as of recently, seen Wood in his adult years, this is the best performance I've seen from him; I'm yet to watch <em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em>, admittedly.

Away from Wood, there are a few other strong cast members. Courtney B. Vance is impressive as Jim, while Jason Robards (The King) and Robbie Coltrane (The Duke) are a good double act. I very much like the cast.

Onto the story. It's kinda bonkers. It goes from being sombre, to being funny, to being serious, back to sombre, back to funny etc. It's very up and down in that sense, the first and third acts are rather heavy but the middle act is as silly as it could possibly be really. It has a very mixed feel about it, amidst the overall arc of slavery.

There is definitely a positive message in there, particularly with Finn and Jim. It's just muddled in with comedy, somewhat oddly. All that matters, though, is did I feel entertained by it? Yes, quite easily so. A film to watch, certainly.

Worth noting I am the opposite of book smart (aim to change that at some point!), despite knowing the name of the title character I've never read the book by Mark Twain. Therefore I couldn't tell you if it does Twain's work justice, or how it relates to it."

I don't think this is a movie anyone is going to watch again and again, but I believe it's memorable enough to be somewhat infamous.

This is the movie with the hairdoll.

My big problem with this movie is that the protagonists are scumbag liars and cheaters, and while the antagonist is somewhat crazy, he's the villain because he catches them in the act of misdeeds.  That he uses the information to his advantage is actually somewhat symbolic of heroic stories, but he's such a nutcase that it is twisted.

I'd love to see a reboot of this with Schwartzmen's character as the protagonist, but with some proper character development would be a great movie, this is, at best, a good movie."

Hmm. As with all action films, especially those that feature one of the action heroes we grew up with, there will be supporters of even the most turgid of productions. Collateral Damage was the point where the truest and honest of Arnold Schwarzenegger's fans knew it was the end of an era. 

Famously held back from release for a year due to the 9/11 attacks on the twin towers, the film pitches Schwarzenegger as a L.A. fireman, who after his wife and child are killed by an act of terrorism, decides to take the law into his own hands. The focus here is Colombia, and the big guy goes off to Colombia on a one man crusade to kill those responsible for his grief. Cue explosions, kinetic action, bad effects, bad dialogue, mucho posturing and hissing villains.

It works on a very basic level for fans of such fare, in fact it's nice to see Arnie playing a vulnerable role where he quite often gets hurt - both physically and mentally. It's just that it feels tired, feels too long, while it wastes a cast that includes Elias Koteas, John Turturo and John Leguizamo. Decent enough as a time waster? Yes, just, but really if this wasn't on Schwarzenegger's CV then nobody would lose any sleep over it. 5/10 || ***Lacks heart, but there are highlights and the compelling last act features a nice plot turn***

A vengeful Los Angeles fireman (Arnold Schwarzenegger) goes to the jungles of Colombia to apprehend a terrorist (Cliff Curtis) where he meets the man’s dissenting wife (Francesca Neri) & their son. An angry CIA agent (Elias Koteas) also travels to Colombia to join with paramilitary allies to take down the same man. When the two teams learn of a planned terrorist attack at Union Station, Washington DC, they return to the USA.  

""Collateral Damage"" (2002) is an action/adventure originally set to be released a few weeks after 9/11, but due to that tragedy it was set back four months wherein an anti-CIA subplot was removed, as well as a plane hijacking. What we are left with is a by-the-numbers film with a couple of highlights that perks up in the final act with an unexpected twist.

There’s a spectacular waterfall sequence shot in southeastern Mexico, which takes place near the beginning of the second act. Another highlight occurs at the end of the second act where the movie drives home the problem with military attacks and the eventual revenge of the enemies: One nation’s military attacks a paramilitary organization wherein innocent civilians are killed, which is considered “collateral damage,” and so the paramilitarists attack the nation in question with more “collateral damage.” Who’s right and who’s wrong? And where does it end?   
  
The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in  Los Angeles & Burbank, California; Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico (standing in for Colombia); Union Station, Washington DC; and New York City .

GRADE: C+/B- || Okay action-thriller that has some decent action and overall was entertaining. However, this is one where I think Schwarzenegger was the wrong choice to lead as someone like Bruce Willis (circa 2002 mind you) would've worked better. Still, has its moments. **3.25/5**"

Perhaps the finest 'reveal' of all time, in fact.

In short, a 'must-see' film, and if you enjoy beautifully-shot psychological horror, it's definitely worth a purchase in the finest quality print available, and re-watches...hopefully once every Halloween season, in fact. || I honestly had a great enthusiasm towards this film before I watched it and I really longed for a film that would mainly offer a sinister atmosphere for the most part. I had read so many great things about ""Don't Look Now"" and the plot, the locations and the characters looked compelling enough to me to give this movie a chance and be prepared to enjoy an over and done masterpiece. Frankly, I am aware that most people who like this film, are probably going to think I'm terribly brainless because I was somehow disappointed by it, but I would much rather speaking my mind and giving my honest opinion.

The main reason why this film turned into a disappointment to me, was mostly the fact that there were quite a lot of scenes that worked as a sleeping pill to me. I think I have seen a decent share of horror films that offer big moments of silence and so-called clever symbolism and subtle details that somehow help to build a solid story. However, in ""Don't Look Now"", I felt a bit overwhelmed by the excessive amount of pointless sequences (and I'm pretty sure they ARE pointless) and images that in the end are reduced to nothing whatsoever. I felt like most of these puzzling and unsolved details, were Nicolas Roeg's way to mystify the audience with discourteous methods and filling blanks to make the movie longer and by some means more ""interesting"" to look at. Nevertheless, opposite to what those chaotic sequences were meant to incite, I felt somehow underestimated and ripped off. This film could have offered the same story and lots of bright symbolism, without the requirement of bombing the audience with tedious states of affair. I'm very supportive of ambiguity in horror films, when help to create a sinister atmosphere, at least. As an example, I'd probably mention Lucio Fulci, whose films are mostly criticized by the great quantity of nonsensical scenes. However, in Mr. Fulci's case, I think the puzzling aspect of his films, at least contribute in a great deal, to develop a terrifying atmosphere. So to make it short and clear, what I condemn the most about ""Don't Look Now"", is its offensive and underestimating ambiguity that leads to nothing at all and simply leaves the audience doubting about their own intelligence.

Too bad this film cheats the audience with so many pointless oscillations, because the story itself is not bad at all and the characters look darkly beautiful enough to make a frightening horror film, like the two old sisters, for example. The locations were probably one of the most appealing elements in ""Don't Look Now"" and probably one of the main reasons why I agreed to watch the movie until it was finished instead of just leaving it incomplete. I am not one of those horror fans who expect a big ""EUREKA!"" moment during the last minutes of a film, I can guarantee that. However, I do not appreciate feeling mocked after a movie is finished. I'm sure this comment will be voted as NOT useful several times by people who support this film and think I'm just an airhead who didn't get it, but that's all right… I can live with that ;)

(My five stars, mostly are due to the locations and a couple of eerie moments that made the whole thing endurable somehow). || ""John"" (Donald Sutherland) and wife ""Laura"" (Julie Christie) are living in Venice where they encounter two elderly sisters - ""Heather"" (Hilary Manson) and ""Wendy"" (Clelia Matania). The former of those enigmatic ladies claims to be able to see an apparition of their recently deceased daughter. ""Laura"" is engaged, ""John"" less so - but as the story develops we begin to appreciate that the drowned girl has left demons for both parents to deal with - some more substantial than others! Sutherland is on good form here. His character has some depth to it as we realise that he has yet to fully come to terms with his loss and his grief. Christie also delivers well as she takes a different route to dealing with her stresses and the story balances their needs of each other and for closure. As the mystery deepens, the apparitions become more real and - well what is real and what is not? Nicholas Roeg has also worked hard to create an engaging sense of menace. A lack of special and visual effects but the use of the converted chapel in which ""John"" works, works well as does a powerful score from accomplished horror genre composer Pino Donaggio all creating an enveloping sense of... yikes! Then there's the love scene - pretty risqué for the time and photographed in a much more graphic (though still stylised) fashion that does illustrate well the fact that couple are lovers still, despite their trauma. The pace can be a bit sluggish at times, but this is still a curiously stimulating film that doesn't really conform to any template that I've seen. It is a thriller as much as a horror and the characterisations are much more substantial - plenty for them and us to get our teeth into. Venice looks great too!"

What I actually find most baffling is that this film is supposed to be a ""romantic comedy"" film yet there was nothing in this film that was remotely funny. And Britney Spears thought she could have a good crack at movie acting, huh, I don't think so.

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Gregory Hoblit, ""Hart's War"" is a war flick about a paper-pushing lieutenant with a background in law (Colin Farrell) who is unexpectedly captured in Belgium and taken to a POW camp in southern Germany in the closing months of the European theater of the war. He eventually befriends and defends a Tuskegee Airmen (Terrence Howard). Marcel Iures plays the humane German commandant while Bruce Willis plays the tough-as-nails American colonel of the POWs. Cole Hauser is on hand as a racist soldier. 

This is obviously not a conventional WWII flick. Although it starts out with some great war action, it has more in common with films like ""Stalag 17"" (1953) and ""The Great Escape"" (1963), albeit with modern filmmaking craft. As my title blurb points out, it's reminiscent of Hogan's Heroes but without the comedy, plus elements of “A Few Good Men” (1992). The film isn't really about survival in the POW camp, but rather the tensions of the prisoners and the criminal drama.

Some have complained that no fascist camp colonel in his right mind would allow such a trial as depicted in the movie. But there are several reasons why the commandant would allow it: (1.) for entertainment, (2.) to witness and understand the American way, (3.) he knew the war would be over soon and wanted to have the Allie's favor, or (4.) a mixture of the above. Keep in mind that the commandant went to school in the US after the first world war so he was enamored by American lifestyle and had a fondness for jazz. I'm sure entertainment was a huge factor since POW camp life is just as boring for the captors as it is for the captives over time.

The climax telegraphs that this is a war MOVIE and not real life, but it's packed with action and gripping drama. It’s also ultimately quite moving. Although it failed at the box office, ""Hart's War"" is a very good WWII POW camp movie and, in some ways, great.

THE FILM RUNS 125 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic.

This is in that run of unnecessary sequels Disney did to make some cheap bucks; it's (clearly) also right after they started in with digital animation.

While they managed to capture Peter and the lost boys fairly well, Hook and Shmee are more like loose cartoony references to their former selves.  Jane and Wendy seem to have the most detail put into their animation.  The (classic) crocodile was replaced with an octopus (but still includes a suction cup version of tik-toking) by a visual director that barely understood what an octopus was.

Now, being that I'm generally opposed to the octopus in general, I happen to know a few things about octopus so giving it snail-like eyes, a beak AND teeth, as well as an over-sized tongue broke me a little.  The behaviors were typically way off, to include swimming with it's arms above water (they typically help with the locomotion) and some weird physics when climbing the boat.

Also, we've pretty much pinpointed the inspiration for Neverland Island, which does actually include salt water crocodiles, but as it is in the Caribbean, this Giant Pacific Octopus  is completely out of place.

The animation style was also shifting from scene to scene, object to object.  Sometimes it is very jarring, a digital cell character atop a cg rendered log, or other times it's a cg rendered background against the digital cell animation of the ship (or vice versa) that really took me out of it as it just looked so unnatural.  I'll site ""Titan A.E."" (Fox) and ""Treasure Planet"" (Disney) as too different examples where it was blended much more smoothly.

I actually like the premise better: Hook kidnap's Wendy's daughter, but the movie does so many weird things.  Even though the original movie was officially set in the 1950s, Wendy grows at least 4-6 years to 18 to have a 12 year old daughter and a (generously) 3 year old boy, but the entire world travels backwards to WW2.  Even if we retro the original setting, make Wendy....30?, that means the original occurred in 1929 at the latest, as this sequel could occur during 1945 at the latest, and I just did more math than I'm comfortable with to enjoy a movie.

And this bad movie has the audacity to drop like real dilemmas in the middle: obligation to family vs trustworthiness, acceptance of others, and this crazy mechanical suggestion about how The Fey of the island work.  Does belief of faeries / pixies matter, is it disbelief that actually harms them?

Look, this isn't the worst thing to watch, but I honestly kind of regret my time spent on it."

Three characters appear before a fourth to tell a story about a fifth; the three stories are different but interrelated, and the moral of each is the same: studio chief Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) is a major a--hole and to know him is to hate him.

Each tale is bookended by film producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) sarcastically condoling with the teller, pitying them for their blindness to the fact that Shields was a blessing in disguise. Without him, movie star Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner) was ""a drunk and a tramp playing bit parts, and he made a star of you ... For the last seven years, you've been in the top 10 in every popularity poll. Yes, Jonathan sure fouled you up.""

Screenwriter-turned-novelist James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) is told ""Jonathan sure destroyed you. You came out of it with nothing. Nothing but a Pulitzer Prize novel and the highest salary of any writer in Hollywood.""

As for director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), ""[Shields] brushed you off his coattail, so you had to stand alone. And all you've got in the world is a wife, six kids, two Academy Awards and every stu-dio in town after you. Why, Jonathan ruined you!"".

In all three cases, however, especially the third, it would seem as if the complainer got to where they are now despite, rather than because of, Shields.

Georgia and Bartlow he does help reach the summits of their respective trades — though it is worth noting that both were satisfied with their lots in life and had no interest in climbing to such heights in the first place —, which of course didn’t give him the right to crap all over their personal lives. And Amiel he screwed over on a profes-sional basis; used him and then kicked him to the curb.

As it turns out, Pebbel’s intended irony is only half-true; Shields did foul Georgia up, destroyed Bartlow, and ruined Amiel one way or another. That they pulled themselves up by their boots traps and continued to be successful is more a testament to their determination than to Shields’s alleged Midas touch.

To be sure, the film skimps a litte too much on Shields’s hubris. Yes, he naively assumes he can direct a movie himself and ends up bankrupting Shields Productions, but it is implied that he only failed because, for once, he wasn’t a bastard-coated bastard with bastard filling (""Jonathan the director was a new Jonathan. He was patience personified. He was tolerant, even-tempered, considerate and
indulgent to his crew, his cast and his writer"").

Moreover, Shields saves himself from well-deserved public scorn by shelving the movie instead of releasing it. Finally, even though it’s made clear that Shields needs Georgia, Bartlow, and Amiel more than they need him — as well as suggested that they might agree to work with him again, in spite of having every reason not to —, there’s no indication that Shields has changed for good.

Right before biting off more than he can chew, Shields is given great advice: ""To direct a picture, a man needs humility. Do you have humility, Mr. Shields?"". Having his crony Pebbel rub it in people’s faces all Shields supposedly did for them while downplaying how he hurt them doesn’t go a long way to answer that question in the affirmative.

All things considered, The Bad and the Beautiful is not unlike the film Shields drove to the ground;""beautifully"" written, produced, photographed, etc., etc., but unsure of what it is that it wants to say about its subject matter.

P.S. A decade later Godard made Le Mépris, wherein he practiced what he preached (in order to cri-ticize a movie, you have to make another movie); Jack Palance’s producer’s contentious relations-hips with his scriptwriter and director (legendary Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang as himself; The Bad and the Beautiful includes a character possibly modeled after Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, no less legendary or Austrian-American than Lang) parallels those of Shields’s; furthermore, Palance — dressed to the nines and hair carefully slicked back — looks to have styled himself after Douglas.

The difference is that Le Mépris made no pretense that its antagonistic film producer was ever any-thing other than a Jerk with a Heart of Jerk , as opposed to The Bad and the Beautiful’s Wolf in Sheep's Clothing. || It all starts with poor old Walter Pidgeon (""Harry"") assembling ""Georgia"" (Lana Turner), ""Fred"" (Barry Sullivan) and ""Bartlow"" (Dick Powell) in his office so he can persuade then to write, direct and star in one last picture for their nemesis ""Jonathan Shields"" (Kirk Douglas). They loathe him - with a passion, and ""Harry"" knows he has his work cut out if he is convince them. His preferred method is to remind each of them, whilst introducing us to their characters and stories, of how they alighted on the visionary, enigmatic and profoundly selfish ""Shields"", and of how his selfishness and determination helped each of them to achieve success. Vincente Minnelli has assembled a strong cast to deliver really well on Charles Schnee's screenplay. The flashbacks deliver just about everything from betrayal, duplicity, passion - pretty much the whole gamut of human emotions and frailties as we gradually build a picture of a man about whom nothing is simple - and about whom it is possible to admire and detest in equal measure. By reminding them of just how they got to where they are now, ""Harry"" - who was put through the wringer a bit too by his boss - hopes to convince them to step up for one last hurrah! Can he? Should he? Should they? There is a really strong supporting cast here - including an effective Gilbert Roland (""Gaucho"") and the briefest of appearances from Gloria Grahame as (""Rosemary""). Douglas is on super form - he conveys the ambitiousness and odiousness of the producer character effortlessly and at the same time gives us quite a vision of just how transitory and cut-throat Hollywood was. Turner, likewise, is on super form as the gal who will do what ever it takes to succeed - within reason - then when she starts to wear the real fur coats, then... What helps this stand out is the writing - it has a plausibility to it. You can readily imagine these scenarios being true (albeit gilded, somewhat) and it makes for two hours of cinema that simply flies by. Big screen if you can - it's well worth it."

Mean Machine is an English reworking of Robert Aldrich's 1974 beefcake Burt Reynolds starrer, The Longest Yard. Substituting Gridiron for Soccer, director Barry Skolnick, along with his roll call of British ""faces"", is only aiming for one market.

That of the footie worshipping clan that primarily resides within the United Kingdom.

Very much a long way from competing on the same playing field as Aldrich's superior movie, Mean Machine does have enough about it to make it an enjoyable viewing outside of the excellently constructed soccer match that fills out the last third of the piece. But with the film's reputation being far from good, the chance that many others feel the same as me are pretty remote. About as remote as Accrington Stanley winning the English Premiere League one feels.

The problem would seem to lay with the first hour, violence and humour thrust together does not always yield great rewards, and so it be with the wet behind the ears direction from Skolnick. Caught between a tough portrayal of British prison life and outright slapstick, it's an odd bedfellow that Skolnick can't quite get right. And with Guy Ritchie on the sidelines donning the ""supervising producer"" shirt, one can't help thinking that Ritchie would have made substantially more with the material to hand. But as ""I"" say, there's enough there for the discerning fan of blood and banter.

Led by the watchable Jones, the cast, outside of the miscast David Hemmings as the Governor, pull out the stops to entertain the terrace faithful. Danny Dyer haters will enjoy him getting knocked about as he plays simpleton Billy Limpet, while Jason Statham is a joy as Monk, a Jock that even the Jocks are afraid of. While also putting in scene stealing shifts of note are Jamie Sives, Vas Blackwood and Omid Djalili. It's no piece of work to rank in the higher echelons of British movies - or sports movies in general for that matter. But in spite of its soggy formula and over reliance on the template film it's working from, it's very funny at times, and if you like soccer? Well the actual match is well worth the wait. 7/10

Footnote: The Longest Yard/Mean Machine was met with another re- imaging in 2005 with Adam Sandler as the disgraced lead protagonist. Proof positive that it's either a formula that many can't resist? Or that it's one that some feel still hasn't yet met its potential?"

A couple from New York City take a weekend trip to the Catskills in the middle of winter where a local hunter takes a disliking to the husband (Jake Weber). Meanwhile the couple's son becomes increasingly concerned about their environment and a Native American legend -- the Wendigo, an angry spirit that can manifest as man, beast, tree or wind.

""Wendigo"" (2001) is not a conventional creature feature so if you're looking for a typical monster flick look elsewhere. The movie has a slow build-up filled with mundane drama, which some have criticized. Yet this is reminiscent of films like ""The Birds,"" where the main characters and a sense of realism are well established before things get going.

""Wendigo"" is a mood piece more than anything else. The mysteriousness of the lonely Catskill woods is evoked along with a sense of wonder and fear of the unknown. It's a vibe more akin to ""The Mothman Prophecies"" than ""Ogre.""

Like ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" ""Wendigo"" is somehow a pleasure just to watch (as long as you're not psyched-up for a monster-slasher flick). There's a quiet style and expertise to the filmmaking that smacks of professionalism.

Patricia Clarkson is effective as the wife/mother and little Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the son, Miles.

Interestingly, none of the special effects were done with CGI, but rather cinematic techniques, costumes, make-up and creative editing. It works for me.

The film leaves the viewer somewhat scratching his/her head with its ambiguity. What conjured up the Wendigo? What's its purpose? How exactly does it ""devour"" people with its unquenchable hunger? Etc. Obviously, if you like everything spelled out for you and don't like banging your head, this is not the film for you.

The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes, and was shot in the Catskills, NY.

GRADE: B+/A-

POSSIBLE EXPLANATION (***SPOILER*** Don't read further if you haven't seen the film)

Children are more sensitive to the spiritual realm because they haven't yet built up years of intellectual blockades along with social conditioning. It's clear that Miles senses malevolent creatures or spirits around him, which is why he and his mother check the closet and underneath the bed before he goes to sleep.

The Wendigo is a spirit and can only manifest in the physical realm through an agent who releases the spirit through BELIEF. The Wendigo souvenir plays a role in the Wendigo's manifestation because it was created by someone who BELIEVED in the Wendigo; it's in essence an article of worship and, in a sense, an idol. Hence, the Wendigo is attracted to the figure, which can inspire BELIEF in certain individuals, like Miles.

The ghostly American Indian in the souvenir shop is obviously the Wendigo in human form. He's attracted to Miles because he senses belief and therefore guides the boy to the Wendigo figure and explains the ""legend."" He says, ""No one believes in spirits anymore,"" but after sharing the story of the Wendigo he asks the boy if he believes, to which Miles responds, ""I guess so."" This wasn't much, but it was all the Wendigo needed. The boy gets his mother to purchase the statue and thus the Wendigo is released into the physical realm to devour human prey.

The Wendigo is an evil spirit and therefore a liar. In Indian form he claims that such spirits are not ""bad"" just ""angry."" In other words, he makes excuses for his malevolent actions. Our prisons are full of people who do the same thing.

Once released, the Wendigo immediately inspires Otis to shoot the husband and, later, kill the cop. The Wendigo then goes after the very person he used, Otis, which shows that evil spirits will readily use you if you're willing and then lose you. Why didn't the Wendigo provoke someone else? Because evil spirits can only utilize those who are ALREADY given over to the dark side of their natures. The film shows that Otis was already an arrogant SOB and potential psycho. He doesn't go ""over the edge"" until AFTER the Wendigo is released.

If you're wondering why the Wendigo required belief to manifest in the physical realm, just think about it: It's the same way with God. The bible says that ""without faith it is impossible to please God."" Faith is the key that activates God on our behalf, answers prayer, heals and ""moves mountains."" Why would we think it's any different with spirit beings who aren't benign? The difference is that when they are released through belief they cause havoc and destruction rather than blessing. || Be advised: This Is Not A Horror Film
I have no idea why they decided to market it that way, or even to name it ""Wendigo"" when the legend really isn't what the film is about, but merely a story the boy hears and takes to heart.

I did like this movie, surprisingly, being that nothing really happens until the last 10 or 15 mins. But it's got some fine performances all around. The story has some holes in it, but I guess they all do at some level. It's just a good drama about a family that goes upstate (NY) for a snowy weekend getaway and runs into some gun-happy yahoos in a decidedly unpleasant circumstance. 

It flows from there, the formula being 'city folk agitate locals', which never ends well, this being no exception. Just go into it knowing it's a simple drama and you won't be disappointed."

Great cast, that will repeat in several of Bergman's movies and remarkable performances from Ingrid Thulin and Victor Sjöström. || There's a great scene near the start of this film that sees an horse-drawn hearse get it's wheel caught between the kerb and a lamp-post. The horses persist in moving forward, the wheel comes off and we have a coffin exposed in the middle of a deserted street. A passer-by approaches the coffin only to find it's occupant still alive - and, worse still, it's him! It's ""Dr. Borg"" (Victor Sjöström). Is it portentous? Well it made me smile anyway, as does quite a lot of this thought-provoking drama. It centres around this learned man who is to travel to Lund next day to receive a great honour for his services to the medical profession. In the middle of the night, he disturbs his no-nonsense housekeeper ""Agda"" (a charming effort from Julian Kindahl) announcing plans to drive from Stockholm rather than fly. She's irked and is having none of this nonsense, but she makes his breakfast and packs his case. It's at breakfast that his pregnant daughter-in-law ""Marianne"" (Ingrid Thulin) decides to invite herself along. En route, it becomes clear that she despises the old man, and her bluntness rather shocks him. He readily admits he's a pedantic old grouch, but somehow this cuts him to the quick. After a stop for some petrol at the garage of ""Henrik"" (Max Von Sydow), they pick up some hitch-hikers. Firstly, a group of young and enthusiastic people and then a squabbling couple who seem to thrive on being unpleasant to each other. As we travel, the journey and their companions start him reminiscing about his own life, about the mother of his son and about the joys and tragedies of his own life. It's only when he arrives for his ceremony that he begins to reassess his life, his perspectives and his priorities. Sjöström is super here. He really carries off the role in almost ""Scrooge""-like fashion. He has taken the emotionally easy way out for much of his life and now finds himself in an unfulfilling cul-de-sac from which it not might be possible to escape. Thulin also delivers well as the deliberately provocative and seemingly unkind woman who spares him none of the knife. There is plenty of humour - dark and mischievous, and we take quite an interesting look at just how toxic introspection can be - at any age. As ever with this director, questions of religiosity and God are never far away, but here they are delivered in a manner than the characters address rather than having us to do that work - and that makes this a far more relaxed, if that word can be used about Ingmar Bergman - and gentle rummage through his theological baggage. The plot is busy and entertaining, and there are plenty of other characters enmeshed in the narrative that give us an opportunity to come up for a breather now and again, and I think this might be one of my favourites from this man."

Their mission is to combat an enemy with overwhelming superiority of numbers and try to capture and hold a mountain. Needless to say, their hosts are none too keen on that a plan and what ensues is a brutally depicted, bloody and gory, series of well photographed combat scenes that test the mettle of both sides as the body count mounts. There is a poignant angle added too, as back home we see the colonel's wife ""Julie"" (Madeleine Stowe) take responsibility for delivery of the letters that are sent to the families on the base intimating bad - even tragic - news to those left behind. Sam Elliott adds well some stoic discipline as ""Sgt. Maj. Plumley"" and Chris Klein's portrayal of the recent father ""Lt. Geoghegan"" also contributes a strong human angle to this story. Sadly, though, this is all way too long and though certainly potent at the start, that is washed away in a sea of repetition. What makes us sit up and take notice at the start becomes much less effective; the pyrotechnics lose their impressiveness a bit and to be honest, Gibson just hasn't the on-screen presence to carry this for 2¼ hours. It does emphasise just how modern - airborne, usually - warfare can provide smaller groups with greater superiority and as an example of the ghastliness and futility of war it is a worth watching."

Being of a “certain” age and being British, I was firmly around at the time of the ridiculous “video nasty” mania that swept the UK in the early 1980s. Films that usually involved cannibals, either ferox, holocaust or zombified, and torture porn revengers et al, were banned, prosecuted or given a Viking burial at sea. One such film was Zombie Flesh Eaters (the best title the film has of the few it is known by), it became like the Holy Grail of video nasties, where to see it uncut would be like witnessing the last miracle performed by Christ. I never did get to see it back then, and as my horror leanings waned over the years I let it drift from my conscious. But now I’m here in my middle age and finding a new appetite for horror, I have finally managed to see the fabled shocker from Lucio Fulci.
 
In many ways it’s a disappointment, I mean I understand that to view it now is never going to impact in the way that it did (could) in 1979, but casting aside for a moment the gore scenes, which I will get to, it’s a bad film awash with badness, and not in a horror bad ass way. Much like the other Fulci film I viewed recently, The House By The Cemetery, ZFE is a series of blood and guts scenes strung together by amateurish filler. Be it bad acting, bad dubbing, hopeless dialogue and half hearted attempts at something cranial. However, if judging this particular Fulci film on its key horror scenes? Then it’s got brains, imagination and style to burn. Marking it out as by definition a mixed bag genius disaster!
 
The zombies themselves are brilliant creations, all dripping with rotting flesh, caked in earth and having mother nature’s insect creatures wriggling around their ravaged bodies. They shuffle along in classic Romero mode, and feast on flesh with carefree abandon. They are also perpetrators of some of zombie cinema’s best moments, such as fighting a shark on the ocean bed, pulling a hapless female victim onto a wooden splinter – eye first! And one scene where they collectively rise slowly from the earth is atmospherically as creepy as it is stunning in its execution. It is these things that of course helped to make it a legendary part of the Italian Exploitation era, and it’s these things that make it watchable still today, but let it not be said there is anything else worthwhile, because the rest is simply awful. 6.5/10 || in my opinion, quite simply the best CLASSIC zombie movie ever made"

IDK, this is one that did keep me entertained. **3.0/5** || I don't know how to approach this one.

""The Time Machine"" is one of those stories that, rereading it, beings back vivid memories. One of my best friends in high school loaned it to me, I stored it away in my backpack for about a month and then...when we had a field trip to The Board of Trade, I scrounged it out and read it on the train ride.

It was one of those stories that is so short I could rip through it in the hour and fifteen minutes between our small town and Chicago. To this day, every time I go back to it, it brings me back to 1997 and, to this day, I distinctly remember finishing it about the time the train stopped and I remember walking into the crowded city feeling like I was in a different world. The story had moved me out of reality so much Chicago seemed jarring.

And then they made it into a movie, a remake of a movie and, watching it, I don't know, I didn't have that same sense of being in a totally different world that the book gave me...

And the movie, in my mind, has to live up to that experience in some small way. Or at least give you that feeling that same feeling that the world was still spinning that one gets when they walk out of a movie and discover that it had rained.

It's an engrossing story and The Time Machine didn't seem to whisk me away like the book did. I can't help but feel it deserved better.

It felt like I was watching a movie and, honestly, it gave me the same since that Jackson's King Kong did, it felt like it was trying and horribly, miserably failed.

I left feeling ""meh,"" and that was after being excited walking into it, I mean, I read it in 1997 and they made a movie in 2002 and, I was expecting the same feeling. I had waited long enough.

So, I don't know, I may be overly harsh on it just because I loved what the story did to me so much, the first time I read it and now, as an adult, it doesn't take me to another world, it takes me back to 1997 again, and high school, and that hour fifteen minute train ride to Chicago.

So ultimately, it could be a halfway decent film that I just hate because the story had such a jarring effect on me when I first encountered it."

After growing tired of the job, CIA agent Miles Kendig decides to get out of the business once and for all. Fearing that his peace, and maybe his life, could be threatened by the organisation, he tells them that unless he is left alone he will spill the beans on all the secrets that he knows about. They call his bluff, thinking he is full of bitter hot air, so he promptly starts sending out to them one chapter at a time. Realising that Kendig is serious, the CIA sets about putting a stop to him, by whatever means necessary!!. But with Kendig having been one of their own once, he is one shrewd customer, and stopping him is going to be one hell of a job.

Based on the Brian Garfield novel, Hopscotch is a cheeky comedy paced with utter perfection from director Ronald Neame. Featuring a very accomplished cast, Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Herbert Lom, Ned Beatty & Sam Waterston, Hopscotch relies on a sharp script and incredibly appealing dialogue to bring home the bacon, and it does, admirably so. It's the type of film that one knows is not about winning awards, the kind of film that is an actors film, where everyone is comfortable with the material and appears to be having a great time. The lead role of Kendig is tailor made for Matthau, ambling along at his own pace with a glint in his eye and a quip on his tongue, Matthau carries the film with charming ease. The others all contribute of course, but the comedy gold comes from Walter and that lived in face of his. So bits of drama here, bits of comedy there, Hopscotch is a very well made and hugely enjoyable picture, recommended. 7/10"

This Roger Corman production was released in 1980 and concerns a northern California fishing community beset by humanoid marine creatures intent on killing the dudes and having sex with the ladies. It’s as if the creatures say: ""Where all dem white wimmens at?"" Doug McClure plays the lead protagonist, Jim Hill, while Anthony Pena is on hand as a persecuted Indian, Johnny Eagle.

The monsters aren’t too far removed from the Gill-man from “Creature from the Black Lagoon” (1954), albeit with big heads, sharp teeth, loong arms and huge tails. The setting and tone is similar to the contemporaneous “Prophecy” (1979) and “The Fog” (1980), except that “Humanoids from the Deep” throws in the rape angle and female nudity, mostly top nudity, but one woman on the beach is shown fully nude.

Speaking of the women, curvy Cindy Weintraub stands out as Jim Hill’s wife, as does voluptuous Lynn Theel, both uniquely attractive (don’t expect boring thin blondes with fake breasts). There are a couple of other notable cuties. Meanwhile towering Ann Turkel plays the requisite marine scientist.

The “shocking” tacked-on epilogue is well done, but it rips off “Alien” (1979). Been there, done that (and done better).

The movie runs 1 hour, 20 minutes and was shot in the Fort Bragg area of Northern California. It was remade in 1996 with Emma Samms and Robert Carradine.

Maxwell,"virgin, summer camp, georgia, coming of age, teenage girl, teenager","***A fun romp about girls wanting to lose their virginity… or something deeper?***

At summer camp in the eastern USA, two girls (Kristy McNichol and Tatum O’Neal) have a contest regarding who will lose their virginity first. Angel (McNichol) sets her eyes on a cool kid (Matt Dillon) at the boys’ camp across the lake while Ferris (O’Neal) pursues an older camp counselor (Armand Assante).

This is a coming-of-age drama with some amusing touches, similar to “The Summer of ’42” (1971), except that it involves a group of girls during the summer of 1979 (when the film was shot). The first half has the girls meet at the buses, which take them to the camp, and the typical shenanigans thereof: Rivalry, friendship, borrowing a bus, meeting guys, stealing condoms, a food fight, swimming, canoeing and so on. It’s similar to “Meatballs” (1979) and all-around routine, although somewhat entertaining. My attention perked up in the second half where I found I had stumbled upon drama at its finest. 

Despite the set-up of the wager to see who can lose their virginity first, “Little Darlings” doesn't treat sex lightly. The scene where one of the girls says to a boy before (maybe) having sex for the first time: ""Right now. Do you care about me a little?"" This shows how little a gal will ask from a dude before giving it up. 

Her tears after the fact are also an authentic reaction, not to mention thoroughly convincing. It drove home the point that sex was a big deal and not something of which to take lightly. This is followed by the interesting irony of what the two girls TELL their friends and, even better, Angel & Ferris’ potent meeting at the swing set with its refreshing transparency. The final scene and closing still are heartwarming as “Let Your Love Flow” by the Bellamy Brothers plays over the credits.

I know a lot of people see this flick as little more than a fun summer camp romp, like “Meatballs,” but those scenes are superb and represent drama & cinema at their finest.

The movie runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot at Hard Labor Creek State Park, Rutledge, Georgia, as well as nearby Covington, Madison and Eatonton, Georgia.

14807.0,The Long Good Friday,"In the late 1970s, Cockney crime boss Harold Shand, a gangster trying to become a legitimate property mogul, has big plans to get the American Mafia to bankroll his transformation of a derelict area of London into the possible venue for a future Olympic Games. However, a series of bombings targets his empire on the very weekend the Americans are in town. Shand is convinced there is a traitor in his organization, and sets out to eliminate the rat in typically ruthless fashion.",Who lit the fuse that tore Harold's world apart?,"Crime, Thriller, Drama, Mystery",114.0,1980-11-01,en,7.136,387.0,1.5636,"Bob Hoskins, Helen Mirren, Dave King, Bryan Marshall, Derek Thompson","John Mackenzie, Barrie Keeffe","london, england, casino, england, gangster, crime boss, car bomb, slaughterhouse, ira (irish republican army), bombing, neo-noir, gay theme","It's not about safety, it's about honour.  

It's the early 1980s, it's Good Friday, and Harold Shand is waiting to entertain some powerful American muscle. He hopes to get them to help fund his dockside development, but someone is murdering his men, and although Harold has a good idea who is responsible, he isn't quite prepared for the events that follow.

Plot wise, The Long Good Friday is a lesson in under taxing the audience, simplicity in structure and forgoing thunder in the name of telling a solid story. The Long Good Friday is a British gangster picture that owes more to the Paul Muni and Edward G Robinson pictures from the golden age than something like ""The Godfather"". Where the characters are men of the street, working class villains who literally could be living around the corner from us, their respective antics giving them a reputation as infamous stars to be feared - and grudgingly admired.

What many modern day film lovers may not be aware of is that ""The Long Good Friday"" had its release delayed, held back a year as Margaret Thatcher and her merry men frothed at the mouth due to the film's portrayal of the Irish Rebublican Army. This was at a time when the Irish troubles were reaching new and terrifying heights, and here in this film, the government sensed a fall out that could have sent wrong message shock waves across the British Isles. This is one of the chief reasons that lifts the pic high above many of its contemporaries, it may be a simple story, but it's not merely about two gangs striving for power on one manor!.

Barrie Keeffe's script positively bristles with a hard bastard edge, some of the set pieces play out as true Brirtish greats, once viewed they are not to be forgotten. Some of the dialogue has an air of timeless bravado about it, delivered with cockney brashness from Bob Hoskins' Harold Shand. Hoskins is on fire, seemingly revelling in the role and fusing menace with a genuine sense of earthiness, one moment Harold is the bloke you want to have a pint of beer with, the next he's one step from rage induced retribution. Helen Mirren is fabulous as Harold's wife, Victoria, loyal and unerringly calm in the face of the madness unfolding, while the supporting cast are also highly effective, with a cameo from Pierce Brosnan that is icy cold in making a point.

Perhaps now it feels like it's only of its time, and it may well be that it's only British viewers of a certain age that can readily embrace the all encompassing thread of gangland London at risk from insurgents? But I will be damned should I ever choose to love this film less with each passing year, for to me it only just stops shy of being a British masterpiece, bristling with realism at a troubled time, and cheesing off Margaret Thatcher in the process, hell it works for me, always. 9/10 || ""Harold"" (Bob Hoskins) has spent the last ten years building up a business of the back off criminal enterprises and is about to try to go straight with an hude dockside development he hopes to sell on to some Americans. They've arrived in London and he is all set to wine and dine them to seal the deal when things start going quite spectacularly wrong. His best pal ""Colin"" (Paul Freeman) is killed after seeking a quickie in the local swimming baths and one of his pubs suffers from what they conveniently describe as a ""gas leak"". He knows that someone is trying to queer his pitch, and that probably points to an insider. Girlfriend ""Victoria"" (Helen Mirren)? Ambitious sidekick ""Jeff"" (Derek Thompson) or maybe enforcer ""Harris"" (Bryan Marshall)? Well ""Harold"" has to mobilise his entire organisation if he's to salvage what he's got already let alone do any kind of deal with his already sceptical potential business partners. I don't think you could ever describe Hoskins as a versatile actor, but here he carries off the role as the increasingly bewildered gangster with skill and director John Mackenzie keeps the pace moving along well as we all try to guess just who's trying to bring his empire crashing down. Mirren isn't really on screen often enough to make much difference, but eagle-eyed folks might spot Pierce Brosnan and Karl Howman making up the numbers as the Irish continent who appear to be more complicit in the shenanigans. It hasn't aged terribly well but is still a solid drama with plenty of threat and thankfully, precisely no romance at all!"

God (George Burns) manifests to a little girl in Los Angeles (Louanne) whose well-to-do parents are separated (Suzanne Pleshette & David Birney). It appears the LORD wants to use her for advertising.

“Oh, God! Book II” (1980) lacks the novelty of the original 1977 film and is underwhelming, marred by a sitcomy vibe, but it’s also cute and kinda heartwarming. It’s more of a drama with amusing touches than a comedy. In other words, what would REALLY happen if the Creator started appearing to a girl in Los Angeles?

‘God’ does have a few nuggets to share but, to be expected, there’s some political correctness not in keeping with biblical Christianity. The filmmakers naturally wouldn’t want to offend their potential viewers. Meanwhile Suzanne is winsome as usual and Birney is convincing as the likable father.

Not sure I have a huge desire to re-watch, however. **3.25/5** || _**What if the Almighty manifested and gave you an assignment?**_

God appears to a grocery store manager (John Denver) in the guise of an old man (George Burns), offering him the task of spreading the word that He’s there, He cares, and we must work it out on Earth through peace and love as opposed to violence and hate. Teri Garr is on hand as the man’s wife.

“Oh, God!” (1977) is a comedy-fantasy that I found laugh-out-loud funny through the first act. It eventually gets more serious, addressing religious sects and hypocrisy, while remaining amusing. Being a lighthearted movie for the masses, don’t expect commentary on hardcore or complicated theological issues, like sin, divine judgment and humanity’s need for eternal life, not to mention the consequence of damnation. There might be a quick witty comment on some of these items, but nothing more. 

If you can accept that, it’s an entertaining fantasy that screams mid-70s in every frame. Besides, the basics ARE true: If the Almighty manifests (one way or another) and gives you a mission, you would be compelled to carry it out and face the negative consequences, like ridicule and loss of your job. Likable Denver is surprisingly good for a musician and the ending is heartwarming.

A sequel came out in 1980 with the same sitcomy vibe, but focuses on a little girl and wasn’t as funny, although it’s worth checking out if you liked this one. The third and last installment, “Oh, God! You Devil,” debuted in 1984 and involved a Barry Manilow wannabe morphing into a stud-ly Rick Springfield rock star after making a deal with the devil. It’s reminiscent of “The Rose” if it were a comedy and, in its own way, is just as good as this one.

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Burbank and surrounding areas (Long Beach, Los Angeles, Van Nuys and North Hollywood).

I saw it on my own at a cinema this morning which was a shame - it's a solid story with some reasonable characterisations and the animation is efficient rather than ground breaking.

Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't ""get"" horror.

The recent ""Beach House"" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%). 

Unfortunately, the rest of the ""Resident Evil"" sequels except for a few moments, rarely captured that first movie's originality and allure.  Instead, check out the writer/director's excellent previous outing ""Event Horizon."" || Been several years since I last watched this one and I guess it's passable but not very scary (I personally don't find zombies all that frightening) and the CGI creatures, while okay for its time, didn't add to the tension either. At least some of the action was alright and not bad following around Milla Jovovich. **2.75/5** || Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

I understand that zombies have been done to death by the time I wrote this, but I've always enjoyed them, and I understand that, as a movie franchise, ""Resident Evil"" is fairly laughed at, but the first movie was somewhat promising, even if it didn't REALLY have anything to do with the video game.

If nothing else, Milla Jojovich and Michelle Rodriguez are quality actors and carry the movie very well, though I honestly think the cast does well.

I'm all for unique movies, and, at the time, this felt like one.  It is well remembered for a particular death scene.

If you like zombies, then you should like this one.  It just has this evil corporation trope looming in the background.

It does a great job of slowly escalating the situation, if in a slightly absurd way."

To give it some sort of narrative, there's a fan inserted into the mix and he serves as a conduit to not just the story of the four piece's musical journey, but also to illustrate a Britain that was wallowing after many years of ineffective government, out of control trades unions, and on the cusp of electing Margaret Thatcher (who does feature now and again telling us about the safety of old ladies walking along the street). What's interesting about their conversations is that the band vacillate entertainingly from the banal gibberish of stoned, drunk, opinionated would-be rock stars to perfectly lucid men with astute views of society and the causes of the misery which many of us Brits experienced at the time. The drama doesn't really work so well, but when they are on stage the thing can be quite electric, and the bands engagement with a wide demographic delivering some potently observational lyrics; plenty of ripe and vivid language, and some poor soul sent to the hotel corridor so another could get laid in their shared room brings some humour to it too. It's far too long and indulgently paced though, and there's not enough music to really stop in from becoming a bit too repetitive. Needs a shortening to tighten up the story, but still interesting enough."

Seven former college friends from Boston meet at a cabin-in-the-woods in New Hampshire, along with a couple of others. They talk about where they were, where they are, where they’re going, plus other things, like romances ending or reigniting.    

""Return of the Secaucus Seven” (1980) is a cabin-in-the-woods drama without any boogeyman focusing on the lives of former ‘radicals’ in college, all of them around 30 years-old now. Obviously “The Big Chill” (1983) used this as a template, but they’re both different enough to appreciate.

This one had a way smaller budget ($60,000) and no-name actors with only David Strathairn going on to any notable success, not counting director John Sayles, who plays peripheral character Howie. The biggest differences are the locations and the fact that the protagonists here are about 9 years younger.  

Like “The Big Chill,” you have to be in a mood for a dialogue-driven drama to enjoy this. There’s some good droll humor, a fun swimming sequence, an entertaining bar episode and more.

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in North Conway & Jackson, New Hampshire.

Smokey and the Bandit is directed by Hal Needham and the screenplay is collectively written by James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer and Alan Mandel; from a story by Needham and Robert L. Levy. It stars Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed and Mike Henry. Music is by Bill Justis and Jerry Reed and cinematography by Bobby Byrne.

He does what he does best-shows off.

Bo ""Bandit"" Darville (Reynolds) accepts a, illegal job/bet offer of delivering a truck load of Coors Beer from Texas across the states to Georgia. The job must be completed within 28 hours or he will not pick up the $80,000 payment for his services. Enlisting his buddy Snowman (Reed) to drive the truck, while he acts as a decoy in his Pontiac Trans Am, the Bandit must avoid capture by the Smokey (police). When he stops to pick up runaway bride Carrie (Fields), this makes him the target for one particularly vindictive laws enforcer, Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Gleason), whose son Junior Justice (Henry) is the jilted intended of Carrie.

You sumbitches couldn't close an umbrella!

The best of the ""CB Radio"" movies, Smokey and the Bandit makes up for what little it has in plot, with unadulterated fun via car pursuits, stunts and wonderfully colourful characters. Essentially one long chase movie, it was a massive box office success on it release, becoming the second biggest earner in 77 behind a certain Space Opera from George Lucas. Cashing in on Burt Reynolds popularity, and the new found interest in CB radio on the highways, film went on to influence similar films and TV shows further down the line. The memory of the poor sequels and the inferior similar films of its type has somewhat led to many people forgetting just what an entertaining movie it is.

There is no way, no way, that you could come from my loins. Soon as I get home, first thing I'm gonna do is punch your momma in the mouth.

Hal Needham uses his knowledge as an ex-stuntman to great effect, setting up a number of inspired sequences that sees cars jumping, crashing or going for a swim! Wisely letting his actors ad-lib where possible, film has a natural flow that's hard to dislike. The chemistry between Reynolds and Fields is warming, due to the fact that it was off screen real, while Gleason steals the movie with a hilarious portray as the manic, cussing and determined Buford. The bumpkin based music is perfectly in keeping with the mood, and the various locations used make for an appealing backdrop to the carnage and speedster thrills.

Not quite as Punk Rock anti-establishment now as it seemed back then, but still utterly delightful courtesy of a damn fine cast and some special motor vehicle mayhem. 8.5/10"

Meanwhile Cledus ""Snowman"" Snow (Jerry Reed) takes the place of The Bandit, teaming up with a woman who just quit her job at a used car lot (Colleen Camp).

Burt Reynolds and Sally Field are absent in this third entry of the Good Ol’ Boy series, except for Burt having a glorified cameo at the end. Gleason takes the lead with Mike Henry’s support. The latter is so effective in his inane role that you completely forget that he played a serious Tarzan in three movies from 1966-1968, not to mention the formidable corrupt Sheriff in “Rio Lobo” (1970). At 46 during shooting, you’ll observe that he certainly kept in shape.

Car chase comedies like this are meant for leaving your brain at the door and having fun, but this inferior sequel makes me want to up my rating for the original “Smokey and the Bandit” (1977). There’s an amateurish vibe, particularly with the writing and editing, which prevents it from attaining even the low level of ""Cannonball Run 2"" (1984). Still, it’s the most action-packed (and goofy) entry in the series and it has its points of silly amusement.

Colleen Camp is serviceable essentially replacing Field on the female front, although not enough is done with her. If you’re not familiar with Colleen, she played the Indian playmate in “Apocalypse Now” (1979) and the hot French maid in “Clue” (1985). Anyway, this segment arguably features the best women in the periphery. Faith Minton is on hand as a 6’1” Amazonian who takes a liking to the Sheriff.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 25 minutes and was shot entirely in Florida (Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Ocala, Clearwater and Miami).

Everything you'd want out of a Blade movie - gore, martial arts, gunplay, clever quips, and techno music - is here to the nth degree. Best of all, it's filmed and choreographed with absolute mastery (thanks Donnie Yen!)

Guillermo del Toro never forgets to include his more artistic side. Detailed creature anatomy, amazing creature design, an understanding of where to put the camera, and great characters. It's all here.

Blade II is an incredible action picture and even though some of the CGI looks dated (it really just adds to the charm), Blade II is as exhilarating today as it was in 2002. || The second piece of this vampire hunter trilogy blurs the lines between Action, Super Hero and Horror, which personally I'm kinda liking.

This time around, Blade (Wesley Snipes; New Jack City, Chaos), Abraham Whistler (Planet of the Ape, Provinces of Night) and new arrival Scud (Norman Reedus; The Boondock Saints, Pandorum) must team up with the Blood Pack, made up of Dieter Reinhardt (Ron Perlman; Hellboy, Outlander), Nyssa Damaskinos (Hell Ride, Wrong Turn at Tahoe), Chupa (Matt Schulze; The Transporter, The Fast and the Furious), Asad (Danny-John Jules; Red Dwarf, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels), Snowman (Donnie Yen; IP Man, Highlander: Endgame), Verlaine (Marit Kile; Doctors, Blue Murder), Priest (Tony Curran; The Midnight Meat Train, Underworld: Evolution), and Lighthammer (Daz Crawford; Hammer of the Gods, Game Over) in order to defeat UberVamp Jared Nomak (personal favourite Luke Goss; Death Race 2, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Tekken) and his army of Reaper Strain Vampires.

With me so far? No? Then go watch the damn movie! It's very fucking good. The opening is almost as strong as the original, and pretty much everything else about it is better. Not to mention the fact that I'm a total Luke Goss fanboy. All of the characters are so much better. They interact and everything. And even though Wesley Snipes has never really impressed me as an actor, the character of Blade was a little less cheesy, which always helps, and basically just better all 'round.

SPOILERS FOR BLADE, BLADE II and TRINITY: An interesting point, without ruining anything about the trilogy is that in all three films, vampires fight vampires. Not in the whole ""Blade's half a vampire so he kills full-on vampires"" way, although there is most certainly that, but in Blade, Frost kills the Elder vampires to become La Magra. In Blade II, The Blood Pack and Blade team up to take down a new, much more dangerous breed of vampires. And in Trinity, Dracula goes around killing vampires, pretty much for fun. Just food for thought. I've never read the comics much myself, so I don't really know if that's something that's been going on for a while, or if it just turned out that way.

There were a couple of lame bits. Some very stupid lines like ""they took all of our weapons. Even your sword."" Even your sword! Man, the single weapon for which you were named after that has killed more vampires than any other thing on the planet, and the vampires took it away from you? The audacity! And there's this whole thing where Whistler is alive again, they went most of the way to explaining it, and then sort of forgot. It would have been so simple to have a four second flashback cover the lot of it. Oh well.

Still though, I'm very, very fond of this one.

-Gimly || **Blade II is more than just a good Blade or comic book movie. It's one of the best vampire films of the last 20 years.**

Blade II was a significant step up for the Blade franchise (and, unfortunately, the trilogy's peak) with a much more experienced director and a unique and exciting premise. This time the vampires are the prey and are desperate to survive the growing horde of vampire zombies, desperate enough to side with their sworn enemy, Blade, in hopes of surviving this plague. Both Blade and Blade: Trinity placed inexperienced directors at the helm, but Blade II put experienced horror and creature director Guillermo del Toro in charge, and the result was outstanding! Blade II has the most horror influence of the trilogy and the best story. Del Toro's involvement in all three films might have saved the series, but instead, we got the all-out action letdown of Blade: Trinity. Wesley Snipes was a perfect choice for Blade, and surrounding him with a cast that included Ron Pearlman, Tony Curran, and Donnie Yen (all experienced in the genre and with action) makes Blade II a top-notch vampire action comic book film."

For a movie about technology that would make you into a speedster, you'd think this would be phenomenal.  The ""hyperspeed"" effect itself and it's presentation in the movie is amazing, even with the ""mad scientist"" trope accompanying it.

The cast isn't bad by far, but, for this, they could have been quite better to really sell the effects and create a better atmosphere for the story.

Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah, move into a vast Brownstone home, this place is unique because it has a panic room, a room of safety from where no intruders can gain access. Sure enough on their first night in their new home, they are forced to flee to the room as three intruders break in to the house, but trouble is, is that what the intruders want is in the panic room itself.

From the off we know that Panic Room is going to be oozing David Fincher stylishness, the opening credits sprawled across the Manhattan skyscrape like advertising billboards, perfectly set the tone for the movie to follow. I personally think that following on from the harshness and ingenuity of ""Fight Club"", many were surprised at the simplicity of Panic Room's structure, this is after all a straight forward cat and mousery thriller set in one foreboding building. Yet Fincher gains much claustrophobia from such a large building setting, managing to rack up the tension in every reel. The film, in spite of the oppressive nature of the story, never sits still either. The action kicks in from the off and through a series of devilish stunts, it continues through to the pulse raising finale.

The David Koepp screenplay does not seem dark enough on the first viewing, because some of the interplay between the three intruders is actually jocular, but it never loses sight of its thriller heart. Subsequent revisits to the film reveal it to be a tightly constructed character piece, in what is practically a five character story. The real winner in that department is Jodie Foster's Meg Altman, it would have been easy for the character to be ground out as some super heroine, with death defying feats of courage masking her out as wonder woman, but Fincher has her pure and simply as a resourceful human being. She's fiercely maternal and strong and intelligent, but at her core she remains fallible, and with that she becomes believable. The other big plus point in the film is Fincher's use of the house, where his camera glides about like a phantom, a ghostly observer to the unfolding proceedings. In and out of locks and coffee pots, up and down stairs, tilts, as we track the movements of the intruders, Fincher isn't showing off, he's putting us the viewer into the mix as well.

Cast are very good, Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and a surprisingly potent Dwight Yoakam all come together very well under Fincher's watchful eye, whilst young Kristen Stewart as Sarah puts much emotive heart into a role that could so easily have been too syrupy approaching the final act. Yes it's fair to say that one has to suspend disbelief, this is after all a home invasion thriller following a true course, but in Fincher's hands it rises above cliché to thrive on atmospherics and character dynamics. Well put together and big on ticking time bomb tension, Panic Room gets better on repeat viewings. 8/10 || Not a bad movie. She gets this new big house that she is building up. The guys working on the house come up with a plan to rob the panic room. Until the owner and her family lock themselves in the panic room to get away from them. || I recommend this movie for a fun and enjoyable watch, as it has a cute and engaging storyline. While the characters may not be very memorable, the film still offers a good time.

There are instances where the movie could benefit from less dialogue and more adventure, perhaps cutting down on certain cartoonish elements. This adjustment could enhance the overall experience and make it more captivating for the audience.

It's a great movie for kids to watch and have a good time with, although the characters may not leave a lasting impression. Dark, in particular, stands out as a potentially memorable character, while the lead character may fade from memory over time.

Despite its shortcomings, the movie is entertaining and worth watching, especially for a casual viewing session. While it may not be a film you'd revisit often, it can serve as a pleasant distraction or background entertainment during chores or other activities"
14635.0,The Rookie,"Jim Morris never made it out of the minor leagues before a shoulder injury ended his pitching career twelve years ago. Now a married-with-children high-school chemistry teacher and baseball coach in Texas, Jim's team makes a deal with him: if they win the district championship, Jim will try out with a major-league organization. The bet proves incentive enough for the team, and they go from worst to first, making it to state for the first time in the history of the school. Jim, forced to live up to his end of the deal, is nearly laughed off the try-out field--until he gets onto the mound, where he confounds the scouts (and himself) by clocking successive 98 mph fastballs, good enough for a minor-league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.

I felt every emotion of his character, best I've (currently) seen of Quaid so far.

The film does a great job at making you care for not only him, but even his high school team. Speaking of which, they did a terrific job with the casting of those guys - I felt like I was watching a bunch of real teammates; Chad Lindberg, of <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em>, is one of them. Even away from Quaid and Lindberg & Co., you still have Morris' family to feel for as well. There's many characters to get attached to, but I was very interested in all of them.

29135.0,No Such Thing,A young journalist journeys to Iceland to find her missing fiancé only to encounter a mythical creature who longs to die.,A modern day fable.,"Fantasy, Drama, Horror",102.0,2002-03-29,en,5.923,65.0,0.5483,"Sarah Polley, Robert John Burke, Helen Mirren, Julie Christie, Baltasar Kormákur","Hal Hartley, Hal Hartley",,"_**ANNIHILATION of the Wicked!**_

Released in 2001, ""No Such Thing"" was originally called ""Monster,"" which is the superior title. Why? Because the film's about a literal monster, played by Robert John Burke, who looks like a cross between Satan, a reptile and a grouchy dude. The monster's been alive for millennia and is virtually indestructible. He dwells in bored solitude on an island off the coast of a remote area of Iceland where he occasionally terrorizes the villagers, kills people and blows flames from his mouth.

Sarah Polley plays the protagonist, Beatrice, who's assigned the mission of finding out what the ""legend"" is all about and, after a tragic bypass, meets the monster who stirs her compassion to put him out of his misery. Helen Mirren plays a loathsome news media executive and Julie Christie a doctor who helps rehabilitate Beatrice.

Needless to say, this is an odd dramedy/fantasy that's so unique there's really ""No Such Movie,"" which explains the mixed reviews. It successfully meshes the depth of inhuman evil with the height of genuine spirituality with generous doses of comedy, drama, satire and tragedy. It comes as no surprise that it's an American Zoetrope picture, the studio founded by Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas at the start of the 70s and known for filmmaking expertise that generally eschews 'blockbuster' syndrome. In fact, Coppola is the executive producer.

Unfortunately, 'unique' doesn't always mean great. My wife & I viewed ""No Such Thing"" in 2011 and were somewhat bored, even while there are undeniable entertaining elements, but I viewed it again last night and, while still finding it boring in some ways, I enjoyed it more. For instance, the monster is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and the spiritual parts are palpable.

Moreover, I was able to figure out what the film's about, at least in my humble opinion. It's this factor – the film's insightful and fascinating MEANING – that breaks the threshold of greatness and inspires me to rate it as high as I do. See my explanation below for more details.

It runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in Iceland and New York City.

GRADE: B

***SPOILER ALERT*** (DON'T read further unless you've seen the film)

Imagine if you could live forever, what would you do? Imagine the potential for growth and learning! You could learn how to travel the cosmos and discover the answers to life's greatest mysteries. Now consider being indestructible and imagine the capacity for being a benign force in the world and universe, destroying evil wherever you go, etc. The monster in the movie possesses these incredible gifts and yet doesn't take advantage of them. All he does is mope around in a hateful, self-pitying fog, drinking booze, cussing people out – or threatening & killing 'em – and wishing he were dead.

The monster represents people who are blessed with the gift of life and foolishly squander it on drugs, alcohol and various time-wasters (and I'm not talking about proper r & r, which is healthy); others misuse the gift of life to grumble, hate, slander, steal, abuse, destroy and murder. It's no accident that the creature looks like Satan himself. These types of people are all around us. Now imagine if these miserable, loathsome folks were immortal. What would they be like in a few million years? They'd be like the monster in the movie. The media executive (Mirren) is roughly 60 years old and she's on the same course as the creature, as are other individuals in the story.

Beatrice is the Christ-figure who figuratively dies and is resurrected. Like the Messiah, she responds in love to the hate, crime and self-destruction that infects the world. When she meets the monster she observes that there is no hope for him; there's no love in him, no good, no possibility for redemption. The only compassionate thing she can do is assist him in attaining his ultimate desire: destruction.

This destruction is a type of the lake of fire or ""second death"" where the bible says God will ""DESTROY both soul and body"" (Matthew 10:28). What's the purpose of this ""second death""? The Creator is essentially doing what Beatrice does in the film and for the same reasons.

If Beatrice is the saintly ""Christ-figure"" why does she morph into a loose woman who has a one-night-stand at the end? Because she's only a TYPE of Christ and, as such, is still wholly human, possessing the potential for moral failure. She falls after constant contact with the irredeemable creature for an extended period. The apostle Paul put it like so: ""Bad company corrupts good character."" This explains why Beatrice tells the monster she fears him at the end while simultaneously hugging (loving) him: She needed to carry out her duty -- compassionately putting the creature out of its misery -- because his intrinsic evil was starting to rub off!"

But it's all about context, if instead of comparing it to a list of similar things that I hate you compared it to, say, the entire history of cinema overall, then _National Lampoon's Van Wilder_ is pretty bad.

One additional note, the friend of mine who I put this on for told me that the movie was from the era of ""When Tara Reid was still hot"". Now personally I've never found any iteration of her attractive, but it did make me have a parallel thought, is Van Wilder from the era when Tara Reid was a better actor? I'm not saying she has been some sort of Oscar-worthy great at any stage, but if I compare her in this to her in, for example, _Sharknado 47_, despite the extra years of experience, she's definitely worse now, right?

Most of the time we can’t even be honest with ourselves”. Honesty. Deceit. Contradiction. A crucial part of human preservation is the requirement to lie. Intentional or accidental, it’s within our ancestral blood. The unprejudiced can succumb to the immoral values of deceit, either through meticulous storytelling or scattershot deception. Even the truth can be distorted by one’s self-absorbed ego. The mutually contradictory stories of a bandit, Samurai and his wife, during a police questioning of an ambush, rape and murder, provides Kurosawa with the leverage to thematically explore the depths of human duplicity. A narrative conveyed through the perspective of four individuals, each telling a variation of the same event and asserting it as the truth. Yet who is moral? Who is verifiable?

The answer lies within the embellishments of mankind. The egotistical residue enveloping the desires for personal gain. The bandit, openly admitting to the events in question, proud of his barbaric conquest. The wife, subjecting herself to sorrow and helplessness, innocently scarred from the visceral crime. The Samurai, communicating through a spiritual medium, self-gratifying his noble demise. And the distant woodcutter, examining the various preceding stories, acting as the fragile bystander solidifying his story as the whole truth. But when characters reside in a downbeat world where “you just can’t live unless you’re what you call selfish”, is anyone’s depiction correct? Is lying for personal gain and visibly stealing an abandoned baby’s clothing the same selfish endeavour? Variational stories so similar yet so different in tone. It all comes down to the genius that is Kurosawa.

Depicting egoism through embellishment, not just through the verbal tales of the living, but also beyond the grave. Signifying the requirement for flattering falsehood, even when life has been fully exerted. It is the impossibility of human nature that provokes us into fabricating the most obvious details. Never has such an influential film, shrouded in its own classicism, infiltrated my soul through its thematic examination of human psychology as much as this did. Every word. Every detail. Every deadpan look into the camera. Every tracking shot that showcases the glistening sun of truth through the obscurities of darkened natural foliage. It’s perfect.

The imperfect gender politics of feudal Japan (“women are naturally weak”) delicately inverted to portray the weakness of humanity, regardless of gender. Utilising the subjectivity of the woodcutter’s perspective, and regarding it as the most truthful conclusive narrative, mankind is objectively weak. And it’s only through our own digressions that we manufacture the strength of the soul. Kurosawa’s symbolic attentiveness never deviated from this examination. His rampart artistry poetically manifesting the beauty of mystery. Invoking the investigative mind of human psychology. And once that overcast storm dissipates, revealing the warm beating rays of honesty, the overwhelming sensation of enlightenment will seep through.

A synergistic vitality equalling that of Mifune’s energetic quadruple performance. Each tale altering the personality of his bandit blood. Hysterically laughing at the face of adversity, to unbearably breathing from profuse fear and sin. The nuances are not exhumed just from the enigmatic cast. Kurosawa himself orchestrated a tantalising, influential and innovative mystery that combats the perception of regressive culture. It’s never retrograde nor unprogressive. It is however, and I can utter this with adorned confidence, perfect.

Short, sharp and sensational. Relatable on a thematic and personal level that transcends the discourse of time. Apt now as it was back then, only proving that humanity is cemented in deceit and acts of selfishness. As with any Kurosawa feature, the mind must be prepared for allegorical beauty. Rashomon is no different. Rashomon is painted with silky smooth brushes, illustrating an unconventional technique of storytelling through visceral imagery. Rashomon quite simply acquires the perfect rating. An undisputed classic that justifiably conceived, what is now commonly known as, “The Rashomon Effect”. || In what seems like an endless, almost biblical, rainstorm we meet three people sheltering in the ruins of an old gatehouse. Each has their own story to tell of the rape of a woman and of the murder of her husband. It was the woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) who discovered the body and who alerted the authorities. It was those authorities that conducted a trial at which a priest (Minoru Chiaki), the woodcutter, the widow/victim (Machiko Kyô); the ghost of her deceased Samurai husband and, finally, the renowned bandit ""Tajômaru"" (Toshirô Mifune) are required to testify. We are shown manifestations of each testimony: all smilier but different. Who were the two victims? Was he honourable and decent? Was she demure or a temptress? Are those testifying embellishing what they saw, what they did? What makes this film great is that there doesn't appear to be a right answer. Each version is plausible, nobody is entirely trustworthy and at the end of each story, you could easily agree that was an accurate report on the turn of events. Accompanied by the relentless sound of the rain and by a soundtrack that reminded me very much of Ravel's ""Bolero"" we explore each permutation with some super performances from all concerned, but especially from the almost maniacal Mifune and from Miss Kyô. Kurosawa packs loads into less than ninety minutes in a salutary lesson in classy and enthralling film making that is quickly paced, characterfully delivered and suitably exasperating at the end! This is a good film. || **A good movie.**

Despite acknowledging the quality and attention to detail, I can't really enjoy Japanese cinema. Maybe because it's so different from what we have around here. But even being so different, we have to recognize the talent of those who have it. Akira Kurosawa is a director with a sharp eye and detail, who knows how to direct the people under his command and extract from each one what he needs for the film he has in hand.

This film seemed to me to be a lot more complicated than it would have been presumed, and I must say that I decided to watch it without knowing very well what I was going to find. Sometimes it feels good to discover something and let yourself be surprised, doesn't it? The story revolves around a crime committed in the middle of the forest, in which a very rich nobleman dies, and the film explores very well the nuances between the versions of the facts, told by various actors. However, the relativity of truth, which Kurosawa ends up defending in his film, I cannot help opposing the precision and absolute reality of the facts. If Kurosawa thinks that there can be several truths around a fact, I personally prefer to defend that there can be several perspectives, several faces of a single truth, factually verifiable. On that point, I disagree with the director.

Regardless of my personal disagreements with Kurosawa, we have to recognize the beauty of the script, in its simple writing, but not simplistic, crystalline and clear, but always done in a challenging, philosophical tone. The actors help the director a lot in his eagerness, with great commitment to the ongoing project and high doses of professionalism. Personally, I think I can only highlight Toshiru Mifune, an excellent actor in yet another superb job. The others are just as good, but I don't know them.

Technically, the film is worth it for all the details. The cinematography, in black and white, stands out with an excellent use of light and shadow, and great sharpness. The film takes place in the middle of the forest and knows how to make it mysterious, yet fascinating, and the settings are magnificent in their detail. The soundtrack is also good, but I confess that it didn't always captivate me."

Paul Newman is the coach of third rate failing minor league hockey team, The Charlestown Chiefs. The town is hit hard by unemployment and this appears to be the Chiefs' last season, however, if the coach can whip up the team up into a winning frenzy, then the unknown owner might just find a buyer and save all their carers? The management bring in three odd looking brothers who, once unleashed, take the whole team on a blood thirsty winning streak right to the championship final. The crowds flock in thirsting for more blood, but then the problems start to arise.

Slap Shot is a tremendously funny film, it's also incredibly violent and often vulgar in dialogue, but be sure to know that both things go hand in hand here (or should it be glove in glove?) to create one of the smartest sports pictures in the modern age. The hockey sequences are excellent (especially to a non fan like me), and the script bristles with course and biting humour. Slap Shot on its initial release was frowned upon by many critics, it was considered too profane and overly harsh with the win at all costs theme driving it forward. However, it's now rightly embraced as the smart and intelligent piece that director George Roy Hill wanted it to be seen as. A new generation of movie fans have started to seek it out and its reputation and fan base grows ever more larger by the year.

Newman was a bona fide star, his hair silver grey but his good looks still firmly intact, his performance has a grace about it that oddly sits nicely amongst this cynical stab at professional hockey; even if his characters' clothes are, in truth, icky. It would be a big disservice if I didn't mention the impact of the Hanson Brothers, surely one of the finest combinations to have ever graced a sports movie? They are at once unassumingly likable, the next gleefully violent, they are the glue that binds the whole picture together. Film is filled out with sparkling support work from the likes of Strother Martin, Michael Ontkean, Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse and Jerry Houser.

Not long after originally writing this review, the legend that was Paul Newman sadly passed away, he left behind a movie legacy that few can touch, and trust me, this is one of them. A sports movie that never gets old and continues to pay off on repeat viewings. 8.5/10"

Van Heflin plays rancher Dan Evans whose family and livelihood is at breaking point due to a devastating drought. Needing money fast, Evans gets thrown a financial lifeline when a reward is offered to escort a recently captured outlaw, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), on to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. But as Wade's gang closes in to free the shackled outlaw, and the clock starts to tick down, Evans finds himself torn between a sense of social duty and an easy option courtesy of Wade's mind game offer.

Based on a story by Elmore Leonard, this is a tight and tense Western that harks to the wonderful High Noon five years earlier. Directed by Delmer Daves, 3:10 to Yuma sees two of the Western genre's most undervalued performers come together in perfect contrast. Heflin's Evans is honest, almost saintly; but ultimately filling out his life with dullness and too much of a safe approach. Ford's Wade is the other side of the coin, ruthless (the opening sequence sets it up), handsome and very self-confident. This coupling makes for an interesting story-one that thankfully delivers royally on its set-up. As Wade's gang closes in, led by a sleek and mean Richard Jaeckel, Wade toys with Evans, offering him financial gain and gnawing away at him about his abilities as a husband, the tension is palpable in the extreme. Nothing is ever certain until the credits role, and that is something that is never to be sniffed at in the Western genre.

The comparison with High Noon is a fair one because 3:10 to Yuma also deals with the man alone scenario. A man left alone to deal with his adversaries and his own conscience; money or pride indeed. Daves' direction is gritty and suitably claustrophobic, with close ups either being erotically charged {watch out for Felicia Farr's scenes with Ford in the saloon} or tightly wound in room 207 of the hotel; where Heflin & Ford positively excel. His outdoor work, aided by Charles Lawton Jr's photography, also hits the spot, particularly the barren land desperate for water to invigorate it. While the piece also has a tremendous George Duning theme song warbled (and whistled by Ford in the film) by Frankie Laine. Great acting, great direction and a great involving story; essential for fans of character driven Westerns. 8.5/10

Footnote: The film was very well remade in 2007 with two of the modern era's finest leading men, Russell Crowe & Christian Bale, in the dual roles of Ben & Dan respectively. One hopes, and likes to think, that they remade it purely because it was such a great premise to work from. Because Daves' film didn't need improving, it was, and still is, a great film showcasing how great this often maligned genre can sometimes be. || A top 50’s Western with Glenn Ford only held back by the B&W photography

RELEASED IN 1957 and directed by Delmer Daves, ""3:10 to Yuma” is a Western about a struggling Arizona rancher, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), who has no choice but to hire-on as an escort of dangerous, but charismatic outlaw, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). Wade proceeds to employ psychological manipulation in order to corrupt the righteous family man and escape.

This is a quality psychological Western from the 50s, only held back by the B&W photography. The Arizona landscapes are spectacular but they’re all for naught due to this flat B&W presentation. Nevertheless, the story & characters are great. The mind games Wade plays with Evans keeps things interesting. Felicia Farr, the hottie from Glenn Ford’s excellent “Jubal” (1956) is on hand as a bartender who has a thang for bad boys. I’m not complaining about her role, but it’s a tad unlikely that such a smoking hot woman would be alone for too long in the Old West where there were twenty times more men than women.   

Most old Western theme songs are hopelessly hokey, e.g. “North to Alaska” (1960) (a great Western), but the one here sung by Frankie Laine is very good. I like it when words that don't rhyme are made to rhyme in a song: ""There's a legend and a ruma', when you take the 3:10 to Yuma.""

The 2007 remake with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the Evans/Wade roles takes the template of this film and makes a superior Western with more action and deeper themes, not to mention IN COLOR. 
                   
THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Arizona (Old Tucson,, Contention City, Sedona, etc.) and the studio ranch in Burbank, California. WRITERS: Halsted Welles (screenplay) and Elmore Leonard (story). 
 
GRADE: B || Interesting watch, especially after the remake (which improved on some plot holes).  The first half is a ""typical western"" that you could easily see Wayne or Stewart in.  But the second half (once they arrive in Contention), sees this turn into more of a psychological drama.

Especially surprising is that Wade's torments actually seem to break the hero, Evans.  In this movie, Evans then suddenly seems to ""right"" himself and get on the train with a happy ending because Wade, for some inexplicable reason, decides to help him.  

The acting of the 2 leads is top notch (esp Ford), but all else are left aside and not developed. The score and cinematography are superb.

Overall an above average western, worthy of its status as a classic, but not the masterpiece I was hoping for."

That pretty much sums up this 1990 film starring Tom Hanks as a miserable man stuck in an uninspiring job. After learning he's going to die in six months, he accepts an offer to live it up for a couple of weeks and sacrifice himself in a volcano on some nondescript Pacific island.

Right off the bat, the movie tips off that it's more fantasy than reality. There's a great message about not selling your life -- your dreams -- for whatever pathetic wage they're offering at the local factory or whatever the case. But the final act fizzles out in Giligan's Island cartooniness.

Meg Ryan co-stars in a three-pronged role.

GRADE: C+ || Bare with me here, because things are hazy.

I distinctly remember renting this at our old small town independent pre-Block Buster video rental establishment. Back when it stopped selling porn (for a few years) and devoted the back room to Betamax and Laser Disc before they moved on to a bigger building.

I remember riding my bike there with my father when I was ten. I remember seeing the poster in one of the two small windows. I remember the other new releases on the shelf, and I remember renting this on VHS with a Beta Danger Mouse.

And then I remember thinking it was a drama because of the start of the film, cracking up about the luggage, cracking up about the actual volcano climax, and that is about it.

But I guess the point is that I remember laughing, and that is what matters."

The story is centred around the character of ""Manfredi"" (Marcello Pagliero) who is being chased by the Gestapo, and so is trying to escape. Even though Rome has been declared ""open"" and is therefore not subject to bombardment, the citizens are still very much under the control of their occupiers and getting ""Mandredi"" to safety is no easy feat. He seeks shelter with his friend ""Francesco"" (Francesco Grandjacquet) but meets his fiancée ""Pina"" (Anna Magnani) instead. She wants to help him out and so they send for the priest ""Don Pietro"" (Aldo Fabrizi) who sees the safety of these resistance fighters as a core part of his responsibility to God. Even he, clad in his robes, is not immune though from the pursuing authorities and as they close in things become increasingly more perilous for all concerned. This is one of the most poignant wartime stories I have ever seen. It conveys the sense of brutality being faced by the community, but it also allows room for a spirit of optimism and hope to emerge too. The children continue to play and though their food is rationed, their day to day lives are not touched by the mayhem of many occupants of ruined cities elsewhere. The casting of the soldiers is masterly, as is that of the collaborative police commissioner and the whole ensemble, coupled with the characterful writing and the delicately framed photography really does give us a plausible insight into just how - even as the war was coming to a close - dangerous their lives were. It doesn't spare us some ghastliness at the conclusion either - but that's somehow an ultimate validation of an humanity that is plentiful throughout."

......said no one ever in 2018!

A nostalgic trip to a wierd past. I liked it for a 90's movie, and it is cute, but not very funny. But a feel-gooder and everyone is nice and happy, but somehow brain-dead - like it is supposed to be!

But I was surprised how sexist and racist it was in comedy movies from the 90's! Not something I had ever questioned before. Like this fun reviewer noticed:

> One of the really great qualities of this movie was just how racist, anti-semitic, and sterotypical it was. Did Spencer get lost in a bad neighborhood and ask for directions, only to get mugged? Yup. Was their a talkative, annoying, single Jewish woman? You betcha. Was the President of the company Japanese, leading to lots of references to their culture like being on time, bowing, respect, and politeness? You know it.

Well worth the search though. One of James (Jim) Belushi's best films along with The Principal.

<em>'The Watcher in the Woods'</em> isn't necessarily a terrible film, but wow did I feel completely uninterested from (almost) start-to-finish. Dully told plot with a plain cast list. I couldn't, unfortunately, tell you anything I actually found good about this.

Lynn-Holly Johnson (Jan), a year prior to her appearance in James Bond, is the standout, but that's only down to a process of elimination to be honest; I found the rest yawnful. They aren't helped by the writing which fails to captivate how supposedly heavy the premise is, it's all basically as it seems - obvious. I should've cared for Mrs. Aylwood (Bette Davis) but I simply didn't feel attached one bit.

It is a weird one due to it not, as noted, doing anything massively negative, it's just the fact that the (short) run time is such a chore to get through. Not one I'd recommend. || _**This ain’t no conventional Disney flick; it’s genuinely eerie**_

An American family moves into an English country manor for the summer while the mysterious owner, Mrs. Aylwood (Bette Davis), lives in the guest house. The teen daughter, Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson), discerns something weird is going on, which is linked to Mrs. Aylwood's missing daughter, Karen (Katharine Levy), from decades earlier. Jan investigates the mystery with the aid of a neighbor (Benedict Taylor) and her younger sister (Kyle Richards). Carroll Baker & David McCallum play the girls' parents. 

""The Watcher in the Woods"" (1980-81) is a mystery thick with haunting ambiance, augmented by an unnerving score. DON'T expect typical Disney kiddie fare. Despite inexplicable criticism, winsome Lynn-Holly Johnson shines as the protagonist and carries the film with Davis superlative as the curmudgeonly crone. Baker is still attractive as the mother.

The original ending of the movie wasn't finished in time so important expositional scenes were cut, which left the story nonsensical. Negative critical response to a test run in spring, 1980, resulted in the movie being pulled from theaters and, after reshoots, a more subdued ending was inserted for its official release in fall, 1981, which is the ""official"" ending. 

The original ending included a cool a skeletal-insectoid alien as the Watcher, who eerily floats in thin air, which also appeared in the 1980 test run, minus an explanatory ""other world"" sequence (which was the part that wasn't completed in time). While the 1980 ending fails to properly explain events, I thought it was quite effective for the time period and for this type of movie. Not everything's tied up, but that's okay because it's a haunting mystery movie anyway. The longer version with the ""other world"" sequence goes overkill with the gobbledygook. 

For a more low-key version with an intelligible and more interesting (but less entertaining) climax, which happens to be more faithful to the book, see the 2017 TV movie by Melissa Joan Hart. 

The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes (theatrical version), and was shot in Warwickshire, Buckinghamshire & Pinewood Studios, England, with further studio work and reshoots (directed by Vincent McEveety) done in Burbank, California.

Though that's maybe less shocking knowing that _Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_ happened.

_Scorpion King_ delivers on a small amount of the hammy fun it could have been, though I can't help but wonder just how amazing it would be if we had gotten a _Fast & Furious_ level Rock portraying Mathayas.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Spawned from the ""Mummy Returns"" this rather stolid and lurching drama tells the tale of “Mathayus” (Dwayne Johnson) an “Akkadian” - an ancient sort of Mesopotamian - who tries to overthrow the tyrant king “Memnon” (Steven Brand) who reigns with the aid of sorceress who can predict the future (Kelly Hu doing her best Jane Seymour impression). This is as formulaic as I've seen in this genre and leaves little for the imagination. It has humour, on occasion, but is anything but subtle. It's all just an action vehicle for the star that does look good but has little else to recommend it to anyone. || <em>'The Scorpion King'</em> isn't one to take seriously, but based on sheer entertainment factor I did suitably enjoy this. It was, at least for yours truly, a fairly breezy 90 minutes, they did a solid job at keeping the action paced well across that run time. The casting is good too.

Dwayne Johnson isn't the best actor here in terms of how he says his lines and all that (his acting has improved since), but I'd say he makes up for that by fulfilling the physicality requirements. Michael Clarke Duncan, Kelly Hu, Grant Heslov and Bernard Hill are ones I liked seeing too.

Steven Brand is the only actor that I wasn't sold on whilst watching. I do think his Memnon character is just about passable, but at the same time I'd consider him as the weakest link. Elsewhere, the special effects seemed minimally used (at least compared to the originals) - that's a plus.

It always fascinates me when I find out about these sorta franchises, simply because it is somewhat difficult to believe that they could produce five releases and have none of them enter my knowledge - until now, of course. I am interested in checking them out though, no question."

A modern spin on the Leopold and Loeb case, directed by Barbet Schroeder and starring Sandra Bullock as a cop with emotional baggage trying to prove that two high school kids (Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt) have committed what they think is the perfect murder - just for kicks, allegedly.

There's nothing exactly awful about the film, it's well performed by the principal players, engrossing in narrative, beautifully lensed by Luciano Tovoli and Schroeder layers the production with a suitable feeling of unease. Sadly there's no psychological depth given the two boys by writer Tony Gayton, which renders the whole motives and means, and the investigation of such, as being a shallow exercise in thriller film making.

Running at two hours in length doesn't help matters, because this further irritates that more meat was not written onto Gosling and Pitt's bones, while it also exposes just how hackneyed and clichéd the picture is. Which when the story should be psychologically profound, marks this out as a frustrating viewing experience. 6/10 || Decent crime-thriller that I saw back in 2002 (probably in theaters as I did go on a weekly basis back then) and while never really impressed me, still found it watchable thanks to the performances from a young Ryan Gosling (only his fifth film) and Michael Pitt, and Sandra Bullock was alright as a damaged homicide detective. Plot plays like an episode of Criminal Minds, which isn't a bad thing to me. Also fun seeing Nick Offerman in a bit role. **3.25/5** || This is yet another role in which Sandra Bullock plays a cop on the outskirts of her team. She is ""Cassie"", a woman with intimacy issues who gets teamed up with ""Sam"" (Ben Chaplin) whom she toys with as if he were a kitten both personally and on their case to investigate what looks like the perfect murder. A distinct lack of clues leads her bloodhound nose to a school where, without the slightest shred of evidence, she alights on the wealthy ""Haywood"" (Ryan Gosling) to whom she takes an instant dislike. Further ferreting around lead the pair to ""Pendleton"" (Michael Pitt) who is partial to a little caviar, as was the corpse. Might they all be connected? I've rarely seen a potentially decent ensemble cast wasted like this. Bullock just isn't at the races, her character is frankly really quite boring and the rapport with the out of his depth Chaplin just doesn't work. There is the glimmer of an homo-erotic relationship between Gosling and the always enigmatic Pitt, but I think maybe that is just because my brain was scrabbling around trying to find a reason to make it through this really disappointing feature. In the end it is a battle of wills, and those who seem to hold all the aces play their hand as if their arms had been amputated; serendipity plays way too big a part in the denouement and at just shy of two hours, I found myself looking out of the window at the seagulls more than I might have liked.

The premise revolves around World War II and the role of codebreakers in it.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || 10th time's a charm. Better than many of the Friday the 13th movies. || ***Like ""Alien"" but with Jason and a sense of humor***

Released in 2001, ""Jason X"" starts in the year 2010 where the government decides to finally stop Jason by putting him into frozen stasis. He and another person are revived in the year 2455 by a professor and his students who are on a field trip from Earth Two to Earth One. Jason is unleashed on their spaceship and havoc ensues.

This entry is like 1979's ""Alien"" except with Jason as the monster and a sense of humor. You'll also notice that it's a great departure for the series putting Jason in space in the future. Most Friday fans look down on 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"" because the producers tried something new. It's obvious that they felt the series had become stale and formulaic with an incredible eight-installment run from 1980-1989. I felt ""Jason Goes to Hell"" had a refreshing concept (ripped off from 1987's ""The Hidden"") and a great intro & opening act, but the tone was distasteful and the flick eventually spiraled out of control with its cartoony quasi-horror gobbledygook; still, it featured a couple of the best women in the series (Agent Marcus and Deborah), which should be commended.

I heard negative comments about ""Jason X"" over the years, but the first half is sci-fi at its best with some amusing elements thrown in for good measure. It’s stunning how well the filmmakers handle the sci-fi aspects of the plot and F/X. The second half, unfortunately, becomes too cartoonish as Jason systematically annihilates most of the crew, particularly when he gets his new futuristic look, basically morphing into SuperJason (rolling my eyes).

As usual, this installment features an impressive assortment of women, but it's only Kinsa (Melody Johnson) that I find appealing, except for the cameo of the campfire teen #1 at the end, played by the stunning Mika Ward. They should have included her in the main cast.

To be expected in light of the spaceship plot, the film was shot mostly on sets (in Toronto) with a couple of outside sequences in Ontario.

The film runs 91 minutes.

Danny Parker (Kilmer) is hanging out with a bunch of methamphetamine users, apparently in an effort to numb the pain of his one time life that saw his wife murdered. Or is he? The word of mouth for it was strong, but no sooner did it hit cinemas than it disappeared off the face of the earth. However, the cult cinema world is often a vibrant place to lurk, enter there and you find The Salton Sea, a wonderfully tricksy and off beat neo-noir awash with misery, revenge, redemption and odd ball characters that are either stuck in purgatory, or heading to nowhereville.

Protagonist Danny Parker leads the film, a man whose identity is fractured after being dealt a blow from the hands of fate, very much in limbo mentally, he none the less has goals to achieve, nothing is never quite as it seems until director Caruso wants us in on the side-shifts. Danny is often in the company of danger and weird characters, from a hopped up harpoon wielding loon, to a no nose psycho (too much meth up the nose will make you lose it kids), via dirty cops and meth heads, it's a world of unease, the twisty plot drawing the viewer in with a kinky smile on its face.

Caruso also pulls off the neat trick of placing humour in this off kilter world without hurting the dramatic harshness of the thematics. There's a quite brilliant sequence that shows a botched crime being attempted by the meth head crew, this we watch at the same time as they discuss about actually pulling the crime off. That it involves a stool sample from Bob Hope should tell you all you need to know about the intelligence of the wannabe perps! Caruso's camera is fluid and he uses certain neo-noir visual tricks of the trade as well (time lapses etc), and he also has a knack for varying the mood without averting the slowly bubbling to the surface pace that the story requires.

Kilmer is superb, perfectly low-key, there is no need for rage, the yearning for revenge and redemption, for identity, is brought out via calmly delivered dialect, and it's very affecting. D'Onofrio as Pooh Bear, the afore mentioned no nose fella, steals the movie with another of his off the planet nut-jobs. Elsewhere, Sarsgard is as appealing as he has ever been as Danny's stoner best mate, Hutchinson and LaPaglia cut fine figures as dirty cops, while Guzmán and Danny Trejo leave an impressively grungy mark. The only disappointment is the lack of screen time for Kara Unger, a fine actress, she is playing what turns out to be a critical femme fatale role, but really we needed more of her. It's a rare misstep in an otherwise cracking neo-noir that is highly recommended to fans of similarly devilishly fun pictures. 8.5/10"

For one thing, the film adopts a jittery cinematographic style (aided by handheld cameras and Steadi-cams) which certainly is not Allen’s modus operandi, and lets rip the neurotic, taxing, unrelieved relationship squabbles to full throttle, inflamed by Jack and Sally’s abrupt declaration of their separation after being married for over 15 years. Two different reactions ensure, Gabe retains his sangfroid facing a bolt from the blue but Judy apparently loses it, thinking that her closest friend has been keeping her marriage snags to herself, that seems to be a big blow to their time-honoured friendship, but on a more intuitive level (as later Sally astutely dissects), there is something deeply self-serving in Judy’s reaction. 

Gabe and Judy are jolted to scrutinize their own 10-year-young matrimony, where crevices start to crack open, here, Allen deploys another gimmick, a faux-documentary with character revealing their inner feelings in the form of an interview, Gabe confesses he is a sucker for “kamikaze women” (with trying smugness) until he meets Judy, whom he deciphers is a mastermind of passive-aggressive manipulation, aka. she always gets what she wants in the end. That is what happens, Allen, a professor in literary, becomes increasingly attracted by one of his student Rain (Lewis) while being self-aware of the clichéd professor-student entanglement. Meanwhile, Judy, lends a helping hand by introducing her newly single colleague Michael (Neeson, a disarmingly pleasurable presence) to Sally, who is fumed when she finds out Jack has moved in with his new lover Sam (Anthony), a young aerobics trainer, merely three weeks after their separation. But, what complicates the situation is, subconsciously, Judy carries a torch for the gentlemanlike Michael, so in the end of the day, a paradigm shift is bound to shatter the status quo. 

Allen’s script, as rapier-like as always in laying bare the intricate verities of gender politics and monogamous dilemma, eventually, plumps for a morally ego-boosting windup for Gabe (Allen’s alter-ego) who has savored the tempting kiss from a young hottie he craves for, and then rebuffs her advance with all the dignity in the world to remain morally uncorrupted (which blows up in audience’s face when juxtaposed with its sardonic divergence from reality), whereas for Judy, her seemingly happy ending betrays Gabe’s own complacent shrewdness of knowing her too well, for my money, that’s where this otherwise rather piquant and honest-to-goodness modern marriage assessment leaves an unsavory aftertaste, which actually has been lurking behind a majority of Allen’s oeuvre. 
 
But what makes HUSBANDS AND WIVIES head and shoulders over his lesser works is the cynosure of the cast, namely, the divine Judy Davis, an ever-so entrancing showstopper, revels in emitting of Sally’s often self-contradictory but ultimately revealing emotional states with sheer intensity, veracity without forfeiting the salutary outpourings of humor and wits (her post-coital ""hedgehogs and foxes"" rumination is a gas!), Marisa Tomei, as excellent as she is in MY COUSY VINNY (1992), should hand over her Oscar to Mr. Davis, a blatant robbery in the Academy history. Whilst no one can steal the limelight from her, one must admit Sydney Pollack is quite a trouper in the other side of the camera as well, his outstanding two-hander with a feisty Lysette Anthony alone can effortlessly bust a gut, which only leaves, the story-line concerns Gabe and Judy pales in comparison with its pseudo-cerebral self-deception and self-doubt, no wonder Jack and Sally would not open up to them, they are much messier. || One of Woody's best, subordinate pretty much only to Hannah and Her Sisters.

Calamity Jane is directed by David Butler and written by James O'Hanlon. It stars Doris Day, Howard Keel, Allyn Ann McLerie, Phillip Carey & Dick Wesson. The score features music by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. Out of Warner Brothers, the film is seen as a response to the success of MGM's production of Annie Get Your Gun in 1950, where Keel was also starring. Plot here is loosely based on the life of Wild West heroine Calamity Jane (Day) and explores the relationship between Wild Bill Hickok (Keel) and herself. 

I guess the first thing that should be said is that this is no biography of one Martha Jane Cannary Burke (AKA: Calamity Jane), in truth this is more a comedy musical romp built around that famous frontiers woman, so with it being very basic on narrative and direction, this is predominantly appealing to the film fan with musical leanings. However, on that score the film is utterly delightful, such as it is fronted by the spirited lead performances from Day & Keel and a handful of truly great tunes headed by the Oscar winning ""Secret Love"" (Day luminous and vocally on peak form). 

Pic also earns some bonus points for giving Day the chance to play something other than the naive innocent girl next door type (it was a personal favourite role of hers). She gets to be spunky and brash without ever losing that adorable appeal that carried her throughout her career. The play on sexual stereotypes is rather humorous without being twee, something that you feel director Butler was under appreciated for, while Wilfred M. Cline's gorgeous colour photography enhances the playfulness of it all. 

Seen now as a feminist fantasy with a gay following thanks to ""Secret Love"", there's no denying the film is all very Hollywoodized - with characters so animated they could actually burst. But all told, if one is able to forgive and see past its tiny flaws then this is a film guaranteed to light up the darkest of wintry days. 7.5/10"

With her signing up to be a nurse and him on the front line, it's hard for them to stay in touch and that's when, with the bombs flying and the tongues wagging, confusion and misunderstandings set in that cause no end of strife for this young woman struggling to deal with the increasing conflict - physical and emotional - in her life. Those issues become even more poignant for ""Veronika"" when she is the victim of the unwanted attentions of his cousin ""Mark"" (Aleksandr Shvorin) which leads to a marriage that few understand the reasons for and that can only further demoralise ""Boris"" should he ever find out that his true love has deserted him to his fate. It's a flock of cranes that symbolise their affection at the start of the film, and it's that very consistency that they hope will see them through their lives - regardless of what goes on between peoples with bombs and bullets. Is that just a naive pipe dream, though, or is there really any hope when so much conspires against them? The effort here from Samoylova is both strong and touching, especially as the film enters is much darker and more desperate second phase. The camera loves her face, her eyes and her facial expressions and she uses that tool to convey an whole gamut of emotions effectively. Shvorin also delivers well as his character introduces a little of the manipulative and the cowardly bully to a scenario that extols the virtues of family and community but not in a perfect fashion. People adapt to circumstances in individual ways.

Will is self centered and has cast off all his responsibilities. But during one of his more dubious scams to date single mothers, he is forced to reconsider his moral fibre after coming into contact with a 12 year old outcast named Marcus.

Adapted from the massively popular book written by Nick Hornby (""Fever Pitch"" & ""High Fidelity"") About A Boy easily translates well to the screen without truly breaking free of the modest premise. Oddly enough for such a British picture, this is directed by an American, Paul Weitz, who along with his brother Chris, brought the world ""American Pie"". It works, largely to the undervalued comic talents of one Hugh Grant (Will). I would go so far as to say that without Grant leading the film, this would have been a flop, all the highlights on offer are when Grant is on the screen. Expressive with his face and delivering his lines with a natural high, Grant nicely lures the audience into the less than admirable Will's hands. Which is quite a trick considering that Will is a morally dubious scum bag!.

Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) is OK as child actors go, but here he is given far to much to do. Which is another reason why Grant is so important to the film being a success, he shoulders much of the emotional burden, letting Hoult breathe what life he can into poor young Marcus (worst hair cut on film ever). Solid support comes from Toni Collette and Rachael Weisz, and Weitz's direction is smooth and unobtrusive, with Badly Drawn Boy's score an integral part of the story. Yet as much as I enjoy the film myself, one still feels frustrated that it didn't turn out better than it did. A double handed narration from both lead characters intrudes on the flow of the plot, and the pay off is ultimately an ""oh"" moment. So to me it's an OK movie made into a good one courtesy of one of Britain's best light comedy actors. 7/10 || ""Will"" (Hugh Grant) lives a life of leisure living off the royalties of a Christmas song written by his grandad. He dates a succession of women but usually neither party want much more than a quickie. He realises that all of the interesting people have grown up and into relationships, marriages and family life - so he decides that it's time for him to have a son too! An imaginary one. Then he encounters ""Fiona"" (Toni Collette) and her son ""Marcus"" (Nicholas Hoult) and they begin to bond a little - even if the boy does bring out his (and my) best Herod tendencies. Despite himself, ""Will"" isn't a complete waste of space and when a near tragedy strikes the life of the bullied ""Marcus"", the two start to bond over afternoon editions of ""Countdown"" on the television and slowly all concerned start to realise the benefits of family - shiny new trainers, warts and all. The dialogue is quite observationally witty here and as much of the story is told via a punchy narration from Grant and Hoult, we get an additional degree of honesty to their story that augments the acting quite amiably. Hoult is the star, no doubt about it. His characterisation of an increasingly savvy and persistent child is engaging to watch and though I really did struggle to get through the cheese-fest that is the conclusion I did rather find myself wanting an happy ending. It's easy to see why Grant was Hollywood material and here he effortlessly delivers a gentle feel-good film tinged with the odd bit of reality. One that still works well. || Really like this movie. Hugh Grant before he started playing himself."

The collective fever that characterized the countdown to The Phantom Menace had long since dissipated by the time the first sequel prequel rolled off the ILM production line. Casual spectators, once stung, had decamped en masse to the newly discovered Middle-Earth, leaving George Lucas with just the few million hardcore fans - true believers who, with all the apprehension of parents at a nativity play, willed their defrocked hero back towards respectability.

There are certainly stretches in the patchy Attack Of The Clones when Lucas’ flat-packed dialogue struggles to keep the hecklers quiet – Anakin’s seduction of the former Queen has all the charm of a teenage lunge behind the bike-sheds and none of the feeling – but by the time climactic ‘reel six’ cranks into high gear the saga’s reputation as the godfather of modern sci-fi spectacle is more or less restored. Indeed, when Yoda finally unsheathes his mini-saber and kicks Sith ass the faithful can reliably be found standing on seats hollering as if the outcome was never in doubt. But, as the little Jedi might say, in doubt it was.

Where Episode V fairly zipped around the galaxy with all the breezy confidence of youth, unafraid to travel anywhere, even dark places, the second middle child of the saga is saddled with an altogether heavier burden from which it struggles to escape. Empire hits the ground running on ice planet Hoth, Clones however, has a truly cold start to contend with, aware perhaps that the movie’s most pressing task is to simply atone for the more egregious sins of Episode I. Thus, Jar Jar is quickly sidelined, the upgraded CGI Yoda gets a showcase and those damn Amidala-clones are killed off on page one. On Coruscant we also meet the grown-up ‘Ani’ - okay so he’s a whiny teenager but that’s still a vast improvement on the bowl-haired moppet the world was asked to root for in 1999.

Also more powerful than when last we met is Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan, the Jedi who was simply wan in Menace is a much more forceful presence as a full-bearded Master, struggling manfully with the endless exposition and even landing the odd punchline.

As with Empire, the protagonists are separated for the second act: while Obi-Wan is busy uncovering the conspiracy of the Clones, Anakin and Padme turn into colourless clones of Han and Leia in the romance stakes. There are pleasures (Obi-Wan squares off against Jango Fett) and pitfalls (Anakin and Padme have a picnic) in roughly equal measure throughout this flabby middle act but as with Episode I mostly you get a sense of drama that is willed into being, a necessary bridge to Episode III that requires Lucas to traverse territory – romance, politics – he is simply not comfortable in.

Matters improve greatly in the final forty minutes: Christopher Lee’s Count Dooku arrives to provide some much needed gravitas, C-3PO turns up to do his C-3PO thing and Padme puts on a skin-tight white leotard. Best of all, Lucas finally cuts loose. The classic trilogy bristled with seat-of-your-pants filmmaking, our heroes bouncing from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, and in the final section of Episode II – almost four hours into this prequel enterprise - Lucas at last cranks up to this Saturday morning serial pace: from the Tex Avery goofiness of the droid factory, to the Cecil B. De Mille grandeur of the gladiator arena, the action never lets up.

Also in the last reel we finally get to divine something of Lucas’ grand design, with ironic pay-offs for the fans still paying close attention - it is the witless Jar Jar who makes the creation of a clone army possible and Yoda who first leads what will become Stormtroopers into battle. In its own way, the end of Episode II is every bit as dark as the famous end of Episode V.

Unsurprisingly, the least anticipated movie of the saga suffered at the box office – Episode IV raked in more money at the US box office back in 1977 – and remains largely unloved by the fanbase for its emphasis on the central love story but despite no real improvement in dialogue or acting it functions perfectly well as an old fashioned romantic epic, complete with standalone set-pieces, rich political intrigue and a painters’ pallette. Indeed, so indebted is Lucas to David O. Selznick here, ultimately he may have been better served abandoning his own trilogy structure and boiling both Episodes I and II down to a 3-hour Gone With The Wind style classic – an approach that would have at least halved all that damn anticipation.


Verdict - The middle episode that can make a virtue of its bridging role is rare indeed. And where The Empire Strikes Back dazzled with vertiginous cliffhangers, Clones is more typical of the breed, necessary but not vital. However, as we make the awkward journey through Anakin’s teenage trials a sparkling digital print ensures there is still much to marvel at, not least a little green fella who is surprisingly quick on the draw.

3/5

- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine || I'm not a diehard _Star Wars_ fan. I've seen all the movies, seen them all more than once even, and I have my opinions, but when I see the way people talk about _Star Wars_ online, I can't really find myself behaving the way that ""true fans"" or whathaveyou do. That being said, I think that the majority of the _Star Wars_ films have been pretty good. The notable exception to this, for me at least, is the prequels. And yes you can include the animated _Clone Wars_ movie that they made in that era too. These four movies, again, for me, are all bad. But even amongst them, there is still a ranking in my mind, and in that list, at the very bottom sits _Attack of the Clones_. Yes it is this movie which holds the title, of the very worst Star Wars theatrical release of all time. 

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || Better than <em>'Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace'</em>, though <em>'Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'</em> is again rather underwhelming - if still good on its own merits.

Liam Neeson is missed, with the likes of Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen and Christopher Lee failing to set the world alight. McGregor does give the best performance of that quartet; Christensen possibly the weakest, though his character's story is probably the most interesting - or its overall arc, at least.

Those onscreen aren't helped by the dialogue, which is very basic and run-of-the-mill. I found the score a little forgettable, even if it's still fun to hear the key pieces of it. The plot is watchable, but I did expect greater storytelling from these two follow-up releases to the original trilogy. The CGI is, marginally, an improvement on this film's predecessor."

Every Which Way But Loose is directed by James Fargo and written by Jeremy Joe Kronsberg. It stars Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke, Geoffrey Lewis, Beverly D'Angelo and Manis The Orangutan.

It surprised the studio executives, even had them sweating about the release, but the adventures of Philo Beddoe (Eastwood) and his pet Orangutan proved to be a smash hit at the box office.

Beddoe is a trucker who also happens to make money by bare knuckle fighting, and he's very good at it. Clyde the orangutan is a full on personality himself, and between them they wind up being trailed by vengeful coppers and a very incompetent motorcycle gang. Philo's brother Orville (Lewis) is along for the ride and polar opposite love interests come into play via Lynn Halsey-Taylor (Locke) and Echo (D'Angelo). 

Plot is very thin on the ground, we are in fact viewing a series of events that are mined for comedy purpose - which totally work. Action comes by way of the punch ups Philo gets into, with Eastwood as always proving to be one of the better punch throwing actors of his generation, while Lewis shines bright as the best friend and voice of reason to Philo.

The love story sub-plot involving Lynn and Philo - and its subsequent revelations - feels a touch out of place, since this is such a chilled and relaxed comedy picture. Which is the key, the makers know what they are doing, they are having fun and ask the audience to do the same. The public lapped it up and ensured that a sequel of similar tropes would follow. That also proved to be popular since it was more of the same.

Open the beer and popcorn and just run with it, it was never meant to be high art etc. 7/10 || A bit forgettable, if nothing terrible.

Clint Eastwood is solid enough, while the supporting Geoffrey Lewis, Sondra Locke and Ruth Gordon have a couple of moments. The plot is a little meandering and doesn't hold enough entertainment, even with an orangutan being present throughout <em>'Every Which Way but Loose'</em>.

I found the pacing to be slower than I would've liked and the characters opposite the lead to be boring, whether it be John Quade & Co. or the pair of police officers. I will say that I actually did enjoy the music used, which is arguably the film's main plus if I'm honest.

I can't say I'm expecting much from <em>'Any Which Way You Can'</em>, the sequel, but I'll give it a chance no doubt."

How can I help you Inspector, buy a few tickets to the policemen's ball?  

Right from the off there's a realistic feel to the film that immediately draws you in. Be it the characters being acted out so deftly, or the whole composition of director Robert Wise's work, it's quite something and sets the viewer up a treat. It somehow manages to put you in there with Barbara Graham so as to make you feel all the emotions that Graham herself feels.

The plot is based around the murky life of Barbara Graham and the subsequent trial that would culminate in her execution, all of which is decidedly dark and troubling. Broken home upbringing (merely alluded to here) right through drugs, perjury, prostitution, shilling, robbery and ultimately murder? It's all in there, yet why does the viewer feel complete sympathy with Barbara? Could it be that she is portrayed as a victim of society? Or merely that it's just so shattering watching this woman get knocked from pillar to post at every turn? Either way the film is a triumph of a character piece, an explosive look at the destruction of one woman's hopes and dreams, a murky peek at the impact that the press can have on such trials, as they turn them into national parties and the accused into national stars.

As a criminal biography it is handled adroitly, maybe too much so? For the makers here hint at Graham actually being innocent, and yet nothing substantial is offered up so a to put meat on the bones of such a hint. Other than Graham's own repeated claims of innocence, it's just comes off as a daft slant for the film to aim for, especially since any research into the real life case leads you to finding her out as being guilty anyway. It's a minor complaint though, hell most of my favourite films of all time are historically twisted, and since so much is great and right with the film it would be churlish of me to not advocate it as a must see for anyone remotely interested in classic film history. 

Susan Hayward gives a faultless display as Graham, she nails every emotional tick of the human condition. Her feisty shows are a pure delight, whilst her scenes of heartbreak and bewilderment look genuine and are up with the best in classic film. Oh yes the academy got this one right, a long overdue Oscar for Susan Hayward. She took on a lot of edgy roles in her career, a great actress for sure. The academy simply found it impossible to ignore such a layered masterclass back in 1958. The rest of the cast are splendid, and I would be doing a disservice if I didn't mention the wonderful jazz arrangement from Johnny Mandel (well done Gerry Mulligan) that tones in perfect with the film's sizzles and sadness.

It looks and sounds fantastic and holds you enthral from the first reel right through to the last. And what a final reel, where come the denouement you may find yourself holding your breath along with Barbara herself. A truly superb piece of film making. 9/10"

I greatly enjoyed the five short extras on my DVD (a double-sided disc I bought years ago that has 'The Devil's Advocate' on the other side, yet unwatched): a conversation/interview of Nolan with Pacino; 'Day for Night: The Making of...'; 'In the Fog' (which interviewed cinematographer Wally Pfister); Nathan Crowley: production designer; and 'Eyes Wide Open' (which interviewed sleep disturbance experts), which thankfully I viewed before I watched the movie, to enhance my experience.

Greatly recommended to fans of contemporary crime thrillers, regardless of whether you watched the Norwegian original or not. There are enough differences to still make it worth your while as a cinephile. || Captures some human sentiment incredibly well, coupled with the unique setting and great acting, this makes Insomnia a good watch, worth every minute of its two hour runtime.

That said, I was not as enamoured by it as others might be. Perhaps if was unaware of what Nolan, Pacino or Williams are capable of at their highest levels, or if I didn't realise five minutes before the end that I'd actually seen it as a kid and could exclusively remember the ending, then it would have had a higher impact on me.

But even taken for me as is, _Insomnia_ is still a very solid bit of filmmaking.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || A good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece  of the puzzle. And a bad cop cant sleep because his conscience wont let him.

Insomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Erik Skjoldbjærg and Nikolaj Frobenius (1997 screenplay). It stars Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan and Nicky Katt. Music is scored by David Julyan and cinematography by Wally Pfister. It's a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.

LAPD detective Will Dormer (Pacino) and his partner Hap Eckhart (Donovan) travel to the remote Alaskan town of Nightmute to aid the local cops investigating the savage murder of a teenage girl. But Dormer leaves behind an Internal Affairs Investigation that gnaws away at him, and when a potential bust of the murder suspect goes tragically wrong, his conscious gets attacked on two fronts. By lack of sleep and by the killer himself.

It's a House of Cards.

Viewing from afar it's easy to be cynical and suggest that Insomnia is just an American remake cash in. Bigger budget, bigger stars and directed by an indie darling of the critics moving into the big league. While on the surface the plot looks to be another in a long line of cops and villains thrillers where procedural unfolds and evil is ultimately brought down at the end. Yet Insomnia is so much more than that, it's a deep movie dealing in complex psychological issues, a blanc-noir of some character substance, a picture clinically put together around one mans descent into a private hell, with the beautiful Alaskan backdrop perversely claustrophobic and Anthony Mann like in being at one with Will Dormer's fragmented state of mind.

Killing changes you. You know that.

From the opening moments as we observe a biplane flying over the Alaskan glaciers, accompanied by David Julyan's nerve tingling score, there's a looming air of disquiet. Nolan knows his noir onions, mood is everything and the dense psychological atmosphere is never once breached for the entire movie. Much of the picture is dialogue heavy, gratifyingly so, with the hushed conversations between Pacino and Williams begging the viewer to hang on every word as cop and killer (no spoiler, it's revealed to us early as a necessity) jostle for control of each others soul. What action there is also comes with a side order of otherworldly delights, a chase across floating logs and a stalk through eerie fog being the two particular highlights.

Sleep comes at a cost.

With three Oscar winners in the cast Nolan had some serious quality to direct, that Pacino, Williams and Swank deliver excellence is high praise for the British director. Pacino actually gives one of his finest late career performances, utterly compelling as Dormer, his haggard face tells of a thousand sorrows, his sleep deprived gait befits a man staring into the abyss. Wally Pfister's photography is on the money, the blend of snow whites and green tinges sparkle from the vistas and the soft brown hues inside the hotel provide the rare moments of tranquillity available to Will Dormer. Across the board Insomnia is a cracker of a movie, a film that goes into the murky depths of the genre to reveal one of the best movies of 2002. 9/10"

The Sum of All Fears is directed by Phil Alden Robinson and adapted to screenplay by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne from the novel of the same name written by Tom Clancy. It stars Ben Affleck, Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Ciaran Hinds, Liev Schreiber, Bridget Moynahan and Michael Byrne. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John Lindley.

Film is the fourth film to feature the character Jack Ryan (Affleck). It is set in present day 2002 but with Ryan younger than in the other films and at the start of his career in the CIA. Plot is Cold War themed and finds America in a sweat when it is found that renegade terrorists have a nuclear weapon in their possession; just as a new supposed radical president takes up office in Russia.

Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet, we all breathe the same air, we all cherish our children's futures, and we are all mortal.

2002 saw two great thrillers released that starred Ben Affleck, one was Changing Lanes, the other was this Jack Ryan based effort that attempted to reboot the series. Coming a year after the September 11 attacks and featuring a plot involving terrorists using a bomb that America supplied the Israelis in the 70s during the Yom Kippur War, it was material too close to the bone for some critics. Yet the film did well at the box office in the States and including Worldwide takings it garnered well over $100 million in profit. Impressive figures considering it's not an action blockbuster, it relies on brain over brawn and leading man Affleck was on the back of Pearl Harbor and bearing the brunt of critical scorn.

Each day we lose a little bit more of our separate, sovereign ability to determine our own futures... and each day the world comes a little bit closer to that terrible moment when the beating of a butterfly's wings unleashes a hurricane God himself cannot stop.

Comforted by the superb cast around him, which also includes the likes of Colm Feore, Phillip Baker Hall and Alan Bates in support slots, Affleck proves perfect for the material to hand. Without doubt he's no Harrison Ford, in the same way Moynahan is no Anne Archer, tough boots to fill in the roles of Jack and Cathy Ryan respectively, but in a re-jig of Ryan the character, we now have the arrogance of youth dressed up in slacks and t-shirt, a smart brained youngster beginning his CIA career at a perilous time, a time that thankfully is devoid of jingoistic flag waving, but of adult political sensibilities. Affleck's Ryan as a character is as refreshing as the writers' responsible attitude is.

You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki. Do not lecture me on Chechnya!

With shades of the Cuban Missile Crisis and a Fail-Safe like finale, The Sum of All Fears rounds out as a nail biter of a thriller. Dig deeper and some implausibilities surface, but we are asked to tune into the paranoia and get in deep with the characters trying to avert global catastrophe, to decry the film's cerebral thriller qualities is churlish. The Jack Ryan parts of the film involving Cathy the girlfriend are the least interesting, but here's the thing, young Jack Ryan is just one of the components making up a far bigger whole. The film isn't solely a Jack Ryan movie. The source novel was a door stopper, so inevitably much as been excised from it, and inevitably fans of the book have been vocal in their displeasure; though we would have needed another hour of film to even get close to Clancy's big block of fiction. So in place is a picture that is uncomplicated in structure and story telling and comes in at under two hours running time. It's credit to director Robinson that The Sum of All Fears engrosses from start to finish.

It was hoped that the reboot would herald the start of a run of more Jack Ryan based movies, but in spite of the great box office, this didn't materialise. But that is in no way any marker to the quality of the film, or its standing in the Jack Ryan series. Judge it on its own merits and ideas and the rewards are many, especially on a second viewing. At the time of writing Jack Ryan will return to the big screen in December 2013, titled simply as Jack Ryan, with another young actor, Chris Pine in the role of Ryan. Undoubtedly that will be high on action, such is the way of drawing in the young dollars at the multiplexes these days. But if it has half the tension and brains of Robinson's picture then we will be blessed. If not? Then there's an even bigger reason to treasure Jack Ryan's 2002 version. 7.5/10 || _**The sum of all OUR fears**_

A nuke falls into the hands of a neo-fascist madman who wants to pit America against Russia. Then the unthinkable happens. 

Based on the Tom Clancy novel, ""The Sum of All Fears"" (2002) features Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst-turned-operative; Morgan Freeman plays his boss; and James Cromwell is on hand as the president. There are several other notables; even the hulking Sven-Ole Thorsen shows up.  

I’ve only see one other Clancy movie featuring Jack Ryan and that was “Patriot Games” (1992). While it was a’right, this one’s better; top-of-the-line actually. It’s a realistic globe-trotting political thriller that shows how the world is a tinder box and it’s not going to take much to set it on fire. It’s augmented by some welcome wit & low-key humor. 

The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes. The locations are too many to list. 

GRADE: A-/B+ || As a movie, it is OK, actually one of Afflec's better efforts.  However, apparently the writer of the screenplay read a different book than I did, because ""The Sum Of All Fears"", the movie, had about 3 things in common with the book: The name, the main characters, and the fact that it involved nuclear weapons.  Why change from Denver to Baltimore?  The relationships between Ryan and most of the other characters is scrambled up.  

Neither Afflec nor Harrison Ford got the character of Jack Ryan right (Ryan is NOT an action hero, he is a deep thinker with a giant inferiority complex who still manages to be a hero, because he HAS to).  Actually, Baldwin got it closer in Red October.  

If you haven't read the book, this film is passable, but if you expected to recognize Clancy's story, you will be disappointed."

Bruce Dern appears as a bit of a deranged scientist in what may be his most likable role ever, which says a lot about the roles he has played.
He is a caring scientist, except he kills all his companions in a spacecraft. Well, can he still be likable?
He has a motivation for doing this which is more than the motivation for his other villains.
Here, he means to save plant life for Earth. His companions didn't even understand the need to save plant life, which tells you about the horrible times they live in.
All this happens fairly early in the film. Afterwards, his companions are robots whom he empathizes with as if they are human beings. 
Earth has decided to destroy all plant life, so in essence, he plays a hero/villain, hard to tell. But does he manage to salvage something for humanity?"

Barry, Kate Hodge",Dwight H. Little,"martial arts, undercover cop, police corruption, los angeles, california, drug lord","This ranks alongside **KING OF NEW YORK** as a spiritual not-quite-sequel to **YEAR OF THE DRAGON**. Let's put a few of the same characters in Chicago, with Raymond J. Barry in essentially the same role (though now even more overtly crooked and with the FBI) and swap out that Thai drug baron John Lone visited with Tzi Ma and  now throw in Bruce Lee's son into the mix. Bring in horror director Dwight H. Little (fresh off his other successful action outing **MARKED FOR DEATH**) and see what we get?

Well, the results are a bit of a mixed bag for sure. While the action sequences are largely okay, the plot doesn't really throw us any surprises. The romance between Brandon and a female police officer falls flat on its face and the surrogate father-son dynamic he has with grizzled cop Powers Boothe feels similarly forced and awkward. Also, why is a big Chinese drug shipment being brought in via the Port of Chicago when anywhere on the West Coast would be 1000x more convenient? Plot contrivances galore, plus a really goofy Tienamen Square flashback make for just a little too much dumb writing to take seriously.

That said, Brandon Lee, though still a bit rough around the edges, is tremendously charismatic as the lead. His character seems very much a humanized fish out of water and his handling of the numerous martial arts sequences makes us lament his untimely passing that much more. Dwight's action highlights come near the start with a very John Woo inspired shootout in an art gallery and reach their crescendo mid-movie with a hapless gang of Italian wannabe mobsters turning their besieged restaurant HQ into a fortress. 

Nick Mancuso, the primary antagonist of the picture, really shines as a somehow likable pathetic wimp of a mob boss. He's a lot of fun to watch, and its unfortunate that his character leaves the film prior to the third act, which turns into a straight-up dig on John Woo with a very low-stakes cliched battle in a Chinese... laundromat / factory (???). Both Tzi Ma and Al Leong get in some quality martial arts time with Brandon, but it's still so much more fun to see him in a fisticuffs match with giant brute Tony Longo in that mid-movie restaurant scene.

As it is, **Rapid Fire** has a lot of fun 80's/early-90's-style action in it and sits comfortably next to the likes of **RAW DEAL** and **HARD TO KILL** in terms of quality. Had it not been saddled with a lame script that plays its cards way too soon, it could have been a lot more. Leave it to Brandon's final film **THE CROW** to finally deliver the action goods to end up defining one of Hollywood's most tragically brief and promising careers."

In the early 2000s, when James Bond was surfing on laser-melted glaciers and fighting diamond-crusted henchmen and Ethan Hunt was dual-weird diving through a flock of doves, The Bourne Identity charted a new path. Doug Liman took Good Will Hunting’s Matt Damon, whose biggest action role to this point had been watching Tom Hanks die to save him in Saving Private Ryan and turn him into a hardcore action hero. But unlike Bond and Mission Impossible, Bourne was a grounded and gritty spy that used skill and ingenuity to overcome the duplicitous intelligence agencies that wanted him dead. The action is more realistic and brutal, with the punches landing harder and pens stabbing deep. The Bourne Identity reinvented the spy genre. || Matt Damon (""Jason Bourne"") is fished out off the sea by a passing fishing boat and after having had bullets removed from his back, determines to find out just what happened to him. One slight snag - he has absolutely no idea who he is!

He goes to the US embassy, but that doesn't quite go to plan and in escaping picks up the feisty ""Marie"" (Franka Potente) and the two have to evade chasing police and would-be assassins as they try to discover the mystery of ""Treadstone"".

Being a fan of the original cartoon from 1969-1970, I saw this live-action version when it debuted at the theater. After the first 15 minutes or so I slowly became more and more disappointed. Yet upon seeing it again last night, I must say it's better on repeat viewings.

What most impressed me on my first viewing was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. as Fred is good while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne wasn't quite right for the role, although certainly serviceable; I'm sure she got the part because of her popularity at the time. The addition of the winsome Isla Fisher as Mary Jane is a peripheral highlight. The CGI Scooby was good for the time (2002) and holds up pretty well.

On my initial viewing I was hoping for a straight live-action adaption of the cartoon sorta like 1994's ""The Flintstones."" What I got instead was part homage and part parody. This would have worked for me but the film bogged down in the ""Spooky Island"" segment, which comprises the 2nd and 3rd acts and amounts to a full hour of the film. The problem with this large chunk of the movie is that the whole ""Spooky Island"" set was just too cartoony for a live-action homage. It just turned me off. In hindsight, I suppose the cartooniness was intended since the flick's based on a cartoon (aduh).

Viewing it agin, I had the same impressions of the movie up to the 30-minute mark, but the final hour won me over. I still don't like the limitations of the ""Spooky Island"" set, yet I was impressed with the whole 'well of souls' aspect and the complications thereof, as well as the ingenious way they included Scrappy-Doo in the plot. I used to think I was the only one who literally couldn't stand Scrappy-Doo, but now I see that my feelings were pretty much universal. Scrappy-Doo rightly become the symbol of an annoyingly overexuberant or cute character added to a series in an attempt to maintain ratings, also known as the Cousin Oliver Syndrome (named after the character from the final season of The Brady Bunch, of course).

At the end of the day, this live-action version of ""Scooby-Doo"" is definitely better on repeat viewings. If you loathed it on your initial viewing be sure to give it another chance. Aside from obvious positives, like Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini nailing Shaggy and Velma, the film features the beautiful Isla Fisher in a significant role, plus the creative plot elements of the 'well of souls' and Scrappy-Doo.

It runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, which is perfect for cartoony fare like this; and was shot in Queensland, Australia.

Gangster No. 1 is directed by Paul McGuigan and written by Johnny Ferguson, Louis Mellis and David Scinto. It stars David Thewlis, Paul Bettany, Malcolm McDowell, Saffron Burrows, Kenneth Cranham, Jamie Foreman and Eddie Marsan. Music is by John Dankworth and cinematography by Peter Sova. 

Gangster 55 (McDowell/Bettany as the younger version) looks back on his brutal life, on how he became a gangster... 

The British gangster genre of film was gathering apace in 2000. Guy Ritchie's Snatch would wow critics later in the year, while Ben Kingsley's ferocious turn in Sexy Beast (David Scinto and Louis Mellis co-write on that as well) would even get an Oscar nomination, yet Gangster No. 1 is the equal of both films but still doesn't have the acclaim afforded the others - undeservedly so. 

Predominantly set in the late 60s, with period flavours strong, pic doesn't pull its punches, and yet it is never over gratuitous with the violence and mania (but you do feel it big time) that surrounds Gangster 55 (Bettany brilliantly feral and frightening). It's with the characterisations where McGuigan's film gets its strength, we witness greed, blood lust and the yearning of power via chilling portrayals, set to the back drop of a scuzzy London underworld where even the vermin don't dare to dwell. This is a film not wanting to be loved thematically, but the top performances across the board and pic's ability to grab you by the throat - to not let go - makes it a rip-snorting slice of evil. Essential for those interested in the British gangster film revival of the noughties. 8/10 || **It's not a movie for everyone, it's extremely violent and tense, but it works very well.**

It's not easy to make a good gangster movie. Sometimes it feels like they've done everything that could possibly be appealing or challenging, and that each new production is limited to chewing on and revisiting what's already been done by others, usually better. This film, set in London, brings us into a universe of violence and tension, of envy and madness, which is refreshingly dark and appealing, yet not really new.

The screenplay follows the criminal path of a British mobster whose name is never revealed and who, due to his brutality and competence, becomes one of the trusted men of Freddy Mays, one of the crime lords in London in the late 60s. However, he is ambitious, and his desire is, in the future, to be like his boss is: brutal, ruthless, but elegant and sober. It's a film where we follow the same character through thirty years of ultraviolence (I'm not using this word randomly, as you'll see) and sheer madness.

The cast has several strong names, and the main character is played by two actors: in the older chronologies, it is Paul Bettany, and today, it is the experienced and skilled Malcolm McDowell, who has participated in other intense films, such as _Clockwork Orange_. In fact, I can't help but think that Alex, the main character of that movie, iconic in this actor's career, could have evolved into a twisted and crazed figure like the one McDowell played here. The impeccable work, both his and Bettany's, is one of the pillars that sustains this film and that makes it truly intense and enjoyable. Both have memorable lines and dialogue. Another truly outstanding actor is David Thewlis, who harmoniously combines harshness and brutality with the sensitivity and almost aristocratic good manners with which he moves among other criminals. Saffron Burrows is beautiful, and works great as a love interest. The rest of the cast just tries to keep up with the main actors.

On a technical level, the film does a truly brilliant job of building and controlling the environment... the film knows how to build and manipulate the dramatic tension, letting it build up as time goes by, until a climax where we feel the lack of control and the loss of the notion of reality experienced by the central character. The slightly blurry cinematography, with many of the scenes shot at night or in low-light places (bars, rundown apartments, etc.), or the personality of the character, which shatters) or that scene where the camera puts itself in the skin of a man about to be brutally murdered, and we end up being invited to feel that moment, the fragility and mental weakness that takes over. of a man facing death, certain and painful. The movie's speech is full of profanity and rude words, but that's something inevitable, given the movie that it is. However, I recognize that it is not a film for any audience, it is extremely violent and brutal. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, impeccable and very well conceived."

Carefully smuggled back to the mainland, the impoverished traveller has to make his own way to the city and with very few that he can trust to be loyal, he befriends the recently widowed “Nicole” (Iben Hjejle) and her young son “Gerard” (Tom Watson). Her late husband was to have been one of his contacts, and when it transpires that his replacement on St. Helena has decided not to play ball any longer, the emperor’s chances of regaining his throne look forlorn.

Can he forget that he was who he was, or will it frustrate and haunt him to he grave? Sir Ian delivers quite a touching performance here, speculating on just what might have happened if Napoleon had ever managed to secret himself from his luxurious prison. He learns to appreciate life from the perspective of the ordinary, war-weary, population who cared not for grand ambitions. They just wanted a roof over their heads and food on the table for their families. The burgeoning romance is delicately developed and there’s a good rapport between man and woman and also man and boy, too. There has been plenty of attention paid to the detail of the film and there is the odd bit of comedy interspersed through this story of longing. Not really for history buffs, not romantic ones either - but it’s an enjoyable piece of postulation from an an actor who knew his craft."

Well thought out from the beginning to the end. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! || Quaint comic book werewolf flick by Stephen King

RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Daniel Attias, ""Silver Bullet"" chronicles events in a small town in Eastern America when a ferocious werewolf starts picking people off one-by-one. Corey Haim and Megan Follows play the adolescent brother/sister protagonists, the boy being a paraplegic. Gary Busey appears as the amiable alcoholic uncle while Robin Groves plays the mother. Everett McGill is on hand as a prominent minister while Terry O'Quinn appears as the sheriff.

Stephen King wrote both the novella and the screenplay and so the movie has the comic book vibe of movies based on King’s works. The townspeople are unsurprisingly cartoonish, but the main family is well done, i.e. realistic. In any case, “Silver Bullet” seems quaint compared to the three werewolf flicks of 1981: “The Howling,” “An American Werewolf in London” and “Wolfen” (of course the latter wasn’t strictly a werewolf flick, if at all). Nevertheless, I appreciate the old fashioned take on the subject and the warmth of the family members. The werewolf is Grade B when fully revealed, but certainly formidable. 

The film conveys cinematic stereotypes, like the goodhearted drunk (or prostitute) and the corrupt civic leader, who puts on a fake smile for the community while being a savage beast within. Although there’s some truth to these depictions, most of the time a drunkard is an alcoholic because his/her heart is desperately flawed. And the bulk of respected community leaders aren’t evil incarnate. Yet I like the way the movie shows how everything is not necessarily as it appears.            

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in North Carolina (Burgaw, Leland, Wilmington, Castle Hayne and Carolina Beach). 

GRADE: B-/C+ || Like a children's horror movie that still has some **actual** horror, Busey chews up _Silver Bullet_ hard, because of course he does, but it was still pretty enjoyable. If you **are** feeling a retro sort a deal, I can recommend it, not strongly, but there's a mood you can be in where _Silver Bullet_ is much appreciated.

Hombre is directed by Martin Ritt and adapted to screenplay by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr from the Elmore Leonard novel. It stars Paul Newman, Richard Boone, Fredric March, Diane Cilento, Cameron Mitchell and Barbara Rush. Music is by David Rose and cinematography by James Wong Howe. Plot finds Newman as John Russell, a white man who has been raised by the Apache. Travelling on a stagecoach after collecting his inheritance, Russell finds himself ostracised by his fellow white travellers. That is until something goes wrong and the group find they now need Russell's skills in order to survive.

If it's all right with you lady, I just didn't feel like bleeding for him.

One of the best things about 1960s Westerns was that writers and directors were now more comfortable in portraying the Native Americans more honestly. Yes there were some excellent ones in the 50s as well, but as the 60s wore on things started to get more gritty, characterisations had a more daring depth to them and darker human thematics drove the narratives forward. One of the finest of the decade is Hombre, a literate and often bleak story that thrives on truisms as it spins off about racism, tolerance, corruption, selfishness, hypocrisy and vengeance. Crucially here the makers aren't just about kicking the white man for injustices against the Native Americans, Russell, too, is not being portrayed as a stoic, moral, defender of the Apache. He also has major flaws, his bile consistently rising, he's one cold fish. The film does indeed have a liberal slant, but it's also kinked in places and ultimately plays out as a complex morality piece, where it's to be noted that there's not much to like about any of the characters here, this really is down and dirty stuff.

You wagged your tail in the mans face and got his attention.

The dialogue is sparse, which suits the material and tonal flow perfectly, thus making all conversations there is is to be savoured. The script has intelligent barbs and rough edged ironies dotted within the exchanges, for the group dynamic is frayed from the off and Ravetch and Frank's script keeps the mood deliberately sombre. With Ritt unhurried and pacing it on the simmer, it's a film that begs to be heard and understood. Filmed in Panavision on location in the Coronado National Forest area and the Helvetia Mines in Pima County (a real ghost town), pic has a naturalised beauty that belies the tone of the story. Photographer James Wong Howe composes some striking images for the scenery and deals in memorable deep-focus shots for John Russell's telling moments. Howe, Ritt and Newman were a great team, four years earlier they had made Hud, with Ritt and Newman getting nominated for Academy Awards (Best Director/Actor respectively), and Howe winning for Best Cinematography (Black & White). Their understanding of each other is evident in Hombre, it's a lesson in how to get three of your key Western elements right (direction, photography and leading actor).

Cast are led superbly by Newman, piercing blue eyes with an icy cold demeanour, there's a boldness to the role that brings out a wonderfully simmering bitterness to Newman's acting. Perfect foil to Newman is Boone (The Tall T/Rio Conchos), who is nicely restrained in an uncouth bully boy role. Balsam (Psycho/Cape Fear) is one of the few character actors of the time who could get away with playing a Mexican without inducing cringes, and March (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde/A Star is Born) scores well in a two fold character portrayal of some shiftiness. Of the girls it's Cilento (Tom Jones) who leaves the lasting impression, she has Jessie as a lady not for turning, the character  has taken her knocks but ploughs on with strength of mind and a tongue as sharp as a tack. Rush (It Came from Outer Space/Bigger than Life) is the weak link, never once looking or sounding right in a Western setting, she compounds this by looking hopeless on a horse. A decent actress in the right genre, but an Oater? No way.

That gripe about Rush aside, this is a cracker of a Western. Not one for the all action guns a toting brigade for sure, but one for the adult who likes a bit of moody cranial splendour in their Western diets. 9/10
 || _**Die for our sins, dog-eater**_

Released in 1967 and directed by Martin Ritt, ""Hombre"" is a Western starring Paul Newman as John Russell, a white man raised by Apaches on a reservation and thus disdained by the ""respectable"" stagecoach passengers traveling with him. Perhaps they'll respect him when he becomes their only hope for survival. The driver & passengers are played by Martin Balsam, Diane Cilento, Richard Boone, Fredric March, Barbara Rush, Peter Lazer and Margaret Blye.

""Hombre"" is a gritty realistic mid-60s Western; a character study that stands the test of time. Seeing it today, it's hardly aged. Taken from Elmore Leonard's novel, the script effectively shows the illusion of high and low social standing: The proud are proud until uncontrollable events swiftly bring them to their faces; the decent are only decent until survival or lust can only be attained through indecency. This is a tale of survival and in the heat of life-or-death tribulation what's in one's heart comes to the fore.

People complain that the climax leaves a sour taste, but it ends the way it must (see below).

ADDITIONAL CAST: Skip Ward, Frank Silvera, David Canary, Val Avery and Larry Ward.

The film runs 111 minutes and was shot mostly in Arizona, but also a couple scenes in Jean, Nevada and Bell Ranch, California.

GRADE: A

FURTHER COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read until watching the movie)

John Russell tells the other passengers that they'll only survive their life or death situation by being very careful and shrewd. Ultimately, he decides to be UNcareful in order to save an unworthy uppity woman in response to Jessie's bold sympathy (at least she practiced what she preached). To survive, he relies on the inexperienced kid to take out the bandit while he shoots the main outlaw. Ironically, the kid's shot is blocked by the very woman Russell is trying to save.

When the dust settles, the survivors are all revealed as seriously flawed one way or another, whether venal (Fredric March), arrogant (Barbara Rush) weak (Martin Balsam), green (the kid), morally dubious (Margaret Blye) or liberally naïve (Diane Cilento). The end leaves them speechless as unworthy sinners in the face of unmerited grace through Russell's bold sacrifice. They represent the viewer, you & me: We can take the grace offered us and live a life worthy of it or put it out of mind and continue in our folly. It is every person's plight. || Before Riddick, there was Russell.
The similarities are obvious. Riddick of modern sci fi fame, is obviously based on Russell of Hombre.
Seven letters, starts with R, then a vowel, a double consonant, a vowel, and two consonants. The characters are totally alike. Both are definitive anti heroes to the max.
There have been three perfect models for anti heroes in films-Riddick, Russell, and Ethan of the Searchers.
They do what they must, and rules mean nothing. Fair fights are for Greek demigods with superiority complexes. 
John Russell (Paul Newman) is ""Hombre"". He quietly does what he does. He is a white man raised by Apaches and part of the Apache police.
He wants to settle down. He gets a rebuttal from a middle aged woman, about his age, and winds up on a stagecoach with her.
Also along is Martin Basalm, a meek and likable character who tries to get along with everyone.
And there are two villains on the coach. Three, if you count the young wife of the real villain of the movie. 
The second villain is the physically dangerous one, played by Richard Boone. He has a gang helping him rob the stage. One of the gang is the middle aged woman's ex lover, played by Cameron Mitchell.
But the real villain is played by Fred March. He does just a great snake oils job that many people forget he's the true villain. He plays an Indian agent who stole from the Indians and starved them. Richard Boone means to steal from him.
""Hombre"" strikes back, killing two of the gang immediately, including Cameron Mitchell. The other three race off with the evil villain's young wife, but Hombre has the money.
The other passengers go along with Hombre. He tries to ambush the remaining three bad guys while they come after the money, but his plan is foiled by a nervous Basalm. This is when he gets the nickname ""Hombre"", by a vaquero whom he wounds. The vaquero says ""Hombre, I will give this bullet back to you"".
There is a lot of wit going on. The vaquero actually hates the idea that he will have to either kill or be killed by Hombre, but it's his work. 
The most memorable line is the one that establishes Russell as the ultimate anti hero, when Richard Boone comes to talk to him under a white flag of truce, and then wants to return down a hill in safety.
This is a classic Western about credible characters in incredible circumstances, which is generally what makes a classic."

The sun and the moon change, but the army knows no seasons. 

The second instalment of the acclaimed John Ford cavalry trilogy had a lot to live up to after Fort Apache (1948). So it may not be too controversial to state that ""Yellow Ribbon"" doesn't quite achieve the potential promise that Fort Apache's foundation building had provided. However, here is still a mighty Western of many joys. 

The lead theme here is the passing of time, of time and love lost, lest we forget indeed. These themes give the film a strong emotional heartbeat from which to work from - even if on proviso it's noted that elsewhere there is not much in the way of an adrenalin pumping action extravaganza. Accepting it as an affecting character piece is something of a requisite if you want to get the most out of the viewing experience, and of course simultaneously getting wrapped up in the gifted art of film making in the process. 

John Wayne gives a top notch performance in what is obviously one of the first out and out serious roles that Ford gave him. His ageing Captain Nathan Brittles requires him to put in a very fallible human type of performance, something that he achieves in spades. He's a believable leader who is ruing the calling of time on his career in the service. Yet even Wayne's affecting turn is trumped by some of the most gorgeous cinematography you could wish to see from the 1940s. 

Winton Hoch clashed with Ford on the shoot about various perfections (both parties equally to blame of course), but the final result is incredible. Witness a scene as Brittles visits his dead wife's grave, the backdrop is all purple and red, a storm is imminent, metaphorically and in reality. Has shooting in the desert ever been so colourfully lush? The locations are breath takingly brought to vivid life, Monument Valley in all its glory.

Picture leaves an indelible mark on the conscious for the art and performances (Joanne Dru, Ben Johnson, Victor McLaglen & Harry Carey Jr bring their ""A"" game), but temper that slightly for as a story it just about gets by for dramatic purpose. Yet of course John Ford knows his onions and structures it accordingly, bringing precision and a genuine love of the genre and the material to hand. 8/10 || Approaching the end of his military career, ""Capt. Brittles"" (John Wayne) is charged with one final patrol whilst trying to reconcile two hormonal lieutenants who have the hots for the prim ""Miss Dandridge"" (Joanne Dru). One is from military gentry ""Pennell"" (Harry Carey Jr.) the other a more working man ""Cohill"" (John Agar) and she is having quite good fun playing the cat with two balls of wool. Just to compound his misfortunes, ""Brittles"" has to take this woman, and the major's feisty wife ""Abby"" (Mildred Natwick) on his tour too. Yikes, maybe the Apache would be a welcome relief from all these shenanigans. Perhaps not though, as it transpires that the Indians are very much on the warpath and it might not matter for very long for whom ""Dandridge"" wears her yellow ribbon. There's a solid cast here, as you'd expect from a John Ford who has pretty much assembled a team to follow his adventures through the genre with the Duke. Ben Johnson's confederate veteran ""Tyree"" as well as Victor McLaglen's mischievous top sergeant ""Quincannon"" and his cohort of fellow whiskey lovers all keep the film moving along entertainingly with plenty of action and just a little slapstick humour to raise a smile as Wayne continues to engagingly rule the roost."

Much like Jack Skellington and Bart Simpson, Stitch has struck an emotional chord with audiences. Aside from him being adorable, it also must have something to do with how Stitch, a being created to destroy, ends up being the missing link that brings a broken family together. There are times that Lilo & Stitch touches on dark subject matter. Lilo reminds me of many problem children that were misunderstood by parents, kids, and the system. But by the end, Lilo & Stitch will have you smiling by bringing you into a very happy place. || Cute film.

<em>'Lilo & Stitch'</em> is a short and straightforward production, but that doesn't stop it leaving a charming and hearty impression. It's actually rather impressive in that regard, you can't help but feel attached to the main characters.

Daveigh Chase (Lilo), Tia Carrere (Nani), David Ogden Stiers (Jumba), Kevin McDonald (Pleakley) and, obviously, Chris Sanders (Stitch) are very good. I love their respective voices. Even some of the minor characters, like Zoe Caldwell (Councilwoman), Kevin Michael Richardson (Capt. Gantu) and Ving Rhames (Bubbles), are memorable too. A real cool set.

Animation-wise it isn't actually sensational, undoubtedly pleasant, but not out of this world or anything. As for the music, who knew Elvis Presley's discography would fit so well? An inspired choice, it must be said.

Not at the top of my list of Disney animated films, but it's certainly in the 'best of the rest' bracket. You should definitely watch this, if you haven't already. || Ohana!

The year is 2054 and the murder rate in Washington is zero, the reason? Three Pre-Cognitives (each named after a literary great) whose combined abilities witness murders before they actually occur. Apparently faultless, it's then something of a surprise to Pre-Crime chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) when the Pre-Cogs predict he is to murder a man named Leo Crow. Forced to go on the run, and haunted by a family tragedy, Anderton must evade the system he so perfectly executed himself. Can he find a flaw? Or is he actually about to commit a murder?

Everybody Runs! That was the tag line that accompanied the explosive trailer for Steven Spielberg's, Tom Cruise starrer, Minority Report. This marketing tool indicated that the great bearded one had adapted from the Phillip K Dick short story and created an action monster? He hadn't, he had in fact created something far far better than popcorn fodder.

Minority Report was the next project for Spielberg following the equally dark and intriguing AI: Artificial Intelligence, both films serving to note that Spielberg was capable of thought provoking science fiction outside of the standard crowd pleasers that many critics love to decry. In fact, it's arguable that Spielberg may have hit his creative peak with Minority Report, for the messages and crawling dystopian bleakness on show paint a picture not so much as a future far away in our lives, but of one we live in now. Big thematic points of reference dot themselves throughout the piece. Such as the changing of eye balls, or that in these post 9/11 years we yearn, and always will, to be safer.

Here in this bleached shadowy world, a world of metallic tones and visual stings (ace cinematographer Janusz Kaminski on duty), we are safe under Pre-Crime. Yet still it's a world without soul, it has no heart, it's almost as if inhuman in itself, suggesting that the World's problems are not easily vanquished by technology - a total sacrifice of the World's inhabitant's souls. Spielberg of course is well served by the supreme professionals he has at his disposal, he has also managed to garner a great performance from Tom Cruise, something that critic and fan favourite directors have not managed to do previously. Believable grief, action work as strong as ever, it is however with his ability to imbue a tortured film noir protagonist where Cruise excels the most.

Alongside Cruise and operating with great impact are Samantha Morton as Pre-Cog Agatha and Max Von Sydow, the latter adding that touch of experienced know how needed for his particularly important character. The odd casting choice appeared to be Colin Farrell as the meddling, almost vindictive Danny Witwer, but he plays well off of Cruise, this even if he veers dangerously close to comic book villainy at times (check out a holy smoke Batman scene). What action there is is first rate, from a jet back pack pursuit, to car jumping heroics, the sequences are crafted with Spielberg's deft eye for an action sequence. While the sick sticks (yes you read right) metal spiders and a brilliant Peter Stormare cameo should hopefully have you squirming and grinning in equal measure.

Which brings us to the finale, an ending that may not be a complete surprise (yet it still doesn't cop-out in context to Anderton's tragedy), but things are rounded off in true classic noir tradition, where it closes down a thinking man's tech-noir. Superb. 9/10 || Works more on the strength of Spielberg than of Cruise.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || Really good movie. This is one of those movies where you really gotta pay attention to it to understand it fully. Great storyline too. I'm sure our world will eventually end up this way. Hope not though!"

This has all the hallmarks, and cast, of most typical Happy Madison productions, but with a lot of money involved, both in the characters and the production value.  I think this is the movie where John McEnroe started getting involved.

 The character work in this is either drastically good or drastically bad, and they definitely experimented with some ideas they had in the backlog.

The ""rags to riches"" trope crossed with the ""NYC is a cesspool of money corruption"" trope is actually inspired.  There is a great script in this movie, behind all the Sandler style humor, but that humor does make it fun, I just wish there was an adjustable setting sometimes.

There are no two without three, and after two films, a third was made to finish a trilogy that had already begun to derail in the second film. This film, in fact, was a desperate effort to recover from the bad step, but it ended up definitively burying any vain idea of a future fourth film. The film is weak, and if we compare it to its predecessors, it becomes even more tiring. The biggest problem is an erratic and poorly written script, but the weak and naked jokes also detract from the film, which never really captures our interest.

In this film, Mollie and James are taking care of two grown-up babies, but they face financial and marital difficulties from the moment she is fired and starts to stay at home, forcing James to accept the job offer of Samantha, a young and rich seductress who will try to break their marriage, leading to several jealousy fights and a climate of instability in the home. At the same time, they decide to adopt a street dog, who is the main protagonist of this film, and who will start talking to Samantha's poodle, in a funny rivalry relationship. As in any romantic comedy, it is predictable that everything will end well, between several twists and turns.

The cast continues to include John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, but both are shadows of what they were in the first film. There is virtually not a minute where they come close to the performance previously achieved. Both seem aware that this movie is a mistake and shouldn't have been made, or at least it shouldn't have been made the way it was made. The dogs' voice is provided by veterans Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton, and they try to do everything they can to defend their work, but the material they've been given is bad. Lysette Anthony just doesn't do more than be annoying.

Technically, it's as bland and uninteresting as the others: the cinematography doesn't bring anything new or particularly remarkable, and the sets and costumes are pretty much what we'd expect to find. The soundtrack is good enough, but it doesn't justify watching the movie at all."

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || _**Fun sequel, but not as good as the first one**_ 

Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith and Rip Torn return in this sequel about a secret government agency based in New York City that deals with extraterrestrial interactions on Earth.

Like the original 1997 movie, ""Men in Black II"" (2002) is amusing & thrilling in the first half, but loses its mojo a bit in the second half where some of the jokes fall flat. If you’ve seen the first film, there’s no need to see this one; but, if you want more with slight variations, then check it out. It’s the lesser movie, but it still fills the bill for when you’re in the mood for fun & thrilling popcorn entertainment.

On the female front, Linda Fiorentino is absent, replaced by Lara Flynn Boyle as the villain and Rosario Dawson as a pizzaria employee that catches Jay’s eyes. Meanwhile, the stunning Paige Brooks appears in a couple of small scenes.

The next two sequels are: Men in Black 3” (2012) and “Men in Black: International” (2019); the latter is the only entry in the series (so far) without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.

The film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot in New York City & surrounding area (e.g. Fire Island for the Post Office scene), as well as Los Angeles/Culver City/Pasadena.

The former girl has an absentee (pilot) father and a mother who is great fun - so long as she can pop a valium or two.

Gradually, though, the penny drops for ""Holly"" as she realises that her own life is being subsumed into that of her friend. They even end up sharing blokes, wittingly and otherwise. The challenge for ""Holly"" now is how to assert herself and live her own life without her mate doing her own version of the Hindenburg. It's quite wittily poignant at times, but the inherently repetitive nature of the frying pan to fire scenarios and the unlikable nature of both of these women didn't really do it many favours as it trundles along. In principle, it addresses the complexities of addiction - not just booze and pills, but for an affection not just related to sex. In practice, though, it's a messy and incomplete analysis of two uninteresting people surrounded by men who all seemed to deserve each other. There's also far too much dialogue and after a while it just starts to fade into a background of mediocrity with the rest of this. Not for me, sorry."

Dormant fire-breathing dragons are awoken in subterranean chambers and proceed to unleash hell on earth. Almost two decades later a group of survivors led by Quinn (Christian Bale) live underground in England when American militants pay them a visit, led by seeming-psycho Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey). It seems they have a strategy to slay the dragons once-and-for-all.  Izabella Scorupco plays the woman stuck between the two rival leaders.   

""Reign of Fire"" (2002) is similar to the Mad Max films, but without the comic book goofiness. This is a solemn, grey tale with a quality cast, convincing sets/costumes and surprisingly effective CGI. I gained greater respect for McConaughey as he is unrecognizable as the bald combative and loses himself in the role. Unfortunately, the storytelling is weak. It’s just not that compelling, which isn’t helped by the mumbled dialogue and ambiguities. Still, if you can adapt to the viewer-unfriendly style, there’s a lot to appreciate here.   

The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes and was shot in Ireland. 

GRADE: B-/C+ || **Reign of Fire might not have a robust deep story, but it’s still a solid post-apocalyptic sci-fi adventure with an impressive cast and great action.**

Reign of Fire collects Batman, Leonidas, a Bond Girl, and a crazed Matthew McConaughey and throws them headlong into a charred, barren post-apocalyptic world covered in the ash of millions of unstoppable hungry dragons. Critics savaged this movie with its harsh reviews, and if you expect an action sci-fi film about fighting dragons to win an Oscar, you will be disappointed. But if you embrace the movie for what it is, a fun action movie with a surprisingly good cast, pretty solid special effects for being 20 years old, and a simple but entertaining plot, then you will be more than satisfied. Christian Bale plays to his strengths as an intense but caring hero, while McConaughey goes full insane soldier dragon slayer in one of his more ridiculous roles but is also one of my favorites. Reign of Fire won no awards, but that doesn’t mean it can’t entertain and warm your heart (ha, get it? 🐉 😉). || Watchable I guess but a pretty lackluster fantasy-actioner that's more noteworthy for a cast that includes Matthew McConaughey, Christian Bale and Gerard Butler. Beyond that it's also a really ugly looking film void of pretty much any color. Not one I have any desire to revisit. **2.75/5**"

When his son witnesses him enacting a hit, mob enforcer Michael Sullivan finds that the man whom he likened to a father has ordered a hit on him and his family. Too late to save his wife and youngest child, Sullivan goes on the run with his eldest boy and plots revenge along the way.

How refreshing to find a gangster movie in the modern age, more so, how refreshing to find a gangster movie set in the early 1930s and not involving foul mouthed Mafioso types. Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig and Jude Law, Road To Perdition is an adaptation of the Graphic Novel that was brought to us by Max Allan Collins & Richard Piers Rayner. The film deals with themes of violence and its consequences and fathers and sons, set to a watery back drop during the Great Depression. It's also a pulse pinging treat of visual magnificence thanks to cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (his last film before he passed away). 

Comparisons with great gangster film's of the past are inevitable, but Mendes' film has more in common with something like ""Eastwood's Unforgiven"" and ""John Ford's The Searchers"", the journey of the lead protagonist is fraught and telling, and motivated by circumstance. Yet the trick for first time viewers that Road To Perdition has up its sleeve, is that we don't know how it will work out for Hanks' Sullivan. It makes for a riveting experience with many transcendent rewards along the way.

As regards the cast, Hanks is a touch miscast, but his play off relationship with the quite terrific Newman gives the film some solid ground from which to launch the sombre story. Daniel Craig does a nifty line in weasel and Law convinces as a mouldy toothed hired killer who enjoys taking photographs of his victims. Pic has almost philosophical mediations on good and bad, and it's elegiacally drawn by Mendes. The melancholic mood is enhanced by Thomas Newman's musical score, where he reworks his ""Shawshank Redemption"" score for narrative tightness. 

The film thrives as a poetic and atmospheric piece. The story might be basic, but it manages to rise above that because it be a superbly directed and well acted picture. One that just happens to be beautiful in spite of the bleakness that lingers on the main protagonist and the journey he undertakes. 8/10 || **Overall : With so much going for it, The Road to Perdition is surprisingly disappointing.**

After hearing Road to Perdition referred to as a classic multiple times, I was interested. Then seeing that it boasted a cast of Tom Hanks, Daniel Craig, and Stanley Tucci and that Sam Mendes directed it, I was even more intrigued. Finally, after seeing the trailer and its promise of some cool action scenes, I was excited to watch this movie! But sadly, The Road to Perdition greatly disappointed. I will be honest and say that this isn’t a typical movie I enjoy, but the film was long and very slow. The action scenes were few and far between, with almost every second of action showcased in the trailers. The ending didn’t surprise and left me even more frustrated as I watched the entire film. Not a fan. || One should bear in mind that this is basically a mafia movie. I say that because it is presented almost as a dramatic coming of age story, which implies a different sort of story altogether. I mean, there is the coming of age element to it, but it is a brutal, violent film true to its mafia roots. For example, father and son feature strongly throughout, with details, backgrounds and character development. Mom and the brother are more like undeveloped pawns in the story.

The settings and photography are excellent, nearly worth watching the movie all by itself. I am not sure Tom Hanks is quite up to his usual high standard here, but it may be exactly what the director was looking for.

I must day that once father and son stopped at a house for assistance, I knew how the movie would end, being a mini-morality tale and all, but I write novels in my spare time, so I am used to thinking about ending variations. The film would not make any of my top 10 lists, but I am glad to have watched this focused, atmospheric slice of noir."

20 Million Miles to Earth is written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight. The film was produced by Charles H. Schneer's Morningside Productions for Columbia Pictures and directed by Nathan H. Juran. It stars William Hopper, Joan Taylor, Frank Puglia and a Ymir, a creation by stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen.

The plot sees an American rocket ship on its return from a mission to Venus, crash land in the Mediterranean Sea near the Sicilian village of Gerra. Some fishermen aid the stricken ship and manage to pull free two survivors, Colonel Bob Calder and Dr. Sharman. Once Calder recovers it becomes known that an important canister brought from Venus has not been found after the crash. However, Pepe, a young fisher-boy who was present at the rescue, found the container and sold its rubbery contents to his Zoologist friend Dr. Leonardo. Whilst in the hands of Dr. Leonardo the gelatin like substance gives birth to a tiny Venusian bipedal creature called a Ymir, but it doesn't stay tiny for very long...

As the work of Dynamation legend Harryhausen got more accomplished and praised, it became a standing joke that his creatures were better actors than most of their adult co-stars. That's never more truer than with 20 Million Miles to Earth, where one of his best creations takes centre stage and acts the actors off the screen. It's also true that some, not all, of Harryhausen influenced movies are just thin clothes lines to hang his work upon. Thankfully that isn't the case here, for although it's homage a go go to King Kong, where Harryhausen hero Willis O'Brien pioneered the stop-motion process, Juran's movie has intelligence within its on the surface monster on the rampage plot.

There's nothing totally new in this genre piece about mans pursuit of more via technological advancement, the unremitting pursuit of science as a tool or plaything. So where Jeff Goldblum mused in Jurassic Park many years later, about that nobody stopped to ask if they should be tampering with science and nature, so it be here. Where the Ymir creature is whipped from its home planet, starts off harmless, afraid, puzzled and very much a stranger in a strange land, yet is provoked into an aggressive state. This even after we are told that the Ymir only attacks if being attacked first, cue next scene as man who said it starts poking confused creature with a big pole! You would laugh if it were it not so adroitly cunning.

Not only does the big question of ""why?"" loom large as things spiral out of control here in Italy, but animal rights are also given a poke, as is a nice thread as regards guns. It's just too cute not to mean something as Pepe, quite the capitalist indeed, wants to be an American cowboy. Buying himself a Texas hat he happily starts clicking away with his toy guns like some Western cowboy of the silver screen. You just know what is around the corner, soon enough the mighty army are throwing everything at poor Ymir, guns, tanks, bazookas, flame throwers, you name it and the mighty military are using it. America flexes its weaponry muscles on foreign soil, indeed. Against something that they are responsible for being here in the first place! You would laugh if it wee not so cunning...

Of course the trump card here is the creature itself because it shows a number of basic emotions. Harryhausen works his magic as Ymir goes through the various stages of its sad stay on Earth. From its brilliant birthing sequence where it rubs its eyes and shies away from the light, to the rousing finale at the Colosseum where rage and anger has fully taken over as the creature fights for its life; on a planet it doesn't know or wanted to be on anyway. This ""thing"" may eat Sulphur, but it has one hell of a personality thanks to Ray, who sat at his table for days on end creating these wonderful sequences for us to enjoy. Letting the creature breath, flick its tale and wrestle other animals. Quite a character indeed.

No personalities with the human cast though, Hopper (son of actress and gossip columnist, Hedda) is lantern jawed adequate enough for the role, and Taylor is pretty but playing a totally perfunctory character. While the Italian characters are as stereotypical as they come. But just like King Kong, 20 Million Miles to Earth has many fans who just adore it. More so now as advancements in DVD technology have seen remastered releases (even with a colour choice that's not bad at all) reach a new and interested audience. A fine fine film that rises above its failings due to a wizard at his work table and some brainy cheekiness from the writers. 7.5/10"

Anthony Asquith has created a delightfully honest interpretation of the play - the dialogue is pithy and quickly paced, few lines are wasted and the talents of Michael Redgrave, Michael Denison, Dorothy Tutin, the perfectly cast Joan Greenwood as ""Gwendoline"" and Margaret Rutherford as the prim ""Miss Prism"" combine to give us a genuinely laugh-out-loud series of scenarios that are a joy to behold. It's colourfully set, the costumes a delight (though, I felt seriously gaudy at times!) and the comically timed mannerisms, gestures and charisma of the performers is great, too. It is rare for a piece of theatrical comedy to transfer so effortlessly to the big screen, but here it all looks so very natural..."

...Somehow still less dumb than _Halloween 6_.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || _**Serviceable, but pedestrian and comic booky entry**_

Several college youths agree to be part of a reality TV show where they stay in the dilapidated Myers’ residence in Haddonfield, Illinois. Unbeknownst to them, Michael is still alive and has returned to his home town after stopping by the asylum to visit Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). 

""Halloween Resurrection"" (2002) is the seventh installment of the Michael Myers saga (not counting the unrelated “Season of the Witch”) and is the final film in the series until the remakes. It gets a lot of hate because of what happens in the opening act and the inclusion of Busta Rhymes, but it’s serviceable and definitely superior to the lousy “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995). It’s just kinda unimaginative and cartoonish with several bits being hackneyed or predictable by this point.  

The feminine department includes Daisy McCrackin (Donna), Katee Sackhoff (Jen), Bianca Kajlich (Sara), and Tyra Banks (Nora). The beautiful women wandering around a rundown domicile and dying one-by-one is reminiscent of “Death Tunnel” (2005) but without the amazing cinematic artistry (even though it cost $11.5 million MORE), not to mention “Death Tunnel” has better women.

""Halloween 4"" (1988) is easily the most entertaining of the original series, followed by ""Halloween 5"" (1989) and “H20” (1998).

The movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot mostly in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area with the Hillcrest Academy sequence done at Silver Lake, Los Angeles.

Spiders escape from a spider farm in Prosperity, Arizona, and become giant man eating beasts on account of toxic waste carelessly dumped in a near by river. Can the odd ball inhabitants of this Arizona town escape with their lives? Or will spiders rule the earth and lay waste to man kind?

Eight Legged Freaks is unashamedly homaging B movie creature features from the 1950s. The likes of Tarantula and Them! have their Pedipalps well and truly watered, in what is possibly the most undervalued of all the modern day creature feature homages. Having no pretensions what so ever, the only real thing not in ""Freaks"" favour is the usage of CGI, but even that doesn't hurt the film, if anything it adds to the obvious preposterous nature of the genre. I mean how else are we to get 20 foot jumping spiders chowing down on some annoying teenager?

Perhaps ""Freaks"" is viewed harsh because the cast is relatively C list? Again that is a genre staple, surely? For what it's worth I think they do real fine, David Arquette has oodles of goofy charisma, Kari Wuher makes a fine female ass kicker, and the kids (one a young Scarlett Johansen) are really rather cool. Director Ellory Elkayem, who after doing They Nest in 2000 clearly has bug issues, adheres to genre staples. Kooky western town out in the desert, the inhabitants of which range from near loonies to dopey politicians, and the plot follows the traditional sense of impending doom played for laughs. Listen out for the score from John Ottman, which plays on variants of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"", whilst cast a keen eye on John S. Bartley's Arizona camera work.

Whilst not having the savvy scripting of homage daddy, Tremors, or the star appeal of 1990's Arachnophobia, Eight Legged Freaks deserves its place amongst such fun and creepy company. As the tag line says, ""Do you hate spiders? Do you really hate spiders? Well they don't like you either"". With that, I think it's web well and truly spun, don't you? 7/10"

Like Gorky Park, which had two late greats in Will Hurt and Brian Dennehy, K-19 gravitates around two solid performers: Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson in the Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster/Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington roles from RS, RD and Crimson Tide, respectively (also like Gorky Park, there is no trace of Russian other than what can be read here and there; the fact that everyone here speaks the same language all the time, even if it’s that which would be anathema to them, allows us to suspend our disbelief and pretend they’re all speaking Russian to each other).

Actually, there is a third, just as important, performance: the titular submarine emerges (and submerges) as a character in its own right; the problem is that it doesn’t do its own stunts. While it’s still in dock, it’s easy to believe in the boat’s reality and all that it entails; once it goes underwater, however, it also goes belly up. Like the Tom Hanks vehicle Greyhound from a couple of years ago, K-19 is at its best when the action stays in the vessel – and for a film where there are a lot of drills, this one is packed with tension and suspense.

The ‘exterior’ shots, on the other hand, makes us long for the claustrophobia of the sub’s narrow walkways. The worst offender is the scene in which Ford orders a very dangerous maneuver (and that’s saying something, seeing how Neeson keeps “recommending” him that they remain “at safe depth”) that culminates in the K-19 bursting through the Arctic pack ice. This sequence reminded me, believe it or not, of The Silence of the Lambs; specifically, the part with the crosscutting (you know the one I mean).

In that movie, parallel editing led us to believe that two separate events were closely related; in K-19, though, we have the opposite: two closely related events – the sub breaking trough the ice and the crew holding on for dear life – give the impression of occurring worlds apart from each other, because while the people come across as real human beings, the ice and the sub suffer from a pervading Saturday Morning Cartoon quality; i.e., they are shoddy as all hell. 

All things considered, this is nonetheless a minor yet not altogether unsuccessful incursion from director Kathryn Bigelow on the kind of usually testosterone-laden genre that even on an off day she does better than many a male filmmaker. || A rather clunky cold-war maritime thriller that manages to mix plausible science with shallow propaganda in a rather cack-handed fashion - and a (mis)casting that gives the film the same sinking feeling that the submarine must have felt when it first put to sea. It's a synch that the 2-kopeck systems aboard this state of the art Russian boat ""K-19"" are going to cause the maiden voyage to be riddled with dangers, and Captain Harrison Ford who blindly believes that nothing can possibly go wrong both before and after the boat sets sail leads to loads of crew resentment - not least from Executive Officer Liam Neeson - who all see him as a sort of ""Captain Bligh"" figure. Technically, the film does evoke a genuine sense of peril and claustrophobia, but the stars don't really have enough to work with beyond their very two-dimensional characterisations and the sight of John Shrapnel (whose son Lex also features) as a Soviet Admiral is verging on the risible. It has moments of pace, and jeopardy - but they are few and far between and more than nullified by the rather dodgy CGI and really pedestrian script."

I enjoyed the star-studded and cameo-filled opening scene, it's well done. Mike Myers is again great in his roles, especially Dr. Evil, and Beyoncé Knowles is a positive addition. The stuff with Dr. Evil isn't as good as in the 1999 film, yet he still made me laugh a few times; he does have one of the series' best moments with the rendition of the Jay-Z song.

However, I did feel a few pacing issues. All in all, it's still worth a watch. As noted, the cameos are solid - and let's just say they chose the perfect actor to play Dr. Evil... || **Austin Powers' inglorious end... so far.**

I can't deny that Austin Powers was a landmark franchise for late '90s humor cinema, but the truth is that this film, like its immediate predecessor, isn't funny at all. Here, the script is based on a new conspiracy by Dr. Evil, this time in harmony with a Dutchman fascinated by gold, who wants all the gold he can hoard. So that the English spy doesn't get in his way, he kidnapped and had Powers' father killed.

The script is very weak, has worn-out premises and works, in practice, as a parody of the third film in the Bond franchise. If that was any success initially, in this case it doesn't seem like enough for the movie to work. In addition, the conception of the vast majority of characters is unfortunate because it is very underdeveloped, the writing is terrible and the dialogues horrible, and everything seems just an excuse for an avalanche of jokes. Also, there are characters here that don't really have to be here, like Fat Bastard.

Mike Myers continues to play several characters, in a very intense and truly well-executed role-playing exercise; he tries everything to make his film work, and invests his talent in a truly remarkable way. However, if the recipe no longer works, the actor's effort and talent are simply being wasted. In addition, there are other actors with an equally positive record, such as Verne Troyer, Michael Caine or Beyoncé. The rest hardly matters, and I prefer not to mention the large amount of unnecessary cameos from a series of artists, models and singers. Seeing so many stars appear just for the hell of it doesn't make any sense and gives the film an irritating sense of smugness.

Technically, there are some features that I want to point out, namely the visuals and specials, with Myers playing opposite himself in many occasions and scenes, and the excellent sets and costumes. Unfortunately, the film has a very fast pace and the editing was not very happy, but what is really needed here is some really effective humor, because if the film's formula already seems worn out, the humor of the successive jokes is non-existent. || Flat out garbage of a movie. Pure waste of time. The only reason I rated it a 4 is because there were some funny parts. Overall bad movie though."

He doles out his lusts left, right and centre upon the innocent, spreading plague and disaster wherever he goes, but he too is cursed. By his own immortality, by his search for some kind of fulfilment or contentedness. This isn't a depiction riddled with sharp teeth and ketchup, it's much more subtle, refined even, telling of a character that it's almost impossible not to feel sorry for.

""In Like Flint"" (1967) is a mid-60’s spy send-up in the manner of the Matt Helm flicks and “Fathom.” It’s not an outrageous spoof, like the TV show Get Smart, but takes the relatively low-key route. Everything is here for a quality movie of this sort, including loads of 60’s babes, but the story isn’t compelling and the creators didn’t seem to know how to take advantage of their feminine resources (not talkin’ ’bout nudity or sleaze). 

This was the second in the Flint series after “Our Man Flint” from the previous year, but the slashed budget and tiresome story put the kibosh on the franchise. It’s still worth checking out though for a few amusing scenes and the authentic mid-60’s ambiance (authentic because that’s when it was made). Coburn was certainly the king of cool at the time and it wasn’t his fault the script & general filmmaking were below par. 

The film is overlong at 1 hour, 54 minutes. It was shot in Jamaica (Montego Bay & Dunn's River Falls) and Los Angeles (Century City & Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant).

Coming back from the Crusades, Robin Hood and Little John (Sean Connery and Nicol Williamson) are still serving under King Richard the Lionhearted (Richard Harris) in France before finally making it back to England and reuniting with Marian (Audrey Hepburn) and their old nemesis the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw).   

Directed by Richard Lester, ""Robin and Marian"" (1976) has an odd tone, combining the brutal realities of Medieval Europe with subtle humor and nobility. The fun element is low-key and meshed with melancholy, but such ‘dark comedy’ is lost on many today (even I had to acclimate). However, if you think about it, the blockbuster “Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves” (1991) had a similar mixed tone. 

In any case, the movie emphasizes the betrayal of aging; how the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Past glories and past loves are yearned for, but the passing decades have changed everything forever. On top of this, you get real-life castles, authentic Medieval garb and a great, realistic swordfight between two aging men before the controversial close (controversial to others, not me). 

Pompous King Richard’s shocking atrocities in the opening act are contrasted by the Sheriff of Nottingham (Shaw), who has mellowed with age and has leaned something of compassion and respect.  He’s older and wiser now, less disposed to unfair treatment. His present reign seems to be rather benign and not overly oppressive. He has a limp along with the generally slower movement that comes with age. When he comes to the edge of Sherwood Forest with his small army his strategy is to wait Robin Hood out for surrender, presumably to spare Robin's life and allow his followers to simply go back to their farms or what have you. This is a welcome surprise and shows that this is not just Sean Connery’s movie, but Shaw’s as well. Notice how, after a prayer in the field before their mano a mano duel, Robin assists the Sheriff to his feet before they begin.

Concerning King Richard, his fate in the movie is similar to the way it went down in real life, except that it was by a vengeful boy using a crossbow and, like in the film, he was using a frying pan for a shield. The kid’s name was Pierre Basile and the incident happened at the siege of Châlus-Charbrol in central France on March 26, 1199. Although Richard generously forgave him and set him free, he was flayed alive the day Richard passed away on April 6, 1199 at the order of Richard’s infamous mercenary captain Mercadier.

This rendition of Robin Hood features perhaps the best depiction of Little John by Nicol Williamson, at least as far as getting to know the character and caring about him. You’ll note that he too loves Marian, albeit secretly. Speaking of Marian, this was Hepburn’s first film in almost a decade after taking a break to raise her family.

If you appreciate “Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves” or “Robin Hood” (2010), be sure to check this one out as it’s a quality interpretation of Robin in his older years. True, Connery was only 45 years-old during shooting and Russell Crowe was the same age when he did his version, but 45 was fairly old in Medieval times. The only negatives are the aforementioned curious tone, which you have to get used to, and the lack of lushness in the locales, which betrays that the flick was not shot in England.

The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in the Navarra region of northeastern Spain and Villalonso, Zamora, Castilla y León in northwestern Spain.

GRADE: B+ || I didn’t really appreciate this film when I was younger. I much preferred the colourful flourishing of Errol Flynn and Michael Curtiz’s take on the Robin Hood legend and found this a bit slow. Now, though, I actually rather like this interpretation of just how this folk legend might have aged after his return from the crusades. It’s on those travels that the impetuous and frequently boozed-up King Richard (Richard Harris) falls foul of a rogue arrow and so when Robin (Sean Connery) returns to an England in the hands of King John, he finds that the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw) is still ruling the roost and the Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) has taken her vows. With the Sheriff bent on arresting her, Robin arrives just in the nick of time to rescue her from his clutches and so reinvigorate their old rivalry. Marian isn’t best pleased with her erstwhile Romeo, so some prickly antics ensue between the pair as he starts to reassemble what’s left of his brigade of Lincoln green-clad warrior-pensioners before the sheriff and his equally aged men force battle upon them. There’s quite an entertaining sarcasm to some of the script, a stocism that quite nicely sums up the drawbacks of the ageing process and the denouement shows that both Connery and Shaw seem quite enthusiastic about portraying characters in need of as many surgical supports as 12th century medicine could provide. Despite it’s sometimes almost slapstick approach, it has a certain grace to it as these rivals acknowledge a grudging respect for each other and as Hepburn’s feisty nun looks more like a role her namesake Katharine might have delivered. There’s a solid supporting cast to help keep it moving along and there’s enough geriatric swash and buckle - with the emphasis more on the latter, to keep this entertaining. Growing old graciously is over-rated, clearly!"

Night Shyamalan","farm, faith, symbolism, miracle, family relationships, alien, grief, rural area, alien invasion, crop circle, alien attack, death of wife, loss of faith, alien encounter, anxious, suspenseful, foreboding","_**Is it really about aliens?**_

M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" (2002) is about a disillusioned ex-minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son & daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in their cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion!

Although the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: (1) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And (2) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.

The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give-in to the former.

This is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.

Many people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).

**SPOILER ALERT** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

It's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the ""father of lies"".

There are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called ""the prince of the power of the air"" in the bible). The ""aliens"" look decidedly demonic and have cloven hoofs. The “primitive method” of repelling the aliens is discovered in “three cities the Middle East” and is holy water, which is ordinarily used by Catholic & Episcopal exorcists against demonic manifestations (Shyamalan, by the way, attended Catholic & Episcopal schools). The daughter, Bo, was said to be a ""gift from God"" who is sensitive to impure (unholy) water. Her name in Old Norse means ""to live"" and she was able to discern the weapon of life needed to defeat the demonic menace. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. The crop circle in the Hess cornfield resembles a pitchfork. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God in order to converse. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the ""aliens"" are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.

Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.

Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The ""alien"" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet after the death of the minister's wife.

Keep in mind that when the film debuted, Shyamalan was known as the king of the plot twist, yet the revelation that the aliens’ weakness is water wasn’t exactly a mind-blowing turn seeing as how the earth is 71% water and technologically advanced aliens who can travel the galaxy would know this. Moreover, the aliens curiously have no physical weapons and are easily trapped by a pantry door. It stands to reason that Shyamalan hid the twist in the movie. That twist is that the aliens are really demonic in nature.

I'm not saying you can't view the movie as a literal extra-terrestrial invasion flick, but rather that the underlying demonic reading is a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together and links to the story arc of the disillusioned ex-minister finding redemption. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a quality Shyamalan film and is about on par with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village.”

The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.

GRADE: B+ || Not my favorite M. Night Shyamalan film. Also not my least favorite... || It's barely over an hour and a half this film, but it seems much longer. Mel Gibson (""Graham"") is a widowed former pastor who lives on a farm with his two kids ""Morgan"" (Rory Culkin) and ""Bo"" (Abigail Breslin) and his brother ""Merrill"" (Joaquin Phoenix). Their lives are all rolling along normally until one morning they discover some crop circles amongst the corn fields. Dismissing them as hoaxes, they are intrigued when television reports suggest a proliferation of these things all around the world. Now add to their now heightened suspicions some late night noises and mysterious happenings, and the family begin to suspect that they are being watched - and that their observer is not exactly benign. The last ten minutes or so redeem this story to a degree, but for the most part it is a terribly slow burn of a film. There isn't really much by way of action; Gibson and Phoenix don't really exude much of a compelling sibling relationship and the kids - usually a crucial conduit for M. Night Shyamalan stories have much less to work with here. This has more of the melodrama to it - the backstory of tragedy and grief all gets in the way of the gradually increasing sense of menace and I found the whole momentum of the story quite staccato. This is an adequate film, but it is definitely nobody's best work."

Recovering from a heart transplant, a retired FBI profiler (Clint Eastwood) takes a case as a private investigator because of his amazing link to one of the victims. Jeff Daniels plays his amusing neighbor, a dock bum, while Wanda De Jesus appears as his potential girlfriend.

“Blood Work” (2002) was based on a Michael Connelly novel and his corresponding protagonist, Terry McCaleb, but the movie comes across as Dirty Harry’s final case after retirement, sorta like “Gran Torino” (2008) was akin to “Dirty Harry, the Golden Years.” 

Eastwood was 71 during shooting, but his character is roughly eight years younger and he pulls it off. I point this out to stress that he’s no longer kick-axx Dirty Harry. This is an aged, retired and recovering detective working on what is likely his last case. A lot of dialog is devoted to emphasizing how over-the-hill he is and how horrible he looks.

So, while this is a gritty big city detective flick in the mold of Dirty Harry, it’s way more subdued and mature. It’s more dramatic and less compelling. If you can roll with that, it’s a decent detective movie. It’s relatively realistic until the ending, which features a twist that I didn’t foresee (although others say they did). The climax is unlikely and smacks of a typical Hollywood ending. “A Simple Plan” (1998) did the same thing: a believable story that takes a “Yeah, right” turn at the close.

The film runs 1 hour, 50 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area. Anjelica Huston also appears as a doctor while Paul Rodriguez is on hand as a cranky Hispanic detective.

GRADE: C+/B- || Good entertainment.

I like the plot of <em>'Blood Work'</em>. I'm unsure if it would hold up if you went through with a fine-tooth comb, but it certainly gave me the required enjoyment levels. Clint Eastwood gives a sturdy performance, as do Jeff Daniels and Wanda De Jesus; elsewhere on the cast, neat to see Anjelica Huston and Rick Hoffman, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_characters#:~:text=Faye%20to%20leave.-,Louis%20Litt,-%5Bedit%5D"" rel=""nofollow"">Louis Litt</a> himself, appear in smaller roles.

It's a little silly, but it's fine for an action comedy.  The only weird thing, really was setting on Luna.  Having on the its moon instead of on Terra didn't really add a lot to the movie except to facilitate a flimsy backstory and some scenes where people required environmental suits, and that had little payoff.

The benefits of being a sci-fi action comedy is to have laser effects for the blasters, and androids, which are used to various levels of humor.  

Eddie Murphy is great, and he plays well with Rosario Dawson, and if nothing else, you have to admit Randy Quaid is funny: the character would have been much different in someone else's hands.  I'll have to admit I thought it was Terry O'Quinn (""Lost"": John Locke), which made even funnier at the time, but it's a good job done.

Norman Jewison and William Harrison expand Harrison’s short story into a full length feature film, with great results. Story takes place in 2018 and the world is a global corporate state, a hegemony of six ruling cartels. There are no wars, poverty and etc, so the cartels provide the antidote to pent up frustrations with Rollerball, a bloodthirsty arena sport where no quarter is given or taken. But when the sports number one star, Jonathan E, becomes a free spirit and too big for the sport, the corporations aim to retire him…

Headed by a superb James Caan as Jonathan, the performances are from the high end, the photography superb and the action during the games themselves is beautifully choreographed. The use of classical music to run concurrent with the themes in the narrative is smartly rendered to the tricksy plot, while the writing is sharp and deserving of the utmost attention from the viewer. It’s folly to suggest that when the film is away from the Rollerball ring it sags a touch, so patience is required and a respect of literate posturing is also expected to get the most out of it.

Dominant and popular, the crowd love him - but his boss ""Bartholomew"" (John Houseman) tells him it's time to retire. Their world is run by big corporations and these are not to be readily defied - but ""Jonathan"" isn't going to play ball. He is not going to sacrifice his fame, fortune and adulation without exacting some conditions of his own. One of which is that he be reunited by his wife (Maud Adams) who was apparently ""reallocated"" at the behest of another company bigwig. He also tries to find out just who is behind his dismissal - and why, and luckily has the help of ""Cletus"" (Moses Gunn) on that particular quest as his options narrow and ""Bartholomew"" becomes ever so slightly more menacing. The action scenes with the ball and skaters racing around the track is quite scintillating to watch with intense photography and plenty of high-speed tumbles, but the rest of it is all sort of ""Logan's Run"" with an Houseman who really only knew how to play one role. That worked well in the ""Paper Chase"" (1973) but here, it's just a bit underwhelming. Caan puts his heart and soul into the story, but there are too many holes in that to resonate beyond the obvious and rather undercooked swipe at a sterile authoritarianism that reminds us of the Nero and the Coliseum style of entertainment for the obedient (or else!) masses.

Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake co-star as Anne Marie's surfing friends.

""Blue Crush"" (2002) is a 'sports film' in the manner of ""Karate Kid"" and a host of others. Although some of these movies go the comedy route -- e.g. ""Cloud 9"" and ""Bad News Bears"" -- ""Crush"" is a serious drama with fun flashes.

Filmed on the beaches/resorts of O'ahu, Hawaii, this is a beautiful and exhilarating film to watch, the perfect remedy if the weather in your area has been dreary.

There's no profanity, raunch or t&a exploitation but, to be expected, the film features some good-looking women in swimwear throughout. By ""good-looking"" I mean realistically so, not like Baywatch.

For the first hour the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, nothing great but moderately entertaining for this type of flick, and then something happened at the the 58-minute mark that struck a chord. Anne Marie hits the waves with her friend (Rodriquez) to prepare for the Pipeline Masters as we hear the song ""Youth of the Nation"" by P.O.D. This sequence touched me for some reason. The music & lyrics are emotionally potent and effectively set the tone for the remainder of the film.

""Youth of the Nation"" exemplifies the zeitgeist of the new millennium much as ""My Generation"" represents the mid-60s and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" typifies the 90s. Everyone's heard the song by now but if you're not sure go to Youtube and listen to it with lyrics; it's a standout piece, including the heartrending lyrics. It's reality.

For me, the film's just compelling enough to give a marginal thumbs up. Fans of surfing and Bosworth (or any of the other actors) will appreciate ""Blue Crush"" more than me. But I was moved by the above musical interlude and one other thing...

What affected me most is the picture of the three maids, impoverished and disdained by the snobs but full of youthful zeal and hope. It strangely reminded me of something I experienced on my last trip to Southern California. I was leaving the last showing of a theater late at night and spied the janitorial crew coming in to clean with their mops & buckets. They were Mexicans, mostly young, and possibly illegal aliens. Everyone walked by them as if they were invisible, like they were the scum of society or something. But I made a point to acknowledge them and smile. I don't feel I deserve a medal for this or anything; it's just that I made a decision long ago that, no matter how far I go in life, I'm not going to look down on or ignore those in a more modest position. Why? I don't know, maybe because I'M scum.

As great as Robin Williams' comedy is, I like the idea of seeing the guy act more serious - and he certainly did so in this 2002 release! The film starts are very strongly, I really enjoyed the vibe that was building. Williams plays a creepy character very well, while the rest of the cast - namely Connie Nielsen - support ably.

The movie does a drag a tiny bit the longer it goes on, despite only having a run time of around 90 minutes, and the conclusion didn't have as much of an impact as it should've. Still, I definitely got enough out of this one thanks to some good atmosphere building and a competent Williams performance."

This is unfortunate because the film initially appears to be smarter than the average prison movie. Instead of the usual Force Prized Fights/Involuntary Battles to the Death wherein a Condemned Contestant goes through a Tournament Arc in order to Win His Freedom, we get a state-sanctioned, inter-prison boxing program.

Sadly, Undisputed manages to avoid all the above-mentioned clichés only to succumb to the The Thunderdome. In lieu of a ring with ropes, the bouts take place in a big-ass, roofless cage with barbed wire atop its walls — but why? Why go to the trouble of establishing the lawfulness of the premise only to make the actual thing look like a Texas Death Match?

Anyway, disgraced heavyweight champion George 'The Iceman' Chambers (Rhames) is convicted of rape, sentenced to 6-8 years, and sent to Sweetwater maximum security prison in California. Chambers asks his cellmate Mingo (Studi) why he’s there. Mingo replies that «it's not considered polite to ask why we're here. Kinda violation of the ethics. You know, the code?»

No, I don’t know. What code? I’d seriously like to know, because it would mean that every prison movie where a character asks another character what he’s in there for (i.e., all of them) is in breach of some sort of tacit etiquette system.

Mingo’s right, though; no need to ask when Hill helpfully includes captions detailing the lives and crimes of every single characters — even those who only appear in a couple of scenes. Why exactly do we need to know that the announcer/commentator is a con artist convicted of larceny in 1995 named Marvin?

Mendy Ripstein (Falk), an elderly mobster/boxing fan, becomes dead set on booking a fight between Chambers and Sweetwater’s own state champion Monroe Hutchens (Snipes), so that he can (according to All Movie) ""pull in a million dollars in bets from guards and inmates"" (the movie actually speaks of multiple millions of dollars; either way, that’s a lot of cigarettes). 

Chuy (Jon Seda), Ripstein's caretaker or something, says “I talked to the head guard [Rooker]. He’s OK agrees. But the warden [Dennis Arndt] is a problem.” The nature of this problem seems to be that the warden can’t make up his goddamn mind; first he allows the fight, as long as it happens while he’s on vacation. 

He then backtracks and cancels it. Finally, he backpedals yet again and agrees to it. He’s not the only indecisive one, however; at first Ripstein wants a bare knuckle fight, but then someone complains, Ripstein thinks it over for about five seconds, and decides that it’s better with gloves — so why bring it up at all. 

I understand why they cast Falk in this role, but they needn’t have bothered him for something that Burt Young could have easily handled. As for Rooker and Studi, Hill forgot to write parts for them to play — which is odd considering that Rooker as a sadistic, racist guard C.O and Studi a mystical mentor are parts that pretty much write themselves (and even such clichés, that both actors are more than able to elevate beyond the commonplace, would be better than nothing).

That leaves Snipes, who does with his Zen Warrior what he can (not much, since he spends a good chunk of the movie in solitary confinement), and Rhames, who has the juiciest character and makes the most of it, as a man torn between the need to be a ""model prisoner"" if he wants to regain his freedom and resume his career before it’s too late, and his pathological desire to be respected and feared at all costs, something he only knows to achieve through physical violence. 

Unfortunately, the ugly business of rape remains unaccountably ambiguous. Chambers is unequivocally the antagonist, and Rhames is so good at being bad that it's hard to believe his claims of innocence. 

Therefore, either Chambers is innocent in that particular respect but a horrible human being in general, or he's guilty and ultimately gets away with it, since in exchange for fighting Monroe, Ripstein uses his clout to get Chambers out ""in special parole” (one has to wonder why Ripstein, who can get someone paroled without having served the minimum time required, doesn't use his obviously vast influence to his own advantage). 

We are supposed to believe that the humiliation of being beaten by Monroe is punishment enough; Chuy narrates at the end that “The Iceman and his manager denied that the fight with Monroe ever happened and the story that he lost was just a big rumour” — and why wouldn’t they? It is, after all,  their word against that of 700 witnesses between inmates and prison staff, not to mention, as Marvin points out, “our friends from Las Vegas, here to witness this competition and report to various cities across our great country. A lot of bookmakers want to know what's coming."" D'oh!"

_Originally posted on IMDb 21st December 2013._

This is the second time I have watched 'Satin rouge', and I thought I would write a short review.

The first time I watched the film I became very intrigued about Tunisian culture; at the time I knew virtually nothing about the country. I was surprised to read about how much more liberal the country is compared to other Islamic countries in the Middle East/North Africa. For example the Government actually discourage the wearing of the hijab, and religion in general seems to be a bit more secular. The liberation of women in Islamic-dominated countries is not often seen so I enjoyed that aspect of this film in particular.

The main reason why I chose to watch 'Satin rouge' initially is because of the beautiful Hiam Abbass, a seasoned actress, whom I have seen in many films now.

I enjoyed the film more after watching the second time. What I love most about it is that there is nothing overly spectacular about it. The plot, the editing, the scenes. But that's what makes it so good as well, because it is simple and that adds a sense of realism. It is a lovely little depiction of Tunisian life and culture.

Hiam was the perfect choice as traditional Lilia. It was amazing to see her character transform from a shy, plain widow with a bland and uninteresting life, into a more liberated, confident, expressive and beautiful woman with a new zest for life.

Whilst we don't see much depth in some of the supporting characters (including Lilia's daughter), they all complement Lilia's character nicely. There are a couple of saucy scenes too!

'Satin rouge' goes against the usual grain of Islamic/Middle Eastern (or in this case, North African!) culture and society and for that, it is definitely a gem for those who appreciate Indie cinema."

The animations are the stars, though - ""Bubo"" the mechanical owl; Pegasus the flying horse and ""Kalibos"", the cursed half man half lizard all make for a great series of friends and foes for our intrepid hunters who must rush if they are to save his love from the giant ""Kraken"". Certainly, time has maybe not been so kind to some of then cinematography and neither Hamlin nor Bowker are much good - but it's still a cracker of a fantasy that I heartily recommend."

In the 70s, this was one of the media's tools to terrify the populace. Unbelievably as it may seem, when released this movie scared the pants off of America in the same way that Jaws did when it made it to the theaters. The Killer Bee swarms in South America, created in cross-breeding African and Western Honeybees, of course had to share the stage with the other big threats of the day: The Upcoming Global Ice Age and Nuclear Power Plant disasters, both of which also made minor appearances in this film. Nevertheless, the fashionable fear in 1978 was bees and Hollywood was there to make sure YOU got the message that Man was bad and Nature would soon kick his ass.

That asides, the movie in itself now is laughable, no better than the Global Warming Fear Films that the SyFy channel (AKA NBC) churns out today. The movie passes well beyond the level of believable when train passenger cars explode as they roll down a hill, the nuclear plant explodes like an atomic bomb killing 36 thousand people or when the military decides to burn Houston like Sherman did Atlanta, even though the bee swarms are not inside buildings or cars. The over-the-top fiction that even 2 stings from these bees will kill you, even though Science (oh, doesn't the Left like to laud that term up on a pedestal when it suits their agenda) knew at the time that the level of toxin in this new strain of bee was no more lethal than that of the average Honeybee. Rather, it was their aggressiveness in tracking threats and ruthlessness of their attack, compared to normal bees, that was the true fact of concern.

The movie does bring a grade A cast to the table and most of the performances are respectable, although I did find the fact that Michael Caine liked to explode and shout through scenes rather disconcerting and over-dramatic. There are plenty of other situations that make no sense, like Henry Fonda's character using himself for a guinea pig when he's the only one who can work on a serum or Michael Caine breaking out a pane of glass to gain entry to a locked building, when people were already inside who could have opened the door, when the bees were attacking the town (and now had easy access to all the people in the building via the broken glass). Unlike the other disaster films of that decade, The Swarm doesn't even come close to being a serious threat and is little more than an inconvenient buzzing in the ear of the audience."

Today I’m an amateur.

Time After Time is directed by Nicholas Meyer who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Karl Alexander and Steve Hayes. It stars Malcolm McDowell, David Warner and Mary Steenburgen. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography is by Paul Lohmann.

How delightful, a wonderful idea is given an equally wonderful presentation. The makers have come up with the idea of pitching Jack the Ripper against H.G. Wells, in the present day of 1979. This after the Ripper (Warner) used Wells’ (McDowell) time machine to escape the Whitechapel police back in 1891, thus forcing Wells to track the infamous killer to San Francisco in the future.

There have been so many fish-out-of-water based movies over the years, it’s so refreshing to find one that has a genuinely original premise to work from. In the Ripper’s case he sees all the violence around the streets of San Fran and believes it’s his calling to be in this company. On the flip-side, Wells is perturbed to find that this is not the Utopia he had envisaged, but yet the science lover in him is fascinated by what he finds. Helps, too, that he has caught the attention of a very horny Amy Robbins (Steenburgen), who is equally fascinated by his genteel mannerisms.

Naturally the fun has to stop at some point to let the suspense and darker aspects of the story come to the surface. Meyer gets the blend right, dropping in little snippets of evil as Jolly Jack, resplendent with waistcoat and money belt, goes about his bloody business, and then switching to the Wells/Amy axis as they try to build a relationship whilst trying to convince the authorities that a nutter is very much in their midst. It builds nicely, ramping up the tension considerably, and there’s always the pertinent question hanging in the air of if there is any hope for H.G. and Amy? 

Such is the rich characterisations and quality of story telling, we most assuredly care about the outcome to this splendid piece of time travelling cake. 8.5/10"

At the end of the Civil War the three Reno brothers come back home with loot from a Union train heist, which they originally intended to give to the Confederate cause. The eldest brother (Richard Egan) is shocked to discover that the youngest brother, who stayed home (Presley), is now married to his sweetheart (Debra Paget) because they thought he died in the war. 

""Love Me Tender"" (1964) was Elvis’ 1st movie of the 31 in his acting filmography. The title of the film and Elvis' addition were last-minute decisions. His role was originally slated for Cameron Mitchell and the part had to be hastily beefed up for Presley, including his performances of several songs. In light of this, it’s not surprising that Elvis’ role is secondary. 

Both Egan and Paget are highlights as impressive examples of cool masculine strength and exquisite feminine beauty respectively. Meanwhile Elvis does fine in his acting debut and is second-to-none in his musical performances (or pantomimes). While critics might complain that no one back then moved like Presley, you could say that the movie explores the possibility of someone of Elvis’ talent & charisma performing during that era. And the flick pulls it off IMHO.

The story’s compelling enough but starts to lose its mojo in the last act. This isn’t helped by the flat B&W photography or the laughably disingenuous geography. (Tell me, do the opening landscapes look anything close to Louisiana?)   

The movie runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot at 20th Century Fox Ranch, Calabasas, and Bell Moving Picture Ranch, Santa Susana Mountains, both in Southern Cal, as well as studio stuff done in Century City.

I can enjoy horror films that don't contain some of the expected traits, like: jumps, creepy music, lots of screaming or tons of gore… but there has to be something to remind us that this is, in fact, a horror movie after all. To be honest though, there is a little bit of gore, that's true… but if the atmosphere isn't reminiscent of a horror film, the gore itself ends up being out of place. I was expecting something good, as I consider Wes Craven to be a very talented horror director, but I guess he simply wasn't in his prime back then. 

On 'Last House on the Left', the story revolves around a group of criminals, three guys and a trashy girl, who have recently escaped from prison. Two girls on her way to a concert, decide to stop by a house, looking for marijuana. The girls are kidnapped by these ex convicts, who torture them, rape them and eventually murder them in a brutal way. After butchering the two friends, the gang seeks refuge with the parents of one of the victims, who are completely unaware of everything. However, when the man of the house finds out about what happened to his daughter and who were responsible for what happened to her, he teams up with his wife to execute a gruesome revenge against his four guests.

The idea of two vindictive parents trying to avenge their dead daughter sounded promising and original for a horror film. It gives hopes for something tragic, dramatic and gruesome, but in the end, ""Last House on the Left"" ends up being more like a drama full of missed opportunities. One would expect a movie like this to reach its high point in the scene where the parents are finally able to avenge their daughter, but to my disappointment, this confrontation takes place only during the very last minutes of the film and it is shown in a very bland way. I can understand that minimalism works in certain films, and I don't expect all movies to offer some kind of gruesome shock value. The problem is that simplicity is not exactly something that one would expect from a film like this, where a certain amount of gruesomeness is almost mandatory. When the father finds out about what happened to his daughter, he looks completely numb. We never really get to see any signs of devastation, which would have added a well-placed share of drama to the story and would have made the last minutes much more powerful and tragic. My main problem with this film, however, is the fact that there are a few moments of pointless slapstick comedy. I mean, how can this be explained. It's supposed to be a horror film, but instead it is a horrible drama… with a few comedy moments? We see a girl getting stabbed and right after that, we see two dumb cops doing funny things for the audience to laugh. Honestly, I don't get it. I also find the banjo music to be inappropriate, as it works as a some kind comedy relief and it really doesn't make any sense in a movie like this. I am aware that sometimes, joyful music in horror movies is a way to create some kind of strong contrasting atmosphere, but in 'Last House on the Left', it simply sounded out of place. 

Most people seem to be impressed about the 'appalling gore' and impressive scenes, but I was mostly surprised by the lack of them. True, there are a few scenes that looked pretty brutal, but the gore is not striking enough to save the entire movie. I don't really understand what's the deal with the lame tag line that says 'To avoid fainting, keep repeating ""It's only a movie...It's only a movie...""'. I didn't find any parts to be that horrifying, to be honest. Even though I don't focus on the gore very much, I must admit that there are certain horror movies that make up for the weak plot, with a nice amount of carnage... unfortunately, this film is not one of those.

I give this movie 5 stars because even though I don't agree with the overhype, I still think it's a watchable drama with a few horror and comedy elements scattered around."

What would we do if, while preparing our doctoral or master's thesis, accidentally came across evidence of a murder? I bet with most people, the obvious thing would be to go straight to the police and hand the matter over to the professionals, right? This is not what Angela decides to do when, while preparing her thesis on violence in cinema, she comes across a “snuff” video, showing a student from her college being savagely murdered and chopped into pieces. A video that caused her thesis advisor's sudden death when he saw it.

Despite the very low budget, the film is really very well-made, and a clear sign of the great capacity, talent and creativity of its director, Alejandro Amenábar, one of the best and most regular Spanish directors (regular in the quality of his work, because he is one of those who only make a movie occasionally). I don't know, but while watching the film, I got the feeling that the director drew inspiration from his own academic experience, especially when he studied at the Complutense University in Madrid.

We don't have, in this film, easily recognizable actors, but it wasn't difficult for me, who saw most of the director's work, to recognize Eduardo Noriega's face, and to appreciate the actor's well-done job, in the role of a magnetic, charming and elusive student, who may very well be the great villain (or not, watch the movie). Ana Torrent also did a job well done, although not much was required of her. Fele Martínez was also pleasant, giving the character a welcome irreverence and a somewhat unpredictable way of acting. Xabier Elorriaga looks a lot like some idiot college professor, so I also think he did well in the role he was given.

Being a low-cost film, with few resources, we don't have anything visually ostentatious here, nor great effects. The film was planned to be simple, and the production clearly worked with what they had at hand: the sets and costumes are quite uncharacteristic, but they are within what we expect to see, since filming was almost always done on location. I really have doubts if there was a place that we can call a “studio” in this production. The soundtrack relies on electronics and synthesizer, but it works well, and fits with the period in which the film was made. Simple, effective, with good dialogues, a good script, an excellent director and good actors: a hidden pearl."

Seven people in their early 30s reunite at the summer camp they attended two decades earlier as tweenagers or thereabouts. The owner still watches over them (Alan Arkin) and informs them of his plan to retire. Sam Raimi is on hand as his assistant who seems slightly mentally impaired.

""Indian Summer” (1993) was based around the writer/director’s summer camp experiences at Camp Tamakwa, which Raimi also attended as a kid. It’s similar to “Meatballs,” just with adults and only quick flashbacks of them as children at the camp.
 
It’s sometimes designated as a comedy, but that’s inaccurate. This is a drama in the mold of ""Return of the Secaucus Seven"" or “The Big Chill.” As with those movies, the amusing bits are organic to the setting. They’re cabin-in-the-woods flicks, just without a boogeyman. You have to be an adult or, at least, mature-minded to appreciate some of the material, such as when Jennifer (Elizabeth Perkins) looks in the mirror and remarks to herself.

The writer/director obviously wanted to keep everything believable and lowkey, which is fine, but this will make the film boring to some. Those who are nostalgic over summer camp will likely find more to appreciate.

In my opinion, “Return of the Secaucus Seven” is the best of the three with the later “3 Nights in the Desert” (2014) being equal in quality in its unique way.

Kimberly Williams-Paisley is notable in the feminine department as the one attendee who wasn’t present 20 years earlier and was actually only 1 year-old back then. Along with the aforementioned Perkins, Diane Lane and Julie Warner are also on hand. Perkins’ character comes across a little loud-mouthed and edgy. On the masculine side of things, Bill Paxton is on hand as sorta an early 90s’ version of Jim Morrison. 

It runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot at Camp Tamakwa in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, which is a 3 hour, 10 minutes, drive north of Toronto.

A nuclear family head across the desert in their giant trailer only to break down and find there's beasties in the hills hungry for their blood.

It has become very much a popular cult pic with Craven fans, which is understandable given the brisk pacing, moments of intensity and suspense, while the allegories and messages are smartly inserted. But the low budget does affect the product, it looks cheap and renders much of the violence and sexual aspects (implied or otherwise) as being not very frightening or stomach churning. While some of the acting is very poor, further adding a cartoonish feel to what should have been a nerve shredding experience.

Above average for sure, but not the masterpiece some would have you believe. 6/10 || Though the case of _The Hills Have Eyes_ is a rare one wherein I feel that the remake is in its entirety a better film than the original, Wes Craven's 1977 exploitation horror is still a solid movie, just one that doesn't succeed in its totality. Gimme a Beast spin-off anyday though.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || This is one I could've sworn I had seen before and while I think I remembered a few scenes, the rest was a blank.

So it took me close on 7 years to watch it, so it took me to do a thread about my personal prison based film project on IMDb to get some prompts for this film, I'm just like Novacaine, if you give me time, I get there.

Based on the real life Stanford prison experiment in 1971, Das Experiment is a fabulous construction of seams coming apart in the human psyche, the films triumph is that we are never left in any doubt that things are going to go pear shaped from the off, but the fact that it manages to bash you over the head with its bluntness to reinforce the point, is, magnificent story telling. As much as the film disturbs, it is as much an education of the human condition under trying circumstances. Moritz Bleibtreu & Justus von Dohnanyi play Tarek & Berus respectively, with both men giving superlative performances as the two lynch pins to the pic's unravelling terror.

This is not merely an experiment, but a test where the results are dangerously grounded in facts, it's bleak, it's at times harsh, but it actually is essential cinema for those looking for a kicker where the boot on the foot is all too real, one that and was once worn by the man next door to you. The rating on some internet sites is a disgrace IMHO, I have drop-kicked Der Untergang over the goal posts to make this my new favourite German film. I probably shouldn't go 10/10 for the film after it has scarred me from ever listening to The Beach Boys classic ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" ever again - for now that tune will never seem jolly, it will just serve as a reminder of what a brilliantly bleak film Das Experiment is. 10/10"

Based on the novel by A.E.W. Mason, a greenhorn British regiment in 1884 is commissioned to Egyptian-ruled Sudan to fight Mahdi rebels. A young officer, Harry (Heath Ledger), unexpectedly resigns and is shamed as a coward by his three best friends (e.g. Wes Bentley) and fiancée (Kate Hudson). After the negative fallout he goes to Sudan undercover to hopefully redeem his honor.

""The Four Feathers"" (2002) is similar to Victorian-Brits-fighting-in-Africa flicks like “Zulu” (1964) and “Khartoum” (1966), but I prefer this one as it’s just more compelling and is a quality modern production (I’ve never seen the old-fashioned 1939 version).

There are a lot of gems to mine here, like Harry’s individualism in the face of great social pressure to conform. His reasoning is simple: He never wanted to be a soldier and only took the commission to please his gung-ho militarist father. Besides, how is what’s happening in the Sudanese desert relevant to him and the British in the first place? Why should he risk dying or losing a limb for this dubious purpose? One of the best parts is Harry’s growing friendship with Sudanian Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou).

Unfortunately, the movie’s hampered by two problems: The mechanics of the plot sometimes drive the characters and it doesn’t feel natural or real. For instance, when Harry easily joins the Mahdi rebels and is later seen riding toward the British regiment it’s serious “Yeah, right” territory. Another problem is that, from the main battle forward the movie doesn’t allow itself to breath and seems like it’s in a rush, like it doesn’t have the confidence to slow down and tell the story because it’s worried about fitting into a 2-hour timeframe and pleasing those with ADHD.

If you can get past those two hitches, this is a worthy historical adventure flick.

The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in England and Morocco.

GRADE: C+/B- || **An elegant, visually beautiful, historically well-made film, but very clean of all the controversies it could address.**

The novel “The Four Feathers” has been adapted for film several times, since the days of silent films. Before seeing this film, I had seen a 1939 version, and the similarities of both films are almost as striking as their differences. Which one will be the closest to the original novel? I don't know, I haven't read the novel, but I'd bet more on the older version.

I don't know if it's really worth talking about the script: Harry Faversham, a young British son of a general, is impelled by his father to follow the family tradition and becomes an officer. However, days before his regiment leaves for war, in Sudan, to face the Mahdist Revolt, he asks to leave the army, thus acquiring the label of coward, marked by the offer of the famous white feathers. Faced with this, he radically changes his mind, and decides to go, at his own risk, to Sudan, alone, with the idea of returning their feathers.

Well, what was good about the older films was their ability to make this story seem more plausible, explaining the character's initial motivations for not going and, then, making an intelligent bet on issues of honor, reputation, pride. Without this, the protagonist's change of mind does not make sense: he was not capable of going to fight in a distant war, but he feels capable of going there, alone, and only because he was called a coward? Put that way, it's absurd. This film adaptation has handled this shift in thinking poorly, doesn't explain it properly, and makes it all seem frivolous. The romantic relationship between Faversham and Ethne also never really feels solid. The ending is completely changed and turns out to be more acceptable than the heroic and patriotic ending of the 1939 film.

Heath Ledger is a good actor and is in good shape in this film, which will certainly be one of the most interesting of his (unfortunately) short career. I also really enjoyed the work of Wes Bentley and Djimon Hounsou. But the merits of the cast end here. Kate Hudson never puts in the effort, she just seems happy in the pretty dresses she wears, and the rest of the cast doesn't get the treatment and development they should have.

Technically, the film is very good. There was, clearly, a great effort in terms of historical accuracy, mainly with regard to military uniforms, equipment and tactics, in a period in which there is a lot of reliable published information - it was the Victorian era, the era of the great expansion of the British Empire, and the colonization of Africa. There is, however, a certain care not to touch “wasp nests” such as the enormous ethnocentrism that the British cultivated at the time, racism, the apology of the empire and the “civilizing mission” that the Europeans had to carry out in “savage” Africa. The film takes place in this period, but avoids touching these points in a forceful way as much as possible. Perhaps the producers were a little afraid of seeing DVDs of the film stuck in the next statue of a white colonist that a fanatical group of students decided to tear down in England. The film also took special care in recreating the sets and environments, and in the cinematography, resulting in an aesthetically beautiful and elegant work. The soundtrack, I confess, did not convince me. || The loved-up ""Harry' (Heath Legder) does the unthinkable and resigns his military commission just as his regiment is about to go into action in North Africa. He thinks of his motives as thoroughly honourable - staying to be with new affianced ""Ethne"" (Kate Hudson). Sadly for him, though, just about everyone else thinks he has gone a bit yellow and deliver him the ultimate symbol of cowardice - a single white feather attached to their card. It's only his friend ""Jack"" (Wes Bentley) who has some sympathy but when the soldiers leave, ""Jack"" is completely ostracised - even by his love. He isn't a coward though, and determines to follow his colleagues, incognito, and as the story develops they can all be glad that he did. I really enjoyed the 1939 version of this, and to be fair this isn't an half bad remake. It's a bit long and flighty at times, and the supporting cast of largely British actors doesn't really add much to the sense of menace the soldiers face on their desert battlefield with the fearsome Dervishes bearing down on them relentlessly. The combat scenes are quite well put together and there are plenty of them as his tortuous challenge reaches it's conclusion. It's really just a camera-friendly vehicle for a charismatic star who looked like he was enjoying himself amidst the stiff-upper-lip Victorian military environment where pride quite literally went before a fall. If you enjoy a solid, boy's-own style of adventure movie then this entertains easily enough for a couple of hours of colourful derring-do."

Based on Iles’ book 24 Hours, Trapped aspires to be a potent kidnap thriller, an attempt to use the kidnapping of a young girl as some sort of edge of the seat entertainment, sadly it’s poorly constructed and quite frankly ill advised.

A fine cast has assembled for the picture, but nobody distinguishes themselves as they try to make the generic and idiotic material work. On the atmosphere side of the fence things aren’t half bad, there’s a grim and grubby feel to proceedings, but Mandoki consistently ruins each passage of promise with cack-handed convolutions, which when the core plot device is a dumb drug set-up, only makes the feeble efforts of making a twisty thriller even more laughable.

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Steven Shainberg, ""Secretary"" is a romantic dramedy about a young woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who spent some time at a mental hospital for self-harm (e.g. cutting). She apprehends a job as a secretary to a quirky, arduous lawyer (James Spader) wherein their employer-employee bond turns increasingly sexual in a dominant/submissive way.

This is the first mainline film in America to breach the difficult topic of BDSM, walking the balance beam between being either too amusing or too offensive. For those not in the know, BDSM is an overlap of acronyms: BD stands for Bondage and Discipline; DS for Dominance and Submission; and SM for Sadism and Masochism. I didn’t really know the movie tackled BDSM before viewing it; I thought it was simply a romance-in-the-office type flick with maybe some kinky elements. 

The movie is polarizing, unsurprisingly. I read a few reviews by respectable critics and one was fascinated by it, giving it an incredible 10/10 Stars (Why Sure!), while another wrote it off as a film for sick people, granting it 1/10 Stars. Whilst I find the romance-at-the-office element interesting, I could care less about the BDSM angle. Regardless, the first half is amusing enough and Maggie is a winsome treat, but the second half gets a little too deviant and borders on porn. 

Yet the movie ends well with a well-intentioned message: This is a story about two people who have an affinity for DS that find each other and their relationship may or may not work (no spoilers). I suppose the movie is trying to get across that pain can be therapeutic as long as it's applied by the right hand with the right intention. Thus two people with an affinity for BDSM can develop a relationship that works, for them. But not me; no thanks.                                       

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. WRITERS: Mary Gaitskill (short story) and Erin Cressida Wilson & Shainberg (screenplay).

The detail of the animation is astonishing and coupled with the mysticism of ancient Japanese folk lore works really well at creating a characterful and engaging story. I just love the lithe dragons of Oriental mythology as opposed to the scaly, stodgy, European ones.

I'm not sure Jackie Chan has made a bad movie on the simple fact that almost no one can do what he does, and the flair he puts on it would keep distinct even if someone else tried to compete.  Part of his charm is how humble he acts, and this movie amplifies that as he's a guy that doesn't know what he's doing and has to rely on a Tuxedo for his abilities and Jennifer Love Hewitt for basically everything else.

JLH is great in this as well, she does some action, she's funny, she does some positive messaging for women, and she act's smart.  I'm not sure if this could have been a little stronger if she was an experience field agent instead of a socially awkward scientist, but I don't think it would have been nearly as charming.

The writing is structured fine, but I wish it had a little more oompf to it.  The villain's plot is interesting and innovative, but I feel like they could have done a lot more with it.

Red Dragon is based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris and is directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It stars Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary-Louise Parker & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Dante Spinotti is on cinematography and Danny Elfman scores the music.

Red Dragon is a prequel to the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs. The story had already been filmed as Manhunter in 1986 directed by Michael Mann. The signs weren't particularly good for Red Dragon. The previous year had seen Ridley Scott tackle Silence Of The Lambs follow up, Hannibal, with tepid results. While at the helm here was the director of such fodder as Rush Hour 1&2, and of course Mann's take on the story is viewed as a grainy and skin itching cult classic. Nice to report then that even tho it's hardly in the same class as ""Lambs,"" it's a willing entertainer that genuinely manages to unease.

Firstly one has to get past the Hannibal Lecter factor to fully enjoy (and dampen expectations) the movie on its own terms. Lecter (Hopkins enjoying himself but going through the motions) is a secondary character. Important? Yes! But still secondary to Norton's troubled but gifted FBI agent Will Graham and Fiennes bonkers serial killer Francis Dolarhyde (AKA:The Tooth Fairy). Red Dragon is first and foremost a ripping good old detective story, with Ratner and Tally wisely using the bits that made Harris' novel such a page turning success. They have added their own bits of course {the pre-credit sequence involving Lecter & Graham sets things up perfectly}, but ultimately it's a loyal enough telling of a gripping and goose flesh inducing story.

The makers have wisely filled the film out with quality performers. Norton underplays Graham nicely, a character unable to stay away from the job that threatens his family, he becomes an easy guy to root for as things start to get troubling. Fiennes too doesn't go over the top, in great physical shape and with piercing blue eyes, he exudes menace without resorting to being a cackling caricature. Hoffman was a shoe in for a weasel reporter since he does it so well, while Keitel, tho not having to stretch himself, offers up a stoic turn as Jack Crawford. But the main performance, and sadly unheralded, comes from Emily Watson as the blind Reba. With Reba acting as both a romantic and redemptive foil to Dolarhyde's split-personality, Watson gets the tough gig, and comes up trumps with an affecting turn featuring the right amounts of spunk, sadness and needy tenderness.

It's a bit too polished to be a nerve shredder, with Ratner unable to give the film an atmospheric feel befitting the darkness at its core. But it does deliver on the promise of not only that opening segment, but also on Harris' fine procedural narrative. 7/10 || This might seriously be the only good thing Brett Ratner has ever done. I don't even mean movies he's made, just like, thing he's done. Ever. In his life. Doesn't live up to the book, or to _Silence of the Lambs_ (though that second part took me a while to figure out), but I watch this thing semi-regularly and I haven't gotten sick of it yet. 

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || Retired FBI man ""Will Graham"" (Ed Norton) finds himself back working with ""Hannibal Lecter"" (Sir Anthony Hopkins) at whose hands, years earlier, he only narrowly escaped death - this time on the hunt for the elusive ""Tooth Fairy"" (Ralph Fiennes) who is running amok in downtown Baltimore using each full moon as an excuse to slaughter two - seemingly unconnected - families. Norton is great in the role; he treads the line between emotionally embattled agent and dedicated, almost obsessed, detective with considerable skill. Hopkins features less frequently, but still exudes menace as only he can and Fiennes, too, has a look of madness and evil about him that, alongside Ted Tally's adept adaptation of Robert Harris' novel, creates a wonderfully tense, suspenseful couple of hours of drama. It hasn't the style, or pace of it's 1991 sequel - but perhaps that's because we have had ten years to absorb just how potent these original characterisations actually were; but this is still is good watch combining horror and wickedness in an, at times, edge of the seat story."

The problem is that the Jagger character is little more than a narrator, and should exist only to introduce Andy García into the world of male escorting; whatever he does in his spare time, and with whom he does it, has no bearing whatsoever on the plot and is therefore of zero interest to the audience.

Anyway, luckily for Andy, though rather unbelievably in general, his experience as a glorified gigolo involves one single solitary customer who, as expected, is rich and lonely, but also very beautiful and about his same age, and to cap it all, married to his hero, played by James Coburn, who not only is quite at peace with his wife procuring herself a sexual surrogate, but also willing to let García help him rewrite his next novel. Uh huh.

Improbabilities aside, the whole triangle business is the best part of the movie (with Coburn effortlessly evoking a rugged, Hemingway-esque manliness), and its potential for both dramatic and comedic material renders García’s previously established domestic life disposable were it not that the script needs it to provide the sappy happy ending (and that Hickenlooper couldn’t bear to part even with Julianna Margulies goes a long way in explaining his attachment to Jagger and Huston).

The time devoted to either sub-plot would have been better spent monitoring Garcia's progress as a writer. No doubt his bittersweet experiences with Coburn and the latter's wife would provide him with much better material (not to mention a solid tree to lean against, in terms of professional learning) than his previous novel, a sub-Ira Levin thriller called Hitler's Child; however, the characters are authors only nominally, and the extent of their literary collaboration is reduced to substituting one ""microcosm"" for another (migrant workers instead of Roman slaves)."

Among the plethora of Godzilla sequels Mothra vs Godzilla is simply one of the finest. The best of the Godzilla films work by having a thematic purpose underneath the spectacle of kaiju mayhem. Godzilla, an unstoppable force of destruction against the benevolent Mothra, a fragile and delicate creature. 

A frequent motif in the films of Ishiro Honda was the notion of the brotherhood of man. Here this is put to the test as greed and mistrust take a hold of our characters. Our human villain seeks to exploit Mothra for profit while the islanders of Mothra's island are reluctant to help humanity in their fight against Godzilla. In many ways it shares many similarities to it's predecessor, King Kong vs Godzilla, though this film executes its themes in a more thoughtful manner. Its story and characters may be simple, but the actors give charismatic performances that really make them enjoyable. The human villains in particular are some of the finest in the series.

Tsuburaya's effects are at their apex here. Godzilla's design is imbued with a menacing personality along with a fantastic performance by suit actor Haruo Nakajima. Mothra is once again is brought to life through some stunning wirework. Her wings, head, and legs all wiggle and bob making her feel alive. The film has some of the finest hand made tokusatsu craftsmanship of the original series. Add to that a phenomenal soundtrack by Akira Ifukube and you have what is undoubtedly one of Godzilla's finest moments."

I don't think Shakespeare ever imagined that one of his most iconic works could be the clear inspiration for such a wildly comical film: in fact, the relationship between the film and “Hamlet” is obvious to anyone who has the plot and characters in mind. famous play by the English Bard. Here, we have two comical characters with an obsession with beer (who will probably be guaranteed entry, without explanation, into Alcoholics Anonymous) who go, completely inadvertently, to a brewery and stumble upon a Machiavellian scheme to remove the heiress from the company to the detriment of from an uncle.

The film is complete nonsense from beginning to end, and it even seems painful to see how the two main characters go through so much without having any real idea of what is happening around them. They don't look drunk, but they look like they're on drugs all the time. The film is funny, you can't help but laugh... but at the same time it's not a film I would want to show to a teenage audience. After all, many of them already drink too much and smoke things they shouldn't...

The cast includes several well-known names who seem to have embarked on this project for fun and not, exactly, for the expected financial return. This is the case of Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis, who made several other films with the same characters and achieved some public recognition for it. I also liked seeing Max von Sydow, perhaps the most dense and professional actor present. I don't know Lynne Griffin, but I liked her work here and Paul Dooley was a laughable enough villain to not deserve our hate."

The Curse of Frankenstein was coining it in at the box office, so Hammer Films were quick to negotiate a deal to reinvent Dracula on the big screen. Certain agreements were made as per distribution rights for Universal, who owned the rights via a deal that was struck decades earlier with the Bram Stoker estate. Once all the dots were dotted and the t's were crossed, Dracula hit the screens in a whirl of sensual Technicolor bliss, where the trajectory of horror film history was shunted upwards to the point that the legacy still lives on today.

Directed by Terence Fisher and adapted to screenplay by Jimmy Sangster, Dracula (AKA: Horror of Dracula) is a compact piece of horror. The Hammer team condense Stoker's novel down to an 80 minute film, quickly placing Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) at Castle Dracula and establishing the vampire legend courtesy of the slick and sexy Count Dracula himself (Christopher Lee). There's no changing into bats or scaling of walls here, in fact Dracula's dialogue is very minimalist, instead he permeates the film with sexual menace, horrific suggestion and an obvious disregard for humanity, with Lee in the role simply terrific.

Then it's time for Doctor Van Helsing to bring his cunning whiles to the party, which is the signal for Peter Cushing to enter the fray, who adds class and elegance to a classic role. James Bernard provides a dual score of erotic swirls and thunderous scares, while the cast play out the story in front of some impressively constructed Gothic sets, courtesy of Bernard Robinson, who like the rest of the team were working with a budget under six figures! Some nifty effects work cement the pic's status, other little touches - such as Dracula having no audible footsteps - also ensure that Hammer's Dracula remains a key vampire movie of note.

A number of interesting tid-bids sit in the film's back history. How it fell into the public domain, complaints about blood transfusion advertisements in theatre foyers during its first run! Censorship and the ""X"" Certification afforded it in the UK, and that some of the first wave of critic reviews were positively barbed and indignant. In truth Hammer would produce far better horror films post Dracula's release, in fact this is not even the best of the Hammer Dracula movies. Yet in the pantheon of Hammer film, and horror film in general, it's a 10/10 movie. Terence Fisher deserves the final word, he would say that the shoot and production for Dracula just clicked, it all worked and everyone was in sync. 8/10 || Hammer’s first vampire flick with Christopher Lee as the Count.

RELEASED IN 1958 and directed by Terence Fisher, ""Horror of Dracula"" chronicles events when Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) goes to Dracula’s castle under the pretense of a librarian. Later, the Prince of Darkness travels to Karlstadt, Germany, to prey on Harker's fiancée, Lucy (Carol Marsh), and her relatives, Arthur & Mina (Michael Gough & Melissa Stribling). Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Cushing), a student of vampirism and a friend of Harker’s, shows up to try to put an end to the Count’s reign of terror.  

Hammer Studios did nine Dracula films from 1958 to 1974: Horror of Dracula (1958); The Brides of Dracula (1960); Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966); Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968); Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969); Scars of Dracula (1970); Dracula AD 1972 (1972); The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973); and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974. Christopher played the Count in every one of these except ""The Brides of Dracula"" and ""The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires."" 

Hammer fans typically praise this first film in the series, Lee's first gig as Dracula, and it is a solid entry with the typical Hammer highlights: Lush Gothic ambiance, bright colors, Lee & Cushing and bodacious women. Lee's diabolical interpretation of the Count is another highpoint, not to mention one of the most stunning horror scores by James Bernard. Unfortunately, the abridged story loosely based on Stoker’s novel is somehow unsatisfactory and there are too many 50's limitations IMHO.

Here’s one curious abbreviation: In the book the story starts in Transylvania, switches to England with Dracula voyaging to London, but ends up back in Transylvania for the climax. Coppola’s 1992 film adhered to this European globetrotting, but Hammer decided to simplify the geography where travel time is condensed to something akin to a European theme park rather than reality. The tale starts outside of Klausenburg, the capital of Transylvania in Central Romania at the time, with Drac’s castle nearby, then switches to Karlstadt, in South-Central Germany, which is roughly 750 miles from Klausenburg in reality, yet a mere carriage drive away in this film, perhaps 20 miles.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 22 minutes and was shot entirely in Bray, Berkshire, England. WRITERS: Jimmy Sangster (screenplay) and Bram Stoker (novel).  

GRADE: B- || Dracula, or Horror of Dracula, is a pretty by-the-numbers Dracula film.

This one, in particular, focuses on Dr. Van Helsing, giving the titular character very few scenes. Regardless, the acting is effective in most of the main characters, including Dracula himself. 

This film doesn't stretch the lore of Dracula much, rather just producing a solid film within the already-crafted confines, which works well enough. While it's not groundbreaking, it's not bad, either, which is a very good thing. 

Overall, it's a touch of a drag, but the solid score brings the viewer right back into the action, which is a nice touch on most of these older movies."
