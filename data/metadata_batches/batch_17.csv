Something we can't clean up this time?

The Drop is directed by Michael R. Roskam and written by Dennis Lehane, who adapts from his own short story titled Animal Rescue. It stars Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, Noomi Rapace and Matthias Schoenaerts. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis.

Brooklyn barman Bob Saginowski (Hardy) spies an opportunity for a better life - but only if he can escape family ties, the crime that surrounds him and a dark past 

It's arguably a tricky film to recommend with confidence given that it doesn't sit still in crime genre company. This is very much a character based story about a small handful of people affected by crime, where they are chained to events occurring by way of law breaking. Roskam is in no hurry what so ever to spin his picture's literary worth, very much favouring a slow burn - even low key - approach. He deftly develops atmosphere whilst simultaneously ensuring we the viewers are very much a part of the setting and situations - something Lehane does so brilliantly in his novels. By the time the pic plays its hand, what appeared at first to be needless complexities, are valid and close the piece down with some considerable success. 7.5/10 || ""Bob"" (Tom Hardy) and his cousin ""Marv"" (James Gandolfini) run a bar that is regularly used for the anonymous drop - money paid to their Chechen landlords - and all goes fine until it is robbed. They are tasked with retrieving the money and are soon immersed in a cycle of gangland betrayal and deception that isn't helped by a police investigation into another murder, and the curious ""Eric Deeds"" (Matthias Schoenaerts) whose dog ""Bob"" has rescued from maltreatment. Nobody knows who to trust and director Michaël Roskam manages to use the talent at his disposal, alongside some effective lighting and a careful build up of the pace to help this better-than-average thriller work up to it's clever conclusion. Noomi Rapace (""Nadia"") features only sparingly, and Hardy's accent maybe isn't the best - but the complexities of the plot as well as a reasonable attempt to develop the characterisations into people we cared a little about do help this stand out. Hardy shows us that he has the ability to deliver a slightly more multi-dimensional persona and this is a good watch with quite a quirky ending."
246400.0,"20,000 Days on Earth",A semi-fictionalized documentary about a day in the life of Australian musician Nick Cave's persona.,,"Documentary, Drama, Music",97.0,2014-07-05,en,7.046,197.0,0.4272,"Nick Cave, Warren Ellis, Blixa Bargeld, Susie Bick, Arthur Cave","Jane Pollard, Iain Forsyth, Nick Cave, Iain Forsyth, Jane Pollard","docudrama, woman director, part fiction","Simultaneously one of the most pretentious and brilliant things I have ever seen.  If you love Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, you will love this.  If you find his music dark and too much hard work, stay away.  

8/10 || I wouldn’t hesitate to call Nick Cave a genius, especially not after watching 20,000 Days on Earth – and yet, the beauty of this biofictional film, co-written by Cave with directors Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, is its humility. Most movies about musicians, particularly rockstars, suffer from what we might call The Amadeus Syndrome; in contrast, 20,000 Days is a refreshing reminder that you must let inspiration find you working – and by ‘you’ I mean anyone; if Cave himself is a genius, it's not because all his ideas are right, but because he has the right idea about all ideas:

“We cannot afford to be idle. To act on a bad idea is better than to not act at all, because the worth of the idea never becomes apparent until you do it. Sometimes this idea can be the smallest thing in the world, a little flame that you hunch over and cup with your hand and pray will not be extinguished by all the storm that howls about it. If you can hold on to that flame, great things can be constructed around it that are massive and powerful and world-changing... all held up by the tiniest of ideas”.

This certainly is a film about the thought as well as the deed. We see Cave and the Bad Seeds working in the studio and performing onstage, but the movie reaches farther back, to the genesis of a song and even what lies before that – the ‘pre-song,’ if you will. We learn that everything – including “every secret, sacred moment that exists between a husband and a wife” – may be “cannibalized and ground up and spat out the other side in the form of a song, inflated and distorted and monstrous.”

We learn also that songs are born from chaos (“Counterpoint is the key. Putting two disparate images beside each other and seeing which way the sparks fly”), “wild and unbroken,” and it’s the songwriter’s task to grab a hold of them in this protean state and not let go until they “become domesticated … something familiar and compliant.” This is no mean feat, considering that Cave’s songs aren’t your typical ‘verse-bridge-chorus’ compositions; “Higgs Boson Blues”, featured in the film, is an outstanding example of a stream of consciousness-type song whose greatest strength is its apparent spontaneity – and indeed, if Cave wasn’t reading the lyrics off a notebook as he sings them, we might be tricked into believing he’s improvising them right there on the spot. The movie as a whole is deceivingly effortless – one of those small ideas around which something great has been constructed."
254191.0,Honeymoon,"Young newlyweds Paul and Bea travel to a remote lake cottage for their honeymoon, where the promise of private romance awaits them.

In that perspective, it was a decent movie, because within the limits everything was done nicely. In fact, it was a minimal cast movie set in an isolated cabin in the woods. A simple story that is like the title, it is about a newly married couple's honeymoon. All sets off nicely to them until strange events begin to follow one after another. How the couple manages to come off of it, or do they is the rest.

I don't know others, but like I said it was not a bad movie to me. Whatever happened, it just kept me engaged throughout, because of the uptight plot. Though, it raises some questions about the events that takes place in the movie and makes to have your own imagination. In fact, my opinion in the begging was 'big foot', later very quickly I understood what it's about. The writer's notion was also the same, leaving blank space to fill by the viewers with their creative prediction.

The most of the answers answered or going to be answered are merely the same (I think). For those who won't get it, will suffer nothing except think they wasted time. The rest will probably want a sequel for a proper and further explanation. Especially a couple of dialogues made me think that way. But, I don't think so there will be one, it will stay a mystery as of now forever, if I'm not wrong. Not a scary movie nor actual violence, but the suspense was the movie's strong hold. If you're looking for that type, you can give it a try other than blood gore and killings.

5.5/10 || A Kewl_Kat quick review: Honeymoon was suspenseful for a while but ultimately left me feeling dissatisfied. It shouldn't be your first choice on a boring evening but if you happen to watch, it won't be a complete waste of time, either. It's somewhere in the middle. 5/10."

After the beautiful 'Hateship Loveship', I expected this one for Kristen Wiig. It was a brother-sister relationship theme. The main characters are twins and they have lots of common. The story begins when they meet for the first time after the ten years of no connection. The circumstance was strange as they both were depressed who attempt for a self kill. That does not end successfully, instead narration commence for us where they share each others memory of the past by trying to shape up the present life. But still the old habits won't let them alone as they encounter life changing decisions by the end of the story.

Kind of a rare movie, all about the twins' bonding told in a humourous way, mostly. Mistakes are the essence of the script. The fall and rise were cleverly constructed throughout around those two characters. The cast was the plus point. Since it was about twins, Wiig and Hader are perfectly fit for their respective roles. As for Bill Hader, I've never seen he donned in a higher ranked role like this. He was always been a co-star and in this film he's one of the leads. Everybody gets their time right like awesome Timothy Spall in 'Mr. Turner'.

In this movie, these two lead performers were absolutely spot on. But the lack of pace is a challenge. If you pass through it successfully, you would get a nice entertainment. If not, the movie would be dull, pale, even it could be worse film of the year for you. Anyway, still it falls short to be an excellent film, I consider it to be a just good movie. Worth a watch, but the movie won't stay in your memory for so long.

198663.0,The Maze Runner,"Set in a post-apocalyptic world, young Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow “runners” for a shot at escape.",Remember.

In this case, to compensate that the main characters are often women, we just make the whole cast to be men.

Just forget about this. || It was a good movie as far as it goes -- resourceful characters deprived of both freedom and their memories manage to build a society and think their way out of their bondage.  The problem is that at the end, it simply stopped.  No dramatic reason for ending where it does, no resolution of ""why did the captors do this?"" .  Even in a series a movie ought to have a decent local climax -- for example,  Kat and Peeta winning the Hunger Games. || One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.

On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a “young adult” movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.

In my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.

I did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?

Sometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.

Bottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.

J. Soria, John Carroll Lynch",Peter Sattler,"military officer, guantanamo bay, female soldier, female protagonist, american abroad, military police, military, unlikely friendship, detainee, female, prisoners","> Right from the beginning events of the scenes are poorly intensified.

It was a one sided narration, that is really a very bad for this kind of sensitive theme. But the prime intention was to bring the Guantanamo Bay detention camp's atrocity on the detainees by the US military. Well, it actually avoids those strong cruelties, and focuses the unusual relationship between a detainee and a woman guard.

Limited cast, shot mostly in a single location with the budget of just one million USD, and an ordinary opening, but ended strong. I assumed a lot of things likely to happen while I was watching. Like Amy Cole (Kristen Stewart) was in undercover, to make detainees talk and collect the information. Because she was the only woman around, but as usual like most of the time I was wrong. It was so plain and filled with human emotions.

I was strong and confident that they were just torturing the terrorists who deserved it. If you see it from the human perspective that was slightly a over-limit, only if you exclude their crimes. I just felt it was a propaganda to show US in a bad light. That is the reason it will not show terror strikes in the movie that committed by any of the detainee characters, but only the consequences they face.

A Hollywood movie specially made to make feel good for the terrorists and those who support it. Okay, I agree, some were innocents. While fishing, a few other marine animals also gets trapped in the net as well, for that I feel sorry what happened to them. But 95% of them were heartless monsters. Everyone will have their own opinion on this film based on their religion, nationality or sympathetic for simply being a human, and everything are fair.

6/10 || As a fan of Kristen Stewart, Camp X-Ray felt like an intimate exploration of her ability to embody complex emotions. Stewart’s portrayal of Private Amy Cole was nothing short of captivating—her quiet strength and vulnerability brought the character to life, making her moral dilemmas deeply relatable. Watching her navigate the challenging environment of Guantanamo Bay, you could feel the internal conflict that defines her journey.

One of the standout aspects of the movie was the chemistry between Stewart and Peyman Moaadi, who played Ali Amir. Their interactions carried much of the emotional weight of the film, adding nuance to the otherwise stark contrast between a soldier and a detainee. Moaadi’s performance was poignant, offering glimpses of humanity and resilience, which made you wish the film delved deeper into his character’s story.

This brings me to the one significant shortcoming of the movie—the missed opportunity for better pacing and more balanced storytelling. With nearly two hours of runtime, the film focused heavily on Cole’s perspective while leaving the detainees’ backstories and character development underexplored. Given the rich potential of such a setting, this felt like an oversight. It wasn’t just a missed narrative opportunity; it also impacted the emotional depth of the film, which could have been much stronger if we had seen more of the detainees’ humanity and struggles.

That said, the production and direction were solid, creating an authentic and immersive portrayal of life in Guantanamo Bay. The setting felt real, and the atmosphere added tension to every interaction. The film’s quieter moments, though slow at times, were effective in highlighting the isolation and monotony that defined the characters’ lives.

Overall, Camp X-Ray is a film worth watching, particularly for Kristen Stewart’s heartfelt performance. While it could have been a more well-rounded story, the themes of connection, humanity, and moral ambiguity still shine through. It’s a movie that lingers in your thoughts, not for what it achieved, but for what it could have achieved with a more balanced approach"

It makes me think of what would have been had my favourite actor ever, James Cagney, hadn't basically retired for the quiet life in the early 60's, when the perfect storm of 'great actors in B-movies' hit the fans.

My lady is more a horror aficionado, and of recent vintage films, so it was nice to throw this on for a spin and show her its neo-noir tendencies, almost as if going through a 'make your own movie' template, checking them off one-by-one. I don't mind that sort of rote predictability if it's done right, and, though heavily flawed, for the most part it does. By the climax, I basically only cared for four things: that the kidnapped girl, Matthew Scudder and TJ were alive, and that the two kidnappers/murderers got their just desserts, whether it be lengthy incarceration or murder, anything so their crime spree would be ended. The film was well-made and a very enjoyable experience, so considering the relatively minor flaws (especially the one-dimensional aspect of the antagonists), I would definitely recommend at least a watch for most cinephiles out there, especially those interested in 'true crime' type of contemporary American cinema. || This movie had quite some premise and it is a decent enough movie but, sadly, it never really rises out of the ordinary. We have some really despicable criminals and I mean some real creepy nutcases and we have Liam Neeson as a gritty former cop turned private investigator. Good recipe to start with I would say.

Unfortunately it never really took off. Liam Neeson is doing a good job of portraying the former cop and he is pretty much making the picture. The creepy guys are, well creepy but they never really get to shine in their creepiness. Most of the other characters around are just decoration with the possible exception of the young brat whom I personally just found annoying.

Speaking of annoying I have to say that the AA sessions and the voice overs from them pretty much falls into that very category. They felt at best like unnecessary fillers to me. I do not know why it is so popular to portray “heroes” as drunks or former drunks.

The movie is not a quick paced one. It is more of a thriller than a action one although there are a few outbursts of action. Sometimes it goes quite far down the road of some real detective work and sometimes it just jumps about leaving a few inconsistencies and plot wholes hanging around.

I would say that this movie is a fairly ordinary, good but nothing special, crime story about two psychopaths and a gritty former coop given the task of chasing them down. Without Liam Neeson as a lead actor more or less carrying the movie along it would have been a fairly bland movie."

A German cyber-thriller from the director of 'The Silence'. The second half of the title 'Kein Systen ist Sicher' means 'No System is Safe' in English. So far, lots of films were made on this theme, but nothing was quite delightful as this one. Mainly because of the young cast and the depiction of the contemporary cyber world. With its incredible pace and the exciting storyline, in addition to that, some unexpected twists and turns, the film would easily surpass anybody's anticipation.

It hits the right chord at the right time to bring some of the wonderful scenes. But as usual like any thriller films, the third act was its strength where it peaked that caused to flip its narration to the different facet. There are positives and negatives in the hacking business, but what I witnessed in this was some kind of digital gang war which directly affected the law-enforcement agency. A virtually conflict between two gangs for their superiority over the cyber's underworld. That means don't imagine like an online game between two, but beyond that.

Usually the hackers are the sidekicks for the film's main characters. That's how most of the films depicted them and we know it. But there are some films that highlighted them on the first priority base, yet no film convinced me their genuine acts, both, virtually as well as physically to achieve their goals as in this one. I meant this film was not all about programming, cracking passwords, stealing data, releasing viruses, definitely not about a computer geek,

But yes, it was something like that whose world changes after encountering a small gang like him. They're all experts in different fields and together unstoppable, who later form a team nicknamed CLAY to make friend with the world's number one hacker MRX. After under-appreciated and humiliation, the CLAY dares their icon and urge to take his place, but the plan terribly fails. That's how the story takes a grand venture that brings the secret police into frame to expand its plot to a more interesting conclusion.

> ""When the life gives you lemons, ask for salt and tequila.""

The balance between all its contents were awesome. Not the whole time they sit in front of the computer and do the stuffs, but there many real outside world adventures. Because there's a belief among us that everything can be done playing with the computer keyboard which proved wrong here. Besides, there was a small slice of romance, and the magic trick which briefly illustrates the film's important phase that holds the key to understand the happenings. The overall narration was a flashback that opens in a police station where our main hero of the story was investigated. He himself compares with the superheroes and the hacking ability is his superpower.

Its not only the racy pace, but the energetic performances by the young actors was also the reason for the film's uplift. From the technical aspect, it was superbly written, directed and edited film. In some way, the film also resembles 'Fight Club' and 'The Usual Suspects'. Looks like the lead character was a big fan of those films and that's how it got influenced. I would have said many things about this film comparing with those two, but I'm trying to avoid the spoiler and it is possible only if I never brought this topic into here. But anyway, this film was one of the hardest nuts to crack what's coming next.

Talking about the twist, it feels like the same old tricks from some of the old Hollywood blockbusters. But you should be patience till the film to end, because that part matters a lot. Probably that's where anyone who watched it will decide how much they liked it. The film generated its own trademark with the black hood and the white mask which already got a cult status among its fans. The  rock music was awesomely matched with this theme.

There is a Hollywood version is coming, but I'm hoping for not to mess it up like the majority of remakes does. In the mean time, I'll look forward to an announcement of a possible sequel, because films like this should end in a trilogy. Especially in the todays film business, trilogies are the greatest achievements that followed by the original film's success. If you had loved this film and after seeing the way it ended you won't say no to that. This film is not for IT techies alone, but anyone would enjoy it. Surely I recommend it for who're interested in crime, thriller.

8/10 || A very controversial film. German directors as always surprised. Very pleased with references to the ""Fight Club"" Chuck Palahniuk. But personally, I did not like that so little attention is paid to the program side of the issue. Not a single one of the real applications was mentioned, but was worth it.

A multinationally produced film product. The story as well won't take place in one place, but travels around the different continents. It is when 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' meets 'The Ultimate Gift'. A very inspiring theme, made by 'Serendipity' director which is his first film since last five years. Looks like it is his career best, at least in my perspective it is. The film talks about the different human moods, especially about the search for happiness as the title suggest.

Being I am a movie fanatic, I won't watch great flicks every day. It is not easy to come by, sometimes I have to go through 5 movies, sometimes 10 and sometimes a month long wait. In my recent watch I liked so many flicks, but never considered them as my favourites until this one. Like I said its been months and I am super excited with this film.

As usual, my nemesis, the critics led it to the box office flop. I am saying the same thing that it's definitely not suit for critics, but families (excluding kids) and mainly middle-aged people. It will be too early for children to understand the movie and there is a nudity, but no sex scenes. The old people can enjoy watching it, but won't inspire them like 'The Bucket List' did.

> ""Do you have any children, doctor?
> My husband and I, it was our only regret. We couldn't.
> But, you know what? It was bloody good fun trying.""

Usually for the western countries, self-discover means visiting India. We have seen movies like 'The Darjeeling Limited', 'Eat Pray Love' and many more that focuses on the similar subjects. This film gets rid of that so called cliche and goes ahead with different locations. The title character Hector goes for a such mission looking for happiness through self-discovery, meets different people and their cultures. Even he undergoes several life threatening situations and also meets his past (people) only to clear his head.

Hector was a very fond of Tintin comic books, he kind of imagines that he's Tintin and his dog as Snowy, but there's no confirmation in this regard in the movie. The adventure he takes exactly depicts what Tintin stories do. Looks his mood was kind of affect since his childhood. In the opening scene, he loses his dog which represented his 'Happiness'. Also, where the 'Unhappiness' (probably his girlfriend in his real world) rose above and tailed him since. These are simply my theory considering unexplained things or trying to crack down the hidden messages.

I won't deny that some of the ideas were borrowed from the other flicks. It might not be as fancy as 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', but it had some of its own great momentum like, laughs, craziness, emotions, romance and adventures. I have not seen Simon Pegg's all the movies, but in this he was never seen before avatar. I'll definitely remember it for him as long as I'll be in this film watching business. I was expecting his usual comedy, but I was absolutely blown away for witnessing an uplifting movie. If you focus deeply on the narration, you could virtually experience passing through all those provinces shown in the film. Definitely one of the top 10 films from the year 2014. I highly recommend it, certainly a must watch.

The first word I said after the watch was 'unbelievable'. That means the movie is not bad, but how come I missed it for this long. This is the best dark-fantasy movie I have seen recently. But earlier, I thought it would be like the movie 'Tusk' which made me a little uncomfortable to watch. So in the end, what's the difference between the tusk and/or the horn. Both come in a pair and animals have it to defend themselves from the threat. When I watched that movie, I lost interest in this. Yep, it is a silly reason and now I feel bad for that.

This movie dominated by the British cast, especially for having Daniel Radcliffe and Juno Temple I thought it was British film, actually it was not. It was a Canadian-US jointly produced, adapted from a book of the same name and directed by 'Mirror' director. The story was so good, not genuine, though explored the theme very well. For every few minutes later, the narration was taking a turn and that made the plot to get lot tighter before heading for the concluding part.

Maybe this the best movie of Radcliffe that I've seen after his goodbye to 'Harry Potter' movie series. I don't think he's a chocolate boy type, but this kind of movie suits him well. I think he should get muscles for more movie like this, but his height is another negative factor. The film was entirely shot in Canada, the photography was great, music as well as performances. Even those settings like woods, tree house feels kind of wet English and Scottish atmosphere that fits for a devilish mythical charactered movie like this. I regret for reviewing it so delayedly, but anyway I did it and over it, so I hope you watch it very soon as well if you haven't seen it yet.

7/10 || I was looking forward to this film going into it, based on a highly entertaining book, but ultimately it was just okay.

Well shot and directed, Daniel Radcliffe is the best thing about it, but it lacked the punch and dark humour of the novel. Juno Temple's character feels painfully underwritten, as do most of the 2nd tier characters. The worst part is it takes itself way too seriously for such a silly premise. There is some destructive chaotic fun, but not enough of it. The creature design for the finale is very cool, then the film just sort of stops rather than giving a satisfying wrap up. 

Could have, should have been much better, maybe that's my fault because I was expecting more. Still watchable, even if not memorable. || Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

Trigger warning: rape and murder.

It's in the premise, but certain information sources hide some things more than others.

Some movies are hurt by trying to be too many things, but this finds a wonderful balance between a murder mystery and religiously mythical.  I think it is that they compliment each other.  Regardless of why Daniel Radcliffe's character has been imbued with horns, the powers he gains serve toward revealing the mystery.  I never felt like there was a dead spot where the story wasn't moving forward or we were re-hashing all the details: they do a good job of keeping the relevant information at the fore front and refreshing the information on pace.

Why it is a great premise, it is awfully sad one, but I do feel it helps humanize Daniel Radcliffe almost immediately, and he retains his like-ability throughout the film just for the shear insanity of his situation.

It is also a lot of fun to see how the power of the horns affect the different townsfolk."

*** This review contains minor spoilers ***

It doesn't have James Wan's name on the director's chair, but it's every inch a James Wan film. There seems to be a rut that has emerged where this new brand of horror film makers can't see that recycling the same ideas is, well, kinda dull.

Insidious, Dead Silence and The Conjuring have their critics (not me, I like them all very much), but the timing was right for them to hit the mark of many a horror film lover. Tapping into the fear of the doll and the demon hadn't been done for some time, certainly not with any conviction, so all good there for the fans.

Annabelle spins off from The Conjuring, and Dead Silence to a degree, but just comes off as a lazy cash-cow. The doll is a spooky monstrosity (most unlike the real Rag-Dolly-Anna version), but it's all a bit of a con, the makers resorting to another demonic being, only Red Darth Maul has now been replaced by Blue Lagoon The Loon.

Character's actions are often preposterous, stretching credulity to breaking point (I know you are being menaced by the unknown, but I got a conference to go to, sleep tight babe!). Elsewhere, while everyone acknowledges that what scares you is subjective, but the scares here are very thin on the ground, not helped by a dull script and bland lead actors.

It's tidy enough a production, granted, but familiarity breeds contempt and it's hoped that Wan's return to the director's chair for The Conjuring 2 (where we revisit the realm of poltergeist activity), signals a return to form for his horror stable. 5/10 || I personally am of the opinion that _The Conjuring_ was pretty overrated, but I at least I could see why some people thought it was okay. _Annabelle_ on the other hand, was never at any point anything other than hackneyed, unoriginal garbage. No saving graces to be found here.

_Final rating:★ - Of no value. Avoid at all costs._ || The movie isn't really that scary. It's still a good movie. Just that dam porcelain doll looks creepy as hell."

If you think Dracula becoming a hero and a martyr is a good idea, you will like it. Otherwise, like in my case, you will think that it was the worst idea in quite some time.

So, Dracula is not the most evil creature in the world any more ... :( || That the so called “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes screws this movie over is not really a surprise. Said “critics” are usually out of sync with both my opinions and the opinions of most of the viewers which can be seen again from the fact that these people give this movie a 23% rating whereas the actual viewers give it a 60% rating. At lot of “purists” also seem to take a disliking to this movie. Well, the movie is named Dracula Untold so it should be no surprise that the story would be a new one.

Personally I found this movie quite enjoyable. Yes it is not the original Dracula story but it is not straying too far from the basic origins and it is really a quite decent story unlike some of the disastrous Hollywood rewrites. The original story claims that Dracula became a vampire during his battles with the Turks and this movie picks up on that and tells the story of how that happened. Unlike most (all?) Dracula movies, Dracula is not really the bad guy but rather the inverse and the movie tells a story about sacrifices and Dracula’s quest to keep some of his humanity, moral and sanity.

It would not be a Dracula movie without some blood flowing and this movie delivers without overdoing it. Actually the actual bloodsucking stuff is quite played down until the end of the movie. There are a fair amount of fights against the Turks (who are the real bad guys in this movie) though and blood as well as various body parts no longer attached to their proper places does float around quite a bit. The special effects are not forgotten and I quite liked the bat swarms that Dracula commanded during the final fights against the Turks.

I found Luke Evans performance as the prince and unwilling Dracula to be quite good. The rest of the characters were also well played. I am sure that none of them will be nominated for Oscars due to their part in this movie but I have nothing negative to say about their performance.

On the whole I found this movie quite enjoyable and I definitely disagree with all the people blasting it. I did also quite like the last couple of scenes in modern time at the end which teased of a follow up movie. I would definitely like to see that happen. || Dracula: The dark Superman

RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Gary Shore, ""Dracula Untold” tells the origin of Dracula: In the 15th century Prince Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) must protect his small kingdom of Wallachia (in modern-day Romania) from a Turk warlord (Dominic Cooper) who demands a thousand boys from Wallachia & Transylvania, including Vlad’s son. Threatened by the unsurmountable Turk army, Vlad desperately makes a dubious pact with a formidable caged vampire in order to acquire its dark powers and save his family & kingdom. Sarah Gadon plays Vlad’s winsome wife. 

The producers flirted with the idea of “Dracula Untold” being part of Universal’s Dark Universe; and the epilogue of the movie, set in the modern world, suggests this, insinuating a franchise. This idea was dropped, however, and “The Mummy” (2017) became the first official film in the Dark Universe. In any case, “Dracula Untold” was fairly successful at the Box Office, making $56.3 million in North America and $217.1 million worldwide against a cost of $70 million.

My title blurb pretty much tells you all you need to know: “Dracula Untold” is basically the dark Superman of 15th century Eastern Europe where Dracula wields the power to defeat a thousand-man army. If you like the great prologue to Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992), you’ll probably like this movie, which gives several nods to that forerunner. 

The film LOOKS awesome and has a fine cast. But unlike “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” it’s rapidly paced and doesn’t leave much room to breathe; so the characterizations aren’t quite deep enough. It’s good, but somehow hollow and forgettable. “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” was perhaps a little too slow while “Dracula Untold” is too hurried. I wish the creators found the happy medium between the two because, with just a little bit more time and attention to detail, it could’ve been great.              
                   
THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot entirely in Northern Ireland. WRITERS: Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.

This is like an extended version of 'Prisoners'. Sets in a small snowy Canadian town where a ten year old girl was mysteriously disappeared and so the film focused on the life of her parents who are eager to see her even after 8 years past. The cops and parents, hopelessly look for any clue of her being alive. Happy or sad ending, that's what the film's conclusion decides. Maybe the director was inspired to make this by his previous film, which was similar and based on the real, but that ends differently.

Films like this scares if you are a family man. But I think if we keep watching them at the time of it comes out, it is to alert us about our family security lapse. No matter whatever the country is, how safety it is, as they say, still thing like this happens in an eye blink time. The film is really something big, I wanted to like it, but they did not make the film right.

Not a bad film, only badly made, that's all. The characters, the concept had potential and the development ruined it everything. Nearly 75 per cent of the film was a drag. Everything we wanted to know is in first 15 and the last 30 minutes. In between, they have wasted in the name of development, hence the film failed to impress as what it promised, not from the message perspective and that's the point.

Not all the actors were good, particularly Ryan Reynolds was the best. The remaining ones were okay, though Rosario Dawson was the next best thing in the film. I did not like the presentation, it was so random to move from and forth between in the 8 years time span, it totally messed the film. Not only confuses the viewers, it gained nothing from it. Because usually this kind of narration method used to bring twist and turns and audience to keep guessing till the final, but in this case, it did not work at all. Other than that the film was better than it was criticised, I still suggest it for the adults because of the film theme.

Australian cinematic siblings the Spierig Brothers (as in Michael and Peter) dutifully direct and adapt Heinlein’s Science Fiction material into a twisty tale of search and suspense. It was reported that Heinlein wrote his intriguing narrative in one single day back in the late 1950s. Well, whatever the case is behind such speculation, it is clear that ‘Predestination’ is a competent and compelling time travel vehicle that deserves its inevitable comparison to the likes of Rian Johnon’s solid and involving 2012 inventive spectacle ‘Looper’. 

The Spierig Brothers and ‘Predestination’ lead Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated for ‘Training Day’ and ‘Boyhood’) collaborate once again as they bring together a surreal movie experience detailing with the agenda of a Temporal Agent going undercover as a barkeep known as The Bartender (Hawke) in an attempt to thwart criminal activities before they turn into actual crimes. It is worth noting that the Spierigs have coveted the zombies/vampires sensationalism in their earlier films (‘Undead’ and ‘Daybreakers’) but curiously side-swipe any references to these creatures in ‘Predestination’ despite the aforementioned ‘All You Zombies’ blueprint for inspiration. Perhaps this is a wise revelation as the Spierigs are allowed to concentrate on the ponderous SF aspects of human adventure within the varied dimensions of time, place and space.

The daring exposition gels both creatively and caustically because of the macabre mission being undertaken by the Bartender and feminine targeted scriber ‘The Unmarried Mother’ (as portrayed by Aussie actress Sarah Snook, ‘Jessabelle’). The agent Bartender is represented by a shadowy and roguish governmental outfit blessed with the ability to fight crime through time-traveling tactics. Unfortunately, the rough edges in preventing crime-ridden hedonism through time travel accessibility has not always been a smooth transition for the Agency. Also, it does not help that the constant policing corruption has spiraled out of control thus adding more pressure to the Agency to perform its watchdog duties tackling sinister plots.

There are revolving elements that shape ‘Predestination’ to become this enigmatic, head-scratching puzzle where the sense of encountering warped worlds are wondrous yet unsettling and weird. The Bartender (already a victimized and distressed pawn in the nefarious dealings of the id-70s New York City’s elusive and crazed Fizzle Bomber) soon encounters a stranger betting him that he (or ‘she’ in certain cases) can provide the most outlandish story that he has ever heard to date. Soon the boastful stranger (Snook), a ‘True Confessions’ columnist for the written piece ‘The Unmarried Mother’, will figure into the Bartender’s predestined existence in more ways than one.

‘Predestination’ is a complicated SF sideshow that touched upon some unconventional fodder that range from timely commentary pertaining to violence to topical issues of sexuality. The film skillfully presents the frailties of suspicion, apprehension and uncertainty within the tangled and playful web of time travel management. With all the nifty under-sized flashy special effects and Science Fiction trickery aside, ‘Predestination’ sparkles in large part to its committed and calculating performances by Hawke and Snook as the psychological bait that guides the audience into the transfixing insanity that persists within the confines of the storylines. In particular, Snook’s ‘Mother’ is called upon to offer a complex characterization of an individual (both female and male genders) and take us into the nostalgic timelines of the past and present while conveying shades of toughness, vulnerability and mystique. She has a sordid backstory that unfolds and adds to the tormented trials and tribulations with the obsession of catching the scheming Fizzle Bomber. In a convincing supporting role, Noah Taylor’s Mr. Robertson is instrumental in the development of Snook’s triple identity crisis as Jane/John/’Mother’.

There certainly is an old-fashioned, spellbinding vibe about ‘Predestination’ that propels the Spierigs’ trippy time-traveling spectacle to its climatic ambitions. The low-key production values are surprisingly engaging but overall the telling proof of acting, directing, writing and imagination seems to be a winning formula in conception. Of course, the other filmmaking strokes involving the crisp cinematography, soothing score and vibrant set designs further compliments this punchy actioner.

Dark, moody and visibly challenging, 'Predestination’ gleefully plots and twists its way into a hearty submission of inspired Science Fiction contemplation. After all, time does not stand still for anybody especially in the realm of Australian noir SF sensibilities.

Predestination (2014)

Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions

1 hr.  37 mins.

Starring: Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor

Directed by: Michael and Peter Spierig

Rated: R

Genre: Science Fiction/Time Travel thriller/Sci-Fi crime caper

Critic’s rating: *** stars (out of four stars) || The one thing that this job has taught me is that truth is stranger than fiction.

Out of Australia, Predestination is directed by Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig (who also scores the music). The Spierig's also adapt the screenplay from Robert A. Heinlein's story ""All You Zombies"". It stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, Noah Taylor, Christopher Kirby and Madeleine West. Ben Nott is the cinematographer. 

If we throw up a simple synopsis for this pic, it's about a time travelling agent who goes back in time to stop a killer known as ""The Fizzle Bomber"" - whilst helping a trans-gender man who has just told him a fascinating and emotionally wrought story. But simple is not a word readily associated with the Spierig's deliriously complicated mind meld of a movie. 

The first half of film is the story being relayed by Snook to Hawke, and then the film spirals into a world of temporal loops and frazzled paradoxes. This demands the utmost attention from the viewer, a piece guaranteed to have you asking tricky questions, and also likely to have you rewinding some scenes for clarity - like I did!

This is not an actioner, this is very cerebral and sedate in tone, adult science fiction that's as audacious as it is clever. Snook is quite simply outstanding, the various layers she gives to her characterisations grip with intensity and emotional heart tugs. Hawke once again is reassuringly great - in that how he doesn't need to overact, he recognises the tone needed here, whilst knowing it's wise to let his co-star take the main stage.

Thematically the story blends its dizzying thoughts about time and its impact on the human race, with that of our basic human condition, that of identity. This is a very rewarding production for those who wont be popping off to make a cup of coffee during the viewing, it's hoped that in time this will garner more fans and be seen as something of a sci-fi gem. 8/10 || **Rare excellent story - you cannot predict whatsoever**

When's the last time you saw a film and could not even come close to predicting the ending.

When's the last time after you saw a film you had to call up your best friends and tell them they have to see this.

When's the last time you had a guest over and asked if they wanted to see a seriously twisted film - you couldn't resist that a near stranger would miss the chance to see this.

If you're in the mood for a mind luck (ie. if fish = lish ^_^) you will not want to pass this up.

Way way fun.

Can be watched - and seriously enjoyed - multiple times --> no small feat these days."

A documentary style horror comedy based on the short film of the same name by the same directors. I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.

Definitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.

Quite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a cliché, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept. So I still recommend it because it is worth a watch.

6/10 || 'What We Do In The Shadows' is an hilarious mockumentary film by the makers of 'Flight of the Conchords'. The movie is filed with brilliant homages and references to vampire films such as 'The Lost Boys', 'Twilight' and 'Let The Right One In'.

The directorial style is very similar to the hit TV show 'The Office' as it is able to create humour in the realism and personal interviews and monologues. This method also allows it to be genuinely scary at times such as when we meet the housemate inspired by 'Nosferatu'. The extreme and realistic gore also comes across as very brutal and juxtaposes the silly gags. 

The actors are all very good. Dead pan. Great delivery.

★★★★ || Not the vampires we wanted but the vampires we needed.
Say whatever about Taika Waititi, but he is a capable screen writer, director and comedian.

It is story about a bunch of vampires in a reality show and their interaction with the modern world, that made Waititi a famous director."

Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary” guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into some silly “oh should I really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.

The plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.

Keanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.

Then of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it … so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.

One thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or “obligatory” scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is “the bad guys will pay” all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed off.

Needless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday. || I don't get why this movie has such good reviews. It simple and quite uninteresting. Lots of actions and well known faces (many from TV series), but nothing else. The same old brainless plot to justify tons of bullets. || Woof!

Keanu Reeves is the John Wick of the title, a grieving one man army who gets tipped over the edge when gangsters kill his dog. Carnage ensues.

The paying public do like a good revenge flick, there have been plenty this last couple of decades, and they do go down well. Once the set-up has been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.

Wick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions. Enjoy. 7/10"

The special effects are incredible and the sound is brilliant. The film is very gory and there are lots of explosions and body parts flying all over the place.

I could tell that the movie was trying to follow in the footsteps of 'Saving Private Ryan' by stealing a lot of the characters and trying to recreate the depth and heart of that film. However, it didn't realise that 'Saving Private Ryan' took a lot of ideas from old war movies and paid homage to them whilst delivering awe-inspiring and moving scenes of battles.

'Fury' did not have this. A lot of the dialogue and interaction between characters was laughable. The romance that tried to be thrown in at the middle of the film did not work and just seemed bizarre, The characters were one-dimensional and just seemed like walking stereotypes. The film felt more like 'Tropic Thunder' than 'Saving Private Ryan'. 

'Fury''s lack of long shots of the landscapes and battles meant that the film did not seem as vast or beautiful as other films of the genre.

However, the action scenes were very well done and it was exciting and superbly directed.

★★★½ || I knew that quite a few people had complained about the realism in this movie even though it hold high ratings on most movie sites. I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.

I can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.

The movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likeable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the “heroes” are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where “Wardaddy” forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I’ll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.

Having said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.

The pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.

The “last stand” at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our “heroes” have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f… did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.

The ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed."

His cowardly fellow townspeople then betray him, forcing him to hunt down the outlaws alone.",Bad men will bleed.,"Drama, Western",92.0,2014-05-22,da,6.48,881.0,1.6925,"Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Mikael Persbrandt, Éric Cantona","Kristian Levring, Kristian Levring, Anders Thomas Jensen","corruption, war veteran, coffin, gang leader, frontier, money, revenge, murder, extortion, mute, oil, gang, shootout, undertaker, train, one man army, criminal, wild west, rape and revenge, 19th century, vengeance, payback","Sometimes you gotta sacrifice a single sheep to save the rest.

The Salvation is directed by Kristian Levring and Levring co-writes the screenplay with Anders Thomas Jensen. It stars Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Cantona, Mikael Persbrandt, Jonathan Pryce and Douglas Henshall. Music is by Kasper Winding and cinematography by Jens Schlosser.

1871 and ex-patriot Danish soldier Jon Jensen (Mikkelsen) is, after 7 years of foundation building, welcoming his wife and son to a new life in America. But after they all board a stagecoach bound for their homestead, events will see that journey not be completed. And thus begins a tale of retribution and redemption. 

There are few smiles in The Salvation, in fact viewers will need to grab onto the sparse offerings of such very early in the piece. For it's a film of blood, brooding and misery, of intensity and a paucity of the good side of human nature. Levring has managed to successfully blend the traditions of the American Western with the feel of the Euro Spaghetti Oaters. There is so much for Western fans to enjoy here. It's a classic revenger pumped by a good versus bad heart, yet as pared down and as simple as the story may at first seem, there's interesting asides of worth. 

The issue of Euro immigrants trying to make it in the Wild West is noteworthy, while there's a delicious juxtaposition between two soldiers from different continents, and different wars. Jensen fought the Germans in Europe, while his nemesis, Henry Delarue (Morgan), has been through the Indian wars. A most interesting comparison, one where the characterisations are vividly opposed to each other. Add in a good old town in the grip of a tyrant theme, and a bit of carnal desires upon thine brother's spouse, and it's a spicy hot pot.

Filmed at dusty South African locations, there's a scenic beauty surrounding the harsh story. Westerns don't have to be filmed in America to look authentic, and this is a case in point. The town of Black Creek has been called fake looking in some quarters, not so. This is a new up-coming town, it's meant to be wooden and sparse. Hell! The saloon is also the local store, the mayor is also the undertaker, this is a basic Wild West town without frills and fancy.

Elsewhere the costuming is splendid, especially Morgan who is nicely dapper in black hat and crimson mack, and there's a whole host of face fuzz on show, which is needed to keep up the whole mud and blood, hard West factor. Levring has an eye for a nice shot, such as a full moon bearing witness, even a traditional slow-mo piece. All that said, irks do exist, Green's character is sketchily drawn, but she's playing a heaving bosom mute (her tongue was cut out by the pesky Indians), so scope for development is admittedly limited. While Winding's score is a bit too modern sounding for the key shoot-out sequences.

Ultimately it's great to see the Western is still thriving in this day and age of CGI and blockbuster pandering. From the shattering and moody first quarter to the bloody and excellently staged finale, The Salvation keeps the Western genre well and truly alive. 9/10 || > Revenge for a revenge.

It is a Danish western revenge flick set in the American soil, so 99 per cent it was in the English language. Well, in my opinion, it is underrated for sure. It was not anything stylish like QT's recent western films, but quite usual presentation yet very majestic. The story takes place in a couple of days in a small town in the 1871. The turnaround in the theme was great. Initially, it leaves an impression of a revenge based tale, but later becomes oil warfare, something quite resembles the original situation of the American at that time.

In the last few weeks I have been watching lots of comedies, dramas and other soft themed films, so suddenly I felt too much violence from this. But as always I get used to it after some time in the watch. Great cast and their great performances. The writing was superb along with the settings. I watched it quite late, but the best western I have seen in the recent time, so I strongly recommended for western fans and others who're seeking a fine entertainment.

7.5/10 || This is a decent enough Danish-made spaghetti western. Nothing more and nothing less. It could easily have been a young Clint Eastwood in this movie. Instead the lead character is Mads Mikkelsen who makes a quite reasonable performance as far as I am concerned.

I have to say that it felt a bit funny when the characters spoke Danish in the first parts of the movie. It did add a bit of special touch, at least for me, to the movie though. I guess that people who do not understand Danish may be less thrilled about that though.

The movie itself is a fairly straightforward good guy versus bad guy revenge story. It is a good old-fashioned Western without any silly complicated plot and without trying to make any attempts to show the “real” west or put a social spin on it. It is clearly made to entertain those who like classical spaghetti westerns. Personally I find it nice that someone are still willing, and can get funding, to make those kind of movies. I liked both Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green, although her role is mute, as well as Jeffery Dean Morgan as the bad guy.

Having said that, the movie falls a bit short of being a great spaghetti western. It never really manages to create that grim atmosphere around the lead character when he embarks on the road of revenge and I have to say that the end fight felt a bit meh.

Nevertheless this is a decent enough movie which should please most fans of classical old Western movies. I for one consider it a worthwhile addition to my collection."

Any movie that gets me to well up with tears is an automatic winner in my book.

I always wanted to see Bill Murray play a grumpy old man, and this movie is a little more ""About a Boy"" than ""Up!"", but it's a good middle ground between the two.

There is something wholesome, even when it's specifically not, about a kid being taught life lessons by someone.  It's something special that I feel like I haven't see enough of, and I'd love to do myself.

It's also interesting to see a coming of age story that doesn't revolve around the character coming of age and a romance.  It is possible to grow up without focusing on sex, it's like a reverse Bechdel test.

I must not have been as familiar with her special comedic skills then as I am now or I would have remembered.

This is one of my favorite quiet films. It ends up as a feel good movie — one of those where a large group of people appreciate someone at the end. Like anything from the Alan King character in Memories of Me (at his funeral!) to the exceedingly less likable Al Pacino jerk in Scent of a Woman. I believe the Vin character would be less likable himself in the hands of many actors. I have been pleasantly surprised at Bill Murray’s acting curve since Saturday Night Live. He brings bits of himself into most roles, I think, but he is great at subtle gestures, tone of voice, pausing for effect, and other tools of acting. He reminds me of Mark Ryland, who also makes acting look easy. I actually feel sure that Murray’s totally improvised the final scene during the end credits where he waters a plant and everything else in his back yard.

I like that the movie doesn’t take shallow, cheap shots at people like it could. Even the cheating, divorcing dad is given a more positive spin before we are done. The four main actors are terrific here, and the two child actors who play Oliver and the bully are great also. 

As a side note, I saw a statistical oddity on a certain review site name after a rotten vegetable (or fruit, depending upon who you ask), as this is the only movie I have looked up that has the exact same rating by both the critics and the audience (78). That sounds about right to me, too. And speaking of credits, I really need to try to stop wincing when I see The Weinsteins listed in the opening credits."

Here we have a sociopath for the digital age. A _Taxi Driver_ for the early 21st Century. Louis Bloom might have been born yesterday, just before taking an online course in Small Business Management, the new way to self-educate, without the petty annoyances of human contact and interaction. Every basic lesson he absorbed is put to the test with the obsessive solitary singular purpose of succeeding. Jake Gyllenhaal immerses himself in the role with psychotic stupor. He speaks with the same forward-plotting conviction whether tossing about obvious clichés or revealing something brilliant. The perfect entrepreneur. A maniacal detached idiot savant on a ruthless predatory mission. Morality and the legal system are minor roadblocks to dodge, riddles to resolve, sentiments to overcome. His brand of narcissistic psychosis is a genetic mutation that insures the survival of the species. Like an Aryan bulldozer, he cripples and kills the weak, exploiting the flaws in humanity, cannibalizing the limits of civilization, and capitalizing on each opportunity every step of the way, all for his own personal gain. All while intuiting which backs to scratch and/or stab and when. The perfect entrepreneur. The quintessential post-9/11 movie hero. Where Travis Bickle sought to take down corruption to rescue the innocent, Louis Bloom does the opposite, preying on the fallen and severing the social codes and mores that bind us for his own solitary success. American Exceptionalism. Nightcrawler is nanoeconomics in its purest, most wicked and vicious form. I'm sure some may see it not so much as a comment on what ails us but as an inspiration to venture out from, and Bloom as a persistent determined role model to imitate. How-to-Succeed-in Business-Without-Feeling. Humanity is merely a construct that can be subjugated, an apparatus to dismantle, a child's toy for the child that wants it all. || 'Nightcrawler' is a neo noir thriller starring a very impressive (and thin) Jake Gyllenhaal which cleverly satirises the media industry's obsession with horror and violence.

The poster's correlation with Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' is a very clear choice because they are very similar in how they're made in terms of themes and even soundtrack. The film is also very similar to Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and David Fincher's 'Seven' as the cinematography is very bleak and dark.

The story is disturbingly gripping as the audience view Lou Bloom's rise as an amateur journalist who seems to do anything to get the best footage of horrific crime scenes. What's more shocking are the news channels that purchase his work claiming ""if it bleeds, it leads!"".

Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant in the starring role as he seems creepy but also powerful and shrewd.

★★★★ || I find it truly amazing that Jake Gyllenhaal did not win nor was even nominated for an Oscar for this stunning performance as Louis Bloom. Makes me wonder how much of who gets nominated and who wins rides on insider politics and not on merit. Or how many Oscar noms and wins are ""gifts"" in the respect that either an actor has a catalog of wonderful performances and has never won (Henry Fonda comes to mind for ""On Golden Pond"")or the effort put into as role somehow makes it an Oscar winning performance (Leo DiCaprio in ""The Revenant"").

Gyllenhaal becomes his character; a feral, single minded, means justify the end ""bottom feeder"" catering to the worst in humanity - our seemingly built in need to view others pain. He sees nothing at all wrong with what he does or how he goes about it. Easily he is most believable sociopath I have seen on film. In a performance marked by many stand out moments perhaps the most galvanizing one is not an action sequence but a quiet moment (before a storm) where he tells an employee that ""Maybe my problem isn't that I don't understand people, but that I don't like them.""

How his work was over looked for an Oscar is beyond what good acting warrants and indeed must fall within the machinery of Hollywood backroom politics. Going by IMDb, he was nominated for outstanding acting by just about every other award given in entertainment except the Academy. Maybe perhaps his Lou Bloom was too good and looking at this work, for Hollywood, was like looking into the darkest darkness; understanding the reflection they saw in it was themselves."

Based on the book named 'Where Rainbow Ends', but lots of changes have been done to make a youthfully celebratible movie for the young generation.

Usually, the famous romantic dramas are slow, lengthy, and well developed characters. Of course, this one was a romcom, though, much better in many aspect with less emotions and swift pace. About the characters, it was Rosie's perspective and having Alex as a counterpart, the rest are not given much importance other than permits a fair display. Nowadays I kind like Lily Collins, she's cute, maybe it is a crush. But that does not the reason to I like this film, not entirely true. I find it somewhat atypical with many convincing scenes and lines.

The story is intensifyingly frustrates us as it takes extreme turns all the time just to make a further riddle and complicate. But that is how the screenplay survives or there won't be any story to tell. It might be Rosie's romance, but you don't have to be a woman/girl to enjoy this film. I don't believe such kind of categorisation, because in the earlier time everyone believed animation is for children only and then it proved wrong. So if a man can watch a movie without damaging his brain, losing his eyesight, or becoming paralysed, then I don't see an issue rather making up everything himself. Hope you all enjoy the movie as I did.

In this film, a group of three young people who live together (a couple and a single friend who lives in the house) discover that the old man who lives in the house in front of theirs, disappeared a few days ago and no one knows about him. When they investigated, they discovered a large camera in the middle of the room, and a collection of photos of their living room, taken by that mysterious machine that, to their surprise, takes pictures the day before they can happen. Reluctant to interfere in the future, they decided to imitate the photos, ensuring that nothing bad happened to them and fearing that the inventor had fallen, victim to any attempt to alter the future. But everything will get complicated when they start using the machine to earn extra money.

The movie is quite good, and the story works on top of an intelligent and well-written script, which guarantees us an hour and a half of good cinema, although it is not completely free from predictability or cliché situations (such as the situation of love betrayal among the friends). For a film with low budget and high creativity, the result is quite positive.

The reduced cast is expertly led by the trio Matt O'Leary, Danielle Panabaker and George Finn. The three actors seem to have a good rapport for the cameras, or that translates into a more harmonious and efficient work together. The film still has other actors, such as Amin Joseph or Jason Spisak, but only the three central actors that sustain the entire plot.

On a technical level, the film is quite limited due to its setting, but what was done is very good, and care was taken in the technical execution of the film. The photography is quite good, and all the visual and special effects work was equally effective."

Your nutshell review is that it's a cautionary tale of science going too far, where the narrative thrust of a Turin Test becomes something far darker and troubling. This is a deliberately slow paced sci-fier, told out of a remote reinforced science institute populated by just one human and some A.I. creations. Enter Caleb (Gleeson), who doubles the human quotient and kicks starts what is a cunningly sexy, troubling and potent picture.

As we are drawn into this most fascinating world, we are requested to pose ourselves the deeper questions about being human, for better or worse. This is nothing new, this has been explored in many other sci-fi pictures, but the intensity of the set-up, the performance of the actors in this intimate surround, for sure engage the patiently interested.

The ending is plain daft, even irresponsible when one considers how much thought has gone into the story previously, but mostly this is a genre piece of considerable worth. 8/10"

Life in the thirties. Just now destined to meet the life partners, which actually threatening a life long friendship. Yeah, it is kind of reminds plenty of films from the past, but never too old to enjoy, especially if you are a 30+. It was like the next level of the life story to the films like 'Ginger & Rosa', 'Little Birds', 'Very Good Girls'. One knows the life cannot go on, being with friends forever. The friendship could still remain, but when someone comes between them, it won't be the same. That's what this film is about.

What worked for this film was the two main characters. A straight and a gay friend, and how their love life or still looking for their life partner portrayed fantastically. The actresses were impressive. They are not like from list A. The director too. I wish her to flourish. Yeah, they talked about 'The Big Leboswsky' in the film, honesty, I thought too as well it an average film. The film was shot within a three weeks. Lot better than I was expecting. I love films about the life. The life transition between youth to middle-age. The lesson one learns from self-experience. So definitely a good watch. I don't see a reason to dislike it.

It was quite okay within its somewhat confined genre. Dead Snow 2 however is a major disappointment. It abandoned all pretence of actually being a real horror movie and wandered into the land of pure comedy…and failed miserably. This movie is like Bad Taste but on a higher budget (and regardless of what the fans want to pretend Bad Taste is a piece of shit movie).

The movie does have a plot that makes sense, again for this kind of movie, that has to be said but that lone does not make a good movie. There are literally NO really scary moments at all in this movie.

The movie has plenty of goory stuff. Actually the gore is pretty much thrown at the viewer from the first scene to the last. Unfortunately much of it is so ludicrous that it is embarrassing. To add to the embarrassment a bunch of absolutely nonsensical characters are thrown into the mix. The so called Zombie Squad is just pathetic. The Norwegian police office makes me squirm in my seat. The puking pet zombie makes me want to throw up my supper.
This movie is nothing but brain-dead people (and I am not talking only about the zombies here) and tasteless effects stacked onto each other. The only reason it does not get a single star is that there was one or two laughs in there and because some of the ludicrously overdone gory effects was not too bad from a technical point of view.

As I wrote it was a major disappointment. This movie can only appeal to the die hard fans of the genre or, with its frequent puking scenes, bad jokes and senseless gore to people who … well I will not go there actually."

Benedict Cumberbatch is really just reprising his BBC ""Sherlock"" characterisation - even down to the pensive hand gestures. The story is told from quite an interesting retrospection after the pretty unlikeable Turing has been apprehended by the police for what I suppose we'd call ""lewd behaviour"" nowadays and is being questioned by Rory Kinnear (""Detective Nock""). Indeed, I found all the characterisations to be a bit shallow - Charles Dance, Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode just lacked oomph, I thought.

It boasts a great soundtrack, brilliant acting and a very convoluted story as it tells the story of a private detective (Phoenix) as he investigates into the disappearance of a former girlfriend.

The screenplay is very confusing. It is hard to follow and purposely so as it introduces many characters and multiple stories but I have heard that this aspect of the screenplay is very true to the original source material. All I could do was admit that the film was too bewildering and to enjoy the many jokes and humorous situations.

Joaquin Phoenix is tremendous as the main character Larry ""Doc"" Sportello. He is complimented with a great supporting cast such as Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.

Overall, 'Inherent Vice' is not a typical popcorn flick and I was very confused by the overwhelming plot.

★★★½ || I kind of feel that Anderson lends himself to a film like this. He uses a lot of extreme wide angles and if you ever smoked a little dope in college the world looks a little like when you mount that 18mm on your SLR. His choice of lenses lends itself to telling the story of a guy like Doc without going over the top ala Fear and Loathing and making it a little too blatantly FX.

The humor works in best possible dry as a martini kind of way, and it's played straight like comedy should be.

But really, the premise sold me. Take a hard boiled film noir kind of mystery and replace Sam Spade with the perpetual stoner and then watch him try to solve a mystery.

It's incoherent enough to make you believe that Doc is just a little too rocked to function properly most of the time, which is reflected in his effectiveness and decision making skills. He's smart enough to not bumble his way through it, but has gotten off the magic school bus enough to do his best possible work.

And it makes the film do that one singular thing that all movies are required to do in order to be called a success... it entertains.

And honestly it's a delight to watch. The acting was great, the director was the best possible person to take on the adaptation, and the lighting walked that fine line between naturalistic and cinematic.

I'd call it a beautiful film, but it's hard to call a movie about drugs beautiful without sounding utterly pretentious... so, I'll settle with the highest praise a movie can get... it's entertaining and a pleasure to watch."

If you think it is some B movie, which is overrated, I would say your assumption is totally wrong. I did not know anything about this film either, I thought it was a Christian Bale movie, that's who I saw in the poster, but later I came to know it was a different guy. My thought on this changed after watching it, it is really a beautiful drama-music. One of the best films of the 2014 that I would have missed it if I had listened to the lies of the critics. So be careful while choosing such movies, because critics are not always right.

I believe you all had seen enough films based on the school shootings like 'Elephant'. This is a similar kind, except there's no violence in it, I mean the shootout was not shown, but a drama about its consequences, especially in the perspective of the parents. This tale focused on a father whose son had been killed in a such unfortunate event. How it affects his life was narrated wonderfully with some awesome music tracks. A father's mourning and his uncertain future to the self-discovery.

This is Willian H. Macy's directional debut film and he pulled it off quite superbly. Sadly, nobody talks about it in the line of other great films of the year, because it deserves an equal respect and praise. I am not the only one, there are others too who liked it a lot. A simple story and the perfect character exhibitions with the pleasing musics, all these worked in its favour. Supporting roles are enough, Billy Crudup should do more lead roles. After seeing his impressive performance in this I am confident that he can find his own place in the industry. And so Willian H. Macy, I'm looking forward for his future projects.

> ""There are 14 people in the audience and 10 of them are performers.""

It was not inspired by the real story, except the school shootings, but the film incredibly told what happens after such incidents. The best part was balancing the emotions in the storytelling. After watching it in the first 10 minutes, I expected, in fact anybody expects it to be a tearjerker film, but it was not, even though I loved watching the rest of the film. And the twist was very casual which was not meant for the story or the characters, but for the viewers that related to the school shooting that we never saw. So there is a less possibility for us to expect it coming, but it also that brings a better conclusion to the heartwarming tale.

It was like someone's real life, yet not easy to predict the scenes. Cinematically it accomplished its quest to be a good film. Selena Gomez was in a guest role, but for a star like her it was unnecessary to play a small part, especially in a serious theme like this. Because unexpected anticipation grows in us and in the end that might lead to a disappointment, especially for her fans. That is not for her alone, but any other big stars, because it is not a comedy or a superhero film when they appear on the screen, the audience to go crazy. A character with the dialogues means something big, but anyway, she was bad at all.

It wasn't as good performance as Anton Yelchin's previous film '5 to 7' that I saw early this year, but yeah definitely a decent supporting character along with Laurence Fishburne's. Don't mistake it, it was not a powerful drama about grieving alone, but in its small specific expanse it reached what it wanted to tell the audience so perfectly. So, there are some fun parts as well in it in a small quantity. But overall, a film that fulfills its promise. By now you might know that I strongly recommend it, especially if anyone who had ever lost their loved ones, they will feel it in their heart more than others do.

""Katniss"" (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself on a ship with ""Finnick"" (Sam Claflin) where she discovers that the erstwhile baddie ""Plutarch"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is really on their side as she is whisked to the long-thought destroyed District 13 where she meets ""President Coin"" (Julianne Moore), who leads a semi-militaristic society bent on deposing the Capitol. Unfortunately, not everyone managed to escape from the collapsing dome and poor old ""Peeta"" is being used, shamelessly, by the authorities to try and paint ""Katniss"" as the epitome of revolution and evil and so the scene is set: rescue him and mass their forces for an attack that will eliminate the totalitarian regime once and for all. Aside from one of two combat scenes, very little actually happens here. There is a great deal of dialogue, plenty of moralising and if I'm honest, ""Coin"" doesn't come across as any more trustworthy than the man she hopes to succeed. There simply isn't enough by way of plot to sustain this for two hours and the acting still, largely, refuses to engage me. Liam Hemsworth (""Gale"") features a little more, but the confused does she/doesn't she romance stuff is exasperating as this supposedly emotionally and sexually charged environment delivers nothing by way of passion - indeed the pace of the whole thing borders on the racial. Sure, it looks great but I feel that the writing is very much on the wall for part two - my expectations are pretty low."

So in this film could not foresee the modification, but it did in a slight manner like the later 'Noah' movie. The best part was the visuals, the graphics were so good, hard to resist the pleasure if you are vfx geek like me. That's the reason I love modern movie, especially remake of a classic like 'King Kong'. The problem in this flick was lie in the story telling.

As we know, Ridley Scott is an excellent narrator, but this movie was too short even though it ran 150 minutes. I felt it was just a brief, I mean there were no details or depth in the important scenes. You will know what I'm saying if you had watched '56 movie I mentioned in a above paragraph. That's drawback for the first timers at a same time advantage for not to fall in boredom for those who have already seen other versions. Christian Bale, awesome; Joel Edgerton, good; Ben Kingsley, never required; Aaron Paul, totally waste.

Overall, not cleverly stablised in the scenes that are very important, especially the final one about ten commandments should have been extended a little bit with a moral message. If it was a Peter Jackson movie, definitely it would have been a trilogy with an aggregated time of over 500 minutes. This movie was an entertainer like I enjoyed it than the message deliverer. Must be watched for the amusement and for the pleasure in updating technical aspect of the narration rather than inspiration.

7.5/10 || This movie was rather disappointing as far as I am concerned. The original story has been rewritten rather drastically. This in itself do not bother me too much. I am not one of those fanatics that get a fart stuck the wrong way if someone messes with the holy bible. However, I really do not think this was a good rewrite. A lot of the magical moments had been removed and that took away a lot from the story.

The movie starts off good enough with some nice and fairly impressive battles. Then it slows down a lot and sometimes I got a “get on with it damn it” feeling. When we finally got around to the burning bush part I got rather underwhelmed. God as a vengeful kid? Come on!

The disasters and the special effects are not too shabby but the entire bit where Moses confronted Ramses and warned him about the disasters that where to befall Egypt are taken out. They where just thrown on Egypt one after another in ways that could be explained away as natural disasters. From one point of view I can understand the wish to do this but to me it took something away from the movie.

Later when Ramses decides to go after the Hebrews it continues in the same way with Ridley Scott downplaying the magic in the story. There is no pillar of fire and Moses is not holding out his staff to split the see. The sea just decided to recede and Moses takes advantage of it. Sure the effects when the water returns where quite cool but again, the magic was gone.

Technically the movie is quite well done and the acting is quite okay but the biblical grandeur and mythical aspects are no longer there. This grand adventure story is simply reduced to an ordinary, fairly mediocre adventure movie with a high budget. I have to say that I enjoyed Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments more even though the special effects in that one is hopelessly outdated and the acting is a bit awkward."

That's the first of six segments that illustrate human nature, usually at it's comically worst, over the next two hours. A roadside diner sees a plot amongst the staff to rid themselves of a nasty loan shark. Then my tip for the best of these sees a ridiculous contretemps on a remote road between a man with a puncture and a local he insulted earlier on his journey. The next takes a pop at red tape as a demolition expert gets a parking ticket whilst laying tons of charges to safely demolish a building. He is either going to get the ticket annulled or he's going to do some annulling of his own. The weakest vignette, I found, involved the son of a wealthy man whose parents are trying to get him off a charge of murder. Corruption and extortion are rife and everyone wants their cut to ensure the lad doesn't swing! Finally, a groom rather stupidly admits to an infidelity as he dances with his new bride on their wedding night. Chaos ensues, tempers fly, the chef gets a dish he wasn't bargaining for... What each of these illustrate quite nicely are flaws in human nature. It could have been renamed the ""seven deadly sins"" as we address greed, anger, lust - you name it.

This is not the film everybody was expecting. But not bad to try after coming to know it. It is a black comedy, about a young single woman, a substitute elementary school teacher who moved to a new neighbourhood. She has no limit for her imaginations. Her world was full of wondrous, but there's a little dark secret too. Later, when she comes to face a big hurdle, how she's going to handle her new boyfriend who is a cop and from there where it heads was revealed.

It was a Katie Holmes' show. It was a short film, but she was always there, the camera always with her. I'm seeing her film after a long time. She looks a bit old for this role, but worked well. The supporting cast was okay though. That little girl from 'Girl Meets World, Ava, was good. The film looks okay for all ages, but slightly violent with killing and other crime exposing scenes. Especially it is not for young kids, despite the film theme looks a bit magical. So it should be PG13.

A decent writing and direction. The whole film was shot within two and half weeks. Because the story was simple, that takes place in the limited enclosures. So the experience of watching it was like a television film, but it is not. You might have seen some of the similar films, but still it is worth a watch. Not deliberately going for it, though when you ran out of the options.

_6/10_ || Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

This is great proof that Katie Holmes can not only lead and carry a movie, but has a wide range of acting skill.

This movie is all about character work, or you could say it is character driven.  Meadows is an extremely complex character that is shown, but without explaining to the audience what they're supposed to be looking for (a drain on movies that do this), some audiences might miss the nuance of the character as well as her psychosis.

The movie reminds me of a more mellow ""Mr. Right"", or at least with more realistic values.  And in this lies the problem, every bit of this movie could be true, and that tends to put in eight different categories that people don't find entertaining, mostly because it's too close to reality, and you normally watch movies to escape that.

The movie is metaphor, for the need to stand and defend what is right wherever we stand, and the a representation of the juxtaposition between violence and the social expectations for women.

A LOT of people are going to hate what this movie represents, but I feel that's just representative how awful our society is.

This movie definitely fills a void in the industry, it's masterful, well produced, but as good as the writing is, the content just isn't going to be palatable for everyone. || **Although the main character is adorable, the movie just doesn't work the way it was intended.**

I can't help but look at this movie with mixed feelings. On the one hand, I like the final result and I loved the main character and the overall concept of the script. On the other hand, I'm forced to consider that the film works poorly as a black comedy, doesn't have any funny (and I'm a fan of black humor) and would have been more interesting if it had been thought of as a drama, with some romance and mystery mixed in.

The script starts from a good premise: a lovely young woman with old-fashioned tastes who seem totally innocent and above suspicion, but who, unbeknownst to anyone, is dedicated to cleaning the world of evildoers. The idea was good, but what the film does is turn it into something else. Miss Meadows is adorable, but she's not someone bent on fighting crime. She doesn't look for the bad guys, she simply crosses paths with them, and that's not what a vigilante does. Of course, she ends up being wanted by the authorities, as she herself dates the local sheriff, but she remains not an avenger or someone decided on doing justice. She doesn't act, she just reacts.

In addition to this issue, which for me is essential, there are other details that simply work very badly, starting with the extraordinary formality between the two boyfriends who, despite having a relationship, continue to call each other Miss and Sheriff, and never address each other by their first name, in a register as personal as the one that mother and daughter adopt over the phone. Furthermore, the film lacks tension and dramatic impact: various crimes and deaths occur, but there is no real tension at any point. Ultimately, this is where the most surreal and strange of this film lies: in the naturalness and lightness with which everything happens, and in the way that sheriff seems to want to simply ignore the bride's behavior, which is worthy of a deep psychiatric analysis.

Katie Holmes is the star of this movie. She's not an actress I particularly like, but I have to admit that she did a pretty good job here. She managed to endow the character with great charm and charisma, as well as having excellent dialogue and understated jokes, almost British in essence. James Badge Dale gives him very effective support, even though his character was very poorly thought out and written. Despite the actor's work and effort, the sheriff is too dumb to be credible. Jean Smart, Ava Kolker, Callan Mulvey and Graham Beckel do what they're allowed to do, but the movie isn't theirs to shine.

Technically, the film bets a lot on the style and on the construction of an environment that oscillates between the old-fashioned suburban and the surrealist dystopian. Not everything works, but it wasn't all a complete failure either. The success in choosing filming locations and creating scenarios is quite evident, as is the very happy and accurate way in which the entire outfit of the young Miss Meadows was conceived and created. The cinematography works very well in general, with bright colors, a certain lightness that looks good, and that is only cut in the flashback scenes, in more washed-out tones and in a more tense environment. Personally, I would have liked to see darker, denser cinematography in the parts of the film where the central character is more obsessive, sick and manic. The soundtrack also plays its role in a satisfactory way and without major surprises."

Wang Sheng brings her home and presents her to his wife Pei Rong (Vicky Zhao) that welcomes her and offers to keep her in her service. But Xiaowei falls in love with Wang. 

Strange events then happen, including people disappearing or dying, so Pei Rong turns to a demon hunter, Pang Yong (Donnie Yen), who is tired of things and not of much help. He meets an inexperienced demon hunter, Xia Bing (Li Sun) who is very interested in the events, and thinks a chameleon demon is the cause of problems. It is indeed such a demon, Xiaoyi (Yuwu Qi) that is in love with Xiaowei and kills people to bring her hearts.

Pei Rong won't quit finding the source of problems and confronts Xiaowei that reveals her demon form and forms a pact with her : the killings stop, but Pei Rong takes the blame for the murders.

This is a mix of faery tale, Wuxia and love story. The main cast does a breathtaking job, creating powerful characters with strengths and weaknesses, and led by their emotions and honor, including the demons. This makes a very moving story, as noone is really guilty and tries to hurt as few people as possible, or at least believes they're doing the right thing.
I've been a fan of Vicky Zhao for years, and Donnie Yen is always great, but it's Xun Zhou that really shines here. Her mysterious charm creates a complex and charming character that we try to hope will either become good or be forgiven for her actions.

Very recommended."

However, the script has been quite modify to adapt it to how the story wanted to be told no matter how many swaps in the time line, omissions or mistakes were introduced. || 'The Theory of Everything' is James Marsh's biopic of scientific genius Stephen Hawking. Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking as we learn about his early days at university, his diagnosis of motor neuron disease, and the rise to his now iconic status. Marsh's direction is very good and he uses many point of view shots to create a huge sense of empathy for the main character. Marsh uses stunning visual effects in order to express Hawking's inner feelings and torment whilst highlighting his genius. The choice of music is also uplifting and echoes the key themes throughout the film.

The screenplay is a really interesting piece of work and tells the story in a funny yet intriguing way. However, it does seem to lack a certain something as it tries to alter the source material in order to create some very conventional scenes.

The performances in 'The Theory of Everything' are truly exceptional. Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking in a transformational and moving manner. You can barely recognise him as he highlights his illness with complete sincerity and plausibility. Felicity Jones plays his wife, Jane Wilde. I thought her role would be a simple one as she would work off of the powerhouse performance from Redmayne but the way she shows her strength and compassion is very moving and she does an excellent job.

Overall, 'The Theory of Everything' is a fascinating film about a genius as he deals with his dibilitating illness. The maturity of everyone involved in this make it a remarkable movie.

★★★½ || Based around the honest, touching and frequently heart-rending book by Jane Hawking (here played very well by Felicity Jones), this is essentially a story of love and dedication - with one hell of a lot of frustration thrown in too. Eddie Redmayne is superb as the now acclaimed, flawed and often rather unpleasant scientist whose brain was years ahead of it's time; and the drama marries his dedication to his work with his devotion to himself, his family and, of course, to everyone's handling of the increasingly debilitating disease that ultimately denied him just about every aspect of his physical being. It's not a science lesson - never fear, our neurones are left pretty much unchallenged. It is a love story. Not a romance, either - but a depiction of a relationship that thrived, struggled, rose and - ultimately - fell. The intimacies of the photography almost immerse us in their lives as both take a rather stoic, but not always enjoyable, approach to the difficulties faced by all concerned. It is well scripted, the dialogue is sensitive and plausible - and Jóhann Jóhannsson's score augments the visuals aptly too. As biopics go, it comes across as far less speculative; it has an integrity to it that coupled with with two actors at the top of the bill who clearly enjoyed working with each other, gives us a superior drama about two people who were genuinely interested in each other, and who are genuinely of interest to the audience. The supporting efforts from the likes of David Thewlis and Harry Lloyd and from the myriad of actors who portray the couple as they grow up from childhood add well to the overall richness of this - and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it."

The American Academy Awards had failed to recognise the true ingenuity. That does not stop win the heart the of millions of children around the world. As for the adults, it makes you feel young again for a while. Lots of humour in it with faint emotions at the end along the kids favoured flavour throughout.

Far East and far West film industries ruling the animation production, but Tomm Moore from Ireland is trying to open the new gate from the European division. Not many people are aware of him, one more movie and its success may lead to the greater heights for sure. This animation technics are very unique, but not the first time in the use.

The character illustrations were cuter to enchant the young kids. Watching the movie is like reading a children's storybook with the large pictures everywhere and a couple of lines of words in the corner of the page. Like the anime in Japan and 3D animation in Hollywood, this would mark the Euro on the map. There are many animations are made and still making in Europe, but this one is the new perspective of hope to reach all the major and remote places of the Earth. Wish it moves in the right direction.

If you had known how all the fairy tales work, you would feel you can predict this story because, you know defeating evil, breaking curses, the happy endings are the usual part. So what matters is the storytelling, how well the stories are presented on the screen. This film excels in that point, and the music is the another highlight of the movie. Whoever the music director/composer I must praise him. Almost a year ago I saw the trailer for the first time and I felt like I already loved the movie, mainly because of the music.

''Hold this shell to your ear and listen carefully. You will hear the song of the sea.''

In his earlier movie the director told a simple and short story extraordinarily, and still I hum that beautiful 'Aisling song' sometime. This movie had a wonderful adventure story of a boy called Ben and his little sister Saoirse. In the journey of running away from an owl witch, the magical creatures and an ancient seashell guide them a path. On the right time the title song makes the way to delight next 10 minutes of the crucial segment in the narration. I love the original version, in Irish even though I don't understand. It was good and catchy, even for the grown ups as well. Feels like, want to visit those places from the movie, but sadly our only option is Disneyland, huh.

Disney and Studio Ghibli are the king and queen of fairy tale movies. No one would, but if you are mildly fed up of those, here the new dimensional fresh tales from the Ireland's folklore. Though, it sets in the modern world, but does not abandon to bring the key factors. Like the ancient meet the modern world with the same intensity. Kind of new to hear the words like Selkie, Macha etc., but, brand new for the people who live thousands of kilometers away in the different continents. Animation movie fanatics would love it, but if there are any children like niece and nephew in your home or visits you, watch it with them on that occasion and you would feel differently.

9/10 || Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.

The animation in this beautiful, and some of it reminds me (vaguely) of ""Spirited Away"", but makes more sense.  I'm sure the relation is the sense that ""Spirited Away"" is Miyazaki's display of the Japanese fey, though it is apparently in several other movies (e.g. ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Ponyo"").

This is a movie of great tragedy and powerful feelings, but ultimately is about appreciating your family and people while they are there.  There is charm and uplifting feelings to the entire situation: you're not just going to be depressed or moved.

As the introduction of the fey start, it is very unclear what is real and what is magic, or if the magic is real.  That surreal attitude to this child's adventure seemed to add to the charm of dealing with the situation.

The only problem I have with the movie is this ambiguity, there are so many parallels (that often occur in fey stories) to reality that you can't tell if this is a story of how a boy imagined an adventure, or if it's a fey story full of hidden magic.

The details they go into are amazing if you look.  Even the tears shared between fey and human are different.  The details go on, and while I'm not sure if the quality is better, worse, or just different to a Miyazaki film, I feel it was made with the same consideration for how the audience is supposed to feel as they watch in the same way he created. || This is a gorgeously told tale from Celtic mythology that follows the adventures of the young ""Ben"" and his sister ""Saoirse"". Their mother died whilst giving birth to the girl - who is unable to speak - and they lived in an isolated lighthouse (I'd love that!) with their widowed dad ""Conor"" until being sent to live in the big city with the grandmother. The colourful narrative now follows the pair as they determine to get back home to their dad. Along the way, we discover that ""Saoirse"" is no ordinary girl, and that her powers, thanks to ""Ben"" and his fairytales, might enable both of them to engage in a challenge to free some magical creatures trapped in the realm of the humans. The animation is charming, the characterisations likewise - they are well developed and retain their innocence and childishness throughout. The soundtrack is also a thing to enjoy - a typically Gaelic affair with haunting melodies and jaunty themes that all add richness to this simple but intriguing story. This is a fascinating vein of legend that is really underdeveloped by cinema internationally. Here we have a delightful introduction to those stories and this really is well worth and hour and half of anyone's time."

Ron Howard's latest sea adventure, stars Chris Hemsworth in an important role. So the people comparing it with 'Moby Dick', because both the film is about the same story, but one was inspired and the other one was, I mean this film was based on the actual event. I had seen the BBC film 'The Whale', not a bad film for a low budget television film. Most importantly, it revealed the truth about what I was not aware of from one of my favourite sea adventure films.

I never read the book, but saw the British version, so I knew what I'm going to witness. Still, I was very interested to check it out, because it is a grand film and as expected I loved the visuals. Those sea adventures were very realistic, except the action sequences which is obviously cinema gimmick. The surprise part was the narration. It was a flashback story, something like 'Life of Pi', a man recall his old memory of his survival at the sea with other crew members of the ship Essex when it was attacked by a big white whale.

It is kind of impossible to believe what this film says is true. And obviously what we see is not what exactly happened, but very close. So see this film to believe it. Whatever it is, I totally enjoyed watching it. The 2 hour long never looked too long. There are a few mild disturbing scenes due to the theme concept, but it is a good family film. If you like 'Moby Dick' then you should watch it. Definitely an underrated film by the film critics.

7/10 || I love these type of 18th century film flair, and the whole pirate-like or merchant crew voyaging to the open sea looking for a non-abundant resource later to be topped with an impossible foe because of the technology at the time thus lead to strand in mother nature. Good stuff! || This movie never really grabbed me. I was impressed by I guess what real critics call the cinematography. Some of the scenes of the action on the ship and the ocean vistas, were realistic and placed me there in the same way I felt like I was there. With Master and Commander.

The plot was adequate to the task as well. A familiar story thanks to Moby Dick, but that was the point. My problem was with the characters. I never connected with any of them. I can’t say why or even why I needed to if the other elements of the movie held up their end. But there it is."

I watched this new effort just to see how far CGI has come in the time since the original and I can safely say, not very far. From the opening scene with the terrible looking and poorly animated bird, it's obvious that CGI has reached its limits in recreating realistic content. 
As for the film. The dreadful script and annoying characters helped me lose any interest after about 15 mins. Ok for the age range it's aimed at I suppose, but there are far better films out there worthy of your money."

170522.0,Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods,"In order to wipe out the Gaulish village by any means necessary, Caesar plans to absorb the villagers into Roman culture by having an estate built next to the village to start a new Roman colony.",,"Animation, Comedy, Adventure, Family",85.0,2014-11-26,fr,6.791,1407.0,2.4728,"Roger Carel, Alexandre Astier, Lionnel Astier, Serge Papagalli, François Morel","Alexandre Astier, Louis Clichy, René Goscinny, Albert Uderzo, Alexandre Astier",roman empire,"Like I said in 'Song of the Sea' review, its a 3D animation dominated world. That's mainly in Hollywood, but trend spreading so fast everywhere. Even the Japan shifting gear from anime to 3D anime, I saw it in 'Space Pirate: Captain Harlock'. From a comic book to 2D animation is easy because they are much alike, but it's different when it comes to the 3D. I have seen Micky Mouse and Co transformed into 3D characters that I did not like, because some characters do not suit for that kind of leap. In Micky Mouse, the ears were the biggest drawback. But 'Tintin' was a success and so expecting 'Popeye' would do the same magic which is due next year (2016).

I have seen all the 'Asterix & Obelix' movies so far from both the format, live-shot and animation, but this is the first 3D animation. I'm so happy that it came overall very well, every detail was retained. Even those mud-smoke/dirt-smoke (whatever it's called) shown exactly as it to be which forms during their fight after the consumption of magic potion. That concept is for comic book, to make understand the readers the situation because the picture is still. But in a motion picture you can show the whole action, if they make that change the trademark will lose. So I must praise the technical side of the movie for the lossless transformation.

It's like a new beginning in the series in the 'Asterix & Obelix' franchise. Especially this story was not freshly written for the screen, but taken straight from one of the comic books in the series called 'The Mansions of the Gods'. In 3D animation, emotions, violence, comedies would be a little realistic. That's why the movie like 'Brave', 'Frozen', 'Up' appealed strongly on the sentimental side. Gaul's favourite food, the wild boar hunting was compromised, because children would be watching the movie and it might disturb on the softer side of them. Just like the filmmakers avoided the Giant's children and women in 'Jack the Giant Slayer'.

One of the best things in 'Asterix & Obelix' movies is that the movie might not be awesome, but still it entertains and keeps you engaged. You can't spot the flaws, in animation all are relevant. A man can jump 1000 feet high and leap a mile away. So if there should be something, that must come from the technical side. Since it (Gauls in 3D) is new and so much fun, you can't concentrate finding those faults or you will miss the actual enjoyment.

> ‘‘It's weird that the house looks like a box.’’

As usual the story set in the first BC. The Gaul's enemy the Romans comes with a new strategy to defeat them. They begin to build the large mansions near to their village and later to invade by seducing the community by the Roman culture. So the fight begins between them where the innocent civilians and black slaves get affect more. But Gaul's main intention is to keep the ecosystem unaffected, especially they're against the Romans modern fancy civilization. What happens to the Julius Caeser's 'Veni, Vidi, Vici' is the movie's final battle to disclose.

Probably a best 'Asterix & Obelix' movie compared to the previous couple of movies. Good to see a non-Hollywood 3D animated movie with a great quality and doing well commercially as well. A whole family together watchable movie, not only for the children. Hoping for the a sequel, I mean very soon. All the above it was short and sweet which runs about 80 minutes. If you are a fan of this comic, you will love it, because lots of the frames look alike. Must be dedicated  to the fans.

If “Dragonheart” managed to make an impact and assert itself as an iconic epic adventure, the same cannot be said of its sequels. In the review I wrote for the initial film, I spoke a little about its popularity and impact… and when a film achieves this effect, it already makes a series of sequels designed to “milk the cow” and monetize the success obtained.

This was the first sequel, and it was so weak that it would have been better not to exist. We already know that sequels are rarely as good as the original movies (although we can name several examples of sequels as good or better than the originals), but this movie is so weak and had such a limited budget that I have doubts about the real effort. from the studio to bring the project to a successful conclusion.

The most praiseworthy and redeeming aspects of this film reside in some of its technical characteristics. In fact, the film has a good soundtrack (in good part a recycling of the first film's musical themes) and tries its best to be fun, engaging, friendly and enjoyable for the whole family. There's plenty of humor, although the jokes don't always work: burning flatulence or drool dripping over a human are situations we've seen before on film, and much better.

Everything else is woefully weak: the script, based on an implausible prophecy and a dragon's egg left behind by Draco, is rather weak and riddled with problems; there are several action-packed scenes, but almost all of them are overly choreographed, imaginative and uninteresting, plus the climax was clearly cobbled together in a hurry. The sets and costumes also suffer from the excesses of imagination applied to the script, turning the Middle Ages into Middle Earth, or almost. There are clearly problems with the lack of good taste in the design of some sets and costumes.

The film used CGI and computer effects quite intensively, both for the castles and the dragon itself. Its use, however, should have been more punctual, since nothing is real, and we clearly understand that. I, for one, don't remember seeing many movies with such clearly fake and amateurish CGI and effects! There are also pacing problems, which reveal faulty editing and many shortcomings in the post-production work.

About the actors, I can only say that we shouldn't hope for miracles. We are dealing with a very weak cast, with weak talent and little able to shine. The main character is the CGI-created dragon, but despite Robby Benson's good voice work, he's a jerk. The best interpretations are by Christopher Masterson and Harry Van Gorkum. Masterson is the classic hero and Gorkum is the Machiavellian villain. What unites them? Both are crooks."

It tells the story of a University linguistics professor (Moore) as she is diagnosed a rare form of Auzheimer's disease.

Richard Glatzer's direction of the movie can be viewed as a parallel to his own life and personal struggle as he lived with ALS disease. 'Still Alice' is full of emotive shots as the characters show care and support to Moore as she tries to continue juggling her career and family life with the disease. Aspects such as the music and cinematography is given a very straight-forward approach to allow the actors' performances to tell the story and to add a true to life direction.

Based on the novel of the same name written by Lisa Genova, the screenplay is very faithfully adapted. The film really focuses on the story and the dialogue between the characters and some scenes and interactions are extremely moving thanks to how well it is written.

Julianne Moore is perfect as the main character. She portrays her struggle with the disease with so much inner strength and dignity. Moore is supported by a solid cast such as Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart but are outshone by her brilliant performance.

Overall, 'Still Alice' is a very good film. It is very touching and moving tale about coping with such a life changing and destructive disease. However, it seems to only be memorable due to Julianne Moore's incredible acting.

★★★½ || At the ripe old age of fifty, renowned American linguist “Alice” (Julianne Moore) is at the top of her game and looking forward to a married life with three grown up children and a grand-child. Then she starts noticing that she is becoming a little forgetful. Those climbing the stairs then forgetting why you went up in the first place moments start to become more regular. She can’t recall the words for her lectures and presentations, indeed she can’t always even recall the topic she is supposed to be speaking about. These aren’t complete memory blackouts, but they concern her enough to go to doctor who confirms that she has early-onset Alzheimer’s. Her husband (Alec Baldwin) and her children rally around her, they do what they can, but in the end it is the distressing dismantling of a life that Moore presents quite poignantly here as her character’s illness worsens and it’s effects on her family resonate quite profoundly. The children themselves prove quite useful in portraying the differing responses to the illness, with independently-minded daughter “Lydia” (Kristen Stewart) who is already having a tempestuous relationship with her mother being one of the powerful litmus tests offered by auteur Richard Glatzer as they come to terms with the situation. There’s an especially effective scene where she essentially creates a trap-door, or exit strategy, for herself and that illustrates just how difficult it is for someone who’s life has always relied on her cerebral abilities, being gradually eroded to the point where reason becomes something blurred and complicated. It does flirt a little with sentimentality, but for the most part it is a thought-provoking, slightly observational, drama that raised quite a few question about our own mortality."

On top of that it is well animated, and full of heart.

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || I loved the optimistic notion of ""Aunt Lucy"" when she convinces the young ""Paddington"" to travel from darkest Peru to London safe in the knowledge that the wartime spirit will soon see him adopted by a loving family and bathing in a sea of marmalade! His arrival at the eponymous London railway station after stowing away on a boat is certainly more akin to the arrivals I've made in this bustling terminus where nobody gives anyone else a second look, though. Luckily for our rare bear visitor, the late night arrival of the ""Brown"" family from a tour of a wool museum sees mum ""Mary"" (Sally Hawkins) take pity on our forlorn stranger. This is to the chagrin of her suspicious husband ""Henry"" (Hugh Bonneville), the indifference of headphone-clad daughter ""Judy"" (Madeleine Harris) but the enthusiasm of son ""Jonathan"" (Samuel Joslin). One night can't do any harm, surely? Of course we just know it's never going to be that simple but after a bit of a ropey start, the family begin to take a bit of a shine to their new lodger. Meantime, over at the Natural History Museum, it's chief taxidermist ""Millicent"" (Nicole Kidman) doesn't really mind from where she obtains her samples to display in the museum, and a chance conversion with her procurer reveals that this Peruvian bear is newly in town. What now ensues puts an whole new meaning on the expression ""get stuffed"" as we discover a little more about the provenance of both ""Paddington"" and his new, menacing, antagonist. It's great fun, this film, with plenty of slapstick comedy and strong performances from Bonneville and Hawkins as well as Peter Capaldi as the irritating neighbour, Julie Walters (just about) holds her Scots accent together as the sagely ""Mrs Bird"" and Kidman seems to be enjoying herself as a sort of cross between ""Lara Croft"" and ""Hannibal Lector"". Like the original Michael Bond (he does feature here briefly) stories, the sentiment is short on gloop but long on the characteristics of politeness, respect and decency and of course there's little jeopardy that our kindly ursine is gonna prevail. The production design and standard of animation is first rate, there's plenty of light-heartedness from the script and as family dramas go - this offers just about everyone something to smile about.

The original blueprint effectively captured a unique time and place of mystique and other morbid curiosities.  The audience was craftily introduced to The Glade, a head-scratching venue out in the middle of nowhere while being surrounded by a massive maze that pretty much rendered its survivors in vulnerability and uncertainty. Well, ‘Maze Runner: Scorch Trials’ looks to revisit that same kind of mystifying aura where our young and daring protagonists face the surreal obstacles in a futuristic facility that begs for the same kind of grandiose ambivalence. Sadly, ‘Scorch Trials’ is a derivative follow-up shadow of its former pronounced presentation. This formulaic fantasy fails to provide any distinctive punch or promise to its more competent predecessor.

As a post-apocalyptic Young Adult-oriented narrative ‘Maze Runner: Scorch Trials’ never really invests in its adventurous characterizations that seem to blankly react to the jittery surroundings without any genuine conviction. It certainly is not advisable to saddle a pack of imperiled individuals in a cocoon of dream-like devastation and not have them equally match the imaginative SF sensibilities of their enthralling, enveloped universe. One can speculate as to whether ‘Maze Runner: Scorch Trials’ does any justice to the James Dashner epic-driven YA novels or not. Still, there should be a sense of excitable freshness and intrigue to this eye-opening film project that comes off strangely as remote and mechanical despite the whimsical feel to its wasteland of wonderment.

Sure, some will be partially engaged in the exploits of our young harried heroes bouncing from post to post in a desolate desert known as the Scorch where unpredictable encounters with undesirable creatures and the regional elements are recounted with Ball’s simplistic by-the-dots direction. There will be your predictable share of over-the-top villains, outlandish yet awestruck special effects imagery and a centerpiece for youth-oriented romancing among the ruins. However, ‘Maze Runner: Scorch Trials’ should do a better job in whisking its viewers away in a bells-and-whistles story that should be convincingly subversive and challenging.

Back in the Maze mold madness is Glade stud Thomas (Dylan O’Brien) and his band of fellow wanderers in Theresa (Kaya Scodelario), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and Frypan (Dexter Darden). The group had learned that their ‘a-MAZE-ing’ (sorry…could not resist) past experiences had been at the devilish hands of the evil paramilitary outfit known as WCKD (as in the pronounced word ‘wicked’). The head honcho of the aforementioned WCKD is none other than diabolical diva Dr. Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson). So now Thomas and his endangered entourage (along with a few more disposable tag-a-longs) are forced to roam in the treacherous Scorch where the ominous run-ins with the resident beastly zombie Cranks are inevitable.

Of course, there are other factors working against Thomas and his Gladers. First, they must constantly hunt for their safety guaranteed in the arms of the resistance faction called The Right Hand based in mountainous terrain. Secondly, there is also the matter of an outbreak known as the Solar Flare virus that is running amok and the cure is to draw blood from those that are immune.  The underhanded Janson (Aiden Gillen, from television’s ‘Game Of Thrones’) heads up the laboratory where the shifty agenda for collecting pure blood from unsuspecting hosts is hatched. So the dilemma is presented as such: should Thomas and his put-upon colleagues be the sacrificial lambs in an experimentation that could benefit the numerous lives of their exposed society?

The problem, among others, is that ‘Maze Runner: Scorch Trials’ never seems to distinguish itself among the crop of other YA-related feature films that seem collectively familiar in theme and tone. The long line of impish and impulsive fare that includes ‘The Hunger Games’ film franchise and ‘Divergent’ movie series has already saturated the movie market to the point of no return. Unfortunately, this leaves little room for error for derivative knock-off films such as ‘Maze Runner: Scorch Trials’ to not only echo the same kind of entertainment value but be considered a few notches off the scale in doing so.

T.S. Nowlin’s screenplay is shockingly synthetic and that is inexcusable for an escapist SF flick using Dashner’s colourful and descriptive tomes as its inspirational source. A few of the interesting supporting characters come and go while registering some servicing interest such as the dashing duo Jorge and Brenda (Giancarlo Esposito and Rosa Salazar) that befriend the Gladers en route to their destination for comfort and calmness. Gillen’s Janson is serviceable as the slimy opportunist blood baiter. Otherwise, the main performers that make up this cosmetic caper bring little to uplift this pseudo calculating landscape of imagined isolation and desperation.  Somehow, the charismatic presence of both O’Brien’s Thomas and Scodelario’s Theresa seem watered down from the first film.

For the second time around it is kind of a tough sell for ‘Scorch Trials’ to get the obligatory mouse to chase after the cheese in this particular misplaced maze.

Critic’s rating: ** stars (out of 4 stars) || > The adventure expands outside the maze to seek the answers.

Another teen movie in the mid series on the line of 'Divergent' and 'Hunger Games'. As an adult, I don't know what to expect from it, but entertainment was the priority. The first film was just an introduction that happened in a small and a single location like the film 'Cube'. Now it has outspread in a large extent with more new characters and takes a wider adventure in the wastelands.

Many doubts from the previous film were cleared, yet a few need to be clarified and hoping for the next one to do that job. But anyway the suspense was this franchise's specialty, that simply reminds us the TV series 'Lost'. This second part can be compared with plenty of other post apocalyptic films, but still I liked it better than the first.

The best thing was they retained the same director and he's going to be here for the next film as well. But I'm more interested in the prequel, I mean the fourth film than the third which brings an end to the story moving forward. Because the maze holds the key for many unresolved issues. So I'm anticipating the prequel trilogy than the current one to learn how it all began.

Surprisingly, many new additions like zombies, bounty hunters in the mainstream boosted the film with its variety. Gives us a creepy atmosphere, along thrilling running and chasing. The twist was not that great, but kind of unpredictable, and again due to the mysteries surrounding it, it created more curious about what might happen next.

6½/10 || Let's get to the point. This is bad.

A dystopian future full of conspiracies in which we throw the typical ingredients thinking that, magically, would make a good movie: teenagers, zombies, a ""Mad-Max""-like desert and a stupid story in which main characters and their enemies behave stupidly at every step.

Quite a forgettable one ..."

Perry","serial killer, psychiatrist, killer, evil, woman director","'The Voices' is a very dark comedy from graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi. It tells the story of a man named Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) who works in a bathtub factory. Jerry continuously sees a psychiatrist (Jacki Weaver) as he tries to live a normal life whilst dealing with his mental afflictions. He decides to pursue his office crush (Gemma Arterton) but soon finds himself in a murderous situation when she fails to reciprocate his advances. Jerry's schizophrenia means that he hears voices specifically from his pets who give him help and advice.

Satrapi directs the piece with a surprisingly heartfelt and empathetic way. The lack of colour and light (such as when Jerry is on his limiting medication) contrast really well with the scenes where the main character is free and feels at peace. There are very graphic scenes of murder which highlight the brutality of his actions reminding the audience of the morality of Jerry's actions. The music is also very fitting and turns drastically into a horror-themed score when the drama switches.

The screenplay is funny in a lot of places. Before I watched the film, I thought I would find similarities with HBO's 'Dexter' as it deals with a likeable killer whilst also being humorous. But, after watching, I feel that the film owes a lot to Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' as it shares similar themes of delusion and indulgence. However, the dialogue was a bit forced at times and I usually find myself cringing when watching a British actress (in this case Gemma Arterton) having to read lines written in a very stereotypical way.

Ryan Reynolds is fantastic as the main character and really makes the audience feel for his character. Reynolds completely embodies the main character's innocence and is a genuinely nice man. Even more impressive is the fact that Reynolds also performs voices for his pets which include a Scottish cat and a Texan dog. I had a slight problem with other members of the cast who I felt were not quite up to the standard that Reynolds set although Jacki Weaver was great as his psychiatrist and Anna Kendrick did a good job at playing his love interest.

Overall, I feel that 'The Voices' was a surprisingly good film. It was funny and very well acted. 'The Voices' is a little hidden gem that a lot of people who are fans of small and strange indie comedies would love.

★★★★ || ""_Being alone in the world is the root of all suffering._""

I appreciate that Ryan found his way to make blockbusters, but I would love to see him make a few more movies like this. It is funny, but dark, and some reveals that are pretty smart."

Quite pointless, but you may enjoy the action if that is what you were looking for ... || The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needless to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien’s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.

Still, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.

Anyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.

The story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.

I have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.

On the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a “Tolkienesque” athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers. || Comparing the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy and the _Hobbit_ trilogy was already like comparing apples and mediocre oranges, but none so mediocre as _Battle of the Five Armies_. Don't get me wrong, I love a ""battle"" as much as the next guy, more maybe, I don't even mind a movie that's 95% battle, but in this? It does. Not. Work.

_Five Armies_ is a movie that never made it out of pre-viz, let alone to a polished, well-rounded, final cut. I enjoy it to some degree when running through a Middle-Earth marathon as a whole, but only when the group I'm with will let me roll my eyes and complain about it.

I've never been one to be prejudice, but some of the people in that town really are and I think it has a lot to do with the fact that Selma was the turning point for all of Civil Rights. I left Selma and I can't say that was a bad thing. I had researched the March as a teen because I wasn't old enough to be there or wasnt even born yet, and I know for a fact they left out a lot of key elements in that movie that they didn't want you to see so I cannot give this a decent rating higher than a 1 because there's quite a few things omitted for the public not to see. The actors were very well casted and the backdrop made me proud to see my hometown shown so beautifully. Still I can't give this anything but one star due to the omitting of certain aspects of the story which are HISTORY and should not have been left out."

There's a fabled Nazi U-Boat down in the depths of the ocean, aboard is gold, lots of gold. So it's time for a not so motley crew of submariners to go forth - in an antiquated submarine - and try to set themselves up for life. Naturally nothing goes as planned, there are hidden agendas, rival factions within, claustrophobia reigns supreme, will anyone survive? Will you want any of them to survive?

Black Sea is not without problems, though the complaints about credibility and believability not being available? Well these are surely from folk who don't watch enough of, or understand the workings of, genre cinema of this ilk. Kevin Macdonald (director) and Dennis Kelly (writer) have crafted a tight and efficient submarine thriller. Characterisations are clichéd, with nods to other genre type of films evident, but the group dynamics pulse with danger and the inevitable peril sequences strike the requisite suspenseful chords.

Black Sea doesn't define or reinvent the submarine thriller wheel, it just keeps the rotor shafts turning. Strong casting and earthy photography help matters, to make this - ropey accents aside - better than a time waster of a viewing. 6.5/10 || Laid off from his job, ""Robinson"" (Jude Law) gets wind of a rumoured sunken horde of Nazi gold at the bottom of the Black Sea. He manages to cobble together some funds, recruit the ultimate in disparate crew - half British and half Russian, and somewhat implausibly obtain a WWII submarine that is only really held together by rust. Off they go in search of their loot and, as you might expect, tempers and superstitions run riot as the claustrophobic environment and cultural clashes cause difficulties for the increasingly isolated skipper. At times the imagery is quite effective at conveying some of the peril as their boat lurches from one disaster to another, but for the most part this is a really poorly constructed drama let down at pretty much every turn by Law's over-acting, his intermittent Scots accent, some very ropey dialogue and a cast of people who would usually perform better - Ben Mendelsohn and David Threfall, especially - but who really don't deliver anything substantial in this really cheap and cheerful looking effort. Some of the submarine interiors are authentic enough - a real one was used - but that can't really compensate for the lacklustre and repetitive narrative that can have but one conclusion. Not one of Kevin MacDonald's finer works - despite the decent cast."

Ever since the movie 'Dallas Buyers Club' grabbed the three golden statues at the Oscars, the director has been in the spotlight. But I was enjoying his movies before that and yet this one is another remarkable adventurous-drama based on the real expedition into the wild. Cheryl Strayed whose story was this film based upon appeared in the beginning scene where she drops off her version of the movie character and wishes her a luck.

The world is round, you can't runaway with your problems. If you do, you might end up where you have started. That's why its called a circle of life, goes round and round and round. You can hide your issues with yourself, but it may lead to a depression. Sometime when an experiment goes wrong, it's better to restart from the scratch with a different method. Here in our (human) lives some people do the same, return to where we've come from to restore the lost life. Of course I said all these, because this flick was inspired by such real incident.

I prefer this film was very close to the Australian movie 'Tracks' than bringing 'Into the Wild' into the frame. Obviously the Australian movie and this one are about the two young women, but the thing is, the story deals with the different motivation for their decision to take part in the quest. The Aussie flick has an edge over this when it comes to the challenges faced during the journey and also I loved from narration to photography, music and performance.

Since they both inspired by the true story, I appreciate the filmmaker's effort to bring them into the screen and salute to those two magnificent ladies. In both the films, both the women psychologically affected by their earlier stage of lives which was one of the reasons to step into the wild. I feel, 'Tracks' should have been nominated instead this movie for the Academy Awards.

> I never got to be in the driver's seat of my own life.

It was a wonderful 2014 for Reese Witherspoon. Back to back career reviving; biographical and inspiring human emotion movies in this graphic, sci-fi and fantasy dominated era. The year's sweetheart for the critics and I doubt there will be another same year. Remember, she was nominated for the Oscars for her role in this film.

The disappointment was the adventures. Not what I expected. The struggles were unable to reach for our deep heart compared to other self-discovery voyage films. Weight she carried and losing a toe nail, I don't see much impact because those are supposed to happen. This PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) is well planned and partially protected the hikers with all the needs supplied all along the route. The only thing they have to do is stay away from the wild lives and watch-out for the intruders between the checkpoints.

In other end coping with depression was what I loved in the movie. Without those flashbacks this film was nothing. Literally, this story all about the mental healing. The pain she carried, she just wanted to eject it from her body and mind, and the journey helped it. The funny thing is I liked Laura Dern a lot than anybody in the movie. Her character as well as her dialogues was very inspiring. Her nominee for the actress in a supporting role was justified. I can watch this film again and again, only for her alone, sadly she won't appear for a long stay.

I loved it, but not completely pleased with the product. The reason is 'Tracks'. I think the film came at the wrong time or maybe I saw this one when the other flick was still hot and fresh in my memory. An achievement is an achievement, I respect both the films. You like the movie or not, that's a secondary thought regarding movie's outcome.  But it's a must see for disclosing the extraordinary adventure of an ordinary young woman.

Is it really worth a watch? Absolutely yes.

Chris played a famous comedian in this, who desperately looking to turn into a serious action hero. On the other hand, he's getting ready for the grand wedding with a reality star.

The performances were brilliant. I mean it is a simple drama, mostly they talk about their personal life and profession, but inside that the both lead actors had given a good show. It was a slow start, and I did not understand where the story was heading. Because everything looked aimless and random scenes, other the some flashback parts, until the final scene.

If you wait patiently till that far, you might think it was a late strike, but makes all the sense. Yep the whole narration was defined with that 20-30 second clip. The screenplay is to be praised for that. Might be slightly an underrated film, though, looks like more a television film. Finally, I have to mention those guest roles by other comedians which actually had less impact, yet appreciable for giving their hand for another comedian.

Directed by Tim Burton and written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, Big Eyes brings to the screen the story of artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), who was producing a number of paintings of waifs with big eyes that captured the art world's imagination. Unfortunately her charlatan husband (Christolph Waltz) manipulated the interest in her work to claim it as his own, leading to Margaret having to front up to the lie and take the case to court.

Quite often the beauty of filmic cinema is that it can bring notice to the public about certain topics in history. The story of Margaret Keane is a story well worth telling, it may not be all encompassing as a biography since it is just about the key part of her life, but getting the story out there is to be applauded. I myself knew nothing about the Keane case, but I'm glad I do now, this film adaptation forcing me to seek out further reading on the subject.

It actually doesn't matter if you have a bent for art on canvas (me, but I do find those paintings beautifully beguiling), this is more about the human spirit, the crushing of such and the birth of. However, sadly to a degree the film often seems at odds with itself via tonal flows. There's whimsy where there shouldn't be, the drama should be front and centre, whilst Waltz's performance is awfully cartoonish, way too animated, and these problems are laid firmly at Burton's door, an odd choice of director for the material, it's like they felt the off kilter look of the paintings marked Burton as a shoe-in to direct.

Conversely he gets a sparkling turn out of Adams, she plays Margaret as being so vulnerable but radiant, yet she's perfectly infuriating as well, tugging our heart strings whilst troubling our anger senses. It's the strength of Adams' turn that steers Big Eyes away from choppy waters, for even as the court case that makes up the finale is given too little time to breath and make the ultimate mark, Adams as Margaret holds her own court and seals the deal for a big uplift - which in turn marks Big Eyes out as a film of great warmth and importance. 7.5/10 || When I first started watching the movie ""Big Eyes"" starring Amy Adams, I didn't have high expectations. I assumed it would be another typical older film that had its time in the spotlight. However, I was pleasantly surprised as the story unfolded.

The film follows a wife who decides to leave her husband, realizing he's not the right match for her. She finds solace in a painter who she admires, leading to a fast-paced romance. Both characters are artists, with the wife painting children with big, expressive eyes that reflect deep emotions and turmoil.

The movie boasts exceptional acting, a compelling storyline, and a captivating plot. As the narrative progresses, it's revealed that the husband is a fraudulent artist, taking credit for his wife's work and financial gains. The twist adds depth to the story and keeps viewers engaged.

What truly impressed me was discovering that ""Big Eyes"" is based on a true story. This revelation added a layer of credibility and authenticity to the film, making the ending even more satisfying. The actors' performances were outstanding, bringing the characters to life in a remarkable way.

Overall, ""Big Eyes"" exceeded my expectations with its powerful story, excellent delivery, and conclusive ending. It was a film that left me feeling excited and fulfilled by the time the credits rolled."

I like the idea of <em>'Into the Woods'</em>, with its mash-up of numerous fairy tales from <em>'Cinderella'</em> to <em>'Little Red Riding Hood'</em> to <em>'Jack and the Beanstalk'</em> to <em>'Rapunzel'</em>. I'd also say the musical pieces are enjoyable across the opening 20-30 minutes, which are nice and energetic.

However, from the midway point things start chugging down to a snail's pace. The novelty of the premise begins to wear thin, as it becomes clear that there isn't much more to tell - despite a load of the 125 minute run time still remaining. I will say, though, the look of the film is pleasant.

I do also rate the casting. James Corden seems to split opinion online, but I've always liked him; having watched and enjoyed him since his career took off with UK TV's <em>'Gavin & Stacey'</em>. Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp are two of my favourite actors, while Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick are strong casts. I like Chris Pine too, but he's iffy in this.

Humor, action and adventure well plotted into this great movie. The action is just great. || A nice surprise.

I was not expecting anything from this movie but it turned to be a really funny one, borrowing from all the other spy's movies around.

Collin Firth is a great choose and you can say the same for most of the cast, remarking also Samuel L. Jackson.

An easy movie for a brainless evening. || The kinetic super-spy caper ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ will serve as a boisterous blueprint for those teen fanboys out there that will fancy an elaborate overload of James Bond-esque high-powered hedonism. It certainly does not hurt that the high-wire hysteria as showcased in the twitchy ‘Kingman’ is based upon the acclaimed comicbook series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. Also, add into the mix the movie-making overdrive pedigree of director Matthew Vaughn (‘Kick-Ass’, ‘X-Men: First Class’) and slick, cheeky spy-spry send-ups that recall the over-the-top espionage genre and its exaggerated suspense-driven foundation. Well, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ is a cockeyed, pulsating parody that works its ultra-violent magic for the Austin Powers crowd that wants to walk on the high-octane wild side of Bond’s universe.

Sure, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ has its iffy moments where the blatant sexist overtones, magnified violent sequences and a generous bloody bounce of excess will have some stomping their feet in sheer indignation. The apparent knock on ‘Kingsman’ will be its robust ridiculousness and familiarity in Vaughn’s ‘Kick-Ass’ cartoonish vibe. However, the same elements that may cause some reservations with the film’s low-brow lunacy is also the same ingredients that trigger ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’s carousing charm in majestic mayhem.

The grand gimmick behind behind kick-starting ‘Kingsman’s go-for-broke rollicking is casting the sophisticated presence of the Oscar-winning Colin Firth (‘The King’s Speech’) as dapper Harry Hart (aka ‘Galahad’), a polished and prominent superspy for a British secret intelligence society.  Hart’s top-secret spy network is headed up by Arthur (Oscar-winner Michael Caine). The secretive operation is based out of a notable tailor’s shop known as Kingsman. Also worth noting is that all the secret service agents are named after the famed knights of King Arthur’s Round Table. Go figure. In any event, the suave Harry Hart is the debonair face of the spy organisation and will play a critical part in both recruiting a young up-and-coming agent with decent physical skills and tracking down a worldwide menace bent of destroying the planet. It is all in a day’s work for the skilled, well-dressed licensed-to-kill operative.

Hart, who had been loyally connected to a fallen colleague from a past mission gone disastrous years before, decides to become a mentor for his late co-worker’s troubled son Gary ‘Eggsy’ Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) whose law-breaking conduct catches the attention of the police. Feeling a sense of responsibility for his deceased spy buddy’s wayward kid, Hart takes Eggsy under his wings and determines to shape the misguided youngster into resilient Kingman stock. After all, Eggsy has the needed physicality (we are told he is an exceptional gymnast) and roguish spunk to join the ranks of the seemingly understaffed spy outfit. Soon, Eggy and other recruits will be grilled through rigorous training from Kingman member Merlin (Mark Strong) as they look to fill the spot vacated recently from the dead Lancelot.

The dearly departed Lancelot, it turns out, was the latest victim of ruthless criminal mastermind Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). The flashy Valentine, a billionaire gone bonkers, hopes to control the world’s climate change. He is known as a mega-wealthy entrepreneur and philanthropist but his sinister heart yearns for some heavy-handed dastardly deeds that puts him on the immediate radar for Hart and his crafty Kingsmen to spring into action. At the demented Valentine’s side is the deliciously disabled exotic henchwoman Gazelle (Sophia Boutella) with the treacherous knack for disarming her adversaries with blazing blades.

The bombastic and eye-pleasing ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ sets out to have one goal in mind: to highlight its thunderous homage to spygate spectacles that salute everything from the Agent 007 flicks and related free-wheeling 60’s fare such as the ‘Matt Helm’ and ‘Derek Flint’ spy franchises to the recent espionage vehicles that invite the millennium-based harried heroes such as the Jason Bournes and Jack Ryans of the world into the frenetic fold.  It is fast, furious and unapologetic in its rambunctious spirit as a ricocheting romp.

Vaughn, in all his rousing Tarantino-esque tactics, unleashes a visceral assault that is visually wrapped in his escapist package of an adrenaline rush. Wisely, Vaughn incorporates some of his ‘Kick-Ass’ colourful calisthenics to arm his playful spy yarn. As the veteran spygame squires, both Firth and Caine are game for the frolic they signed up to participate in with puckish aplomb. Jackson brings his usual explosive badass persona to the table as the villainous fashion plate Valentine. The 14 year-old males will draw their adventurous inspiration from Egerton’s junior spy Eggsy Unwin. Some may become nostalgic when uncovering the likes of spotting ‘Star Wars’ icon Mark Hamill as an imperiled climate changer scientist caught in the crazy clutches of Jackson’s diabolical antagonist. 

Although not the most inventive take on ridiculing the spy genre with over-extended finesse and sensationalism, ‘Kingsman: The Secret Service’ is still a preferred jolting distraction at the beginning of an early stillborn movie season.

I was not expecting the third movie, but it made its way and I give it a try only to get disappointed.

Ben Stiller is a fine actor and a great director, this trilogy was just a passing cloud in his career, other I would have blamed him for accepting the offer. As we know its a multi star movie, in that I am very happy to see Robin Williams one final time. What a great actor, lucky we had him in our time. The funny thing is I am confused for Rebel Wilson as Melissa McCarthy, but soon after realised.

The rest of the cast, Wilson, Coogan, Kingsley and other were what to say, their existence were in individual narrow thin lane in a weak story. Badly needed a fresh plot in the well known concept from the last two movies, and it did not give us. Hope the reboot would be very creative in the each three. May be it should set in the Hollywood studios like Marvel, Disney et cetera. Because, as I am a movie fanatic, love to see some of my favourite characters like Gandalf the gray, Joker et cetera, as well as beasts like Godzilla, King Kong et cetera come alive at night. It would be so awesome. Anyway, this movie was just okay for a certain reason. Don't expect high, because it won't serve you.

5/10 || Is very very funny!!! I like the movie... || Night at the Museum: The Closure.

Part 3 - and expected last instalment - of the poplar NATM series pitches Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) on a mission to save the magic stone that brings his exhibit friends to life. So off he goes to London where new characters and new exhibit creatures join the frothy frolics.

In truth it's all very predictable and plays exactly like the money maker it is, but as with the other two films prior to this one, it has bundles of joy for the kiddies, whilst inserting some dark patches and edgy gags for the benefit of the adults. There's fun cameos, one of which is a joyous belter, and all the returning cast members are joined by an ebullient Dan Stevens as Sir Lancelot.

For a series closer it could have disgraced itself, but with some neat injection of ideas and decent story telling, it winds up as above average. The caveat, though, is that at the same time it convinces that the franchise has very much run its course. 6/10"

In any event, ‘Seventh Son’ is in good company (or is that bad company?) with flaccid fare such as the sci-fi eyesore ‘Jupiter Ascending’ and the meatless melodrama ‘The Boy Next Door’ joining the parade of putrid pictures occupying the big screen at the same time. What is even more shockingly shoddy about ‘Seventh Son’s embarrassing presentation as a sluggish supernatural movie misstep is the inclusion of Oscar-winner Jeff Bridges (‘Crazy Heart’) and current Oscar-nominee Julianne Moore (for 2014’s ‘Still Alice’) saddled in director Sergei Bodrov’s (‘Mongol) period piece sci-fi sludge. Bridges’s gray-haired evil-bashing spook and Moore’s wicked witch may very well deserve to have their SAG cards revoked upon audiences sitting through this faceless fantasy of hocus-pocus.

‘Seventh Son’ wastes no time in setting up its familiar, generic premise involving a mentor-trainee tandem in the wise and haggard spook Gregory (Bridges) and his youthful farmboy protege Thomas Ward (Ben Barnes), an apprentice learning the ropes in taming the evil-doers that dare to exist and persist. Get this…old Gregory is considered a laughingstock (in addition to appearing as a leading personality in this ludicrous narrative) for believing in the evil-minded forces that he warns about consistently. Well, Gregory’s warnings are not so humorous to the naysayers when the sinister witch Mother Malkin (Moore) makes her hostile presence known. Resembling ‘Maleficent’s gaudy twin sister in wardrobe, Mother Malkin escapes her confines to concentrate on two treacherous tasks at hand: seek revenge on the meddling geezer Gregory and, of course, to control the world under her devilish grasp. The sorcery sass Malkin means business and the desperate Gregory must contain her with the recruitment of the chosen Thomas.

Naturally, Thomas comes with a unique yet confusing mythology attached to his backstory which explains Gregory’s undivided attention towards the young sword-wielding raw talent. It is revealed that the revered young-blood Thomas is the ‘seventh son’ from a lineage of seventh sons in his lineage. Thus, Thomas has the specialized aura to carry his own weight into battle as he will serve as an adequate fighting tool for Gregory and the cause to restore order for a doomed society not ready to deal with cutthroat Queen of Mean in Mother Malkin.

So we witness Thomas’ so-called training methods and the philosophical mantras that go along with his journey in the name of good versus evil. What would a stud-in-combat-mode be without a lovely lady as an incentive to complete his heroic sacrifices? In this case, Thomas develops a romance with his object of affection in half-witch Alice (Alicia Vikander) who may have some hidden relationship secrets of her own that may prove critical.

Bodrov’s wooden direction and screenwriters Charles Leavitt (‘Blood Diamonds’) and Steven Knight (‘Easter Promises’) present an amateurish and spotty script that does no favours at all for the rancid ‘Seventh Son’. Drowsy dialogue, disjointed storylines, hammy acting, tedious fight sequences, derivative-looking 3-D special effect flourishes, cornball sorcery ans swords swagger, spaced-out and unintentional amusing dragons and other convoluted creatures are all are on delusional display in this faulty fable that feels strung together in the aftermath of a drunken stupor originating at the local pub.

In this demonic dud, both Bridges (whose ‘Seventh’ role recalls the forgettable flop ‘R.I.P.D.’) and Moore are outrageously cast in this clumsy costumed drama and one has to wonder why these veteran performers would sign on the dotted line to appear in this medieval mess? Barnes follows suit as the touted apprentice but his Luke Skywalker-lite antics in ‘Seventh Son’ are dismissed almost instantly. Even the pronounced presence of Oscar-nominee Djimon Hounsou (‘Blood Diamonds’, ‘Gladiator’, ‘In America’) cannot give any animated muscle as he appears as Radu, a multiple blade-armed, sword-swinging warlock with stylish jazzy chain accessories. Only the supporting roles of Vikander’s bewitching beauty Alice and Olivia Williams’s Mam Ward (Thomas’ mother) come out of this vacuous venture looking mildly memorable and inviting.

‘Seventh Son’ is based upon the Joseph Delaney books with a decent following in literary circles. The big screen adaptation of Delaney’s pages is meager to say the least. Clearly, there will be no heralded ‘Twilight’ trend beneath ‘Seventh Son’s cinematic wings and, if this statement is proven wrong, then perhaps those very same wings need a serious clipping.

Critic’s rating: * star (out of 4 stars) || This is a good, solid fantasy adventure. It is not a “wow great” kind of movie but definitely enjoyable to watch, at least if you are a fan of fantasy, magic, dragons and such like.

The movie is based on a book which I have not read although I believe it is considered as a young adult book. The movie seems to reflect this in that it has a fairly simple, straightforward, adventure plot. This is a movie made to entertain with magic, adventure, a bit of humor and visual effects. Nothing more and nothing less.

In my opinion it does so fairly well. I do like Jeff Bridges in his role as a rather wacky hunter of evil witches who have fallen into a dark and uncaring attitude towards the world around him. Uncaring about everything except slaying of witches that is. Ben Barnes, portraying the apprentice and Seventh Son is unfortunately making a rather bland impression. Then Julianne Moore is definitely better as the evil witch.

No movie where fantasy, magic and dragons are among the main themes can be without special effects. So, not surprisingly, there are a fair amount of them in this movie. I think they are generally well made and complements the story well without being overdone.

On the whole I liked the movie. It is a simple but solid adventure story with just the right amount of a few humorous remarks, nice visual effects, a bit of romance and action."

It came as a little surprise. Obviously I was looking for this film, but not expected to reach at this level. The film was really brilliant despite the influence of plenty of other films. Yes, the ideas were borrowed from the movies like 'Short Circuit', 'I, Robot', 'RoboCop', Real Steel', ""Bicentennial Man', 'Transcendence', et cetera. But that did not bother me at all. I would call it an inspiration to make a new product out that already existed.

It was not completely depended on Dev Patel's role, otherwise woulda been a disaster. Its the Hugh Jackman, eventhough his character was not on the frontline, because of his presence, the movie was filled with some exciting and thrilling moment. His role was pretty much same to 'Real Steal', but showed in a different shade.

Silly concept, even dialogues were so stupid. I don't know, maybe because of the South African accent. But the screenplay was very good. Fast and gets the point quickly than wasting time for buildups. One of the best robot movie and it will be remembered. Looks like the sequel will be more furious and going to be an action packed item, if there will be one. Worth to watch it at least once.

This was nominated for the Oscars, but did not win. I should have watched it earlier, but I don't know how I forgot it and moved on. Recently noticed that I've missed it, so finally gave it a try and I really liked, but very sad to learn what the film narrated. This is a biopic, an aged photographer who traveled world revealed his experience with those horrifying encounters the humanity ever saw. From South America to Europe and Africa to Pacific Asia, he takes us back to the 70s, 80s and the 90s. His pictures tell us all the story, but when he explain more surround those pictures when he had taken them, that's where not just me, anybody who sees this documentary would be heartbroken.

Initially I thought it was just a photo exhibition from the past 40- 50 years of his life, but after the opening few minutes, it kicked off from Brasil to the different parts of the world, like how people suffered from our own mistakes. Also the nature like the oil fields in Iraq, polar and sea animals, tribes, all are very fascinating, as well as upsets with the facts that causing all those troubles. Before watching this I thought it might tell about actual salt of the Earth, the chemistry, to brief its past, present and future. But what the film revealed was shocking and at a time, thanks for being very bold, for the present world, it definitely needed.

This is just one man's experience, we don't know what might have happened behind when there is no camera to capture the moment and to tell the story to the rest of the world. A must see film, a documentary film like this is never late to see, even if it takes a lifetime to watch, you must take that chance and do that before you die. I have seen lots of documentaries like this, but this is not a message deliverer, it just finger pointed to our mistakes. You will learn some of the history that you ever learnt from your school, college textbooks or from your own journey around the world. So definitely these pictures are priceless. Not to admire, but to remind not to repeat in the future. I hope you watch it right away after reading my review.

It was another Russian film just like the Oscar nominee 'Leviathan' that highlighted the corruption in a city administration, except it had no depth in its narration like that one did. A simple tale that takes place within the 24 hours, but strongly told. From the domestic violence to the political targets, the film extraordinarily portrayed its each character and some of theirs double-cross. Besides, it discloses what the higher and lower class expects from each other, like it is already in order and those who disturb it will be seriously get affected.

When a public utility worker Dima Nikitin finds an enormous crack in an apartment block, initially he ignores it, but later thinks something terrible going to happen. As his duty, he notifies the higher ranked authorities in the middle of the night when they were partying. At the time when it was going to be declared emergency in the town and to take all the precaution measures, the tale takes a twist that changes the fate of many who were involved in the matter. So the dark side of the story comes into the display.

Showcasing Russia in such a bad light really hurts if you're a Russian. More than that, the outsiders judging a country from what the film depicts is very sad. It was neither true story, nor inspired by the true story, but this kind of things happens in every other countries. More or less the experts agree with the film to the present state of the Russian political landscape. It was financially co-supported by the ministry of culture that tells us they're going tough against such action. So this film was received well from all the quarters thinking such kind of portrayal might lead to transformation in the struggling society.

> ""A fish rots from the head down.
> If I am tainted, then so are all of you.""

In this, the main event was given the prime focus than any of the film characters. That's why the happy or the sad ending won't matter. But there was a character who was preferred the most for his involvement in the plot. In the meantime, it also followed other characters to add more complication in its narration and the story to get going. Overall, it was something like a chain reaction that began with a domestic violence and moved to the public service till it reached its highest end, I mean the head of the each department and the politicians.

What the film's end was outlined is something the negative side of the society. The lack of the knowledge of the lower class families and the negligence of the civil servants is the reason for most of the tragedy that could have stopped before it to happen. The title is a metaphor for one who unnecessarily raising his voice in a matter where others were being quiet. All the above, knowing what's coming at you and taking an improper way to tackle it is what's going unnoticed. Unless every citizen join hands to fight against the corruption, this thing will go on.

The film totally captures our attention. Obviously a slow start, but you could have not expected the way it ended. I haven't seen a single Russian film at the recent time, but very pleased with this. It was a double strike, delivering a message as well as a fine story for a film who seek only the entertainment. In some way, it was so much simpler and better than that Oscar nominee I mentioned. Because unlike that film, in here majority of us who always root for a particular film character mostly won't end in disappointment. That's the cleverness of this narration. If you had liked that film, then you should not miss this film as well.

Actually, it was not a bad movie, I really enjoyed it. But associated with 'Taken' and being the third film in the series was the setback. Because unlike the first two films, this one was somewhat detached from the original theme. Except the cast from the previous two, the story takes place in a completely different platform. From all the three films, the phone call between father and daughter was retained, but was not effective as the first one which became just a trademark of the series, that's all.

The first half creates the puzzle and next half solves it. As expected, it was a typical structure in this trilogy, but the last quarter was turned into something like 'Mission Impossible'. In 'Taken' films, Bryan Mills (our lead guy) works alone, but he formed a team with a tech guy and others. That does not sound good, at least tried to be different from the original movie.

It is a little disappointment for 'Taken' fans, but you will have a best shot if you see it as an independent one off movie. Yes could have made a better action flick if it was not linked to it. Hope it all ends here like they have said. As a trilogy, it failed, or maybe we can call it a 50-50. But the first one was a masterpiece, a trendsetting piece.

6.5/10 || The rugged and feisty Liam Neeson (as on-screen alter ego ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills) is back in fighting form for a third and supposedly final go-around in ‘Taken 3′. This tired and tepid action-packed crime thriller is directed by French filmmaker Olivier Megaton (‘Taken 2’, ‘Transporter 3’) with screenwriting credits attributed to ‘Taken’ producer Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Clearly Neeson and company want to squeeze the remaining strained juices out of the ‘Taken’ film franchise as this movie series trilogy ends on an exhausting whimper. Uninspired, toothless and motoring on empty impishness, ‘Taken 3′ has run its kinetic course for the aging Neeson to aim, shoot and take down some serious repetitive butt-kicking numbers.

After the last two energizing installments where flashy foreign locales were a major part of the appealing ‘Taken’ universe, ‘Taken 3′ is reduced to unraveling in the uneventful backyard of familiar Los Angeles that definitely lacks the exotic excitement and visual vitality that were previously showcased in posh landscapes such as Paris and Istanbul. In fact, star Neeson reportedly nixed the idea to partake in the ‘Taken 3′ production if there was another concept of kidnapping involved. Huh? Why avoid the element of kidnapping when in fact it was the soundly running gimmick that made the ‘Taken’ experience palpable and pulsating? Still, this is the least of ‘Taken 3’s bothersome problems as the movie delves in the manufactured mockery involving cliched car chases, sketchy gunplay and the inclusion of countless Russian mobsters parading about in obligatory fashion. Importantly, even Neeson seems quite disengaged as his robotic Bryan Mills goes through the motions trying to find some upside in the forced upbeat shenanigans that seem to trudge along scene after scene.

The very first outing in ‘Taken’ took audiences by surprised as it featured a matured Neeson as an avenging former CIA human weapon Mills committed to his fatherly duties in manhandling the Albanian human traffickers that dared to abscond his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). In ‘Taken 2′, the hostile adversaries want Mills’s head on a platter after he tore up their territory in his crusade to rescue his precious offspring from the opportunistic ruffians. Now Mills finds his neck on the line in the connection with his ex-wife Lenore’s (Famke Janssen) brutal murder. Look out LA…the harried Bryan Mills is out in survival mode. The question remains: whose blood will be spilled in the process?

Prior to Lenore’s senseless demise, she had visited her ex-hubby Bryan and the feelings between the former spouses are still strong. Mills still carries an emotional torch for Lenore but he cannot act upon his affections for her. Poor Lenore is trapped in her current unhappy marriage with an insufferable moneybags misfit Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott). In the aftermath of Lenore’s death, the distraught and beleaguered Mills finds out the trouble that he is embroiled in so convincingly. As a result of his former lover’s slaughtering Bryan Mills is reeling with outrage. Yes, folks, it appears that Mills is on the run and must prove his innocence and bring to the forefront the murderers that butchered Lenore. Mills has on his mind the need to protect his exposed college-aged daughter Kim from potential harm as well.

In the meanwhile, the LAPD lead investigator in Franck Doltzer (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, ‘The King Of Scotland’) must track down the defiant Mills and make some sense out of the Lenore Mills St. John slaying.  Mills proves to be elusive and crafty as usual while leaving behind his trademark trashing of battered bodies and bouncing bullets in the chaotic southern California streets.

Seemingly, the catchy novelty act of a hulking middle-aged Neeson exploding at the seams in action-oriented fashion resonated with glorious forethought. After all, ‘Taken’ single-handily resurrected Neeson’s box office cred and made him a cinematic hipster to the young folks and his aged contemporaries alike.  However, the third time is not the charm in revisiting the gun-toting ‘grandpa’. Sadly, ‘Taken 3′ is mindlessly played out as Neeson’s Mills or the handlers behind this hollow hedonistic actioner have dipped their toes in an empty well of ideas to conclude this three-part crime caper.

Let’s face facts…we all were ‘Taken’ in by this pseudo punchy action yarn that no longer generates the destructive heat it once punctuated with carefree confidence.

Critic’s rating: ** stars (out of four stars) || I was looking forward to this movie and I have to say that I was a wee bit disappointed. It is a decent enough action movie but the script leaves somewhat to be desired. A good chunk of the movie is quite good, actually it is very good, but there are some crucial scenes that, in my opinion, really drags it down to a rather mediocre level.

The plot is a fairly classical, not a very intelligent nor a very original, one. When trying to push the third sequel in a series Hollywood have a tendency to fall back on certain “trusted” elements. Like, make the hero haunted by the law and / or the government (no I do not consider the government to be the same as the law) or kill off some of the main (or at least likable) characters.

In this movie they are doing both. I do not know why this always seems to be the standard solution because I certainly do not like it. Are the general movie going audience really falling for these, in my mind, cheap scripts? I guess they must be since this formula is repeated over and over again. Well, it is not for me to judge other peoples tastes and if I would have been a bean counter for the movie industry then it would really have been my duty to squeeze out as much money as possible regardless of whether I thought it would make a good movie or not, However, I am not. I am a consumer of movies and my personal opinion is that these plot elements are pretty cheap and not really to my liking. But then, that is just me.

Anyway, the movie is not really bad. It is a decent enough action movie and, in general, I quite like the performance of Liam Neeson. He is the half-sad, silent and, most of all, ass-kicking hero that I like. He is pretty much what holds this movie together. Well, that was perhaps not entirely fair. Forrest Whitaker is doing a quite good job as well. Most of the other characters are mostly fillers. The main bad guy started off fairly good but he really never got the chance to shine and the ending scenes with the big confrontation was…well I would say pretty pathetic.

This brings us to my man gripe with this movie. Up until this point Liam Neeson was really playing the big bad, and really skilled, killing machine. The way he, with the help of his friends, entered the bad guy’s stronghold was perhaps not very innovative (seen that, been there, and done that) but at least it was professional. After that however it turned into a bloody joke. Not only does our hero walk into a heavily defended stronghold carrying only a small pea shooter but every time he manages to liberate a decent weapon from the hopelessly incompetent bad guys he throws it away and, occasionally, picks up another pea shooter. What the f…?

Then we have the fairly ridiculous big fight at the end where the bad guy runs around in his underwear. That was just embarrassing. Maybe I could have swallowed the underwear thing if it was not for the fact that Lieam Neeson suddenly lost all kind of professionalism. Apart from the pea shooter syndrome mentioned before he just gets himself wacked by this maniac until, in the last minute, he miraculously recovers and gets the upper hand. There were a few minor glimpses of intelligence in the whole scene but they were never really exploited.

On the whole, if would say this was a fairly decent and enjoyable action movie but I was expecting more from it. If the last third of the movie would have matched the first two thirds then my rating would have been higher. Maybe Liam Neeson is not a big enough star, although I like him a lot, to pick his roles like he wants to but I would say that he should indeed be a bit more picky and read the scripts before signing on."

This is the story of the United States and China, that also involves some of the southeast Asian nations when the story takes us there. So this tale is about an explosion at a Chinese nuclear plant and followed by the investigation conducted by the US and Chinese collaboration, the cops hire a convicted hacker to fast up the process and to nab the culprit who was behind the power plant disaster. These people begin their hunting by tracking the clues to the different locations and where they finally land and how it all come end told in the rest of the film.

I felt it was a too much realistic presentation. Like a documentary film quality, but full suspense filled story that stretched to over two hours. So sometimes it was very boring, because slowing down in any big development. At a time, some of the important scenes accomplished so fast like most of the action sequences. It mainly revolved around hacking plot, but was not that intelligent, so can be understood by everyone.

Initially I disliked those circuit board graphics, which I thought was a good detail, but too much for a film like this and it never looked so convincing. The film was average, but I anticipated lot better than that. I liked the actors though. Whether it was Chris Hemsworth or the Chinese counterparts, all were decent according to what the tale required. The film is not for everybody, particularly if you don't like slow narration, you should not consider it to watch. But the film is not bad for once viewing.

All levity aside, _Terminator: Genisys_ is not great. They took some risks with their casting and it didn’t explode in their face which is nice, a lot of the effects were very visually impressive, and it was fun to see the weapons of the future be purple lasers again, but these aren’t things that make a good movie by themselves.

Honestly, it's even worse than T3, which at least felt like a continuation of the series.

Here everything is changed so much that, well, there is nothing left. It took the entire Terminator franchise, and re-worked it to kill all the canon, all the mythology, for no apparent reason whatsoever.

And what you have left is a disheveled mess that is guaranteed to make the old fans give up and walk away because of the sheer needlessness alone."

I actually thought it was better then 1st.i liked the storyline in this one better as well. || Walt Disney's classic film, 101 Dalmatians, may not be completely original as it is based on a previous book, but it has turned its characters into beloved favorites, especially Pongo and Purdy. The movie will make you fall in love with all the adorable puppies like Lucky, Penny, Patch, and Freckles.

The animation is superb with just the right amount of music that doesn't overwhelm the storyline but does give us the memorable song of Cruella Deville. Speaking of the villain, Cruella is an iconic and fantastically over-the-top character, with Horace and Jasper adding to the trio's incredible dynamic.

The film is a delightful experience from start to finish, a complete classic that has been a box office success and is one of Walt Disney's triumphs. Moving forward, the live-action films, 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, are based on the cartoon and offer a fresh take on the story with Glenn Close's portrayal of Cruella Deville being particularly outstanding.

While the movies may have a few plot holes, they are still top-notch entertainment. The sequel, 101 Dalmatians Part 2 in the Animated Series, focuses on Patch's adventures in London, adding a new dimension to the beloved story. Although the animated series may not reach the same heights as the original or the movies, it is still worth a watch for fans of the franchise.

Overall, the four films together create an enjoyable and incredible experience. They are definitely worth checking out, with Patch's story adding an extra layer of fun to the beloved Dalmatian universe."

If you're expecting this to be an actual movie and make any sort of sense whatsoever, then be disappointed.  Honestly, I'm just thankful there was ANY amount of continuity to this.

This is literally a movie version of ""hold my beer, I've got a funny bit to show you""  it would have saved a lot of time and actually been funnier if you cut everything before the start of the games and just had random movie characters interacting with each other...or just do the whole thing as a sketch comedy compilation, which is closer to what it is than anything else.

This includes some of the weirdest opinions I've ever seen shown through movie.  Jamie Kennedy does two different impression roles that seem to make statements on actual people, characters share names with the actual people that portrayed the characters, they gave Ted a dick (which he specifically didn't have, as part of his character) and made him giant sized,  I think they slandered the Muppets, they took shots at Gandalf and Thor (both of whom would stalemate in these games), they shoehorned in an Obama joke, they did a ""sassy black girl"" character for Roe, but must have decided it wasn't racist enough so they did a bad voice over so she could still look (sort of) like Roe but have a Queen Latifah sized attitude, they specifically included ""gratuitous"" nudity but then have actual gratuitous nudity so they're clearly not going for anything clever there.

If you just want to turn your brain off and go, ""HAHA, Zach Galifinikas is getting it on with the blue chick from Avatar!"", then maybe the above is actually going to sell you on the movie, but I honestly think this is a nightmare for anyone who is going to look past the inclusion of hot chicks and vague movie refrences."

It was not too long ago I saw the director's other film, his first one and liked it instantly. I did not expect him to go all the way from a beautiful teen drama to a creepy horror flick. But I liked this movie as well, thus that prove he's not a fluke. After seeing his both the films, I can detect the style of presentation that marks his trademark. That is very realistic, dull, but a natural societal atmosphere with a mere background score.

I have said many times that these days horror flicks are heavily leaning on the scary noise/sounds. But this film brings the tone that's really happening around us. The story was like a straight flowing river, no twists or turns like the Amazon river. Even it did not try to hide the existence of the evil spirit. Not only from us, but among the characters in the story. That means it is a very simple tale with the compelling scenes.

It does not look like a cheap horror, this 2 million movie can stand up to any fancy horror flicks. The writer/director's interpretation was very interesting too. Like he said IT could board a plane to follow who he's after. The theme was also very innovative. Quite similar types have made out, but this one was way better. Yep, many movie goers overwhelmed by the unexpected, even the filmmakers for the response.

Now I pray for if there is going to be a sequel, it must be made by the same writer/director. My worry is the B category filmmakers going to spoil the original in the name of follow-up. I highly recommend this movie, especially for adults due to the plot that develops on the sexual intercourse. Though there's no strong nudity. I also suggest you to watch at night, if possible alone. I won't guarantee that it would scare out of you, but that's the best way to watch any horror flick.

8/10 || I wanted more by the end, but that's not to say <em>'It Follows'</em> isn't a very, very good film - it is.

I adore the look of the film, the cinematography is superb; the score is nice too. Maika Monroe leads a solid cast excellently. The premise is certainly interesting and it does create suitable tension, while the effects used are neat. The plot is quite sexual, potentially overly so in a couple of moments but in truth it needs to be for the most part. I would've, elsewhere, appreciated a deeper dive into the antagonists, also.

I could see a sequel coming from this, it's the sorta concept that could easily produce many sequels. I'd be fine with just the one, but would watch another - it must keep the same vibe though. || **It Follows shines as a unique and fresh horror film that pours on the anxiety and dread with a clever slow burn that will keep its viewers glued to the screen, desperate to see what happens next.**

Ok, ok, ok. I know the synopsis of this movie sounds like a lame excuse to focus on the sexual escapades of young college students, as many horror movies do. Instead, It Follows is surprisingly creative, well-done, and fresh that doesn't linger on the sensual but instead almost warns of potential consequences. The premise of a slow but relentless entity endlessly pursuing its cursed target is eerie, tense, and filled with suspense. Typical horror films repeat the same face-paced terror and disturbing gore and images. However, It Follows sets itself apart with a slow-building tension that keeps its audience unsettled but engaged, wondering what will happen next. This movie deserves all its hype with its innovative concept, clever script, and genius directing. While it does have unnecessary random nudity near the end, It Follows is worth fast-forwarding a few seconds to enjoy a creepy masterstroke of slow-burn horror."

Now, the maniac is back…","Thriller, Horror",85.0,2014-10-16,en,5.71,477.0,2.9033,"Addison Timlin, Veronica Cartwright, Travis Tope, Anthony Anderson, Joshua Leonard",Alfonso Gomez-Rejon,"ghoulish, harsh, horrified","_**A copycat killer is on the loose in Texarkana**_

It has been 67 years since The Texarkana Moonlight Murders of 1946 and a new “phantom killer” surfaces with copycat attacks, usually occurring during “lovers’ lane” scenarios.

“The Town that Dreaded Sundown” (2014) is not a remake of the 1976 B-flick, but rather a meta-sequel. It’s best to see the original first (if you’re not already acquainted with it) since there are so many references. This is a worthwhile companion-piece. 

To be expected, the filmmaking is all-around better, particularly the excellent color & cinematography, as well as the gore factor; unfortunately, the editing is sometimes too manic, like in the cornfield sequence. There’s also a bit too much sleaze for my taste, including perversion (which was at least amusing).

This is basically an amalgam of the original movie with elements of “Freddy vs. Jason” (2003), the remake of “Friday the 13th” (2009) and “Scream” (1996), plus the raunchiness of “Psycho III” (1986).

Addison Timlin is effective as the winsome protagonist, Jami. Meanwhile Morganna Bridgers is on hand as Kendra, a girl that’s enthusiastic about her man coming back from oversees, and Lanee Landry appears as Ardele. All three women are worthy one way or another. Veteran Veronica Cartwright even shows up.

The film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Texarkana on the Texas/Arkansas border, as well as Shreveport, Louisiana. 

GRADE: B-/C+ || After viewing ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"" I had high hopes for a thrilling horror movie that would keep me on the edge of my seat. However, the film turned out to be a letdown, with a twist at the end being the only moment of intrigue. The rest of the movie felt drawn-out, absurd, and uninteresting.

As the plot unfolded, it became increasingly clear that the film was leading to nowhere, and the gradual decline in quality left me feeling disengaged until the final twist involving the murderer. Despite some horror elements being teased throughout, they failed to deliver any significant impact, leaving the viewer with a sense of unfulfilled expectations. Additionally, the film relied heavily on sexual themes that felt unnecessary and out of place.

Overall, ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" failed to live up to its potential as a captivating horror movie and instead ended up being a disappointing and unsatisfying watch."

The jokes are all the usual round of nautical, innuendo-ridden, quips (though I am not sure I heard ""avast behind"" in there) and the cast look like they are all enjoying themselves as the story plots it's predictable, but entertaining, course. Somehow I felt the ""Carry On"" films worked better in black and white, the humour pertained more to the past rather than the colour of the future, but this takes a swipe at all things cruising: snobbery, excess, boredom and the middle classes who tended to occupy the cabins when not getting blotto on cocktails they had never heard of - and it does it quite well. It's a chortle, not a laugh out enterprise and is anchored well by some pithy writing and Messrs. James and Williams."

Abrams, Michael Arndt, Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams","android, spacecraft, space opera","So where were you when the Science Fiction cinema sensation ‘Star Wars’ took shape and captured the imagination of the massive global moviegoers’ escapist expectations back in 1977? Regardless of whether you existed thirty-eight years ago or not, the legend of George Lucas’ highly-heralded SF blockbuster that shattered box office records worldwide was automatically engrained in your cinematic psyche. Now nearly four decades later, the motion picture phenomenon that took place in ‘a galaxy a long time ago…far, far away’ has come to expand its entertaining promise and prominence even after numerous servings of movie sequels, television specials and other fanfare attributes that promoted the ‘Star Wars’ agenda throughout the countless years.

The modern-day arrival of yet another ‘Star Wars’ edition in the millennium movie-making age of technical and tactical brilliance is quite fitting and filmmaker J.J. Abrams is the right choice to helm this sacred film franchise and present a whole new litany of continuing adventurous narratives for a new generation of ‘Star Wars’ personalities dipping their tenacious toes into ‘the force of goodness’ battling ‘the dark side’ of authoritative evil.

In Abrams’s reboot ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’, the anticipation of enhancing and enlightening the reputation and respect of the Lucas landscape of stormtroopers, light sabres and of course the iconic ‘Star Wars’ returnees from the treasured trio of Harrison Ford (Han Solo)/Carrie Fisher (Leia) and Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) registers with a nostalgic blast of appreciation and exhilaration. ‘The Force Awakens’ is a sheer big screen celebration of majestic impishness and intrigue that will fortify the hunger of both casual and rabid ‘Star Wars’ fanatics. Indeed, the hype is warranted and Abrams, the mastermind of the big-budget movie sequelitis, is in top form as he triumphantly presents ‘The Force Awakens’ on a prized silver platter designed for its surging golden moments of charged ebullience.

In looking at the numbers game that is connected to the overall ‘Star Wars’ universe, it is hard to believe that the last prequel was released just a decade ago. Furthermore, it is mind-boggling that the aforementioned ‘Star Wars’ ‘royalty’ in Ford, Fisher and Hamill have shared the same space on film for the first time in over three decades since they last were featured in a ‘Star Wars’ movie together. Nevertheless, no one can deny that ‘The Force Awakens’ does not take the challenge in combining the remembrance of the ‘Star Wars’ installments of yesteryear with the fresh brand of current upstarts willing to engage in another boisterous saga that begins a whole chapter of compelling wonderment. The mix of veterans and novices in ‘The Force Awakens’ is quite interesting but the familiarity of the storytelling heft of good vs. evil is always a solid sell in the realm of the ‘Star Wars’ utopia.

The good news is that ‘The Force Awakens’ not only serves as a bridge that crosses both boundaries past and present in ‘Star Wars’ folklore but it taps into the masterful mystique that Lucas and company worked so diligently to showcase so historically some thirty-eight years ago. Still, some may have lobbied for a stronger storyline in ‘The Force Awakens’ as they may gently dismiss it as being merely thin in its premise while viewing it primarily as a launching pad to develop yet another series of movies to create the ‘Star Wars’ juggernaut for this current-day climax of warped speed wizardry. For those that want a basic outline of ‘The Force Awakens’ pulse it is as such where the beloved yet aging tandem of standouts Han Solo and Chewbacca (yes, good old hulking and walking hairball Chewie is back) is helping out heroic new bloods’ Rey and Finn (played by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega)’ in an effort to groom them for combating the emergence of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a villainous representative from the Dark Side of the Force.  

Basically, ‘The Force Awakens’ is a grand and stirring homage to the prolific Science Fiction/space fantasy that dared to soar its ambitious wings while taking the old-fashioned concept of the good guys sparring with the bad guys and spinning a whimsical web of dark imperialism while searching for the intrinsic value of brotherhood. One cannot imagine the vitality of ‘Star Wars’ without the inclusion of notable and favorite characterizations that were instrumental in inviting a ravenous response to this filming phenom that has existed in your pop cultural lives for too many years to recount. In addition to joining top dogs in Ford’s Han Solo, Hamill’s Luke Skywalker, Fisher’s General Leia Organa (the former Princess Leia to all you old school ‘Star Wars’ enthusiasts out there) and Peter Mayhew’s Chewbacca, there is the welcomed presence of C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) as well. As for C3-PO’s newest sidekick BB-8, a mechanical rolling ball robot, he is the R2-D2 replacement that should easily win the heart of the kiddies looking for a cute contraption of a companion to treasure on the spot. It should be pointed out that ‘The Force Awakens’ is set 30 years from the last installment and thankfully this update has not lost a magical step since that time.

Anyhow, the First Order’s solar system mechanism needs to be destroyed and must be eradicated by the young talents in spunky and pretty Rey (think the athletic female version of Luke Skywalker) as she teams up with former stormtrooper Finn, a warrior with an uncharacteristic compassion for not killing any designated weak soul as instructed. Naturally, this duo (while under the tutelage of the mature and ragged-looking Han Solo) has their hands full as they clash with the nefarious General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson from ‘Brooklyn’) and his Special Forces protégé Kylo Ren that strikes an immediate comparison to ‘Star Wars’ most notorious bad boy in the deliciously ruthless Darth Vader.

Daisy Ridley's Rey and John Boyega's Finn are having a blast as the touted twosome out to save the day in J.J. Abram's celebrated STAR WARS reboot THE FORCE AWAKENS
Daisy Ridley’s Rey and John Boyega’s Finn are having a blast as the touted twosome out to save the day in J.J. Abram’s celebrated STAR WARS reboot THE FORCE AWAKENS
Thankfully, the majority of the audience may recall similar elements in ‘The Force Awakens’ that was touched upon in ‘Star Wars’ editions such as ‘A New Hope’ and ‘Return Of The Jedi’ where the same structure and theme of the plot points are somewhat revisited. As charming and stimulating as ‘The Force Awakens’ appears in its glorious presentation of being a beautifully shot and visually vibrant popcorn piece, the real find in Abrams’ spectacular space-aged spectacle is Ridley’s heroine Rey, whose emotional and physical commitment to this futuristic fable feels grounded in genuine suspense and praise. Ridley has legitimate game and carries this hot and heavy galactic actioner on her sturdy shoulders with the overwhelming pressure of headlining a cinema giant looking the re-enter the consciousness of rabid ‘Star Wars’ aficionados everywhere. Clearly, we are invested in Ridley’s Rey whose feistiness never undercuts her feminine convictions or courageousness. She runs circles around her male co-stars in fellow ‘Star Wars’ newbies Boyega/Finn and Driver/Kylo Ren and her sense of empowerment is what drives the authentic Force behind Abrams’ inherited ‘Star Wars’ workload.

‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ gleefully ignites the flashy flames of giddiness that we all associate with George Lucas’ indomitable big screen creation. The signature flourishes from composure John Williams’ commanding musical score to the stunning and innovative technical tweaking to the mixture of the old and new guard in front of the camera all make for an eventful and exciting return to the universal staging for a movie-making moment that will stand the test of time, the immense pop cultural movement at the movies known as ‘Star Wars’.

(c) Frank Ochieng 2015 || A very entertaining film filled with immensely fun nostalgic moments and lots of laughs, but this is movie is not perfect, no it is not. 

**Spoiler alert!!**

This movie is an exact copy of the 4th one and this frustrates me more than it should. Although new characters and mysteries were introduced, the plot was too similar to the 4th film, but hey, at least they blew up the republic so no more boring bureaucracy!
One more thing that bothered me a lot is Kylo ren, not the character, the actor. I mean they couldn't pick an uglier wimp? I mean no offense Adam Driver, but bad guys need to look badass, and once you took of your helmet, you lost all hope of becoming a badass.

**Summary:**

Definitely a movie worth watching despite minor setbacks. || Slumber Earthquake.

There really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con. 

The Force Awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come.

Yet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy?

This made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot.

The makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10"
271969.0,Ben-Hur,A falsely accused nobleman survives years of slavery to take vengeance on his best friend who betrayed him.,Brother against brother. Slave against empire.,"Action, History, Adventure, Drama",125.0,2016-08-17,en,5.751,1706.0,2.9722,"Jack Huston, Pilou Asbæk, Rodrigo Santoro, Morgan Freeman, Ayelet Zurer",Timur Bekmambetov,"based on novel or book, christianity, chariot race, ancient rome, remake, betrayal, 1st century, jesus christ, vengeance","Last time I watched the Ben-Hur with Charlton Heston the thought did not cross my mind that perhaps the world needed another version of the story directed by the guy who brought us Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and that weird movie where they make bullets bend.

Anyway, the Heston version is one of my favorite movies. I saw it when I was 8 and two times when I was about 20. I love it and quote it all the time.

But this is not a review of that version because (surprise!) it is not that version. This is a review of the 2016 version and I don't feel it is fair to give this movie a bad rating simply because it was an unnecessary remake. In case you are wondering, this is the sixth version of Ben-Hur.

The story follows Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince in Jerusalem at the time of Christ, and his adopted Roman brother Massala. They love each other but they get in the middle of an attempted assassination on a Roman leader and wind up on opposing sides. They both feel they are in the right, get in a very sticky situation, and thus begins an 5 year journey of survival, revenge, forgiveness.

I liked the movie. The chariot race was thrilling. I was worried about it because the trailer showed a scene which an obvious CGI horse running through the stands. To my delight that was the only part that really used a CGI horse (that I could tell, anyway). The rest of the race was intense even though I already knew how it was going to end.

The movie focuses very heavily on the relationship between Massala and Judah as well as Massala and the rest of the Hur family. Massala's intentions and actions were understandable and he wasn't just some evil man who betrayed his family.

The main actors and actresses do a good (not great) job. I felt Morgan Freeman may have phoned it in a little, but he delivered one of my favorite lines of the movie. My favorite actors were the slave drivers on the galley along with the drummer. They have small roles but I loved them.

I didn't care for the Jesus scenes though. He is a hard character to portray, and I just didn't like it when he spoke. I'm probably picky, but I would have preferred to hear him speak in King James English or not at all (like in the Heston version). I just felt something was off with the scenes and they could have been more powerful.

Overall, I felt it was a pretty good movie that succeeds in many aspects chiefly with the themes of revenge/forgiveness and delivers one exciting race. It's not perfect but a good movie overall. || **They've grown up together and later turned up to each other.**

I had seen the old film and I liked that. So remake means we expect nothing less than a visual spectacular and this film had them at its best, including many more great features, but the real stars are missing. It was a let down without any notable performances. Besides, the idea of upgrading the story was good, though not everyone going to like that. Particularly the one who loved the old film or the versions.

The length is justified. For the kind of story the film narrates, the pace was very good. So for me this is not a bad flick, but just some key features missing like I said the star value. For the first timers, like today's generation, this film might work, but for the others most probably not. And the end was disappointing, because it felt like watching a Disney film that made for children and families.

I think the director of 'Wanted' did his job as it required. Definitely not an unnecessary remake, but should have been careful in the historic events. Overall, it fell short of depth. You won't feel emotions and/or the character's struggle. In the end it became just an entertainment product and if you expect beyond that, you are only responsible for that. So good luck with the watch if you are yet to give it a try.

_5/10_ || **Booooooring**

As with most major productions, ""Ben-Hur (2016)"" gets an extra star for production value.

Bad camera, unlikable characters, ugly costumes, this film has it all.

Early on the two brothers are introduced, who will have their biblical vendetta throughout this movie. Clearly the adopted one is supposed to be the bad guy, while the viewer is encouraged to root for the Jew. But questionable decision making of the 'hero' paired with the comical anti-Semitism which permeates America is going to bring the audience over to the side of the scarred underdog, whose name is not in the title.

This movie would have been great, if it had ended with the arrest of the rich fool, who harbored a fanatic in his home and didn't even have the good sense to guard him, or the variety of weapons he kept in open display.

Unfortunately it goes on and on, and no doubt ""Ben-Hur"" will learn a thing or two about life, love and combat during the 2 hours ordeal. But will that count as character development, and will it sway your favor back to him when he finally mounts his cart and races his brother for the final time? I don't know, you watch this drivel, and you decide.

Good action and quite a decent story. Not all fresh, but well put together.

I think the biggest pity is the lack of talent of Fimmel. He learnt how to perform for Vikings and he lays another flat copy of the same character.

Positive points to the very good OST by Djawadi. || Even if you have never played ""Warcraft"" or ""World of Warcraft"" before,
I think you will like this movie. It has a great story, good acting &
is visually stunning. The special effects are not over the top, but are
very good & believable. Do yourself a favor & don't think of this a
another ""video game movie"", see it & you will love it & want another to
be made. I hope this turns this into a great franchise, there are too
many good stories in the ""Warcraft"" universe waiting to be told on the
big screen.  Some non WoW fans might have a hard time following the fast paced story, but watch it again if you missed it & you will understand it more. I think there could have been a bit more character development & the addition of a narration track might help non Warcraft fans understand a little better, I hope they will do a little better on the sequel. || **One fights for their new home and the others to defend theirs.**

I never played Warcraft game in my life, nor read comic book, but I enjoyed this new fantasy universe. Azeroth is the world where this story takes place. When the Orcs planet was destroyed, they use a magic portal to get to Azeroth and make a safe home. But that is where humans and other intelligent species live peacefully. A new race means a new conflict to solve the differences. So the battle commences at no time to gain the power to rule the land. Between the two great powers, who wins is the film to tell us in the rest of the parts.

It was something like 'Avatar' and 'The Lost of the Rings' coming together. Despite having alien race, it is very much an action- fantasy film, not a sci-fi. From the games to film, it was awesomely made which is obviously a latest trend in the filmmaking. The graphics were good, but not perfect, and that's fine, because it succeeds to give the game look than the realistic one. I think that's the point, otherwise no disgrace to call it was inspired by the games or comic book.

I know it is not a masterpiece like 'The Lord of the Rings', but there's a promise like the quality and story and its characters. There's no big names, but these actors who are known mostly for their supporting roles has given their best. Like I said I'm new to this Warcraft universe, so I don't know anything outside this film, but I'm kind of neutral on the war between the humans and orcs. Because one's world was destroyed and they're seeking a new home and the other ones are defending theirs. So everything makes sense from both the perspectives for their actions.

This is just a beginning, there's lot more sequels to come. Though, it's a pity that it failed in America, the native product, but internationally proved it is one of best of its kind, I mean games to screen adaptation. The director of 'Source Code' did a great job and all the actors, including those motion-capture artists. I missed Zoe Saldana in this, to be as another blue or green skinned alien specie, instead Paula Patton did well in a similar role. The character name also very similar to the one from 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. I know it's going to get even bigger in the follow-up, so I can't wait for it. Hope it will release in less than couple of years.

The actors perform well and you can identify them very well with their characters ... but it is all old and without imagination.

I suppose nobody was expecting anything else, though ... || This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.

The movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.

The movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another “standard” comic book villain a’ la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.

Having said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.

Overall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well."

But there's only ever been one that was truly any good. _Dead Men Tell No Tales_ does nothing to alter these assertions.

I would not begrudge anybody who enjoyed their time with this latest _Pirates_ movie, particularly anyone who saw it on the big screen, there's the zany action romps that the series has been famous for from the get go (and that started wearing thin on me after the second one) and some truly spectacular visuals including shiny rocks and zombie sharks (which I will refrain from making a joke about jumping). But where _Dead Men Tell No Tales_ fails harder than anywhere else is in its dialogue. Virtually every line is uncomfortable to hear delivered, and I can't see myself looking forward to the inevitable sixth instalment.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || If only we could recycle our waste as efficiently as Disney appear to be able to recycle this theme! Once again, we find ""Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) in a bit of bother from someone from his past. This time it is Javier Bardem (""Salazar"") who has escaped from his purgatory in the ""Devil's Triangle"" to avenge himself on his arch-enemy. Meantime, the young ""Henry Turner"" (Brenton Thwaites) seeks help to track down Poseidon's Trident which will empower him to take control of the seas, and to reunite with his father - the original ""Bootstrap"" (Orlando Bloom). There's no doubt that this is a great looking film, the effects are spectacular but the story is little better than a regurgitation of voyages gone by. The cuties that were Bloom and Kiera Knightley have been succeeded by the handsome, boyish Thwaites and his feisty astronomer pal ""Carina"" (Kaya Scodelario) but otherwise, it is another pretty formulaic prolongation of this colourful adventure franchise. It has some humour, there's a tiny cameo from Sir Paul McCartney that raises a smile (if only because you are never entirely sure if it is actually him); Geoffrey Rush still manages to inject oodles of charisma as ""Barbossa"", and Bardem offers a bit of menace - but Depp can only get away with that hail-fellow-well-met meets a drunk persona so often before he becomes a parody of his own characterisation. It's fun to watch, for a time, but after a while I was just bored. The format offers unlimited opportunity for fantasy and adventure, but maybe it is time for the ""Black Pearl"" to join the ""Queen Mary"" and HMY ""Britannia"" and just settle down as a respectable old lady of the sea - and a tourist attraction!"

Remember, all these described elements are not a bad thing when it comes to larger than life comic book/superhero fantasies. In fact, we almost insist that our volt-minded vehicles have some kinetic kick to its pulsating, pithy adventures. After all, there is certainly nothing wrong with that approach to the cinematic sensationalism of summertime popcorn pleasers and the costumed heroes that take us on that daring, rollicking ride of magical mayhem.

However, director Peyton Reed’s ‘Ant-Man’ symbolizes a different texture and tone to the familiar action-packed world of Marvel Comics’ outrageous universe both on the printed pages and in the dark movie theaters. It does not necessarily use the overwrought or ultra-stimulating tactics to sell its percolating product as a super-charged heroic fable of mighty manipulators out to save the planet in the tradition of frantic favorites such as ‘The Avengers’ film franchise for instance. Instead, ‘Ant-Man’ relies on its small and intimate take of quirkiness, introspection, a gentle doomsday message of despair and a measurement of an awkward man that wears his bugged-out wardrobe with a sense of curiosity and conviction. In essence, ‘Ant-Man’ is a costumed caper that is high-spirited in its low-key excitement…something quite refreshing and revered in the wild and wacky world of Marvel Comics’ representation of the super-studs and sasses that invade our cinematic sensibilities in the hazy days of summer.

‘Ant-Man’ lead Paul Rudd, an affable actor that has shown various levels of competence in both comedies and dramas over the years, is the unlikely source to don an ant-oriented attire and let his charm and cheekiness take over as the tiny bugged-eyed avenger of right and might. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former troubled lawbreaker and gifted engineer whose demons come back to haunt him when he gets involved in the burglary shenanigans with his bad news buddies (T.I. and Michael Pena). The reason for Lang’s lure back to crime: a cockeyed but convenient way to win over the affections of his estranged young daughter.

Interestingly, another great analytical mind of mechanics and science in stand-offish Hank Pym (Oscar-winner Michael Douglas) is spotlighted as he too struggles to relate to his daughter as well in the pretty Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Anyhow, Pym has a colorful backstory as it is revealed that he used to save the world from harm as the underrated crime-fighter Ant-Man. There was no glory or special recognition for Pym’s heroics as the buggy super-hero but his devotion to his crime-stopping craft was realized nevertheless.

As ANT-MAN Paul Rudd's Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminnal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed's modest costume caper.
As ANT-MAN Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang has plans to stop the criminal foolishness besides raiding a giant-sized picnic basket in Peyton Reed’s modest costume caper.
The conflicted father-daughter tandem of Pym and Hope eventually recruit the beleaguered Lang to climb into the exo-skeletal red-and-black suit and become the current Ant-Man to continue the mission of promoting goodness over evil. In this specific case, Lang’s Ant-Man is asked to foil the nefarious agenda of Pym’s former protege and associate Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) who threatens to expose the revolutionary shrinking technology to anyone sinister that offers him an insane and immediate price for such secretive scientific information that could jeopardize mankind in the long run. Of course, it goes without saying, that Cross has an ominous alter-ego in the vile Yellowjacket whose back-and-forth clashing with Lang’s Ant-Man leads to the calculating and corrosive chess game of one skillful insidious insect trying to outwit and outmaneuver a conscientious one.

Some may dismiss ‘Ant-Man’ as being too low-grade, cheesy and incidental in its confrontational canvas of saints versus sinners. Still, Reed’s handling of his Marvel-inspired ‘battle of the bugs’ is a winning formula in simplicity because it does not have to be rooted in a spectacular and showy landscape as the other successful bombastic blockbusters that come out of the frivolous factory of Hollywood. Essentially, ‘Ant-Man’ demonstrates the right kind of personality and prestige for its presentation as a scaled-down comic book actioner steeped in the personalized disillusionment of the characterizations and their assorted psyches. Sure, ‘Ant-Man’ will not let anyone forget its popular competitor in the much glorified and iconic standing of another insect-fighting Marvel mastermind in ‘Spider-Ma’n anytime soon. Yet Scott Lang’s Ant-Man is just as angst-ridden, impish, awkward and devoted as Peter Parker’s resilient web-headed wonder Spidey.   

The drama unfolds so convincingly in ‘Ant-Man’ not so much because of the dire dilemma of comicbook goodness and badness but because of the examination of deteriorating relations between broken men and their families or more specifically between fathers and daughters. Both Rudd and Douglas are committed to their roles as the Ant-Men that saved the world with ease past and present but could not say the same thing about rescuing the domestic responsibilities that eluded them under their own roofs. As Lang tries to find an opening for forgiveness toward his little girl and remarried ex-wife (Judy Greer), his current adviser Pym struggles to put the pieces together with a disgruntled Hope that blames her father for the neglect of her well-being as well as the death of her beloved late mother known as the Wasp, a super-heroine that shined in her own shadow of accomplishment.

‘Ant-Man’ is a soulfully weird, witty sliced-down spectacle of a comicbook film that is rare in its skin to deliver the message of a connection not just to stamping out the cartoonish crime and chaos that is routinely found in the playful playground of Marvel’s movie machine of high-powered personalities armed with skillful brute and brilliance. It also has something called heart and hope as it tackles the alienation and isolation of fathers and their vulnerable daughters. It will take more than a gigantic can of Raid to destroy the indomitable presence of ‘Ant-Man’ and what his hedonistic heroics, both physical and psychological, bring to the prized picnic table.

Given the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be. Unsurprisingly with a Marvel Super Hero film, the critical reactions have been mixed, but given it's not as gargantuan as most Marvel pics it proves to have a big entertaining heart. A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.

The effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity. Sure, some of it's just plain daft, our hero's powers are hardly blunderbuss stuff, while the family melodramas bubbling away feel tired, but come the glorious finale, pandering to the child in us all, it's another Marvel winner readying itself for further adventures of Ant-Man. 7.5/10"

The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.

The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion.  

The death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet after he collects the three needed artifacts that his plan requires.

In a race against time, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to battle to save the planet. Naturally they battle amongst themselves as well as their massing enemies but ultimately decide on a dangerous plan that can tip the odds in their favor and save the day.

The action in the film is good but it often plays out like a video game. With so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds, the movie looked like a video game. There were numerous scenes that looked like they were lifted from Injustice and Injustice 2 that I mused to myself that someone must have used their Power Up for the shot.

Affleck and Gadot are good and work well with one another, but there are some serious casting issues with the film. The biggest for me was Ezra Miller as The Flash. I did not like his effeminate, nerdy, socially awkward, and neurotic and at times cowardly take on the character. This is not the Barry Allen I grew up reading in comics or the one that has been portrayed twice in a much better fashion on television. His comic relief status grew old fast and his character really offered little to the film.

It has been well-documented that Joss Whedon not only handled the rewrites for the film but took over directing duties to complete the film. You can see elements of his humor scattered throughout and the film does move along at a steady pace without dragging.

The biggest issue is that so many of the characters are just stiff and one-dimensional. They really are not overly interesting so it is hard to really connect with them and the tasks they are facing. Unlike Marvel who have excelled with dysfunctional groups who fight amongst themselves as well as the forces of evil, this group seems to be going through the paces rather than being fully engaged with the task at hand and each other.

In the end “Justice League” is better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road.  As it is, it is flawed entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues.

3 stars out of 5 || An enjoyable superhero team movie. It's really being unfairly trashed by the critics. It's not up to the excellence of this summer's Wonder Woman film, but it's quite fun to watch. What made this film better than some of the other previous DCEU films is that it has a sense of humor. Previous films were rightfully criticized for being too dark and humorless. Gal Gadot is the stand out as Wonder Woman. This film did a better job in its portrayal with Superman. In Man of Steel, he battled Zod, which resulted in massive human casualties, without a care, which does not fit the character at all. That made me mad as a Superman fan. Here, he shows concern for innocent civilians, flying away with an entire building of people to make sure they would not be harmed in the battle against the villain. The one weak spot is the Big Bad, Steppenwolf. He's a rather fake looking CGI creation that lacks depth. But he's only the precursor to the REAL villain--Darkseid. The two end credit scenes are entertaining. The last one teasing the formation of the Legion of Doom/ Injustice League is particularly intriguing. || though thanks to bad reviews I wasn't sure about seeing this one but let me tell you my worries were put to rest very very soon this was one of the best times I have had at the movies this year the critics really missed the mark here I loved all the action and even the humor it was a good family movie as long as you have older kids due to the fact that the villans could be very frightening in spots and also this has a high level of action and it could overwhelm the youngest of kids but I still say get some snacks from the snack bar and be ready to have a super fun time at the movies with the entire family this thanksgiving weekend whether you go alone or take a group this is the movie to see"

I can't say I liked the previous films and not this one. In fact, I kind of enjoyed watching this reboot. It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.

Obviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.

I agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts.

6/10 || I just saw this and I wasn't expecting much as I have read some really negative reviews about it online and elsewhere. Honestly, I think they were wrong. It's not a bad film at all, just not as fast paced as the previous version which I quite liked too ... mind you, I am 60+ so maybe that has something to do with it. A scifi/action film for the older generation perhaps? I really enjoyed it. I gave it 4/5 stars here. || I was actually not having great hopes for this movie giving how Hollywood have screwed up with a lot of my favourite super heroes (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Dare Devil and a few others). Having said that maybe there was still a glimmer of hope given that some of their latest Marvel work have been rather okay. Unfortunately this is not the reboot of the Fantastic Four that I, and a dare say the fans, hoped for.

One thing that I do not understand is why the dumbass script writers that Hollywood employs always have to change the basic story of a set of characters that have a solid fan base? There was nothing wrong with the original story, and thus origin, of the Fantastic Four and the source of their powers. Maybe I am just old-fashioned but still.

The second gripe I have with this movie is the nonsensical stuff with members of the Fantastic Four, especially Ben, being deployed by the US military. It is just so cliché. Lazy script writing plain and simple. Unfortunately this also causes the movie to not really feel like it is a Fantastic Four movie. The team is split up and it is not until the very end that they actually become a team, gets a headquarter and so on. Big fail as far as I am concerned.

Having said all that, I do not think it is as bad as some people claim. There are some good stuff in there. The story is not all bad after all even though it is not exactly to my liking and the special effects are quite okay. One thing that annoys me with the story is that the role of Reed is really diminished and he is never really allowed to show of his powers. Yes, I know, there are some “stretching” moments but, well, meh! To add to the pain the actor cast as Reed is, in my mind, totally unconvincing.

The bad guy is also somewhat underwhelming and thoroughly predictable. As I said a classical Hollywood concoction aimed towards the less intelligent viewers. I do not understand why Hollywood seems to be so bent on repeating the same mistakes over and over again?

Well, as I wrote, the movie is not as bad as some people claim but it is far from great. Given the abysmal reviews I am afraid that we will not be getting a sequel which is a shame. This is one of the (few) Marvel comics that I read as a kid (in Sweden we did not get treated to that many of these kind of comics) so it is indeed a bit of a disappointment that they managed to screw this movie up…again."

With help from mutant allies Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), Deadpool uses his new skills to hunt down the man who nearly destroyed his life. || I actually enjoyed the movie so much that i'll recommend it to all my friends, at first i didn't really want to watch it because i'm not into super hero movies at all, but i did anyway, i mean people were talking so much about it i had to see it myself and what an awesome choice i made. The good thing about this movie is that Deadpool is a hero but in a very comedic way, you don't usually expect comedy from a superhero film but this one was full of comedy and the way they treated the plot was amazing, it was there, humor was there in every scene, even when there was fighting or romance or any other scene, the writers managed to add comedy everywhere in a very good way that'll surprisingly make you want to watch it again, and again. Thank you for taking the time read my review and if you're asking yourself if you should watch this movie, it's a definite Yes. || > So this guy in the red suit came and broke some records...

I was not a Deadpool fan and I'm still not, but like any superhero films I'd pleasure watching it. The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.

I am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X-Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spinoff 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.

This film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before. It works again, don't get me wrong, _Black Panther_ truly was an experience, both important and fantastic, but to say it re-invented the wheel here, is, to me, an outright lie.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || Overrated and overhyped. Definitely avoid. Watch on redbox if you must. || This is definitely one of Marvel's best because the story is compelling and the characters are well developed. Black Panther and his friends and family must defend themselves and their homeland of Wakanda from the clutches of Klau (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). Not only is the lead actor great as T'Challa/Black Panther, but the supporting cast does a fine job as well, especially the female actors. T'Challa is surrounded by smart, strong women. Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy. He sort of reminded me of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. Highly recommended if you enjoy comic book movies."

The highlight was the parings of characters from different stories and their interactions.

10/10 || Just a very short, NO SPOILERS review I wanted to get down while it's still fresh.

For a movie with this much riding it, to come out not feeling disappointed, is a **massive** achievement. While I absolutely do love it I had some things that I felt were maybe imperfect about _Infinity War_, but my biggest concern was that it seemed like it would be absolutely meaningless to somebody who didn't put in the effort of watching the 18 movies leading up to it. You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.

Personally? I can't wait to see it again. This is probably the most excited I've been about the second watch of an MCU film since the first _Avengers_.

_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || The Best CBM movie of 2017

The film is one of the most entertaining of the MCU films so far and a HUGE improvement over Thor: The Dark World. Cate Blanchett as the villainess Hela, the Goddess of Death, is a far better villain that TDW's lame Malekith. Kat Dennings' annoying Darcy and Natalie Portman's bland Jane are not missed at all. Instead, we get Tessa Thompson's badass Valkyrie, who can hold her own in a fight and isn't just there just as a love interest for Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Jeff Goldblum is hilarious as Grandmaster, who runs the gladiator fights on the planet Sakaar. But the real pleasure of the movie is watching the love-hate brother relationship between Thor and his adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The relationship between the two men was the only redeeming feature of TDW, and it's great to see it expanded in this movie. Also great is seeing Thor buddy up with Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fate of The Warriors Three. They deserved better than that. But otherwise, it's a great comic book movie. || From minute one, Thor Ragnarok bursts onto the screen with a new found energy, style, Jeff Goldblum, beautiful use of colours and shot compositions, an amazing 80s inspired music score, and comedy that's actually funny. Somehow, Thor Ragnarok is both the darkest film in the entire MCU given that it deals with the destruction of an entire world, and the most lighthearted.

Thor Ragnarok is very much a Taika Waititi film that uses Marvel lore and characters. It has many shocking twists, turns, witty comedy, and pleasant re-introductions (and introductions) to some of the MCU's best characters that I can't wait to see more of. Oh, and did I mention this movie has Jeff Goldblum?!"

Overall, an average movie. Has lost some of the freshness of the original. || _Logan_, 2017's first Marvel offering, was a movie I loved because of just how little it relied on its comic book origins, completely forgoing the superhero tropes and going in its own unique and totally enthralling direction.

_Guardians 2_ however, is a movie I loved because of just how intensely it embraced its comic book origins. The Kirby-isms shine through brilliantly and every couple of minutes I found myself grinning like an idiot at some new reference or stylistic choice.

_Logan_ might be the super hero movie for people who don't like super hero movies. _Guardians 2_ is the super hero movie for people who have steeped themselves deeply in the lore of super heroes. But I absolutely adore them both for the same reason: How they made me **feel**.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, directed by James Gunn, is an action-packed Marvel comedy. The guardians unravel the mysteries of Star-lord aka Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) broken history while avoiding constant danger. Oh. And did I mention the soundtrack? Muy bueno! 8)

Unlike most sequels, Vol. 2 might actually be better than Vol. 1.

The entire cast is more likable than the first film. Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) has more comedic lines like, ""When you're ugly and someone loves you, it means they love you for who you are.""

Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) still maintains a sentimental but adorably tough persona. And Baby Groot is cute as ever whenever he says,""I am groot."" In his baby-voice.

One of the more noticeable differences is the relationship between Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Star-lord. It's not as intimate. We were all hoping for a sci-fi sex scene. We don't get it!

The fight scenes are nothing less than spectacular. There's a scene with Yondu (Michael Rooker) where he's using a whistle-controlled weapon to kill an entire space crew of villains ALL IN SLOW-MOTION!

Just go watch the film. It's worth it for the cgi-artwork alone."

Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.

Co-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.

So what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.

Leading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.

For Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.

On top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).

The Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.

The movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.

Yeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along so stay tuned.

http://www.hweird1reviews.com/allreviews/captain-america-civil-war-review || **The heroes're divided and so the fans!**

Before watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.

I think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?

I don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.

Films such as Captain America: Winter Solider, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man all consisted of elements that we have never seen within a superhero film before. Now, Marvel Studios attempts to push the envelop once more by leaving the world of high tech armors and super soldiers and entering the mystical world of magic. Leading this charge is Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Stephen Strange and hopefully he could answer why there is this strange mystical feeling that we have seen this all before.



> From Marvel comes “Doctor Strange,” the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place—a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange—armed with newly acquired magical powers—is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence.

I am going to start off the review by discussing the only strong positive thing that came out of Doctor Strange and its by far the visuals. Beautiful vibrant colors pop at you throughout the film, the costume design is beyond extravagant and the framing is spot on. Doctor Strange and his fellow Sorcerers Supremes powers aren't fully on display until they enter the Mirror Dimension and my god, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner would hate this place. As they are men of science, they would hate that all rules of physics are thrown out the window as our Sorcerers Supremes are capable of breaking buildings apart and reforming to however they please. It is hard to not reference Inception but no one here is dreaming, these visuals are being created by the hand of mystical men and they use it to their power.

In all honestly, pushing the envelope when it comes to visuals was not a difficult task at all. Heck, if they didn't I would have been extremely disappointed as it was an obvious opportunity to take advantage of since we are dealing with magic. I am still extremely disappointed regardless as director Scott Derrickson completely missed another obvious opportunity to push the envelope this time in regards of character development.

Doctor Stephen Strange is very much like a Tony Stark and other superheroes we have seen in films before as he is arrogant, egoistical and full of it. After Strange's accident in which he suffered extreme nerve damage to both hands, he dishes out every penny to his name to repair his hands in hopes he could continue his career as neurosurgeon. Every attempt fails and Strange becomes desperate enough to head to Nepal and finds himself under the guidance of Tilda Swinton's The Ancient One. Learning a whole new concept in the mystic arts forces Strange to reshape his way of thinking but Scott Derrickson does not let this have Strange reshape who he is as a person as well.

Doctor Strange should have found himself being more like a Steve Rogers towards the end of the film as learning the mystic arts and his accident alone should have broken his ego. But instead everything still comes easy to him as he masters magic with ease with very little tension. He has a couple hiccups in the beginning but once The Ancient One puts him under her wing it is smooth sailing and Strange is stealing texts, wielding powerful weapons and defeating Supremes with decades of training with ease.

You cannot say that Strange was destined for the mystic arts and that is why everything came so easy for him. Strange is only learning the mystic arts due to circumstance. If he doesn't get into an accident, which happened to him due to being careless, he doesn't find himself in Nepal. Harry Potter was destined for magic, not Strange. Strange fails to grow as a character because he continues to be proven right and no consequences seem to happen due to his actions.

It is hard to get into the character development of our supporting characters Benedict Wong's Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo as I would utterly spoil the film for you. All I would say though is that they were both mishandled and deserved better developments. It is a shame too because Wong and Ejiofor are superb actors but wasting talent is something Marvel Studios is used to.

When will Marvel Studios get a villain right?  With Mads Mikkelsen playing our lead villain, Kaecilius, I thought we might finally get a cinematic Marvel villain that is on par to Killgrave and Kingpin over at Marvel's television department. Ultimately, Kaecilius and Doctor Strange end up fighting due to the most silliest cliche: being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The two individuals meet at the New York Sanctum Sanctorum in which Strange accidentally gets blown in to. Kaecilius is there to kill the protector and Sanctum Sanctorum itself and has no knowledge of who Strange is. In fact, he honestly believes Strange's name is in fact ""Mister Doctor."" Still learning his craft, Strange is capable of putting up a better fight than the protector who should be a matter. I mean, he is a protector after all. There are no stakes for Strange, strange.

Visually appealing could only get you so far as Doctor Strange fails to focus on the development of their characters that they made so appealing to the eye. Doctor Strange will become a huge asset to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and lets hope we see the rest of Strange's development when he casts his next spell. There is so much untapped potential in Strange's character, we just haven't seen the best of him yet. || All continues to be well in the Marvel Comics Universe as the film adaptation of another mischievous and majestic superhero from Stan Lee’s printed page empire emerges and reigns supreme on the big screen. The latest cure from the Marvel movie bag of explosive tricks is the entry of the dazzling and decorative **Doctor Strange**. Armed with a collection of notable performers, a convincing colorful scope of visual vibrancy and a hearty touch of spiritual and reflective potency the spellbinding **Doctor Strange** is an engaging and oddly sophisticated action-oriented comic book fantasy adding imaginative flavor to the typical escapist gem from the Marvel stable of powered personalities.

Some may argue that **Doctor Strange** is merely another conveyor belt cinematic comics confection that follows a safe and similar makeup that constitutes the obligatory Marvel Comics movie foundation–excitable weirdness, overly splashes of wayward whimsy, copious characterizations attached to their brand of eccentric grandeur and larger-than-life gestures of dark and devious exploits grounded in the basic landscape of good versus evil. Listen, sometimes traveling down the conventional path of constructed and adventurous Marvel-made spectacles is not necessarily a bad thing to consider. After all, the well-known and more popular superhero icons such as _Spider-Man_, _The Incredible Hulk_, _Iron Man_, _The Avengers_, and _The X-Men_ for instance seem to benefit nicely from the anticipated formula that routinely delivers the entertaining goods for its avid core of fanboys. So why not wipe off the seemingly obscure and underrated **Doctor Strange** and provide the same kind of popcorn-pulsating mystique for blockbuster cinema?

**Doctor Strange** started out as a comic book creation in 1963 by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee. Director Scott Derrickson (“Paradise Lost”, “The Exorcism of Emily Rose”, “Sinister”, “Deliver Us From Evil”) does an admirable job in giving shades of bizarre brilliance and magical manipulation to an unconventional Marvel comic book character hardly known for his capacity to translate his mystical mastery to celluloid with compelling curiosity. Derrickson, known primarily for his creative juices in the realm of horror fantasies, confidently serves up the off-kilter and hypnotic appeal of Dr. Stephen Strange as embodied by accomplished English actor Benedict Cumberbatch (“Black Mass”, “The Imitation Game”, “12 Years a Slave”). Interestingly, Derrickson and his handful of screenwriters craft **Doctor Strange** with a mind-blowing measurement of restraint and inquisitiveness. Indeed, **Doctor Strange** echoes its contemporary Marvel-established movies with predictable pluckiness to a certain extent but what is appreciated more is the uniqueness of the film’s ability to emphasize a cerebral superhero that is cut out of a different kind of creative cloth which feels quite distinctive from other brooding Marvel mavericks. Cumberbatch–mastering a rather effective American-accented sorcerer with skill–has injected a degree of inventive nobility and refinement that uplifts this calculating comic-book fantasy.

Cumberbatch’s egotistical Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon. His hands are truly miraculous tools of his medical trade and he takes pride in his abilities to treat the critical patients that have tremendous hope courtesy of his therapeutic capabilities. In a nutshell, Strange outshines his other surgical competitors because he is able to give to his patients on the operating table something other doctors cannot instantly muster up. However, cruel fate strikes its ugly head when Strange suffers the usage of his precious hands as a result of a horrific car wreck. The nerves in his hands are destroyed and the non-functioning of his limbs is an awful reminder that his surgical talents are something of the immediate past.

As Strange delves into self-pity and surfacing depression he cannot see just how supportive his fellow physician Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdam) is toward him. Clearly, Christine is in love with the alienating medical moper but Strange simply does not realize the extent of her affections because he is too busy sulking about his misfortune. The only factor that gets a promising rise out of Strange is his recent acknowledgement of the Tibetan community where there is a Kamar-Taj temple rumored to restore ailing body parts destined to make an individual “whole” and “complete” once again. Naturally, Strange wants to bypass the tedious and lengthy therapy sessions for a chance to experience the miracle of his once-amazing operating digits now ravaged by severe nerve damage.

The main source behind the Kamar-Taj temple’s heralded existence is The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton). She is instrumental in teaching the fundamentals of a selected Eastern mysticism that teaches the special concentration of healing the wounded and wasting human body when scientific medical practices fail to do so. Soon, Strange’s affiliation with The Ancient One and her mystical minions has more than a transfixing effect on gaining control of his ailing hands as he gains indescribable powers through the inner strength of mind and soul. Now, Dr. Strange can generate his own alternating state of philosophical wizardry that dictates shaping time and space dimensions. Strange’s out-of-body experiences supersede all his previous physical impairments as a force to be reckoned with at large. Whether observing Strange’s Cloak of Levitation methods or witnessing his supernatural prowess on the mean streets against wickedness Doctor Strange spins a wild and weird web of action-packed surrealism that is a welcomed addition to Marvel Comics’ showcasing of super-heroic protective cads feisty in flaws and frivolity.

Cumberbatch is mesmerizing as the self-absorbed genius Strange who perhaps is the best complex Marvel-related protagonist since Robert Downey Jr.’s flippant Tony Stark/Iron Man. The combination of heightened arrogance and high-brow self-doubt and vulnerability tactically works as Cumberbatch sells this portrayal solidly. Although Swinton’s The Ancient One is an intriguing enigma in her own right one must question why the absence of an Asian actor not considered for this particular role may have some scratching their heads in indignation? McAdam’s love interest Christine amounts to only being an afterthought not just in the eyes of her object of affection Strange but to the audience as well.

Thankfully, the other supporting players contribute marvelously to the festivities. Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor (Cumberbatch’s co-star from the Academy Award-winning “12 Years a Slave”) plays fellow sorcerer Mordo while Benedict Wong assumes the duty as another one of The Ancient One’s followers who guards the school’s sacred scriptures. Mads Mikkelsen is devilishly received as Kaecilius, the former disciple of The Ancient One gone rogue whose agenda in releasing an ominous demon Dormammu to the world will test the will of Doc Strange’s newfound mystical techniques and tactics.

No doubt that **Doctor Strange** is an impeccably surging superhero fable laced with stunning aesthetics and a richly robust score by Michael Giachinno. The high caliber of talent associated with this spry comic book actioner definitely ensures another superhero film franchise-in-the-making as Cumberbatch’s introspective doc administers his **Strange** dosage of Marvel movie-making medicine for the ages.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016 || Though the core events may not be anything new for the MCU, particularly in so far as its origin stories go (Stephen Strange's A-to-B is virtually identical to Tony Stark's in the first _Iron Man_ film) the psychedelic filter through which we experience these events is entirely fresh!

Not all of the humour lands, and in fact sometimes actually detracts from the story. While the effects are very impressive from a conceptual angle, the graphical end-products do sometimes fall short. Benedict Cumberbatch is a fantastic actor, and does a fine job as Doctor Strange, virtually the whole cast are proven actors, but none are really given the chance to flex those acting muscles to any sort of a newly impressive degree.

Those minor nitpicks aside, _Doctor Strange_ is another very successful entry to the MCU, just further proving that Marvel really know what they're doing in this latest form the film industry has taken.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._"

Read my full review here.

http://www.hweird1reviews.com/allreviews/x-men-apocalypse-review || Though far from the worst _X-Men_ film, _Apocalypse_ was still a disappointment, because until this entry, every Bryan Singer _X-Men_ film had been excellent. _Apocalypse_ is a far cry from terrible, but it is underwhelming given Singer's history, as well as in and of itself.

Certain actors, who shall remain Jennifer Lawrence, were completely checked out in this instalment. The CGI was often so bad it was confronting, even in the climax of the film. Apocalypse's plan was plot-hole-y and underdeveloped, and not all of the new characters hit it out of the park.

There was still a lot to like here though. Some of the newer costumes were neat, and a lot of the side-plots had me very intrigued. Fassbender and McAvoy are excellent as always. It's certainly not a failure amongst the likes of, for example, _X-Men: The Last Stand_. Which was a good callout in _Apocalypse_. Another thing I enjoyed.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || **Another ancient power was awoken and blah blah blah.**

I have seen almost all the superhero films of the recent time, but this is the franchise I never liked. I'm sorry to say that, but that's the truth. The 'X-Men' series never made me sense, particularly to say it from the Marvel comics is a disappointment. When it comes to 'Wolverine', my opinion is different, because I loved those films. Hugh Jackman as Logan is the only 'X-Men' I love, so like usual this is another waste of time from its series to me.

I even enjoyed the recently rebooted 'Fantastic Four', but not this one. There's nothing new in the story, it's the same plot stolen from the different films. Like an ancient force is awoken who tries to rule the world by destroying everything created so far by the humans. So the mutants join hands to bring him down and we know what happens at the end. Apart from the vfx, this is very boring film and 150 minutes runtime was another lengthy joke that you never laugh.

Not just me, many people, even 'X-Men' fans showed displeasure over this film. That means, Bryan Singer's stint with the franchise is pretty much over. So they will going to bring a new one and that's another disappointment, because I don't know how long they're going to drag this series. End it already. Anyway, like I said I never was or will be this universe fan, so I don't care much, rather I just give them a try when they get released and obviously I'm to end in regret watching. Instead, I'm looking forward to the final 'Wolverine' film with Hugh Jackman.

Might be this is what I was expecting from Aniston from a long ago. Since break-up with Brad Pitt, probably after 'Marley & Me', she has not given any best performance. This is her best shot to till date, maybe in her whole career. She would have not won, but her snub from the Oscar nominee was not justified. Unlike men, who gets better by aging, women are the opposite. In the old days I used to like Aniston, but nowadays, I don't know. In this film she has done without makeup, well, that's an honest attempt.

Not a spellbinding narration, but it was all about Aniston's performance. There are a couple of cameo appearances, well, all the other character in the movie is like a cameo, including Sam Worthington's, but excluding our heroine. Worth watching this only for her performance, not for the story.

The past events should have been explained to let us know the truth along with the portrayal of the present. But it was kind of realism, I won't doubt about that, but sometime cinematic needs a proper detail rather than straightforward. Really a good movie, simultaneously not great as to praise the direction or the presentation that slightly missed the opportunity to be an awesome flick.

To make this film, he sought out a little-known character from a series of novels by Kyril Bonfiglioli, an author who will only be known by the English or by those who speak English as a native language. I have never found this author's books in Portugal. The film was a huge financial and critical failure, and I was afraid of what I was going to find, but the truth is that I find it mildly satisfactory.

The film begins by introducing us, in the voice of the protagonist, to the central characters of the plot: the art dealer Charlie Mortdecai, an aristocratic bon vivant, his beautiful wife and his faithful henchman Jock, tough and excessively virile. From here, we follow the protagonist on an adventure in search of a missing painting that could be a work by Francisco de Goya, with a past associated with the Nazis and believed as lost.

This comedy makes a huge effort to be as funny as possible and bets everything on a kind of comedy of exaggerations, in which each character is caricatured and everything is taken to the point of absurdity: Mortdcai, for example, is not just a “marchant d'art”, he's an insolvent aristocrat with tics of grandeur and a fetish for his mustache (okay, I wore a mustache myself, and it was a similar style, but I never let the mustache used me, if you know what I mean). Likewise, Jock is transformed into a mobster and sexual athlete. Exaggeration pays off: it is impossible not to laugh at the absurdity. The most obvious example is the way in which Mortdecai insults the US when he treats it as if it were still an uncivilized British colony.

The problem with exaggeration is that it doesn't work if it's overused: the second half is much weaker because we already know what to expect from the characters. I'm even willing to forgive that; harder to forgive is how the script ends up lost in its own twists and turns. Am I the only one who feels that the story is so confusing that even the characters don't know what they need to do? I also can't forgive the amount of sexual jokes. The film had a very restrictive parental rating in the US, but the overwhelming majority of other countries, including Portugal, made the big mistake of giving it a much lower rating, making the film available to a teenage audience. It's not the fault of the producers, it's the authorities of each country, but I wonder if our teenagers, who are starting their sex life earlier and with less awareness, need more sex-promoting stuff. We are no longer in the domain of hedonism, this is perversion.

Despite having a string of hits and a solid career, Johnny Depp is not in top form. Having made this film after two other failures, the actor was going through a bad professional phase, which was associated with a controversial marriage (and a divorce, litigious and mediatic, years later). I don't know to what extent his personal life influenced his work, what I can say is that Depp is a shadow of himself. The jokes, the humour, the comic gestures that he masters so well… everything comes out so forced that it's not funny. Paul Bettany, Depp's personal friend and another actor with established credits, is much more effective in the role of Jock. It wasn't the first time that the actor played a tough character, and it seems to me that he has a knack for this type of material. It's nice to see Gwyneth Paltrow here: despite the cold and forced chemistry with Depp, I think the characters asked for it and Paltrow knew how to give her character an additional elegance and charm. Ewan McGregor is welcome support but has little to do.

Technically, the film has many qualities, and it is obvious that it had a budget worthy of the cast it had. The cinematography is very good, with excellent colors, lighting and sharpness, and it makes deft and intelligent use of effects and CGI. I particularly liked the effect with the planes and the names of the cities, used whenever the characters had to travel. The filming locations were well chosen and the props and costumes (in particular Depp's and Paltrow's) were very well designed... although I need to consider that the Mortdecai costumes, with excessive use of silks, velvets and strong colors, exude a certain ""nouveau riche aroma"" that a legitimate blood aristocrat would not fail to condemn. The soundtrack also does its job flawlessly."

The script is just ... stupid and the dialogues even worse. The characters are not believable. I mean, when you watch Twilight, you just swallow the whole thing because it is fantasy and ... OK, it is just a stupid vampires story but, this is just toooooooo bad.

I've not read the book but I suspect the fail is not just in the movie but that it is adapting something that is already bad from the beginning.

The worst is that I kind of liked Dornan in his role in Fallen but this movie has made me realize what a short range of performing resources he has. Dakota Johnson is not too bad, though. The acting is OK, it is just that you hate such an stupid character.

One more to my very narrow list of movies in which I have seriously thought stop watching by the middle of it. I wasted the second hour too, though. || My fiance is a big fan of the movies...and I only mention that because she is worse than me when it comes to sniffing out mainstream erotica. So, you know, totally hit her radar.

On my end, I brought the book at LAX one night to read on a layover, and I stopped when Grey picked up his phone to call for a helicopter and started using trucker jargon. ""Breaker, breaker, two-nine..."" NO! Not reading any more!

I honestly didn't even want to watch the movie after encountering that.

However, let's be honest, you aren't sitting down to watch the film because of dialogue or plot.

You're watching it because of sex. And, out of all the movies, this one actually delivers the most on it. AND, unlike all the sequels, it doesn't claim to be about anything else. It advertises itself as a movie about kinky sex and it delivers as being a movie about kinky sex.

So ten stars. It is exactly what it claims to be and delivers on that. || Now I never read the book, and the DVD of this has been sitting in a box for years until recently when, discovering it did actually get both an Oscar and a Grammy nomination, I thought I would give it a go. It's all about ""Anastasia"" (Dakota Johnson) who goes to interview hunky gazillionaire ""Christian"" (Jamie Dornan) in his plush office. A bit of flirting ensues as he makes it quite clear that he is interested - but boy, is she in for a surprise when she discovers that all belts and braces does actually having another meaning (as does butt-plug!). What now follows is, I felt, a really tame exercise in soft porn that is about as sexy as putting out the wheelie bin. Dornan is very easy on the eye, but otherwise we are all subjected to a dull, ploddingly produced series of poorly lit scenes that drag on interminably. There's no point evaluating the acting nor the script, they don't matter. This is just a poor attempt to entertain or shock or both that does neither, remotely. Titillatingly tantalising? Nah - just dull. Nice helicopter but the song didn't win either award."

Yet, another movie about an intelligent high school teen girl who socially unfit among others. After realising her issue, she fights back to regain what she was missing. This type of concept is extremely common, but initiating a fresh idea on where the narration can develop the plots and finishes off high note is the vital for a movie's success. This film had one of that and that is called the DUFF. You can find out what that stands for in its official posters.

The movie was above the average. The characters were great, but not the unique ones. Everything was enjoyable, I mean it was not a usual annoying teen movie. Well directed because he got a good screenplay that extracted from the book of the same name. The cast was good, nice performances and so it is official that Bella Thorne classified for those mean girl roles.

Anyway the main character Bianca was so good. Whitman was too old for the role, but outclassed it. Carefully handled to get under the PG13, and it succeeds. So kids with the matured minds are pretty much allowed to watch it and I don't see any serious offensive to keep them away other than facts the film talks about. Overall a nice watch for sure.

6.5/10 || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Being that Dr. Jeong is the reason I finally watched this, I feel he was under utilized, but I was surprised to see Taylor Lautner and Bella Thorne delightfully playing jerks.

Mae Whitman is an excellent actor and not necessarily known for being a ""looker"", but I never would have thought of her as a DUFF either, but I guess the concept is all relative.  The movie does spend a lot of time making fun of her for being ""unattractive"" though.

To be fair, there is a LOT of fun with her being awkward, which isn't the same thing as unattractive.

This movie has the same sort of feel to it that ""Juno"", ""Superbad"", and ""Easy A"" have to them, all good high school social dramedies.

While some of the movie feels like sketch writing for ""how to lie your way to victory"", it doesn't disappoint."

After all, the possibilities are endless in terms of how filmmakers could explore the surreal dynamics of different dimensions thus allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief and engage in the wonderment of SF exuberance. So the question remains: can first-time director Dan Israelite instill some fresh distinction into the ubiquitous genre with the teen-oriented time travel vehicle ‘Project Almanac’? Well, let’s just say that superior spectacles such as ‘Looper’ and this year’s engaging ‘Predestination’ have nothing to worry about in terms of giving way to Israelite’s featherweight found footage fantasy. In fact, ‘Bill And Ted’s Excellent Adventure’ looks appetizing and inspired in comparison.  Relentlessly sketchy and as exhilarating as a PBS-televised high school science project during summer vacation, ‘Project Almanac’ fails to bounce sufficiently with its erratic presentation of cockeyed camerawork and crew of stock character whiz kids along for the surreal joyride.

Israelite and screenwriters Jason Harry Pagan and Andrew Deutschman concoct a breezy kiddie escapist flick where the scientific impishness feels somewhat upbeat and the young cast seem to be engaged in the time-traveling adventure that giddily plays out. However, whatever spry momentum that ‘Project Almanac’ manages to achieve is undermined by the distracting shaky hand-held camera movements and choppy jump cuts that turn this sci-fi caper into a disjointed B-movie bubble. Furthermore, the inclusive found footage material is overblown and exhausting. The gimmick, when used sparingly, was a treasured touch to heighten the anticipated tension. But ‘Project Almanac’ is not the only guilty party to spoil the essence of such a ‘trick of the trade’. The reality is that contemporary cinema–especially in horror and sci-fi–resort to these technical tactics to the point of no return.

It is no surprise that the arbitrary jittery cosmetics behind ‘Project Almanac’ is under the producing credit of Michael Bay whose reputation for exorbitant twitchy filmmaking has been documented in previous pulsating actioners.  Brilliant high school science mastermind David Raskin (Jonny Weston) has ambitions for attending prestigious MIT and needs the appropriate experimental project to be conducted in his attic for acceptance to his choice of prestigious schooling. The finances are tight and David is chasing after a scholarship that should ease the economic burden on his widowed mother (David’s scientific father had recently died).

So David is a chip off the old block like his late father. Daddy Dearest, however, did provide some incentive for his son to to realise his MIT dreams. David had discovered an unfinished experiment of his dad’s – a mysterious machine that has the capability of relocating individuals through time. This discovery is in the company of his ‘herd of nerd’ friends plus his younger sister Christina (Ginny Gardner) along to record the curious contraption that will eventually take them all on a back-and-forth odyssey where they can pop into time traveling moments that range from dealing with school bullies to being placed in front of chemistry class testing sheets.

Interestingly, ‘Project Almanac’ never seizes the opportunity to think big in its time-traveling exploration. Instead, the movie mopes around with trivial tidbits such as petty scholarly set-ups and never really delves into grand confrontational entanglements that one would expect young impressionable brainiacs to face while awkwardly placing them in sensitive settings that all the book learning in the classroom cannot solve. The concept of this so-called time machine that David found in the basement by the skilled hands of his deceased old man should have predictably brought both father and son briefly together immediately in the name of their beloved interest in science, an irony nearly overlooked that could have been both poignant and profound. The nonsense of the kids cheating through invading the lottery result and retaking tests is a mere slap-on-the-hand cautionary tale that comes off somewhat corny and predictable.

Sadly,  ‘Project Almanac’ morphs into teen soap opera territory and sinks the minimal sci-fi flavoring it had for a nonsensical diversion punctuated by the aforementioned shoddy camera fluctuation and lack of time-traveling zest beyond small-time incidental dilemmas. Weston’s David Raskin had the potential to be the second coming of ‘Back To The Future’s Marty McFly but the lame plot and punchless exploits handcuffs him from answering the call.

Critic’s rating: ** stars (out of four stars) || Project Almanac is a film based on time travel. A bunch of students find a device which allows them to make jumps to the past. While the film starts off well, the second half of the movie has way to many plot-holes leaving the viewers with too many questions. The cast is young and is good for the film but nothing out of the world. It's worth a one time watch if you aren't one who complains about timeline consistencies. || I have always been drawn to stories of time travel. The best book I have read was Time and Again, by Jack Finney. I am sorry they never made a movie out of it, probably because it was more subtle with less action than other sci-fi stories for most of the book. But there are plenty of time travel movies out there, like this one.

The fact that teenagers are using the device to travel in time, plus the fact that - at first - they can't travel back more than a few weeks, obviously was put in place to limit their ability to travel whenever they want. So instead of trying to prevent a horrific world event, for instance, they are jumping back in time to tweak their own lives and mistakes. If you have watched many time travel movies, it isn't a spoiler for me to say things don't go exactly as planned.

There are a few clever plot twists here, and I mostly liked the chemistry between the lead characters. The dialogue became a bit wooden here and there, but overall the writing wasn't bad. I have to say my biggest gripe was with the hand-held camera routine. I almost wonder if they used it just to honor another movie with the word ""Project"" in the title, if you are wondering 'witch' movie I am referring to. But whatever the reason, it didn't really work for me.Their reasons for always lugging the camera around, even when there was just one character, fell flat for me. For the loss in camera work quality, there wasn't enough of a gain in plot or character interaction. But it didn't cause me to give up on it, just to wish it lived up to its potential. I am not going to comment on the ending and risk giving anything away, except to say that it felt a bit anti-climactic to me."

A very fascinating movie. Depicted as a real life drama that is totally different from the other Oscars nominees for this year. Based on the novel of the same name, that tells the story of a young Irish woman, Eilis, in the 1950s who travels to the United States, Brooklyn, looking for a better future. Thousands of kilometers across the Pacific ocean, she finds a new job, new friends, a whole new life, but what she misses is her home and family. So how she makes out of those difficulties, and finds a way to go forward is the rest.

About an ordinary woman's life struggle that lives very close to average of us. That's why I loved this film more than other drama films nominated for this Oscar. The first two acts were amazing, the third was a bit off and cliche, but that's how the story rediscovered by getting back at the conclusion. I think this is Saoirse Ronan's full matured character as an adult woman. She was my favourite child actress and seen all her films. So felt strange to see her like this, because that's not how I remember her, but it only gets better after she does more character like this.

She was very good, in fact, she should get the Oscar for the role. In my prediction, Brie Larson for 'Room' and Ronan are the top contenders, but if Cate Blanchett wins that'll be a great disappointment. I'm also expecting adapted screenplay awards. The cinematography was fantastic, those 50s New York City really brought back on the screen. It is a must watch, especially if you're a middle aged guy, because you're well experienced about personal and social life already, and this movie only a reminder.

9/10 || Brooklyn (2015)
A Beautiful and Moving Film - A Love Story.
26 August 2016 - 2 out of 2 users found this review helpful.
A beautiful and moving film. A love story that draws you in, and is told so well that you care about the characters almost immediately. The photography and the close-ups are really beautiful, and the camera loves Saoirse Ronan. She leaves Ireland and she is off to America, (Brooklyn). Her trip to America is shot so economically, yet powerfully, you could feel what it must have been like on that Ocean Liner. Homesick and missing her widowed Mum and Sister she makes a home for herself in Brooklyn. But will she stay in Brooklyn? The cast is amazing, Julie Waters, Jessica Pare, and Jim Broadbent, to mention a few. The wardrobe was authentic, and the soft warm colors seemed to give this film a dreamlike feeling. But In the end it was all about Saoirse, she carried this film, there was never a false moment. When she was homesick, you knew it, you could feel it. I love ""BROOKLYN""."

This is an unexpected biographical drama. I don't know who are those two guys, I mean not the actors, but the real life characters. I never read their books or heard their names, though the film sounded great, so I decided to watch it. The entire film was an interview between a newly famed writer and a journalist who dreaming to become like him one day. So basically the young journalist desperately makes himself an opportunity to meet the writer and they take a road trip, discussing various topics.

It's hard to say who was best, both Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Segel were excellent. I think it was the best casting, they will be the reason if you want to watch it, not the story. Yep, the story was simple, just talking life, present and future of humankind, other celebrities and finally differences between them. That's the part I loved. I mean famed people or genius, whoever they're, they are just like us when it comes to interacting with others. They argue too, it's not like the worst thing to happen, but a normal thing as a human being. Just like animals locking their horns over land or females and sometimes for a no reason.

It was directed by 'The Spectacular Now' filmmaker, based on the bestselling memoir by David Lipsky, the character that played by Jesse Eisenberg. It takes place in the late 90s, but present in the film as a recall after a certain event. If you like 'Before Sunrise' kind of films, you will enjoy it, but if you hate slow pace narration, then you should better skip than giving a bad review and rating badly to wreck it up.

309299.0,Experimenter,"Yale University, 1961. Stanley Milgram designs a psychology experiment that still resonates to this day, in which people think they’re delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger strapped into a chair in another room. Despite his pleads for mercy, the majority of subjects don’t stop the experiment, administering what they think is a near-fatal electric shock, simply because they’ve been told to do so. With Nazi Adolf Eichmann’s trial airing in living rooms across America, Milgram strikes a nerve in popular culture and the scientific community with his exploration into people’s tendency to comply with authority. Celebrated in some circles, he is also accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster, but his wife Sasha stands by him through it all.",Illusion sets the stage.

A movie about the experiments on the human behaviour and for us, there's nothing in it but to study those characters along. This is more a documentary than the cheerful characters and the story with a twist. So forget it if you are looking for an entertainment film.

Based on the true story of an American social psychologist Stanley Milgram. The film narrates the story of his controversial experiments and personal life that takes us back to the 60s. Not all the discoveries were accepted in its first revelation. Sometimes it takes time to realise its benefits like perhaps this one.

The film was boring because it was a drama about an important turning point in the human psychology. So all the major parts of the story were just talking and it never required physical stretch from its characters like running and chasing around. If you're interested in psychology and its related stuffs, then you might like it.

Besides, the romance was a small part of what the film was focused on as its title mentioned. It does not mean I dislike it for not enjoying. In fact, I would have rated it better only if it was a documentary film. But still I'm happy with the product. Overall a decent film with the decent performances.

Only paying attention to itself and putting all the world in accordance to its needs.

The script is brilliant and the cast is well chosen and performs well. However, this story around this character and around the starting of adulthood and chasing of dreams is not really appealing to me. Somehow boring ... || > A sudden sparkling change in a moody life.

The second collaboration between the director and Greta Gerwig. I just love their works, together they write awesome story and create a cinematic magic. Kind of rare filmmakers, only a very few from the past to compare these two to them. It was another quirky comedy, especially if you liked 'Frances Ha' you would like this as well. I hope they would come for the third time to complete 'An Untalented Girl from NYC' trilogy.

It was not as good as the previous film, but nothing short of awesome entertainment. I am surprised a few of those who liked that movie did not favour it. I knew it would be a chick comedy, accordingly, I was not expecting beyond that. But like all the time when I decide to watch a movie, I wanted it to be a better entertainer than the one I saw in the earlier. That's what everyone do, it was like the sea tides, the rise and fall is inevitable. Some would like it and some won't, but to me it was a very good.

Unlike 'Frances Ha', here there are two lead characters, both are young adult women, but the entire narration was from one person's perspective. That is, a college freshman Tracy. How her life follows, especially after meeting a girl who's soon-to-be her step-sister. As in a new place and socially inept, she finds her way to be joyous and adventurous, meets some new people and makes them friends. But how long this unplanned pleasure remains with her and what are all changes makes to her rest of the life is the remaining movie.

> ""I am so impressed by you and so worried for you at the same time.""

It was a simple and soft narration, but engaging characters and well paced with a chain of fine comedies. Apart from writing and direction, the supporting cast was the best feature. It was a tiny twist at the end, but extremely essential to break the steady sequence to bring a diversion. Since that part, I have been wondering about the conclusion, but the makeover was really excellent, I think it was touching yet as I expected.

This is Lola Kirke's major role I've seen. She was fantastic and I hope to see her in more films in the lead. It was one of the best on-screen chemistry between her and Greta. There were many beautiful lines spoken between these two, very memorable and quotable ones. With all these top quality, if one still don't like, then he must be bored of watching plenty of similar themes. But that should not be a reason to trash it, because that is his personal issue to deal who's dumping on this one is totally unfair.

This movie was unique, fun, touching, heartbreaking, likeable characters, filled with cheerful moments and overall one of the best recent films I have seen. It was more like a friendship movie on trust and commitment. The portrayal was at its best, an example of how a life can turn around in a matter of time. But how much more trustworthy is this sudden change and the best uses of it was the movie that told very nicely. I won't say it is a must see, but personally I feel that way.

Before there was _Lady Bird_, there was _Mistress America_. And despite the fact that _Mistress America_ is not a solo project from Great Gerwig, her artistic footprint is evident in every facet of this movie. Co-written with Noah Baumbach (and directed by Baumbach), Mistress America is about Tracy Fishko (Lola Kirke), an incoming college freshman at Barnard College in New York City. The usual freshman loneliness sets in quickly, and Tracy’s mother encourages her to call her soon-to-be-step-sister, Brooke Cardinas (Greta Gerwig)."

It's a funny title for a serious film. I have heard the film was loosely based on a real scandal. This is the story of a federal prosecutor whose life has been decent until he becomes addicted to the escort service. As his wife is pushing him for entering the politics, on the other side, he's unable to come out of his new habit. The time comes when both these things can't go together, he has to pick the side and that brings the end to the tale.

Really an interesting story aspect, but slightly I was not happy with how it was presented on the screen. Though the characters were excellent and the perfect executions by its actors. Patrick Wilson was good, even in a small screenspace Lena Headey excelled. The other characters influenced quite strongly in the film. Like their intentions over the film events which played a major twist in the storytelling. The people can go any length to achieve the bigger thing is the one of the main messages of the film.

The theme was strong, but there were some weaker spots in the narrations. Although, an acceptable and enjoyable film. The end was totally unexpected, but unbelievably not that smart from the character's perspective. Surely an average film, but definitely not a bad or an awesome film. Its about the scandal of a high profile figure or at least trying to be, though everything were told from a single angle. So I hope you watch it and give an honest opinion than going against it from even before the start just because everybody already doing that.

_6/10_ || Zipper stars Patrick Wilson as rising state prosecutor Sam Ellis. He seems to be happily married to a loving wife, Jeannie (Lena Headey) who comes from a powerful family and he is being groomed to climb the greasy political ladder.

However Sam is addicted to internet porn and soon develops a habit in using a high class exclusive escort agency. This sex addiction leads to danger as the escort agency is under investigation from the police, his wife is suspicious and a journalist Coaker (Ray Winsone) is sniffing around for a story and threatens to expose him.

Wilson has developed a nice sideline in playing sleazy characters who might have gone too far. The trouble is this film does not go anywhere. Sam's wife knows Coaker and what makes him tick, it really is a case of the rich and powerful can keep the secrets hidden in the closet but the question is can Sam keep his zipper up? The film leaves this uncertain."

I am very impressed for the recent films of Robert Redford, but the timing was really bad. His one man show, 'All is Lost' that overlapped with the popular flick 'Life of Pi', and now this with 'Tracks' and 'Wild'. People tend to choose the big one and forget the small one, or simply point the finger to the other one for having similarity. Anyway, I wanted to see it, and I did that.

Like the Pacific Crest Trail from the movie 'Wild' which's from the western part of the Unites States, this one is from the east called Appalachian Trail and both these are the biographical films. The six month trail to cover approximately 2,000 kilometers. Even learning the odds are not in their favour, the two old men embark their journey with the fixed mind to achieve the goal.

I did not know it was a screen adaptation of the real event. I won't consider it a great movie, not even for the year 2015, but it was fun to watch. A sweet little movie that I expected something, but it delivered another thing, overall it satisfied me. Maybe the reason I'm showing concern for this is it is a comedy, so looked lot like an entertainment product than the inspiring theme. But you can't deny the seriousness apart from those fun bits that it was based on someone's memoir. Especially knowing those two men are in the twilight of their lives, the attempt was admirable.

> ""No, writers don't retire. We either drink ourselves
> to death or blow our brains out.""

I always love the children and elder people movies with quality narration. Children's films are fun to watch and elder's teaches us their experiences, sometimes sympathy wins for their struggles. There were a couple big female star characters who are the part of the story, but not in the main narration. This film centres only two characters that wonderfully played by the 80 year-old Robert Redford as a 60 year-old Bill Bryson and the other one was Nick Nolte as Katz who actually stole the show. Yep, I must agree Nick Nolte is the backbone of the movie, otherwise the people would have turned away without showing any interest in this including myself.

This film was not all about the hiking or achieving something out of all the sudden in their old age. It let's us a few glimpses of the beautiful landscapes like those we saw in the 17th, 18th century paintings. Despite it being a comedy, mostly it dealt with the facts. Rediscovering the lost friendship and uncovering the old memories. Like the entire life was brought back for a few minutes in the words for us with their sweet recalls.

It is an R rated flick, because the majority of the jokes were adult's. If you decide to watch it, I suggest to give a try with your best friend, because you both might be seeing the future of yourselves. My finishing statement is, it is definitely not a must see, but it won't disappoint either if you're not anticipating in a large scale adventure, that includes emotions and severeness. If it was from before the 90s, probably considered as a good film, but in this modern CGI world, movies about life and self-discovery is fading away from the young people's mind. All they want is superheroes, loud music, fancy costumes, and of course violence.

7/10 || **_Too old to rock 'n' roll, but not to hike the Appalachian Trail_**

Robert Redford stars as an over-the-hill writer who decides to hike the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail. After his wife (Emma Thompson) insists he get a partner, the only one who's up for the task is an old overweight friend with a drinking problem (Nick Nolte). Kristen Schaal and Mary Steenburgen have peripheral roles.

""A Walk in the Woods"" (2015) is a consistently amusing drama/adventure starring two seasoned veterans and it delivers the goods as low-key entertainment spiced with worthy mindfood on aging. Some people complain that Redford and Nolte were too old for the parts (they were 78 and 73 during shooting) in light of the real Bill Bryson and Katz being in their 40s in the satirical 1998 biography, but the movie wouldn't have been made without them and, besides, they're effective in the roles and drive home the point of out-of-shape, mature wannabe hikers.

It's vastly superior to Emilio Estevez' similar ""The Way"" from five years earlier.

The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot along the Appalachian Trail in North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as Sharon, Connecticut.

The problem is the script and the directing. You don't get to understand where the movie is leading to or why and how are the troubles of Michael Finkel.

The actual happenings give a good chance of telling an interesting story but this movie fails to do so. || **About a man who has nothing to lose and a man who can't afford another failure!**

It was based on the book of the same name, which was originally inspired by the real events. But there's a striking resemblance between this and the Truman Capote story. About a man who is serving in prison for slaying a family and his encounter with a reporter/writer. And so their relationship strengthens as they sit together to discuss about each others life event. That is the main film, which covers the majority of the film, but feels like they revealed nothing much, particularly for our convince, yet the story moved forward.

For the Truman Capote, there are two films, including the one I liked 'Infamous' and the other one is 'Capote'. Besides these two, there's another title called 'In Cold Blood' that reveals the other side of the event, before Truman enters the scene. So that's what I'm interested after watching this film. Because right now they preferred to portray a struggling writer and the crime parts were not given any importance. That means it is basically about a reporter/writer doing a story/book.

If they decide to make that one with the same cast as a prequel, then James Franco gets into an action which probably would give a good reason behind such crime where in this film the viewers can't end watching surely what really happened. Both, Jonah Hill and James Franco was really impressive in this. Felicity Jones had the small presence, but was in a main role. It was a feature film debut for the director and he was well managed to make it decently. Overall, for me, it was a good film, not the best, but can be watched once.

The movie does a great job of leading the audience (alongside the main character couple) into this strange new world, not of debauchery, but love and connection.

Do you remember the Kubrick's film 'A Clockwork Orange', well, I'm not saying it is the same or similar film or storyline, but it reminded how it affects those people who are involved in a similar kind experiment. This is not too violent like that film, but it has its share where some might feel uncomfortable. Except in the opening and some other parts, the entire film takes place in a single location, most likely a studio setting. That part was well done, including the screenplay and direction. One of the rare films, about the rare subject, in some way it is a must see, but seems not suitable for everyone.

It is a nice concept, but it was based on the real. It all begins when a university professor decides to conduct an experiment in the summer holiday where some students came forward to be the part of it. It is a two week long project, so the first day goes off well and then the real problem begins when a small incident leads to a series of others in the following days. How the remaining days goes and what were the results of the experiment is disclosed in the later parts.

There are many edgy events; I thought it might get ugly at some point of the narration, but stayed real and ended with a good intention. It is a collection of good performances, everyone did their parts well. Particularly those student cast. Not many of them are famous, but the film provided quite an equal share of screenspace. It is not just an entertaining film, a character study as well. First of all, it is not a usual story, so if you decide to watch it, expect accordingly. I think it is a good film to give a try for once.

_7/10_ || Another very worthwhile production of a chilling real life experiment.

The Stanford Prison Experiment makes for compelling reading/viewing, whichever format you choose to partake in, it's science gone bonkers and has the power to chill the blood. Did we need another film version? Especially since Das Experiment (2001) is an outstanding film and clearly the one that is recommended as a first port of call on the subject? 

As it is this Kyle Patrick Alvarez directed version is special as well, managing to get under the skin whilst being vivid in detail. Not just for 1971 period accuracy (clothes/social traits et al), but across the board characterisations as it's well written and performed. 

Not recommended for those who may be down on the human race, or for those obviously after a good time. But good film making is worth time investment - as is eye opening of the human condition. 7/10 || I don't think they quite nailed what they were going for with this film, but I can't deny it does make for fairly uncomfortable viewing - which is the intention, I guess.

<em>'The Stanford Prison Experiment'</em> has a very localised and low-budget feel to it, things that arguably actually enhance the vibe of the production. The acting is up-and-down, while the run time is too long.

Billy Crudup is very good as Dr. Philip Zimbardo, while those who portray the team around him are also solid. It's when you get to the 'inmates' that the acting gets weaker, none of them are bad but they aren't on the same level as Crudup & Co. - despite some familiar faces, including a few from <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> world. Michael Angarano as ""John Wayne"", however, deserves praise.

It took me a little while to connect to the story, it gets a tad iffy when it's setting everything up though soon finds proper ground in the middle act before ending kinda slowly; this didn't need to be 122 minutes.

Would I recommend this? Yes. It's worth a watch. Perhaps could've been greater though."

Practically the entire movie takes place at nighttime in the big city and I like the reverent tone. Jane is great as the city cop and Willis is his reliable self in a role he could do in his sleep.  Childers comes across as a low rent meshing of Malin Akerman and Alicia Silverstone, but in her mid-20s. She’s a’right, but it would’ve been better with someone of the caliber of Scarlett Johannson or Silverstone when she was younger.

What turned me off is the eye-rolling way the security guards at the resort couldn’t hit the side of a barn; meanwhile the cop rarely misses. Sure, this is done in a lot in movies, but there’s a way to do it that looks relatively realistic and doesn’t insult the intelligence of the viewer. Not so here.

“Vice” thankfully shoots for some depth amidst its action thrills. For instance, there’s the question of robotic self-awareness, which was explored with Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Then there’s the debate over media violence & sex, whether in movies or video games. Does it provide an outlet for people to purge their debased desires or does it encourage that behavior in the real world? Lastly, there’s a halfhearted commentary on religious fundamentalism and spirituality.

While lackluster in some ways (due to its low-budget), I liked the reverent tone and the profundities amid the thrills, not to mention Jane’s entertaining performance. It’s marginally better than “Westworld” (1973), which, let’s face it, wasn’t exactly a masterpiece. 

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes and was shot in Mobile, Alabama, and Miami, Florida.

Epic the way Ben-Hur was epic. It’s filmed on rare Ultra Panavision 70. The film crew altered Modern cameras to work with UP70. Quentin Tarantino knew there were two types of film viewers. Those who would see his film as he intended and those who would not. Tarantino isn’t an idiot and knows people will pirate his and watch it on devices he can’t control [Note 1]. To combat this Tarantino made a version of the film which requires viewing in a theatre. He did this with the 70mm roadshow production of The Hateful Eight.

The roadshow production of The Hateful Eight is a great experience. I was born in 1981, after roadshow theatrical releases fell out of popularity so I’ve never experience a roadshow theatrical release. Roadshow theatrical releases were (or are) a limited engagement showing of a movie before general release. The Hateful Eight’s roadshow includes a beautifully produced souvenir program — already available on Ebay. The lights go out fifteen minutes prior to the film starting and no previews are shown. Roadshows aren’t their to advertise. Their purpose is to wow you with The Hateful Eight in 70mm.

I was only eleven when Reservoir Dogs was released and thirteen when Pulp Fiction was released. Arguably, a little too young to watch these films. Although I knew what sex was and how it worked, My young mind didn’t know about paraphilia or unusual sexual interests. I don’t think I even had a working idea of how homosexual sex worked. This would have made watching scenes from Pulp Fiction rather difficult for me at that age. [Note 2]
Unlike many, I saw Reservoir Dogs before Pulp Fiction. Although I like the editing style of Pulp Fiction, I think Reservoir Dogs is a better film. What makes Reservoir Dogs great is the lack of financing. Financial constraints didn’t limit Tarantino and Reservoir Dogs is dialogue heavy with very impactful scenes revolving around a single location: The Warehouse.

The high-level idea of The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino’s Eighth film, which implies the title is deliberate, is about a bounty hunter escorting a prisoner (the only female in the film) to “hang by the neck until they are dead” in Red Rock. However, a blizzard prevents the prisoner from reaching the final location and the prisoner along with eight others are stuck in a single room: Minnie’s Haberdashery.

The Hateful Eight is filmmaking at it’s finest. Like Reservoir Dogs it could have been a theatrical production. It didn’t have to be a movie. If there are special effects they aren’t noticeable. There is violence and blood, which you expect, but comparing to other Quentin Tarantino’s films it’s tame. There is no dancing to a radio tune while Michael Madsen conducts a horrific act. But, the strongest story-telling scene will stick with you. A flashback overlaid with a monologue performed by Samuel L. Jackson that demonstrates the artistic ability of Tarantino. The editing between Major Warren’s narrative and what General Smithers envisions can only be told with film. The scene contrasts the alluring story with the distasteful act. A compliment to the editor who doesn’t pull you out of the monologue, but enhances it.
I’ve only seen, read, or heard a few interviews with Tarantino, but I don’t get the impression he does anything on accident. Tarantino puts too much thought into his ideas and works. When Bret Easton Ellis interviewed Tarantino he stated:

> My scripts are meant to be read.
> [The Bride] has stashed all this shit in the ground. So, she is going to dig a hole and pull up a footlocker and it will have passports, money, and weapons. All the things she will need for her revenge. But, the way I have it written in the script is she needs to find a rock and turn it over to find an ‘X’ on the rock. She turns over the rock and finds the ‘X’.
> 
> If the ‘X’ hadn’t have been there or if she couldn’t have found rock, she would have taken it as a sign that her revenge never should happen and she would have dropped the whole idea.

These are things you can’t show on film.

You get this same type of feeling when watching The Hateful Eight. It is hard to imagine that Tarantino didn’t have a few one-on-one days with each actor explaining to their character’s fully-developed backstory which isn’t depicted in the film. Only additional viewings will explain each characters motives.

Many of my college friends who enjoyed Kill Bill Volume One didn’t like Kill Bill Volume Two even though Kill Bill Volume Two is the stronger of the two films. The reason? The dialogue. The dialogue is the best part of The Hateful Eight. Although The Hateful Eight is three hours long you don’t feel it. The film engrosses you with the characters, their conversations, and the conflict between them. The acting is superb.

My wife said that this is her favorite Quentin Tarantino film. I don’t know if I disagree and although Reservoir Dogs holds a special place with me, The Hateful Eight is a much more mature film. Tarantino has had 23 years to perfect his craft and it shows. Although I liked Django Unchained, it isn’t as good as The Hateful Eight.

The Hateful Eight may be one of the better films I’ve seen in the past few years.

_Note 1: Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves is a piece of art as much as a novel. But, there isn’t a digital version. This is deliberate. Danielewski can’t determine a way for readers to digitally consume the book. Contrary to what you expect, this control is more easily achieved with print than film._

_Note 2: Like all Quentin Tarantino’s movies, The Hateful Eight isn’t for children. Quentin Tarantino is great because of his dedication to his art. Tarantino made a purposeful choice to not have a relationship or children because it would affect his art. I wonder if his decision is partially due to discussions around the dinner table about what Daddy does without showing them. I don’t know if Tarantino has actually thought about the ramifications of raising a child in the dark to his art until a certain age. Maybe he hasn’t. But, If I was in his shoes, I would have internal conflict about not wanting to twist my kid’s minds until they were of age to deal with my creations. But, I am probably projecting._ || The hateful eight is well directed, good photography and has a great OST, with a good melody from Ennio Morricone (although it is just that, not much more) and, as usual, well selected songs by Tarantino.

The best of the movie is its cast, with the exception of Michael Madsen which I think is terrible but Tarantino seems to love. As usual, good performance by Samuel L. Jackson and superb ones by Kurt Russel and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Tim Roth makes a great role in a character that seems as if it was made for Chistoph Waltz, though. IMHO, the best performance is from Walton Goggins, though. A usual secondary which has the chance in this movie to be more than just that.

All in all, a Tarantino movie with what you would expect from one of his movies.

But ... the problem is precisely that there is everything to be expected, but nothing else. The typical long and witty dialogues. The typical stories and anecdotes distracting the viewer attention from the important happenings ongoing, but just that. Hence, this movie stays half way to be a really good movie and it remains just a enjoyable movie, without much more expectations. || > ...And then there were none.

I'm neither Tarantino nor Nolan's fan, but love watching their movies. As usual these director's films are highly expected by all, that's including me. This one started off quite like a normal western, so I thought it wouldn't be like the director's previous film 'Django Unchained'. In fact, it was considered for a sequel to that, but the director felt this story and the previous character Django failed to blend, hence 'The Hateful Eight' was born with Samuel L. Jackson playing an important role.

Solid eight from me for this QT's eighth film. But I felt the movie was kind of inspired by 'And Then There Were None'. It was not about to find who's the killer or next to be killed. The character introductions were at its best and an excellent twist in the middle. This sets in a cabin with eight strangers struck there after the snowstorm. But after an unexpected event the suspicious started to mount and brings chaos. Then takes us to the flashback to reveal something the story that did not mention in the earlier part which's very essential for coming back to the finale.

The 80% of the movie was just talking, but the remaining stunt sequences were so powerful. All the eight, plus, supporting character were exceptional, but the director's favourite Samuel L. Jackson nailed it as his character is a bit above from the rest. The entire film was shot is a couple of locations, but the major portion takes place in a cabin and it was a limited cast movie. These days, western movies are shrinking, only a very-very few good movies are made every year. In the time of superheroes, a movie like this is really very precious, so definitely recommend it.

A Statham action flick with a small amount of action and a patchwork plot that makes for a mediocre romp through Vegas with an unsatisfying ending. I mistook the various plot holes throughout the film for possible exciting clues to the main character’s backstory or foreshadowed twists, but it was neither - just bad writing. I did enjoy the action in the few moments it appeared, the Vegas at Christmas setting, and the typical Statham swagger and charm. But the random nudity, pointless gambling scenes, and the unnecessary side character that illogically provides resolution to the film all reduce the awesome standard Statham action film to a haphazard mess.

I don't know why it is underrated, probably that's a mistake. Because this is not your usual teen movie, but a different perspective tale and told in a quite exciting way. It was from the director of 'Robot & Frank', it is only his second film and he's now in my watch-out filmmakers list. Both the films were different genre and topic, and I totally loved them. This film was adapted from the book of the same name who wrote 'The Fault in Our Stars'. The film talks about a childhood crush and how long does it takes one to get courage to open his heart.

Q short for Quentin, when he first time saw the girl named Margo, he has instantly fallen in love with her. But having differences over how to enjoy the life, they had drifted away. Until when the actual story begins in the final year of their high school. So Q finds some clues when Margo disappeared like usual, but this time he considers it seriously and goes after her to reveal his love. What follows is a road adventure and a mini twist in the tale.

Great cast, but I think it is the Nat Wolff's best performance as the lead. The supporting roles were not here to just support, but participated beyond the usual. Cara Delevingne was not bad either, but her part was like in and out frequently. So overall it had best set of characters with uniqueness from one another. Which means don't expect a silly teen comedy, it was awesomely designed to impact all generations. So the entertainment is guaranteed.

It is not just a romance between two, that is what I was surprised. The narration points out a one love story, but in the end you would end up watching a multiple romances. Something very refreshing and all the lines were very matured, which kind of feels like the real world stuff. I really liked the conclusion, proves why one should watch it. Whatever the others say, I definitely recommend it. A sweeter and a heartwarming teen film.

In any movie if you see a sidekick rule, that has to be the Kevin Hart. He can handle the whole movie by himself and this film is a great example. It totally surprised me, I expected it to be an average film, but it was an awesome comedy. We have seen plenty of bride and groom and marriage related comedies, but this was a slightly different yet a fantastic treat.

I don't think it was wonderful because of the jokes alone, but unique characters and actors who performed them were brought the fine outcome. I felt like I know what's coming, but the ending was simple and smart. Like always when I like a movie a lot I hope for a sequel to come and they should make one for this as well.

It's a Kevin Hart's time as a comedian, his top box office films are all from the recent time, so he must make use of it and I am expecting his upcoming projects. This is a perfect weekend movie to have some laughs. Middle finger to the film critics. I definitely recommended it not only for the film fanatics but all. Who knows you might find it much better than the recent 'Get Hard'.

However, the still radiant and curvaceous ‘JLo’ found some time to gravitate back to the big screen and revisit the overplayed ‘woman in peril’ genre with her latest generic psychological thriller in director Rob Cohen’s (‘The Fast And The Furious’) ‘The Boy Next Door’. Needlessly rehashed, rudimentary and titillating in tepidness, ‘The Boy Next Door’ is nothing more than a thin serving of the arbitrary ‘damsel-in-distress’ chick flicks that pop up and serve as throwaway conveyor belt melodramas. ‘The Boy Next Door’ will inevitably beg for obvious comparisons to ready-made Lifetime cable movies. Well, there are a decent amount of Lifetime movies that can actually give the limping ‘The Boy Next Door’ a run for its creative money.

In essence, Lopez is no stranger to these types of ‘harried heroines’ on the defense so she is quite comfortable in rollicking in the paper-thin premise of ‘The Boy Next Door’. In forgettable 2001’s ‘Angel Eyes’ and 2002’s ‘Enough’ we witness Lopez’s on-screen dilemma as the creepy men in her life are ominously drawn to her aura causing the heightened jeopardy at large. The case in ‘Boy’ is similar except that the delusional young man in question is as dreamy as he is deranged for the endangered cougar. Hey, he may be crazed but he is still cute, right ladies?

The reality is that we have seen this formula countless times before as ‘The Boy Next Door’ offers nothing fresh or feisty to the table. The teaspoon-sized tension is laughable. The run-of-the-mill steamy scenes are not even trashy enough to digest with notable suspense. Undoubtedly, ‘The Boy Next Door’ recklessly borrows from every psycho-thriller imaginable and still ends up looking bland and boorish. With all the loving-to-stalking fare out there past and present (ie ‘Fatal Attraction’, ‘The Crush’, ‘Fear’, ‘Swimfan’, ‘Disclosure’, ‘Obsessed’, etc.) the inclusion of ‘The Boy Next Door’ only clogs up the cinematic pipe in reference to this overdone genre.

Under Cohen’s pedestrian direction and screenwriter Barbara Curry’s spotty script ‘Boy’ tells the tale of an attractive middle-aged high school teacher named Claire Peterson (Lopez) whose bout with disillusionment will result in her tawdry affair with a neighboring handsome younger man in 19 year-old Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman from the ‘Step It Up’ movies). Before Claire falls into the arms of her youthful studmuffin she is riddled with conflict. For starters, her unfaithful husband Garrett (John Corbett, ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding’) was banished from the house for his constant infidelities. Also, Claire’s sickly teen son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is experiencing growing pains. At this point, Claire needs a positive boost in her existence as she trudges along both in the classroom and at home, where her personal life seems to be in utter shambles.

When the hunkish Noah arrives on the scene to assist his ailing uncle across the street from the Petersons, he makes a lasting impression on the older Claire. Noah is helpful to Claire and becomes sort of the manly mentor that her son Kevin needs to capture his adolescent confidence. Of course, Noah’s backstory is quite suspicious (such as his parents’ so-called mysterious death) but the oozing charm and good company that the older teen offers the stressed Claire is too convenient to pass up. Noah is just too good to be true and Claire has found a young man worthy of entertaining both her and Kevin.

The yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher's preferred pet to Lopez's lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR
The yummy Guzman certainly is the teacher’s preferred pet to Lopez’s lonely educator in the generic psycho-stalker thriller THE BOY NEXT DOOR
In the aftermath of a horrible date arranged by her close friend and school vice principal Vicky Lansing (Kristin Chenoweth), Claire lets down her guard and succumbs to her sexual urge for Noah in a hasty moment of passion. Realizing that perhaps her bedtime dalliance with Noah was a mistaken indiscretion Claire informs Noah that they can no longer go on and act upon their carnal connection. This does not sit well with Noah at all. Soon, Claire will experience the psychotic wrath of her scorned young admirer whose smothering need to be with her becomes hauntingly overwhelming. The stakes are dangerously higher when the forgiven Garrett re-enters the picture in an effort to win back Claire’s broken heart.

Overall, the low-budgeted ‘The Boy Next Door’ simply fills in the cheesy blanks with its amateurish jitters. Lopez’s angst-ridden Claire has all the frightened chops of a ransom hayride during a busy livestock convention. The lackluster acting by leads Lopez and Guzman are not impish or impulsive enough to care one way or the other. Corbett’s cheating hubby Garrett feels like a mere footnote in the flaccid proceedings. Chenoweth’s Vicky is offered as a minor sidekick to Lopez’s Claire and annoyingly buzzes around just to bridge the planted thrills.

With the baseless ‘Boy’ added to her film credits it appears that Jenny was never on the block.

Recently I saw a couple of other films starring Anne Kendrick,  I was not very impressed with them and so I got the same result for this one as well. I don't like musicals, especially not the modern ones, well, mostly. This is a short story that comes around 30 minutes, but with those nonsense songs, it became a feature film. Seems a few people liked it, I think they had a reason, but to me it was very boring.

There was no any decent performances, all I saw was the film characters singing facing in one direction. Maybe they were looking at the lyrics board. I suggest don't go for it seeking a normal romance-comedy. If you like the musical, you might enjoy it, other than that, I don't see this would satisfy any average guy. So no offense for those who liked it, but this is totally a skippable film the year.

Undeniably luscious and wonderfully bizarre, Crimson Peak is a psycho-sexual thriller that resonates with the enticing visual senses and registers with the proper amount of off-kilter seduction and twisted charm. For filmmaker del Toro his unconventional narratives have always been peppered in exquisite bounciness regardless of their hit-or-miss effectiveness. In joining past del Toro genre-ridden offerings that range from the revered cult-like stimulation of Pan’s Labyrinth to the misplaced but eye-popping stiffs such as Blade II and Pacific Rim it is safe to declare Crimson Peak as another elegant and gaudy candy-coated canvas of del Toro’s imaginative cinematic vision.

Aesthetically stunning and armed with a sophisticated lining of suspense, Crimson Peak does not necessarily exude any real momentum of toxic scares or memorable chills. Still, it manages to rely on its Gothic-induced romanticism that is enough to accept this splashy and offbeat vehicle on the merits of its unique brand of animated style. Sure, there are displayed predictable paths to tap into Crimson Peak’s erratic pulse and maybe del Toro and fellow co-screenwriter Matthew Robbins could have injected some more convincing bits of subversive edginess to spice up its modest creepiness. Nevertheless, one can appreciate the borrowed Hitchcockian overtones combined with the arresting set designs and peculiar ensemble. This alone invites Crimson Peak as a colorful costume drama layered in concentrated showiness.

Thankfully, the October release of Crimson Peak should echo the spooky spirit of Halloween appropriately and offer some seasonal sizzle for the macabre-embracing moviegoers. The story may not be startling to the point of an innovative revelation but the winning element–at least one of them anyway–is the exceptional art direction and production design that suitably defines del Toro’s mystifying universe of nostalgic ghostly aberrations. Crimson Peak will not be confused with high-minded horror anytime soon but it does effectively promote its lush, Gothic-induced romantic vibes.

Budding American novelist Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska, “Alice in Wonderland”) has one specific belief system to hang her literary hat on and the sentiment is self-explanatory: “Ghosts are real!”. This haunting message has plagued Edith since she was a young girl growing up in Buffalo, New York in the early 1900’s. Edith was an only child of privilege and an apple in the eye of her widowed wealthy father in businessman Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Naturally the protective parental instincts kick in as Cushing is weary of an opportunist that might wanting to court his eligible daughter Edith.

Enter the seemingly shifty and broke British aristocrat Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Sharpe has an agenda and it is quite clear. Apparently Sharpe wants to shop around a potential profit-making mining device and needs financial support and promotion from an influential American contact. Coincidentally, Sharpe starts a relationship with promising writer Edith whose Daddy Dearest happens to be a prominent industrialist. How convenient, huh? The skepticism about Sir Thomas Sharpe starts to mount for the concerned Carter Cushing as he stands by and regrettably witnesses his precious offspring Edith’s affection for the cunning character.

Of course Sharpe is not the only target that moneybags Cushing needs to worry about as the loving companion to his treasured Edith. Sharpe’s older sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain, “The Martian”) accompanies her sibling on his mission to do whatever he has planned for his personal gain. So now Cushing has double trouble with the mysterious brother-sister Sharpe tandem as they are embedded in the indelible psyche of the artistic Edith. However, the Sharpes have spun their web as they now have turned Edith into a member of their family as both wife and sister-in-law. Thus, a fresh existence begins for Edith Cushing Sharpe on the other side of the pond in Northern England where the Sharpes’ Cumberland-based estate Allerdale Hall is located.

Realistically, the less-than-stellar Allerdale Hall is not exactly the ideal venue that caters to the so-called prominence of the aristocratic Sharpes. The vast Victorian house is relentlessly drab and does not reflect the impressive homestead that it should be in status and structure. In making matters worse at Allerdale Hall Edith is restricted from stepping into certain parts of the dilapidated dwelling. Plus, Edith is overwhelmed by the recurring appearances of pesky apparitions that roam in and out of the expansive hallways of the isolated, blood-colored domicile. Lastly, the creaky goings-on is not helped a bit by the drastic change in hubby Sir Thomas’s demeanor as Edith feels duped by his on-going indifference. Edith has to feel uneasy and uncertain about what she has gotten involved with concerning the grasp of the mischievous Sharpes and the life-long warnings of afterlife spirits in the decaying manse that she has been taught to take seriously since childhood.

The sinister symbolism is adequately atmospheric and the erratic pacing makes for some rather genuine, tense moments. However, Crimson Peak does show some flashes of being a slight boofest melodrama that undermines its titillating convictions. As an eerie romancer Crimson Peak feels a tad uneven. The three-way love triangle pitting Wasikowska’s Edith against both Hiddleston’s Sir Thomas Sharpe and Charlie Hunnan’s Alan McMichael (Edith’s first suitor before Sharpe’s arrival) could have been explored but felt rushed and pushed aside. The whispering presence of shadowy ghostly figures floating about within the decrepit walls of Allerdale Hall makes for some convincing hair-raising hedonism that is compatible with del Toro’s topsy-turvy color-toned exposition.

Overall, the real scene-stealers behind Crimson Peak’s brightly spry makeup belongs to the film’s handlers responsible for the glossy sheen of this eye-fetching film project. Credit the sumptuous contributions in the aforementioned art design and sets (not to mention the crisp cinematography and fashionable costumes) to propel Crimson Peak’s entertainment value beyond the tepid lapses in manufactured jitters.

Critic’s rating ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) || > Ghosts are real, that much she knows.

Seen all the Del Toro films, but this one was not any good compared to his recent year's class. The film has his signature mark, the gothic style atmosphere, visually spectacular, but the story did not strike as expected. Definitely my blame is on the writing department. Though the actors were so much better in their character exhibition, especially the lead trio.

The opening convinced it will going to be a terrifying horror. Seriously? The writer brought ghosts for a concept, but ended penning a fantasy-thriller. In the middle of the narration there was too much drama that dragged the story. And in the third act it turned totally into a killer-thriller. It should have been more frightening, they wanted it to be a faulty human nature kind of twist than supernatural things. Well, they gave what they wanted, not what we the audience looking for.

I did not completely disliked the movie, I enjoyed it other than its plot. The costumes were very nice, the music well blended with the screenplay, but I was disappointed with the reason given as the motivation for all the trouble faced by character Edith. After all the hype, what it revealed was too little and too sudden with guessable stuffs. You can try it for the visuals alone than anticipating another Del Toro's masterpiece.

6/10 || Jane Eyre meets House of Usher with ghosts of the past

RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Crimson Peak” is a Gothic drama/mystery/horror about a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) in the opening years of the 1900s who falls in love with a mysterious English man (Tom Hiddleston) and moves from Buffalo, NY, to a creepy English manor, where his weird older sister also lives (Jessica Chastain). Ghosts of the past make themselves known, ultimately leading to the truth.

Aside from Jane Eyre and House of Usher, both of which have been filmed several times, “Crimson Peak” has similarities to haunting Gothic flicks like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992), “The Others” (2001) and “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein” (1994), but it’s thankfully nowhere near as ridiculously melodramatic as the latter. The spectral horror is more low-key than “Dracula” and “Frankenstein,” which is why I cite “The Others.” Psychological Gothic horror like “Demons of the Mind” (1972) and “The Eternal” (1998) are other comparisons. If you’re in the mood for a movie like these, you’ll probably appreciate “Crimson Peak.”

Honestly, this is one of the most sumptuously LOOKING movies I’ve ever seen. Take, for instance, the numerous scenes of Edith (Mia) walking down the lavish halls in an alluring white nightgown and flowing blond hair. The Gothic lushness is to die for.

Some people think the story is meh, but it’s no better or worse than the plots of the seven movies listed above. Whilst the first act in Buffalo is somewhat tedious, the movie picks up interest once Edith (Mia) moves to the unsettling English chateau, which has seen better days. I read a critic’s list of a dozen questions in an attempt to tear the film to pieces, but I easily answered all of them, which showed that this critic was intentionally LOOKING FOR something to dislike. Every potential quibble is effortlessly explained by clues in the picture or simply reading in-between the lines.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 59 minutes and was shot in Hamilton, Kingston and Toronto, Canada. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Matthew Robbins.

After an excellent opening film and a relatively poor sequel, we have the first prequel to “Dragon Heart”. Set in the Full Middle Ages, a time when dragons supposedly existed (it is a fantasy version of the medieval world, as you can see, and also due to the large amount of fantastic and unrealistic elements, in the scenery and costumes), the script tells how a would-be knight makes the acquaintance of a dragon in the lands beyond Hadrian's Wall. With that ally, and the friendship of a friar and a courageous Pictish warrior, he will try to defeat the oppressive forces of Britannia: a tyrannical feudal noble and an evil sorcerer.

Dragons, castles, evil sorcery, relatively uncivilized tribal peoples, amidst what remains of the legacy of the vanished Roman Empire. A recipe that works very well, even if it is completely invented, and gives us a very wrong idea of what the Middle Ages really were. But that's something I'm willing to forgive. What is not forgivable is the fact that the script recycles the story of the first film again, in its essential points: we have a very noble and decent knight, accompanied by a beautiful girl and a dragon, fighting a tyrant , and again the old story of sharing the heart. At its core, this film is almost a remake of the first film... but the magic of the original has been lost somewhere.

The film has some good actors. Right at the top, I would highlight the excellent vocal performance of Ben Kingsley. The actor, a veteran full of British nobility and chivalry, is impeccable in the task of voicing the dragon. A deep, dense, warm voice, but with soul and emotion. Julian Morris was also very good at his job, and establishes a good relationship with... the fictional CGI dragon, invisible to his eyes. Tamzin Merchant does not disappoint, in a character that is quite predictable and cliché, and that reminds us a bit of a tribal version of Princess Xena. Jonjo O'Neill is not bad, but he does what other actors have done much better than him: giving life to an arrogant and tyrannical medieval villain. The rest of the cast makes a welcome point of support, but doesn't have the time or chance to shine.

The film was produced by Raffaella, daughter of Dino de Laurentiis, producer of two films that I like a lot (“Blue Velvet” and “Serpico”) and a huge amount of films that I hate (“Conan”, in its various versions, “Dune”, the clear original, “Barbarella”, “Flash”, etc.); so when I saw her name associated with this movie I feared the worst. The film, however, offers us good cinematography and quite satisfactory CGI effects, considering that it is not a particularly well-off production. There's a lot of action and adventure here. Less happy was the soundtrack, which seeks to match the original film, ending up just copying it."

Rick Moranis (Wayne) and Stuart Pankin (Gordon) are decent, while Eve Gordon is arguably a better Diane than Marcia Strassman; a meaningless debate mind you, as neither are all that great due to the way the film is. The kid actors are OK, with a (very) young Mila Kunis appearing in a minor role.

The gimmick of an unlikely hot tub magically transporting these silly-minded saps back in time when their youthful existences were fun and carefree that meant something in contrast to the nowadays malaise that plagues them actually had merit, to a certain point of course.  Gleefully, the art of discovering the inner man-child mentality was a cockeyed challenge in ‘Hot Tub Time Machine 2′ . This is not to say that the original ‘Hot Tub’ was without its transparent banality. Still, it at least had a wacky purpose of over-the-top observation in mindless men looking to get back into the boundless craziness of their early years of arrested development.

Well, in the tradition of inevitable practice of sequelitis comes the monotonous ‘Hot Tub Time Machine 2’…a blatant excuse to heighten and celebrate whatever remaining applauded lunacy the predecessor had in making its misguided mark the first time around. Relentlessly pointless, tasteless and desperately attention-getting, this second serving of ‘Hot Tub ‘overflows its witless waters with jerky Jacuzzi-style humor so uninspired in lukewarm laughter that you might consider drowning yourself to save the agony of its time-traveling tepidness.

The tone in the first ‘Hot Tub Time Machine’ wanted to take a jittery joyride in reshaping the doldrums of these present-day morons and whisking them back to the mid-1980s where they can discover their fratboy fantasies as an escape route. Now, director Steve Pink returns to the splashy scene-of-the-crime as his tacky time-traveling hipsters want to engage in more naughty-minded brushes with eccentric personalities and places. The second time revisiting this anemic ‘Back To The Future’-esque formula finds the hot tub hotshots ten years into the future as they have taken advantage of exploiting their experiences through time travel. Yippee for them!

Screenwriter Josh Heald’s lame story never taps into the freshened fervor of the magical hot tub or its band of traveling hucksters as the movie buries itself in arbitrary, manic messiness. ‘Hot Tub Time Machine 2′ has really nothing to say or contribute to its empty-minded nuttiness. If you are game for gawking at bouncy babes (okay, this is not altogether a bad thing to endure), tolerating varied penis-style jokes, being exposed to tired time-traveling gags and fussing over the presence of an assassin on the lurk then jumping into this particular installment of ‘Hot Tub’ will warm your stillborn funnybone. Otherwise, the rest of us will probably prefer to blow bubbles out of chlorine pool water.

The ‘Hot Tub Time Machine’ rabble-rousers are back in this sorry sequel sans top-billed star John Cusack (Cusack’s Adam Yates character is missing from the proceedings, a lucky timed absence for both Cusack and his alter ego). So the floor belongs completely to the other players in Rob Corddry’s Lou, Craig Robinson’s Nick and Clark Duke’s Jacob. Together, they all capitalise on their hot tub-related hubris and profit fabulously in their money-making ventures.

Lou’s creation of the Internet search engine “Lougle” (yeah, a festive take-off on Google) has made him a bundle of cash. For Nick, his star-power as a musician (based on the creative back’s of the other artists he stole from) has landed him comfortable pop cultural status. Jacob, who we learned was Lou’s son previously, is piggybacking off of Lou’s online business success as his personal servant. When an assassin decides to rub out Lou (he is shot in the private parts…there you go…the ready-made juvenile wee-wee fodder in gear), the guys decide to go back to their trusty hot tub to take them back and curtail the assassin’s deed but that is to no avail. Instead, Lou, Nick and Jacob are thrust ten years into the future. The question remains: can the time-traveling trio catch the would-be assassin? How come one gets the sudden urge to automatically root for the killer-at-large?

Sure, the criticisms lodged towards anyone that will rail against the intentional nonsense of ‘Hot Tub Time Machine 2’s will be inevitable. ‘Hey idiot… the ‘Hot Tub Time Machin’e flicks are not suppose to win Oscars so stop being so fussy and overly critical.’ Okay, duly noted. Still, regurgitating a comical time machine romp back in 2010 that was questionable to begin with as it tries to mine the same kind of hackneyed hilarity leaves something to be desired. The gross-out nature of the smirking showcase lacks heft and feels woefully childish. The whole affair screams volumes of strain and desperation as Pink wants the forced lewd laughs to settle as opposed to trying to present a rollicking narrative that actually presents a sense of zany adventure without leaning on its noxious fumes.

For the sheer sake of being sophomoric and obnoxiously outlandish, ‘Hot Tub Time Machine 2′ struggles mightily in trying to plant a guilt pleasure grin on one’s face. Sadly, there are plenty that will be receptive to this lazy and raucous time-traveling tripe with the transparent titillation.

Critic’s rating: * star (out of 4 stars) || **Landing in a wrong timeline!**

Feels like 2010 was a long ago, so I don't remember the first film much. Looks like it is an unnecessary sequel, particularly when a very important character goes missing. Even the first film was not great, though that was considered a mainstream film and this one slipped into the B category. An average story, the theme was not used properly. I'm not talking about the plot holes, but the story construction and its characters.

The old friends meet again after becoming famous and millionaires, but when one of them met an accident, they decide to go back in time to fix it. Instead, they enter a wrong timeline and from there how they get back is what revealed in the remaining narration. The comedies were okay types, but I expected a better one. The twist was very ordinary, for a time travel theme people anticipates a smart twist, but it fell short to stand up to the mark.

Whatever, the production was awesome, all the special effects were acceptable. I mean it did not strongly relied on them, but according to the story's requirement, it managed so well. Less entertainment, but very much watchable and suits as a timepass product. I think the scenes at the end credits are for fun, but it also looks like a hint for possible third film. I'm not against that idea, but if it has a good story and upgraded cast like maybe new ones, I surely look forward.

The second movie is a romantic comedy between two people who are strongly attracted to one another, but who cannot and do not trust each other. 

The movie about con men is brilliant. The hustles and scams are clever and cleverly executed with excellent skill and tradecraft. Dramatically, the double-blinds and double- crosses are well executed. The players con their marks, one another and the audience with finesse and aplomb. The cinematography, choreography and editing are crisp. The reveals are plausible within the film's cosmos of reality. 

The romantic comedy is not bad. One can understand and believe the attraction between the two characters. Will Smith's character is hunky, clever, confident, successful and wealthy. Margot Robbie's character is gorgeous, sexy, vulnerable, clever and charming. But the major plot points in this boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back subplot seem contrived, while the intriguing aspect of their relationship (How can two con artists with a history of deceiving one another learn to trust one another?) isn't explored in a satisfactory manner. Instead we get a breakup for reasons that are never explained, a repeated gag involving a wallet, and a massive coincidence that leads the audience to believe one of them has a hidden agenda involving the other. The relationship between them works best when they are conning one another, but it needs resolution. 

Technically, the film is beautifully done. Cinematography, locations, wardrobe, make-up, editing, audio -- everything is polished. It's a movie that merits a second or third viewing, not only to see the cons played out, but also to appreciate some of the subtle foreshadowing. || > Kicked off well, kept the momentum, but the end was...

It's a Will Smith's movie, anyway, I was going to watch it, but when the initial cast dropped out, followed by a couple more, simply intrigued me. Actually, I enjoyed the film, but did not like it because of the bad ending. It was a good twist, except the shooting thing. An example how a tiny part can decide the entire movie's fate.

Well written crime-drama, with a touch of romance. After all the obstacles, the final cast were at their best. Heist movies always excite me because of the involvement of the tricks and thrills. Nicky, a con artist who recruits a small time thief, Jess to work with his gang. When the job and the romance advancing smoothly, an unexpected split happens. So the years passed, when they meet again, what comes is the crux of the remaining story.

The first half let us know what kind of character the Nicky is. His overwhelmed dedication for his undertaking and his reliable team's the focus. Overall, it was the best portion of the movie, and the next half goes for the giant kill, but lacks enthusiasm. More like a revenge or jealousy type narration, but only until reaching the climax where it tries being a very clever and happen all the things at a brisk pace.

The film was better than I thought, after learning it was criticised, mostly very badly. Would have been a bit better if the writing was cautious for the crucial parts. Importantly, like I said the end part. 'Yes' for the entertainment it provided and 'no' for one of the best products of the year,

6½/10 || **Great twists. Great Fun. Great acting. Great movie!**

As a sucker for heist/con films, I love this movie! Great cast, a fun plot, and just great escapism. After seeing hundreds upon hundreds of movies, I rarely am caught off guard by ""surprising"" twists, but this movie took turns I didn't expect, and absolutely loved it! Probably not as great as my rating would imply, but if you love a good con artist flick, you will enjoy Focus thoroughly."

Would I watch it again? Absolutely! Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely. || Well hats off to John Madden for managing to reassemble the cast from the first film from four years earlier, and for securing the sparing services of Richard Gere but I'm afraid the rest of this is all a poor cousin. With the hotel now more successful, ""Sonny"" (Dev Patel) and ""Mrs. Donnelly"" (Dame Maggie Smith) are in the USA trying to seek funding for them to expand, and to buy the former women's palace for their next venture. Returning, and expecting an inspector to come and evaluate their business they greet the arrival of writer ""Chambers"" (Gere) and of new guest ""Lavinia"" (Tamsin Greig) in slightly different manners - and that's the first mistake for ""Sonny""! The first film had a freshness to it, they (and we) were are all exploring a new life with new opportunities in a new bustling city: this is a much less joyful affair. Everyone appears to be looking towards the end; the characters are much flatter and slightly more depressed. The mischievous characterisations from Ronald Pickup and Celia Imrie have entered a rather uninteresting cul-de-sac. Familial discord between Sonny, his fiancée and his mother is all just a bit too convoluted and the story just, frankly, runs out of steam. Patel exudes charisma, he does way more to carry this than any of others and in the end comes up with quite a decent bit of dancing too. It's colourful and it's doesn't hang about, but Dame Maggie, in particular, has lost much of her curmudgeonly charm and Dame Judi really rather simpers through the film with little of the spark we saw before. To be honest, I'm not really sure the first film really merited a sequel at all. This one is really not very memorable and Richard Gere's character adds very little indeed."

The good news for the youthful muscled Romeo is that there will be ‘Twilight’ tarts lining up just to see Lautner read the middle section of your Aunt Mabel’s phonebook. In the derivative and disjointed street thriller ‘Tracers’, the chiseled Lautner will certainly be a draw for the hormonal honeys out there looking for an excuse to scream at the top of their hysterical lungs. As a vanity vehicle for the ex-Twilight lothario the underwhelming ‘Tracers’ may very well take a backseat to the option of watching the film’s star recite the aforementioned phonebook.

The best sell in ‘Tracers’ is indeed Lautner’s kinetic physicality for athletically bouncing around in a synthetic, boneless urban suspense piece. The doubts are not questioned in Lautner’s labeling as being an impressive physical specimen. After all, the performer certainly gives it his all in assuring that his fitness and finesse are on display to charge ‘Tracers’ with a sense of fueled urgency. It is too bad that director Daniel Benmayor oversees a fast-paced but flaccid actioner that offers a skimpy story in between the impressive gymnastic gestures of Lautner’s harried character.

So what is the fundamental foundation that feeds the relevance of ‘Tracers’ existence? Well, in addition to showing off the streetwise marvelous moves as demonstrated by the movie’s lead star, the gimmick involves acrobatic movements known as parkour. Hey, ‘Tracers’…the mid-80s called and it wants its outdated fad back! Sure, the art of parkour was indeed an instrumental wonderment that gave distinction to the awe-dropping French import ‘District B13′ but, in the case of ‘Tracers’, the stunts looks woefully repetitive and never really gives any considerable flavor to the strained action or transparent storyline.

New York-based bike messenger Cam (Lautner) zips through the streets much like an errand bullet from a shaky gun. The cluttered and busy streets of the Big Apple does not stop Cam from doing what he does best on bicycle wheels in terms of darting to his assigned destinations. However, the crafty Cam receives some considerable heat when he is targeted by tough Chinese gangsters to whom he owes some big time money. Cam’s antagonistic street thugs are not too patient with the beleaguered biker to grant them an expected payback. Bottom line: Cam needs to pay up or he and his loved ones will pay the ultimate price by being snuffed out from the street-minded riff raff.

Things start to look up for the compromised Cam when his accidental bike crash results in his meeting (and inevitable attraction) to the fetching bad girl Nikki (Maria Avgeropoulos). The ‘parkour princess’ was ducking and dodging the cops prior to her rimmed run-in with Cam. Nikki, both sensual and sinister, triggers Cam’s imagination and spoils him instantly with a new bike, not to mention his introduction to her parkour partners-in-crime, a bunch of high-flying, graffiti-loving street renegades that spend the majority of the time leaping and flipping on the city’s concrete surfaces. Nikki’s clique seem to hop and bop more convincingly than a twitchy kangaroo with a hot foot. Alas, Cam has a new crew and has adapted to the physical philosophies of parkour where he predictably excels at without question. Even the hyperactive group’s leader Miller (Adam Raynor) is tickled by Cam’s ability to soar in the air and make the hardened urban streets his personalized pouncing playground.

In its own clumsy way, ‘Tracers’ is well-intentioned because it strives to promote the art of parkour in the spirit of all those conveyor belt break-dancing movies that the studios kept churning out in the mid-1980s. There are some spunky and well shot scenes with New York’s edgy landscape as the convenient backdrop for action-packed mischievousness. Plus ‘Tracers’  is…um…Taylor-made for the fit-looking Lautner to showcase his inherent athleticism on full display for the masses (read: the ladies) to be awed over with wonderment. Nevertheless, ‘Tracers’ never taps into anything innovative or creative to go along with the aerobatic awareness that the movie pushes so eagerly.  The flat and thinly-veiled story, patched-together montages of parkour-inspired pluckiness, the toothless tease of an eye-rolling love triangle among Lautner’s Cam, Avgeropoulos’s Nikki and Raynor’s Miller and the ambivalence of Lautner’s Cam to stroll in the garden of trouble-making tendencies all renders ‘Tracers’ as a weak-kneed crime caper that ironically lacks any genuine animated bounce-and-pounce.

Granted this flimsy, frenetic vehicle is structured for Lautner’s on-screen fitness skill set but the spotty material never quite capitalizes on the star’s charisma or potential to enhance the skimpy plot with some meaty revelation. The stunning Avgeropoulos serves as automatic eye candy but her Nikki never manages to muster up any mysteriousness or cunning curiosity pertaining to her ‘dangerous diva’ persona.

Indeed, the pulsating platitudes in Benmayor’s impish but incomplete tumble-and-rumble tale is without a noticeable trace.

Genre: Action and Adventure, Crime Caper, Intrigue and Suspense

Critic’s rating: * 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) || > Recycled theme with the bike and Parkour stunts.

I think the first time I saw a movie that had Parkour in it was the 'District B13'. After that plenty of flicks came, among them this one as well. The movie was about a struggling young bike messenger who meets a girl belong to Parkour gang. Later he joins them that changes his fate, but whether he gets the girl or not, that tells with the thrilling story development and some amazing stunts.

Ever since the 'Twilight' series, I wanted Taylor Lautner to make his foot steady in his acting career. Because I was rooting his werewolves gang in that movie. His last movie I saw was three years ago, 'Abducted' that did not go well. At least this one looked much better, but not enough. Like always I hope he comes back stronger.

Considering this film, the story was as old as the cinemas. A reused plot, there's nothing new. More like another version of 'Point Break', but everything was under a limit. Adding the Parkour and bike stunts to it, gives somewhat a new flavour. The young actors and fresh faces were highlights. From coming under the B movie category, it is simply a nice entertainer, but appraising from the out of that, definitely a disappointment. In the end everything is how you look it and what you get from it.

Nothing wrong to call it an another version of 'Spare Parts', but it dealt with a different subject. It is a biographical-sport film, about a running race team involving seven high school students from one of the poorest towns in America, McFarland. But the tale begins with the coach Jim White, who finally arrives with his family there after got fired frequently in the other cities. Not intended to stay for a long period, but he has no other choice. He finds hard to fit in the society and get along with his students, but he manages to get going when he forms a team for the upcoming cross-country running race. So their journey puts the small town on the map.

A very inspiring film, not just sports personalities, but anyone who wants to achieve in life should see it. So a must see film for the students and the youngsters. It is not just about the sport, but culture and society. The first act was an introduction, where and how everyone comes together was revealed. Followed by the middle part focused more on the game. Getting prepared for it and facing other troubles that stands obstacle to it. And finally in the third act, it kind of loses what originally intended as a theme, but brings the social matter into it before getting back to where it belongs to curtain.

There was lots of modification in the cinema version compared to the original story. Characters, locations, events, all were kind of randomised from the actuality to the different timelines just to tell a good story. After all, this is a Disney film and Disney always seeks a decent family theme, yet it still remains true to the real. From the New Zealand director of 'Whale Rider' fame, another brilliant film. Apart from the super Kevin Costner and his family, the rest of the cast was so perfect. One of the best sport-dramas of the year and Disney done it again. You no need to analyse it to choose, just go for it and it won't disappoint you.

8/10 || Well made, well acted. Hearty viewing.

<em>'McFarland, USA'</em> sees Disney do a true story sports drama for what feels like the billionth time, but there's no disputing they sure do know how to create a wholesome and meaningful film for the genre; despite the clichés and predictability. This is no different, it's very good.

Kevin Costner leads astutely as Jim White, while Carlos Pratts is the pick of the bunch when it comes to the younger guys. All of the latter, who play a group of runners that White coaches, are well cast in truth. I felt a connection to the story, thanks to the writing but also to them.

It does turn into a very pleasant and enjoyable 128 minutes, it's also quite unique to see a sports film about cross-country running as opposed to the usual basketball, American football etc. Score/cinematography wise, it's good.

Definitely watch this if you get the opportunity. || I recently discovered this wonderful film that had somehow escaped my watchlist until now. Sometimes, trailers fail to capture the essence of a movie, leaving you unsure whether it would interest you or not.

I had owned this film for some time, solely due to my collection of all things Disney, but it wasn't until I sat down with my son to watch it that I truly appreciated its heartwarming and engaging story.

While not without its flaws, particularly in Disney's decision to omit a crucial fight scene, the film still manages to charm with its fun characters and beautiful family dynamics. The bond between the coach and players is a standout element, offering a great portrayal on screen.

Although the story could have benefited from more emotion and better writing, overall, it was a very enjoyable watch that left a positive impression."

Pretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.

I went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.

It was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.

7/10 || A decent enough action thriller. Neeson, Harris, Kinnaman and Holbrook do a good job.

The direction is also good. The script is just predictable, although has some good points but, that's it. A movie to watch without doing any mental effort."

Disney has done it again. Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.

The movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairytales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.

Lily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.

7/10 || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

I'm honestly concerned that this isn't a movie that anyone is going to watch again and again, but it's a solid watch, and a definite improvement over the 1950 animated classic, though I can't say this touches ""Ever After"" for me.

The original story was somewhat lacking, but had fantastic animation for the time, along with voice acting and writing parallel with the movies of its time.  I'm somewhat sad to say that is a fair difference in quality compared to modern standards.

Disney very much kept this dumbed down for younger audiences, and I expect them to have more fun with scenes like ""lizard footman eats a fly"", but in the very least they steered away from realistic cg talking animals (a creepy factor in many of the live action remakes), though they do make a very specific nod to it at the beginning of the movie.

While I do think they managed to improve on almost ever facet of the original, it certainly isn't without flaws.

The casting is all over the place, which, I'm sure, affected the odd character development.  Oddly, the less important characters, the men, in this case, are fine, I really have zero to say other than I rather like Nonso Anozie in anything he's in, and I did think the bit about ""Kit"" was a rather inspired thing.

I understand that Kate Winslet has had a villainous kick the past few years, and she plays ""stuck up snoot"" very well, but seeing Helena Bonham Carter come in to give us ""the fairy godmother who ain't got time for dat"" really makes me wonder if they just weren't paying her enough to care.  It would have made more sense to let Winslet elevate the fairy godmother (one of the only things that really wasn't) and let Carter goes Bellatrix Lestrange as the Wicked Stepmother.

Sophie McShera did a marvelous job of making me hate her character, and Holliday Grainger kept making me see Katherine Heigl if we could keep her away from tanning beds, so they both did a marvelous job as wicked stepsisters (honestly, probably the best performances of the movie).

For some reason though, they made a very strange decision to make all the wicked women gingers, though not with a very convincing dye job.  I don't know if it was supposed to be representative of their tacky fashion and the ability to dye hair at the time, or if Disney really thinks gingers don't have a soul, but it was a blaring message, if illegible.

What makes me think that they don't care at all is Lily James.  She's lovely, she did a good job with the role as written, and I'm dying to see her in anything else to see if any of the oddities were her, or she's done just as good as Winslet with the roles they were given.  

Cinderella is traditionally a ""fairest in the land"" look, given that it's the middle of Europe, I imagine northern was exotic once upon a time, or at least certain people thought so she is traditionally very blonde and very fair.  Lily James is neither (in this, despite some of the posters), so I thought they were taking a more Germanic look with a more honey colored hair....but it is also very oddly colored, and perhaps we wouldn't have notice if it wasn't for her very prominent BLACK eyebrows (which I have nothing against, I actually think they're lovely) which would have been simple enough to die to match.  Alternatively they could have abandoned blonde altogether (plenty of versions do).  It is just very odd to spend millions of dollars to do something purposefully (and repetitively) to make it look like they don't care and objectively make their movie worse.

Overall, it's this sort of attitude that seeps into the movie at different points.  It could have been a masterpiece, but instead, everyone knows it's a guaranteed paycheck on the title alone and made something that ends up being rather average despite itself. || An improvement on Disney's past attempt from 1950.

I do like the animated version from the studio, but this 2015 release of <em>'Cinderella'</em> makes for a more enjoyable experience in my eyes. Lily James and Richard Madden are smart choices to play Cinderella and Prince, while Cate Blanchett is impressive as the Stepmother. Helena Bonham Carter (Fairy Godmother), Stellan Skarsgård (Grand Duke) and Nonso Anozie (Captain) are also noteworthy.

The premise has a few changes, the ending plays out slightly differently compared to the '50 production - to positive effect. It also makes the nastiness of Blanchett's character unmistakably clear, I actually felt hatred for her - which wasn't the case, at least to the same extent, with the original.

All his films were very impressive and I believed him on this one, more than the Sandler. Otherwise, it would have been undoubtedly a skippable flick.

As expected the movie was good, but not without the flaws, I mean the major ones because there are many unanswered stuffs that leaves viewers go either way from thinking all the possibility to create their own imagination. Hope that's not the case, the writers do not want to be that smart otherwise it will be a messed up movie with having a wonderful theme idea.

Yeah, I liked the concept, but it should have been a bit detail while exploring the story and exhibiting the characters. I still feel it can be covered in the follow-up, so from that perspective, the movie was decent. Especially highlighting one of the social issue was a nice addition, but the portrayal of family affair was a disappointment. It's that kind of story demanded in a like manner, but that does not convince me at all.

From the Adam Sandler's perspective the movie was much better, because of his series of recent fails. At the same time it was a bit letdown from the perspective of the director known for his cool works. Overall, it lays on 50-50, and mostly favours on the positive side because of the narration of the dark comedy in a style. And again, I felt the end was terrible with cliche. I definitely give thumbs up to go for it, even though the loopholes the creative concept draws our attention.

Barrie’s classical kiddie character “Peter Pan” comes and goes when it pleases. Naturally there have been several big screen interpretations to outlast one’s reserved stash of pixie dust to fling around. From perhaps the best known animated film adaptation of Walt Disney’s nostalgically revered version to the surprisingly big-budgeted Steven Spielberg-directed spectacle dud Hook with a high-caliber cast the legend of “The Boy That Never Grew Up” seems to spark the challenge of presenting yet another spin on Barrie’s iconic treasured tyke.

In director Joe Wright’s sci-fi fantasy action-adventure Pan the familiar factors of Barrie’s magical Boy Wonder are evident and should serve as a mild and manufactured revisit to the “Peter Pan” folklore for children of all ages. However, the whimsical aspect of Pan was dubiously overshadowed, overproduced yet curiously understated in its ability to convey a storytelling moment that did not seem laborious. Consequently, Pan feels mechanical and never quite settles in with any sense of breezy charm or youthful balance of wonderment. Instead, the audience is left wondering about the uniqueness and distinctive approach to an already ubiquitous serving of Barrie’s celebrated literary lad. Despite the vibrant visuals and the given big screen blueprint for “Peter Pan’s” endearing legacy Wright’s toothless tale of flashy action and adventure may just prove to be another proverbial flash in the Pan. 

Clearly, there is no rhyme or rhythm to tamper with the built-in concept of what the majestic make-up for “Peter Pan” should be conceived in the minds of generations that were subjected to Barrie’s boundless boy. Still, Wright and Jason Fuchs fail to capture any fresh imagination or intrigue about the puppy dog-eyed youngster’s on-screen by-the-dots adventures. This pumped-up project is pedestrian at best and nothing more than another sparkled rung in the “Peter Pan” ladder of box office hits-and-misses. The casting for Pan is decent enough but the shoddy material they are left to elevate with their included presence is wasted in a stillborn fantasy odyssey that cannot overcome its own creative indifference.

Pan seeks to start out with its own embedded twist by delivering this narrative as a prequel set in 1940’s London. Here, we are introduced to 12-year old Peter (Levi Miller) whose disillusionment continues to spiral while staying at the chaotic Catholic orphanage he was unceremoniously dumped off courtesy of his desperate mother (Amanda Seyfried). Nevertheless, Peter maintains some semblance of hope that his mother will soon return to fetch him and all should solve whatever abandonment issues he has at hand.

Soon, Peter and his fellow orphanage buddies will succumb to the clutches of Blackbeard the Pirate (Hugh Jackman). Evidently bad boy Blackbeard had been a notorious busy beaver by sadistically kidnapping working class children and shipping them off to his Neverland mines to toil there. However, Blackbeard and his bunch cannot be too bad to tolerate since they welcome out-of-the-blue snappy sing-a-longs to such noteworthy tunes as Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and the Romones’ “Biltzkrieg Bop”. Huh? Of course this impromptu musical sequence is not the only thing that seems curiously out of place in the disjointed Pan. 

Okay...so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?
Okay…so Hugh Jackman has both a black beard and a black heart in PAN. How about a blackboard to erase this ill-conceived ode to the J.M. Barrie treasured tyke?
It is not long before the plagued Peter meets and becomes attached to a hustling drifter named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). Yes folks…it appears that Star Wars comparisons are in order here as Peter’s Luke Skywalker teams with shifty Hook’s Han Solo to defeat the devilish Blackbeard’s Darth Vader. And you might want to ask who is the Princess Leia in this disguised Star Wars premise amid the mines and high seas? Well, in this case Princess Leia is in the form of Pan’s Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Thus, the gang assembles together in an attempt to thwart the iron fist of Darth Vader…er, the diabolical Blackbeard. The excitable exploits of the crew coming together to defeat the pesky pirate is meshed together with the flashy flourishes of random 3-D special effects, the vitality of color and scope and playful variations of well-known “Peter Pan” personalities. Hence, all the festive and feisty flexing that Pan demonstrates still cannot compensate for a lackluster execution of Wright’s anemic installment that botches a ready-made backstory for “Peter Pan” enthusiasts.

As Peter, Miller shows some solid and impish promise as the boy searching for self-discovery in a bizarre surrounding of despair and disappointment. Jackman’s over-the-top villainous Blackbeard is simply passable but nothing really worth hanging your hat on. Jackman’s plotting pirate will not make anyone dismiss Johnny Depp’s Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies anytime soon. The added elements in supporting players such as Hedlund’s Hook and Mara’s Tiger Lily (not to mention the Lost Boys) feel synthetic and arbitrary–something not very encouraging as these characterizations are essential to the whole “Peter Pan” universe.

Unfortunately for Pan one might end up saying never mind to the boisterous yet aimless shenanigans situated in Neverland.

 || > Its when Peter stepped into the Neverland for the first time.

Usually everyone loved growing up watching the various film adaptations of original work by JM Barrie's a century old creation, 'Peter Pan'. There are plenty of unofficial prequels and sequels were also made and met success. Yet this prequel with high budget and modern technology, but not a Disney film, generated some expectations with stars like Hugh Jackman and Rooney Mara in it.

The box office was not as expected, and the movie was also just above average, but I liked the performances and visuals. The story is about an orphan Peter who becomes a Pan, a leader to 'the lost boys'. The opening line goes like this: 'Sometimes friends begin as enemies and enemies as friends' and that's what the rest of the movie evolves.

I don't think I liked this story. In all the prequels, I loved the Nick Willing's 'Neverland' who is a master of prequels to all the greatest fairytales. I disappointed with this only because of lack of the depth in narration, short storyline and quick scenes, other than that it was not a bad flick to me. The main relief was, it was not like the recent 'Alice in Wonderland' style movie with the weird costumes, makeups and the character physiques.

Despite all the negative feedback for this flick, I feel it won't hurt for a one time watch. My eye is now on its sequel, because before the Wendy's introduction there's another story is to be told and that is between Peter and Hook. But now it's on doubt over the result of this movie. Anyway, I'm on for it and hope it only gets better than the original.

6/10 || I found this to be a quite enjoyable family movie derived from the Peter Pan story we all love. I am not really sure why it holds a fairly mediocre rating on most rating sites. It is undeserved as far as I am concerned.

The movie is a prequel which tells the story of how Peter became Peter Pan. I think the story is fairly well done and allows for both adventure and humor.

The characters are pretty good although I found Peter Pan to actually be the weakest of them. Hook and Tiger Lily not to mention Blackbeard stole quite a lot of my attention. Peter Pan is not bad just a little…bland.

The movie is darker and more real than other Peter Pan movies. Blackbeard is a rather nasty villain and there are certainly more danger for the good guys in this movie. People do not just get nocked down and come back, they really die.

The special effects are not bad. I quite liked the pixie swarms at the end of the movie. Also, unlike what some reviewers state Peter Pan does fly in the movie. I can only assume that those who state that he does not never bothered to see the movie to the end. Do not review a movie if you cannot be bothered to finish it for Christ sake!

The movie leaves a bit of a whole between the end of this story and the beginning of the traditional Peter Pan story. What happened to make Peter and Hook become enemies and what is the story between Hook and the crocodile for instance? I certainly would not mind a second movie about that."

Some people claim that this movie do not follow the books but, obviously, I cannot comment on that. So my review is based on the movie and the movie alone. I have to confess that I mostly watched this movie because I did watch the first instalment and felt obliged to see where the story went.

This movie have quite a few fairly cool special effects, especially the ones when Tris is in the virtual reality world trying to open the cube with the message to the inhabitants in the closed up city. Unfortunately this pretty much sums up the good parts of the movie.

As with Divergent I found this movie to be fairly mediocre. One reviewer said that this was a movie dumbed down for the teenage audience. Unfortunately I feel that he was right. Also unfortunately I think many teenagers are a lot smarter than Hollywood believe they are.

The plot is, well, mediocre. The acting is fairly meh. The main character, Tris, really lacks any form of charisma and spends most of the movie going around in some state of melancholy feeling sorry for herself and everything that happens around her. Apart from Four most of the people were behaving immaturely, cluelessly, froze up or panicked whenever something nasty happened and switched allegiances back and forth like you changed shirts.

When Tris finally opened the cube I was expecting something cool and unexpected. What we got was a rather dull message about the city and its “purpose”. I complained in my review of divergent that we got absolutely no background information as to how the people had ended up in this ridiculous situation with a closed city and these factions that I still do not understand what they were supposed to solve. The message was supposed to explain this but it explained absolutely nothing except that the divergents were some kind of purpose or solution.

The ending? Well again this is a book series so it is not surprising that it ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger but it was really a cheap ending, one that you would expect from a TV series episode.

So I cannot say that I liked the movie very much. The virtual reality special effects scenes were fairly cool but that was about it. || Briefing; this movie is just bad.

The first was not good either but this one continues the path open by the first. The special effects are quite noticeably rendered by computers and the actors are uncharismatic, other than that, the plot is just bad.

Another movie with quasi-teenager lead roles in a dystopic future in which stupidity is spread all along man-kind.

We just witness the struggle of our heroine with her self-imposed guilt with stupid enemies that let her survive at every moment so she can become the messiah she is meant to be.

I think the only positive part I can get from this movie is the preeminence of strong and important female characters. Other than that, just skip it. || > The mystery box and the power hungry leaders!

This is not a bad sequel, I quite enjoyed it, but I think I liked 'Divergent' better. The story continued a very short after where it ended in the first. In this part, it was all about power hungry where many try to get that top post. On the other side, there will be an attempt to open a mystery box that found which might reveal some important detail about them.

Looked like a very good storyline, unpredictable stuffs, but not utilised to its full potential. Though the actors were good, especially Shailene was sexy in her short hairs. I think she came straight out of 'The Fault in Our Stars' to take up this role where her brother in this film was a boyfriend in that.

Visually as well very captivating with those great graphics and it is first digital 3D film in the series. It has numerous small twists, especially during decrypting the mystery box. So I felt the middle parts were the best part of the film.

I thought this film would take place outside the wall, but a new story was developed and still kept the mystery about the rest of the world. I don't know the book, but that's my disappointment. I hope the next film in the series would go beyond the wall and explore some new things. So I'm looking forward for the 'Allegiant'.

Too late for Tears is directed by Byron Haskin and written by Roy Huggins. It stars Lizabeth Scott, Don DeFore, Dan Duryea and Arthur Kennedy. Music is by Dale Butts and cinematography by William C. Mellor.

One night Alan and Jane Palmer (Kennedy & Scott) are driving to a party out Hollywood way, when all of a sudden someone in another car tosses a suitcase filled with cash into the back seat of their car. So begins a tale of greed, betrayal and murder...

Money is poison.

Low budget be damned, Too Late for Tears (AKA: Killer Bait) ends up being a film noir (in story terms) of some excellence. Banging the drum whilst singing that money be the root of all evil, Haskin (I Walk Alone) and Huggins (I Love Trouble) put Scott front and center as one of the ultimate femme fatale bitches. Jane Palmer is a cunning cat, it's perhaps not for nothing that Duryea's Danny Fuller pet names her as Tiger, for Palmer knows exactly what she wants, and now that she has the financial means and sees a way of elevating herself to the richer playing field, she literally will stop at nothing to keep it that way. Be it murder or her sexuality as a weapon, Palmer is in control - even as she takes the knuckles from the hapless Danny. It's a dynamite character and Scott has all the necessary requirements (sultry, blonde, angular bone structure) to make her work to maximum effect.

Around Scott there's much to enjoy as well. Duryea is perhaps a given in the sort of film noir role we just love him for, but also Kennedy as the foolish husband makes a telling impact. DeFore, as the character is written, has to play his cards close to his chest for much of the time, this often gives the sense that he has wandered into the wrong movie. It's a bit jarring at first, but once the plot ufurls in its entirety then it rounds out as a neat bit of performing. Bonus is Kristine Miller (Sorry, Wrong Number) as Alan Palmer's sister, Kathy. A lovely straight backed character of some warmth, it gives the viewers someone to hang their hopes on, a barely visible beacon of hope in a world full of lies and deceit. A fine performance from Miller, she should have had a bigger career in film.

Although the Los Angeles locations are utilised well, especially impressive given the tiny budget afforded the picture, film does lack potency in the surroundings. If ever a femme fatale character, one with men slowly being wrapped around her fingers, called for some gritty, dank & suspicious places to work out of, then this is it. William Mellor (The Naked Spur) puts his photographic talents to use at a boating lake, and brings some shadows to the characters in the various well lighted rooms that the plot plays out from, but the mood is not set at uneasy, a sense of foreboding to match the machinations of Jane Palmer. It's also 10 to 15 minutes too long, some flabby filler in the middle could have been trimmed, because the film does begin to creak in the final third as we approach the sneaky finale.

Nonetheless, the story has the aces up its sleeve, it's strong enough in substance and performed very well by the cast, marking it out as a film noir easily recommended to fans of that persuasion. 7.5/10 || Lizabeth Scott (""Jane"") stumbles on a case filled with cash. She takes it home and confides in husband Arthur Kennedy who promptly deposits it in the lost luggage at Grand Central station whilst they lay low and figure out what to do. She gets greedy and when he tries to rein her in, she goes boating with him; shoots him in an onboard tussle then sets about retrieving the loot and escaping alive... Dan Duryea is quite good as her drunken, unreliable, sidekick and Don DeFore sort of appears from nowhere are her ultimate nemesis. It is quite a decent crime noir, quite tense at time, but it is way too long, a little convoluted at times, and is really let down by a poor ending."

It was a good movie, but just like 'Turbo', it was turned down by the critics and so those who follow them. Besides Disney and Pixar, DreamWorks Animation ain't that bad at all. Technical side of this film comes under same league with the other two top production house, but the story and the character are not strong enough. Comedies were awesome, and so the dialogues, the innovation in narration falls short with the same old cliche in the alien theme. The soundtracks were good though, especially that one used for the promotion, 'feel the light'.

For a change, the lead girl character was different and voice rendered by Rihanna. I said it many times that my first ever 3D animation was 'Ants', despite 'Toy Story' was the first feature length. And this film has been the best work of the director to till date since his first flick 'Antz'. As usual like any animated movie, it was targeted for children, but I enjoyed watching it. There won't be a sequel at least for now, but I would love to have one. For a change you can try this to get a break from the fairytales and princess stories.

6.5/10 || Utterly average film that was rightly overlooked by the critics. There is nothing much apart from pretty colours. Rihanna is not an actress, and when you can't see her pretty face you seriously notice that. I wouldn't bother with this one, there are leagues better out there."

So the Jeff Nichols and Micahel Shannon saga continues. This is theirs 4th film together in the last nine years and all of them were well accepted. Now they are into sci-fi for this, which is kind of a road movie that resembles hundreds of other films. Only thematically, but in parts it looks different, especially for being too realistic as what the director is famous for. Finally, something is not a comedy or a full of CGI, yet still it is a wonderful sci-fi-drama with some thrill moments.

It opened like the midway of the story. We obviously have to wait for a proper explanation to know what's going on, who is the child and where they're taking him. So it all begins with two armed men driving a young kid on the dark hours. Only we know is that they are protecting the boy from the government people, but the film took some time to give a clear picture of the condition. In the meantime, I started my prediction game, but I expected the film to clarify how it all began. It never cared about that part, only moved forward and that's how we're going to get some answers where a few might feel its a let down.

The negative of the film is you won't fully understand it, but it is not an incomplete story, just designed that way that leaves for the viewer to add their own perspectives to where the writer left blank spaces. Like I said the people are comparing it with the similar films and I did not care about that, but I disappointed with the conclusion. It was neatly folded, I actually liked it, but it was not fresh, especially it totally mirrors 'Tomorrowland'. Now I know why Warner Bros moved it from last year to this year's release.

It might be a coincident because the director who is also the writer has a good reputation, so I believe it is definitely not a steal, just a common creative that we've already seen many films like that. Overall, this film is worth, but might not satisfy the Jeff Nichols fans, because like I said plenty of times before in my reviews, now it the sci-fi era and every filmmaker and film-star want to board on that plane. So it did not spare Jeff Nichols as well.

7/10 || It's like _Donnie Darko_ and _Looper_ had a baby. A less talented baby, but still, pretty impressive.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || Midnight Special is an entertaining Sci-fi flick that ultimately never reaches it's full potential. The father son on the run story is griping and well played with the talent of Michael Shannon who is believable as a father who will do anything to get his gifted son to where he needs to be. Dunst and Edgerton do some fairly solid work also as Altons mother and I believe step father. The dialogue is believable, the action and Sci-fi elements are all well put together. The concept almost ET like is interesting. The CGI is acceptable if not spectacular. The music well scored if not memorable. I personally found this movie felt long at 1h52mins and for some reason I felt the movie should of been set in an earlier time period like the 70s or 80's. These are small personal gripes and you may ask why it does not achieve it's full potential. The answer is simply the way it ends, it felt small or empty. These characters had done so much,  for this child and somehow the movie had left me with zero emotional connection to how the story played out. The father and son connection was the strongest element in the movie and this I felt needed a bigger part in the ending of this film, but for some reason they chose to pull back on this right at the buzzer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Science fiction as a worthy watch. My final score 3.5 stars."

It was not bad, but the same old stuff that we'd seen in so many other films. It was actually based on the book and directed by the 'Taken' filmmaker. An international project, takes place in three different countries, but opens and ends in Congo. It centres on an assassin who had successfully executed a high-profile job in Africa. But a few years later, after giving up those kind of work, all the sudden it comes back to haunt him when some unknown men comes looking for him. So he decides to find who's behind it and why.

Even though it is a familiar theme, very much enjoyable. But the problem is the hero remains unhurt and somebody else dies for him which so cliché. The acting was good, and obviously that is Sean Penn in the lead. The action sequences were okay, but the pace of the film was the reason for me to sit on-board for over 100 minutes.

So if you are not expecting a good story and the stunts, it will do okay, particularly for the time pass. Yes, it had a chance to become a better film, but I think it wanted to replicate the book which is a couple of decades old and in the meantime pieces from it was used in the different films, hence this one looked so old. The critics did not like it, but it is much better than they say, as well as not good as some people claim.

_6.5/10_ || Sean Penn really should have thought twice before engaging with this derivative and procedural drama. He is sharp-shooter ""Terrier"" whose accuracy put paid to the Congolese Minister for Mines and sets in train a remarkably lacklustre thriller that sees Interpol and corporate greed now out to get him. Pierre Morel has assembled a surprisingly notable cast here with Javier Bardem probably the best of the bunch as the duplicitous ""Felix""; Idris Elba (""Barnes"") appears sparingly and adds little - though not as little as the terrible effort from the completely un-menacing Ray Winstone's ""Stanley"" - who ought to have just stuck with looking for waterfalls. The dialogue borders on the puerile and the acting is so ploddingly set-piece that even the shoot-outs and jungle scenarios cannot breathe life into this. I haven't read Jean-Patrick Manchette's original novel, but if this adaptation is in any way true to the book, then I won't be bothering."

Cheers ! ! ! || This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.

This movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.

The gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike “Mr Nobody” but I have to say that I quite liked him.

Despite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not?

Well, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer."

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || Amusing slasher parody with heart

This is a parody of 80’s slasher flicks, especially the Friday the 13th franchise. The story revolves around five teens somehow being translated into a fictitious 1986 slasher movie called “Camp Bloodbath.” The prematurely deceased mother (Malin Akerman) of the teen heroine (Taissa Farmiga) starred in the movie and she gets to meet her again, albeit as a young woman.

While this 2015 film is a throwaway flick it’s reasonably entertaining, especially if you’re familiar with slasher films. What I like best is that it has heart and you can feel the loving relationship of mother and daughter. It’s also nice to see Nina Dobrev again, who’s one of the most alluring females in the cast, although she’s outshined by curvy Angela Trimbur as airhead Tina.

The movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with some stuff done in Los Angeles.

GRADE: B- || It was silly, but entertaining. And it had room for poignant moments.
And personally, the outtakes were the most hilarious!

And, good cast as well."

This is a surprise film. A romance-drama with the backdrop of the smart mix of sci-fi and fantasy. You won't always get a B movie as good as this one. So when you find one, you should appreciate them. It never needed the higher-end graphics, because everything it required of those were in small quantity. Even though they did not compromise and gave best visuals that greatly impacted to the narration.

The leading two were very impressive. The Italian locations as well equally beautiful, overall the screenplay was the real winner. The story of an American man who flees to Italy after his mother's death and followed by a small incident. There he meets an unusual young research student and convinces her to date him. While they both getting closer, a series of weird stuffs begins to threaten their relationship. Explaining those to one another and for us the what the remaining film focused.

This is like 'Before Sunrise' meets some monster film. I don't think it is very original, but kind of refreshing that carefully carved film. If you see the film poster, you won't get the impression that you want to watch it immediately, but if you give it a try, surely you would be, I mean majority of you won't end in a disappointment. There's no way it should have been better, because it is already at its best in a simple way. Not a must see, but I hope you won't miss this little gem if you're reading this.

7/10 || A decent watch, could watch again, but I don't think I can honestly recommend.

As much as I feel like I liked the movie as a whole, the more I think about what it actually is, and it is definitely a better atmospheric movie than it is an epic story or a high paced creature feature.

This is a slow burn, hinting at this or that, drip-feeding information until things are just very obvious.  While I think a ""Jaws"" approach  definitely would have given more punch, the movie opts for a deeper question of ""I see what's happening, but why?"".

The movie definitely takes the time to discuss everything in detail, and while the things that would need some explanation are interesting, the movie is filled to the brim with someone's vacation video.

Ultimately worth a watch if you're into semi-grotesque semi-horror stories this should be worth a watch, but I don't know how many people are going to come back to watch this one again."

The last time I saw such documentary film was 'Food, Inc.'. In the mean time I have seen documentaries about different topics, but not food. It was a long gap indeed, because then I was in my early twenties and now watching this film made me realise how to look at the food I eat everyday. So believe me, if you are in your late twenties and above, this will inspire you. But for others, like the youngsters and kids, it will be an educational film.

This Australian film looks funny from the outside, but the information it gives can't simply be discarded. I liked the actor, who was the writer, director, producer of the film and the dedication was highly appreciable. Because it was not just go out and make a film, but he himself placed into the centre of the film plot. Initially I thought it was a crazy idea, but at the end I'm stunned. For everything, from what he did and what this film revealed.

When it comes to the food, there are many things to be concerned. But this film was focused on sugar, about the foods we eat, which has a strong sugar presence and how it is affecting our health. Damon Gameau decided to experiment himself by consuming per day, forty teaspoons of sugar and from sugary products that easily available in the market. And monitoring carefully the changes in his body along the way his wife's pregnancy.

> ""Sugar's not evil, but life's so much better when you get rid of it.""

The film is not all about the experiment he's doing, it also gives some details about the people who are suffering big from modern foods. Especially I'm happy for openly giving opinions about the soft drinks from Coke and Pepsi brands. Damon also travelled to the US and he continued what he was doing, alongside collecting some new input from the experts, as well as meeting the victims. The rapid change in his physique and health gives a report on what direction the experiment is heading. From damaging the skin to the putting his internal body organs into various risks of diseases such as liver failure, heart attack and many more.

There's a brief appearance of Hugh Jackman, but don't expect more than that. It had no big impact, because the film's topic was much bigger than his part in the film. The film gave me some idea about how to deal with the food I consume. If you are concerned about your weight, particularly fat tummy, you will know what to do after watching this. I mean this does not guide you through, but opens your eyes. It points out where you are committing your mistake. It does not tell to completely cut off the sugary, but know your limit and behave.

One of the best documentary films. Do whatever you want after watching this, but before that don't think to skip it. You can call it an inspirational, educational or a message deliverer, but this film has committed to highlight what went wrong with the modern day diet. And how the food industry is responding to all the accusations. But you should know what's better for you, so think twice before touching any sugar products. Especially be aware of fructose (who is the villain of this story), which might not equate to nicotine, but the consequences are.

First of all I don't wanna compare it with any movie like the others did. Many reviews bashing that it was rip-off of 'Big Stan'. Yes kind of similar theme, but there's a lot of difference. The concept was the same and the story happens in an alternate way like 'what if'. That means one takes place outside the prison and the other one in the prison. If you're a movie fanatic, you would enjoy the show other than going after flaws and resemblance.

I had seen many weird combos, and I felt same feeling for this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, when I first heard about it. Like usual, once I watched the movie seem to be okay. Quite a show and equally good, one of the funniest combinations to entertain. I had a few good laughs and enjoyed the film. I would love to get a sequel for this, because these men coming together are double fun. So it should not be wasted ending with a one-off movie, but at least a duology or maybe a trilogy.

It was a hot and humid atmosphere, I thought they shot in Italy. Then came to know it was an Aussie flick when a dead kangaroo was shown. So Simon Pegg in an Australian film, that directed by one of my favourite dog movies 'Red Dog' famed filmmaker. On this, it was a mixed feeling to me. A comedy-thriller, a good time pass movie. The film editing and the screen presentation were what made it look a better flick. If it was told from the starting point to the end as a single line, then it would have been very ordinary.

Barely there are eight actors, that mean it is a limited cast movie that takes place in the isolated location. All about love, cheating, crime, money, completely about the dark side desires. There are a couple of twists, that is only because of the bend in the storytelling. At the Beginning, the three different stories were told one after another that set in the same timeline. The first one was to introduce a hitman, followed by a woman who cheats her husband and the finally a dentist couple who was threatened by a loan shark.

There are no good guys in the story. All of them has some issues and they want to get rid of it from their lives. So the plot begins to explode once they committed to their plans that does not go as it should be. When a series of mistakes and characters and their situation overlaps with each other, that lead to the finale.

There are some minor plot holes, if you don't compare it with the Hollywood blockbusters like critics then possibly you would enjoy it. I won't suggest it if you are looking for a Tarantino style masterpiece. It is a little dark-comedy from the down-under that has its own value despite there are some similarities with other flicks.

The only reason to I go to Nick is to watch 'Shaun the Sheep'. This show was watched by many adults as well, a popular one among all the ages. As the fan of this series, we have been waiting very long to get a movie version. I was excited to see it and of course enjoyed it completely. Its impossible one to get disappointed with the movie/show when the narration is led by one of the awesome characters, Shaun. The promotional posters were also created some extra curiosity that imitated the famous Hollywood films like 'Boyhood', 'Wild', 'Birdman' and many others.

Stop-motion is a very-very hard and outdated concept of the animation format, but still loved by many. Every year only one or two get released, sometimes none. The technical sides were upgraded, including bluescreens for backgrounds and other special effects. Still the hard work remains, but qualities are improved. It made significant contributions to the live-shot movies in the old days when there was no CGI. So when we see a movie like this, the product reveals in each and every frames the real vision from the artist and writer's perspective. Every detail, every corner of the screen tells the story.

It was so good as a television show, because of short and sweetness. The filmmaker intended to create the same magic, except the credits its just a below 80 minute movie. Had a good storyline and a couple of new characters were introduced. Because the new adventure extended its area volume and so the antagonist was needed. Shaun and his buddies set foot outside their barn to find their lost farmer. The journey begins towards the big city and the movie discloses their risky and dangerous undertaking. They go pass lots of stages to accomplish their quest and only the last quarter reveals result with a thrilling chase scene.

Unlike the series, it was not completely a fun movie. There are some emotions involved, and I was amazed by those exhibitions. Because of some kind of childhood connection between Shaun and Co and their owner. That was unexpected, but was really very nice to see the other side of them. We know Shaun is a curious character, he always wants to learn and try new things. So when he has to make an unexpected decision, it does not go as planned and the fun begins with their mischievous adventure in an unfamiliar territory.

As usual without the dialogues, that can be understandable by everyone without a language barrier. A true family movie, from grandparents to grandchildren together watchable flick. Almost a masterpiece, offers a lot of great moments to give ourselves to it. And for the fans its a celebration time for sure. Definitely this movie would get into the final shortlist for the upcoming (2016) Oscars, if not, that would be a shame for the entire ceremony. But for winning, we have to wait till how good 'The Good Dinosaur' going to be. In the meantime, don't miss this little cute flick.

8½/10 || I was never really into Shaun the Sheep when I was kid and I also didn't enjoy this movie as much as I would if I was. I probably had the same problem with this film as I had with Minions. It isn't bad idea but it's too much minutes for too little words.

Shaun the Sheep is great idea but much more enjoyable when it's in seven minutes instead of 85. I think that story had too slow tempo for how long it was and I also felt like I already saw it because the story wasn't really original when it comes to it and also gags in this movie weren't really that funny. I think that even 5-years-old are already full of this same kind of jokes.
I personally enjoyed ""emotional part"" of this movie more, than I enjoyed the ""funny part"".

On the other hand I really loved animation and soundtrack of this film which was truly briliant and one of the factors why I had energy to finish this movie because without it I wouldn't do that and for me, the last 15 minutes of this movie was the best part. 
The idea was great but they should have worked on it more. || 'Shaun the Sheep Movie' is the spin-off feature film of a spin-off television series of 'Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers'. Boasting the same crew that brought us 'Chicken Run' and 'Wallace and Gromit', it promised a lot.

The film is made by the Aardman production company and so boasts a pleasant stop-start animation style. This ""old-school"" way of creating a cartoon is refreshing in the modern world of overused computer imagery and 3D effects.

There is no dialogue whatsoever in this film and so it feels like watching an old cartoon such as 'Tom and Jerry'. There are subtle nods to other television shows and films such as 'Breaking Bad', 'Hannibal' and 'Taxi Driver' so the parents are kept amused at times.

The story is very easy to follow due to the characters very expressive faces and directions which, being a children's film, make it a lot more simple and universal.

Overall, 'Shaun the Sheep Movie' is a good film for children. It has very cute characters and the animation is very fun. However, it doesn't have much for any other demographic unlike the company's previous work. But, saying that, it is an inoffensive and enjoyable film.

I had a feeling that I know this story from somewhere else like a deja-vu, but more than that I felt it should have been a ninja story than the knight's. So when I checked the crew list and I found the Japanese director who made 'Goemon'. That's not at all, it was indeed a version of the Japanese classical hit 'The Loyal 47 Ronin'. Honestly, I haven't seen that, but have seen the other versions like the Keanu Reeve's recent '47 Ronon' et cetera.

It was the story of a group of knights led by Raiden played by Clive Owen. After their master was tricked to death by a corrupted minister in the court of law, everyone thinks the knights would avenge for it. But that does not happen and as the years pass, slowly the hope fades away. And then comes a twist with some good action sequences before the end credits roll up.

It was a great story, but the transforming it from a ninja tale to a knight's did not give that solid revenge seeking effect. Because the ninja fights are kind of stylish, because the stunt choreography and costumes for ninjas has changed in the present scenario. Whereas the knight's remained same for the decades, that means it was a very normal like a medieval European sword fight. So you can call it a realistic, yet there's a filmy thing which lacks in it.

That's fine because the entire film was almost a slow drama. So don't assume it is a complete action film. In that perspective, it will definitely disappoint a few viewers, but I think it is still worth giving a try. The cast and the production were awesome, but still there's something is holding back it to the B movies list than an A. And finally, seeing the way it ended, I think there will be another film to follow.

Based on the true story of an elderly woman, Maria Atman, who attempt to reclaim her aunt's portrait from the museum of her birthplace. Now she's an old and American citizen, but after her sister's death the possibilities favours her when she meets a young lawyer. So these two sets a journey on one focus, that is to reunite with the family's art. How? That's the story of this beautiful movie to tell.

Well, the story was a very good one as inspired by the real, but looks a so simple drama as a film, even the twist and turns. Only if it would have been a better narration, at least in a few important portions, the awards would have been poured on it rather just praises. Anyhow Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds combo were excellent, but individually she ruled and he was a low key performance. Though the overall movie wins with the inspiring characters than the narration.

The two different timeline stories edited into one random presentation. One is the past events and the other is the present that reveals simultaneously Maria's struggles. Really, it was better than I thought, one of the best drama with the backdrop of the world war 2. Everyone can't enjoy this flick, but certainly I feel I want to recommend it all.

Filtering out those parts this is a quite enjoyable, visually very entertaining, family movie. If you have strong opinions about certain things then you might want to be with your kids when watching this one. Personally I consider my oldest son to be quite capable of making his own opinions and as for the two younger kinds I try to point out the pro’s and con’s and let them grow up to make their own mistakes.

Having that out of the way this is a visually quite wonderful movie. it is of course quite CGI enhanced but in a good way. It is a Disney movie after all so you would expect, at least I did, some “artistic freedom” as far as the scenery is concerned.

The story is actually a quite lovely “fairy tale” kind of story about a “wonderland” far far away. Initially it is a wee bit difficult to get a grip of what is happening since it all moves about all over the place a bit. If you can overcome that first disorientation it does indeed get somewhat sensible after a while. Having said that I mean “sensible” in the context of not only a wild and whacky science fiction movie but in the context of a wild and wacky science fiction movie aimed at the younger part of the audience. Despite the scientific blurb thrown around in the last half of the movie do not for a minute believe that any of the script writers have more scientific knowledge than the average Hollywood script writer which is…zero.

To me the enjoyment of this movie came from the childish fantasy style (it does have quite a bit of a fairly tale story over it), from the rather enjoyable cinematic effects, quite a bit of cool action and last but not least … George Clooney. Actually that is not entirely fair. George was part of it but what I really liked was the recruiting android all the way from the start. When Clooney entered the scene both him and the android pretty much stole the scene. I am afraid that the Newton girl, for a lot of the time, felt more like a “plot element” than a main character to me.

I have to say that I quite liked the scenes in Paris as well. Sorry guys but I do live in France after all. The Eiffel Tower scenes where quite enjoyable and I do like the touch where they used Mr. Eiffel’s apartment at the top of the tower as a scenery. Actually I am not sure how many people actually know that there is an apartment (now a museum) up there. The stuff about a hidden room and a hidden [naah, that would be a spoiler] beneath the tower is of course truly nonsensical.

So, bottom line, if Disney would not have gone down the line of trying to make a political statement, and I do not care what that statement was except that it was blunt, obvious and unconcealed, then this movie would have gotten another star or two. I cannot justify giving it much lower than what I did since it was, technically speaking, a quite good and entertaining movie. However, movies for children is not the medium to make a statement unless you believe that you are living in a socialist state a ‘la the Soviet Union. || Wish it was greater, but for what it is it's still enjoyable.

<em>'Tomorrowland'</em> is an intriguing futuristic film, it doesn't really delve as deep into its potential-filled premise as it should but it scratches the surface and it makes for - just about - solid viewing. The special effects are very nice, also.

As for the casting, I guess it could've been better. However, I did like the main quartet of Britt Robertson (Casey), George Clooney (Frank), Raffey Cassidy (Athena) and Hugh Laurie (David) - the latter has a good rant late on. I rate the way the story is told, mostly in retrospective by Robertson and Clooney - it keeps it interesting.

I just feel more should've been done with this, given it's fairly entertaining even in its current state and has a load of potential. Either way, I did narrowly like it. || A mega-grumpy George Cluney is always worth watching. A nice upbeat ""We can change our own future for the better"" movie. It's bright, colourful and inoffensive."

One of the worst week for me as most of the of films I've seen were not up to any good. Okay, fine, the first part was decent. I thought a little refresher, somewhat funny too, so on such scenario, anticipating a sequel is common, but this is not what I wanted. After seeing this, I come to realise that the sequel was a bad idea. Seems funny, but no impact. In fact a little boring to see the same old comedy tricks again. Especially mocking a fat man is too offensive at the present era. So the hashtag on body shaming would go viral on social media.

They did not get a decent story. Even the film characters, including the villains were too old fashioned. Even this film had made in the 90s, might have not received well too. The concept of going vacation-come-convention, we had seen this before, are not we! Yeah, Paul after his short marriage and losing mother, he and his daughter heads to Las Vegas. Being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. His plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.

I felt for a character like Paul Blart, casting Raini Rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. Yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. Its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. This kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why Rowan Atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. But now it's certain that there won't be a third. If you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. Instead, I would suggest you to re-watch the original. That ain't a masterpiece, though a much better one.

_3/10_ || I like Kevin James. I watched every episode of ""The King of Queens,"" and his special ""Kevin James: Sweat the Small Stuff"" is one of my favorite stand-up comedy concerts of all-time. He's a big guy with a flawless delivery, and he can be very funny. He can also be very unfunny.  Paul Blart (Kevin James) is a mall cop living in New Jersey with his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez). His wife (Jayma Mays, with a few seconds of screen time) from the first film has left him after six days of marriage, and his mother (Shirley Knight, also with a few seconds of screen time) is killed by a milk truck, so he is feeling pretty low. Maya has been accepted to UCLA, and finds out on the same day that Paul is invited to a security officer convention at the Wynn Resort in Las Vegas. He is still basking in the glory of his exploits in the first film, and he and Maya head west. Maya is smitten right away with resort employee Lane (David Henrie, given nothing to do), and Paul deals with a supporting cast of freakish security officers from around the country, as well as a team of art thieves led by Sofel (Neal McDonough, slumming and wasted). This sets up a long, dry series of pratfalls and lame action sequences as Paul battles the baddies after Maya and Lane are kidnapped.

As they did in the first film, James co-wrote the screenplay with comedian Nick Bakay, so the laughs should be here. It's weird that James doesn't seem to have a handle on his own creation. Is Paul a stupid oaf, or a genius detective trying to break out of his boring job? Here, we get both characteristics. His arrival in Vegas and dealings with the casino staff is supposed to be fish-out-of-water funny, but fall flat because James plays Paul as a sociopathic jerk. I could not stand this guy. The only scenes I smiled at were when hotel manager Divina (Daniella Alonso) kept finding herself attracted to Paul, and even that running gag didn't get going until after their first awkward encounter; and Muhrtelle (Bob Clendenin), the casino employee with the banana. The film is rated (PG) and family friendly, so the violence here are guns with silencers that never hit their target, and Paul falling down a lot. A supporting roster of familiar faces and character actors- look at that cast list!- stand around and watch Paul fall down a lot. Paul falling down a lot isn't that funny. The Wynn Resort is nice to look at and makes for a great action film setting, but this is not that action film. I don't see another ""Paul Blart"" film on the horizon, this one did poorly at the box office, but since it was released six years after the mediocre first film, you never know."

I don't know the history of golf because I'm not a regular follower of the game other than knowing a few names from this generation. So Severiano Ballesteros is an unheard name to me until I saw this beautiful film. I'm glad I saw it for the many reasons like that.

All the films are not for just entertainment, some are the great historical account that makes it reach in a wider distance like this one. Every sports produced its own legends, and so this film is focused on golf. One of the best sport-drama I have ever seen and an important film based on the golf, specially dedicated to Seve fans.

An English-Spanish language film produced with the collaboration of Britain-Spain. It sets in a small coastal town of the northern Spain in the year 1967 where the 10 year old Seve introduced to us. Being born in a hardworking farmer family and after losing interest in the studies, how he develops a passion towards the golf is what the film portraits. At the young age he begins to think of the game of all the time and it becomes his life. With the support from his family and trained himself in the harsh conditions make him turn into one of the gifted golfer in the history.

This is one of the strangest screen presentations I have seen. It is nothing visual spectacular, or if you expect it to be a film that recreates his whole life, then you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a mix of the feature film as well as the documentary. His childhood days before he becomes a pro was awesomely cinematised and the rest was the archive footages from all the tournament he had competed.

> ""The one with biggest heart will win.""

That's the part anybody must not miss it because some of the greatest shots he ever played and when he teed off a bad shot, how he came back to the game was so inspiring. His spellbinding techniques and as a humble human being, anyone who does not know would to begin to like him like I did. The blend in narration between the real videos and actors performed were amazing. A perfect screen exhibition for a great sporting personality.

Coming from an economically poor family did not stop him to pursue his dream. Everyone goes through a struggle while chasing such dream, and so Seve did despite very talented. It was a long journey that covered most of his life. With the interview clippings attached to it, lets us know his many unknown qualities of his family, friends, former teammates and opponents recalling their memories. Including some of his old interviews where he reveals how much he loved the game.

It was not your usual biographical-sport film, but surely a must see. Very cleverly written screenplay and obviously wonderful editing. Especially if you're a Severiano Ballesteros' fan, you'll definitely love to see him in the film. This is how you showcase a legend on the screen if making money from the product is not an agenda, but letting the world who is Severiano Ballesteros.

Actually, it was directed by a documentary filmmaker, so he excelled it. But the sad part is the film did not reach a wider audience or even the golf fans as it should have been. Mainly because the film did not see the worldwide release, but it is available in the digital format. So I hope my review made you a curious about it and I once gain hope you would recommend it to your friends.

Very close to being a French version of the 2003 movie 'Thirteen'. About two 17-year-old girls, Charlie, a privacy girl with the asthma and the new arrival, Sarah, a sarky with the mystery background. A fresh friendship bloom unexpectedly between them, they begin to share everything. As fast they become close, the each others secret reveals, with the same speed a series of conflict forces them away with hatreds. Once again a movie based on the novel of the same name. Melanie Laurent's 2nd movie from the director's chair and she outclassed it.

Intense drama, from the beginning to the end. The story concentrates only these two girls, their first meet, relationship development and the story's conclusion. Very rarely other characters come into the frame with little to deliver speech and exhibit the act. The first half of the film exactly like the first half of the 'Heavenly Creatures'. Closely showcases the two girl's establishments of an unbreakable bond who do lots of mischievous stuffs together. And the second half was like the second half of 'Thirteen'. The fierce battle like environment like the usual catfight, but fairly avoids the overdose which makes a worthy whole.

> With you, I feel bad. I lie, I am hard.
> You make me play the bad guy. It's unbearable. 

What makes a two best friends (girls) hate each other, a boy? That's how the story switched from one way to another, a turning point in the storytelling. But this film was not all about fighting for a boy, there's something else which was the backbone to the narration. Weaknesses becomes a pointed gun to the face to deal with. The circle of to be victimized and be a victim was relatively balanced. The incomprehensible teen emotions take the story with the sequences of blames and absolves.

What I don't get is in the most of the movies is at the end why the film character sees the camera. This doubt is because the whole film explains something, but that final frame gives a different dimensional meaning. Maybe the indication of reform, like that happens in the coming-of-age movies either good way or bad. So, according to this movie... Sorry, you have watch to know it.

Impressive display by the lead two girls. Music, locations, everything was fine and holds the story till the last minute with same the intensity, then all the sudden releases it with a shocking twist. It was so quick and unexpected at that moment. So there's where I was disappointed a bit. The end should have been a more suitable one than preferable for a strong finish. But no complaints for the rest, a good teen drama which presents the evolution of love and trust to hate and disgust between two characters.

I watched it specially for Scott Eastwood. I did not like his performances in the previous films I had seen, so expected this one to change my perspective and I'm truly happy with it. If you are a romance novel and film fan, then you probably would have heard the name Nicholas Sparks. I haven't read his books, but I surely love almost all the films based on his material. So expected this film to be another romance masterpiece, but it was not, not entirely.

Yep, it is not a great film, but still a beautiful and enjoyable film. The cast was good, especially I love anything with Britt Roberson. The film had dual layer narration, one being set during the 40s onwards and the other was the present time tale. Both of them were about the young romance and their fight to overcome various issues surrounded their relationship. Kind of original and that's the best quality of this film.

I think the director did his best who's known for some fine works. The film should have been a lot better, only if it was a bit emotionalised, which is very essential for a theme like this. I thought the final scene was cliche, but after waiting for a few more seconds, I relieved for changing its course in the final minute to conclude decently. The drawback was the length of the narration and the overall slow pace, other than that mostly you won't end up disappointed with this. Recommended!

First of all, the director proved the script is very important to a film's success. He wrote it, basically he's a screenplay writer who had written many great stuffs and this film is his first directional venture. He excelled it by picking the right stuffs for the project. As the great actors on-board, it was shot in the fine locations and the music was wonderful. It should have been a dream coming true for him, for a great project to work with.

The dialogues were so brilliant like the poems. I'm sure you won't end watching it without having fun because there were many small-small jokes attached everywhere. It was inspired by the real story of a person, but I think they have made some changes for a cinematic translation, hence it is not a biopic.

Mainly it revolves around 4-5 characters and the cast were amazing in their respective roles. Especially the Al Pacino, without him this film would have not been this much exciting. If you're an his ardent fan, you will going love this from your heart and others as well find it a beautiful drama-music. He was nominated for Golden Globe Awards for his excellent title role display. A very appropriate film for him for his age.

You know in this era, film fans are looking for what superhero film is going to hit the screen, a heartwarming film like this is what makes them realise still there's a hope for small scale films. Only if they're a welcoming type. Especially for the yesteryears actor who are physically can't compete with the young generation actors, films like this is a breather.

This is a tale of an aging star singer who one day discovers a letter written for him by an another great singer of his generation when he was yet to taste the success. 40 years later, that mean now he decides to quit his music tour and begin to trace his family for the unfinished business. So the remaining narration reveals lots of inspiring and heartbreaking events. 

> ""If I am going to find any kind of redemption, I can't waste any more time.""

Life as a singer, especially being old and seeking redemption won't quite end as expected. Over the 40 years of addiction to drugs, booze and women, a self-discovery sail begins. In an unpredictable world, anything might happen and so this man's journey tells the impact on the family he's going to meet. It is not just about facing the one who he had abandoned long ago and now trying to fix it, but in reality, life is not easy, especially family means lots of commitment and choosing the best for it should be priority where this film opts that root to reveal a story.

It is almost a good family film, but for the theme the drug parts were essential, so that changed its rating. The sub-plots like how he tries to win a date add more on the romance side of the tale. Kind of predictable because of the heartwarming drama, but differences were made from the twists in the narration. Not of that breathtaking kind, just developed to have a fresh aspect an the well known theme. Especially the ending was so simple yet very cool.

As usual Bobby Cannavale was in a supporting role, but it was kind of different. He shined like a star, he appeared in a well noticeable character than ever. Along with Jennifer Garner, his performance in the film covered an important portion. So it is not just Al Pacino, these guys as well deserves to be appreciated for their contribution. A film that kind of resembles the recent 'Ricki and the Flash', except it was a male version. A product like this hard to come by, so consider to check it out. That means I'm recommending it.

A mix of ""Stuck on an island"", ""Secret Reality Show"", and ""Disfunctional Family"" tropes, it really is just a lot of ""let's mess with this family"" for most of the movie.  They stray away from the traditional use of family values to exploit the infighting to a point where they act like they're thinking about eating one another.

It's fun, but I can't imagine anyone who doesn't have history with this family are going to enjoy the movie."

I like to appreciate the technical team, especially the Art Director and his team for creating the world the movie is in. It was believable and realistic and as a viewer I could be there with the characters. They succeeded in setting the mood. 

I like to point out the fact that it's really hard to make an action movie with believable action scenes. This movie did that very well. Even  with the female lead they did pretty good job.

Another excellent Simon Pegg movie. This is his fourth movie I'm seeing inside a month and I enjoyed them all, especially 'Hector and Search for Happiness' was my favourite. This was a romantic-comedy that takes place in just one evening. A story about blind dating, boy meets girl, they spend a quality time by sharing the details and later turn against each other. So a recycled old theme that was very well crafted.

If you see the poster what does the tagline says, well, that's what I was looking for. I had 'Date Night' in my mind, and thought it might be an altered British version. Other than that I was truly not expecting anything special, but a normal comedy, maybe sloppy. And it does only until a certain stage of the story, but 30 minutes later it overturns. So the best narration briskly took a slide towards joyous ride in the remaining 1 hour.

I think, for right now Simon Pegg is my favourite British actor and you know the reason that I stated in the first paragraph. Lake Bell, who donned in a director's hat in her recent feature was so good on a 34 year-old role she played in this film. Together they were so perfect, one of the best on-screen couple with a wonderful chemistry. It was a story of two middle aged odd guys whose lives were shattered for some reasons. They meet accidentally and bond well. Once the truth got out, they repel away, but they both have something in common and that puts them on a test once they decide to correct the mistakes they have made.

> ""After this shot I will stronger,
> wiser and finally moving on.""

At some stage in the life every person will going to be in their 30s and 40s (and some were had been there) like the couple from this film. The life won't be the same for everybody like that shown here, but can be understood, because that's the experience that define it. Despite romance crisis about the middle-aged guys, many dialogues were excellently written and funny as well.  A couple of lines really made me worry and I can't just ignore by saying it was just a flick.

Kind of easy to begin a story, like we're standing in an open ground and decide to move any direction we want in our 360º angle. But development is the key factor in the movie making and this film outshines. The real challenge was how to end it and once again it was a beautiful conclusion, even though I knew it was so cliché for a romantic-comedy.

Overally looked a fairy-tale like theme, which irresistible if you love touching romantic stories. Definitely a good movie from the director of 'The Inbetweeners' and I'm going to recommend it for those who also liked the similar movies below I mentioned. But remember it's only cinematically amusing than being realistic.

7½/10 || This was okay overall. The leads seemed like an unlikely pair at the outset but they started to connect and feel more like a potential couple. The film seemed to contain scenes from the largely forgotten era of gross-out movies, the dialogue ay least, with too many blow job jokes and references. Once or twice and you might get a smile out of me, but after that it just gets tiresome. That and normalizing a guy who is a stalker and an all around perv. The story was a little too nice to him in the end.

But there was enough humor, wit and charm to keep me watching. I recognized a couple of the performers but wasn’t sure from where. Upon looking them up I found they had both been in Jane Austen-based movies over 20 years ago. One of the pleasures of watching British films and tv and seeing familiar faces reappearing. 

So even though I stuck with it, I probably won’t watch this again. There are just too many really good rom-coms out there."

This is actually a good film that misled by its low rating. But the end should have been really better, other than that the rest of the film was enjoyable. Another small scale movie and another excellent performance by Kristen Wiig. The story of a single woman with the borderline personality disorder. After winning the $80 million through the lottery draw, she decides to own a television show to talk about her personal life.

This is a unique story, not like that you see it often in the movies. Apart from Wiig, the rest of the supporting cast was not bad, but very sad to see such a good looking wonderful actress like Linda Cardellin in a small role. If you hate slow pace, this movie might be an average to you, but others who won't mind will find it better. What I surprised to know is that most of the film critics thumb upped for it than the film goers.

It's CGI destruction time as Dwayne Johnson battles earthquakes and a tsunami to go rescue his daughter - with estranged wife in tow of course.

Disaster films are easy to kick because very rarely they are nothing more than candy carnage with a trite screenplay and cheese laden dialogue. Such is the case with San Andreas. In essence this is a remake of Roland Emmerich's 2012, only this is the shorter version with the time span that 2012 should have had. This does exactly what the marketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and wallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the final third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the noise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense is absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while there are no worthwhile surprises in store. But on the plus side Johnson is a likable guy and he carries us through till the end of what is a fun movie if expectation levels are appropriately set at dumb popcorn fodder. 6/10 || I have never been a fan of the Disaster genre, I don't seem to be able to take much more away from it than visual noise. I was hoping that the combined might of Alexandra Daddario and The Rock would be enough to turn me around on _San Andreas_, alas, it was not to be.

This is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.

The money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.

The other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.

6/10 || I know, I know, this movie is rather superficial and simple. More effort has been spent on cool action than on depth of the story. Well, you know what? I do not care! I quite liked this movie. Agent 47 is cool and kicks ass. The bad guys gets plenty of ass whooping. The action is good. There is quite a lot of high tech and gadgets. What is there not to like?

The movie starts of with a quite cool sequence introducing Agent 47. I have to say that I got into quite a bit of “wow” mode right a way there. The movie continues with plenty of action sequences with just a wee bit of slowdown in between. Actually the first-half, at least, of the movie is pretty much one long chase.

Perhaps I should point out that I have not played Hitman and do not really know what the original story is about. From a lot of the comments I have read it appears That this might be to my advantage when it comes to enjoying the movie.

Some people are probably complaining about bad acting since Agent 47 do not really show much in terms of facial expressions or emotions. Well, news for you, he is not supposed to! He is supposed to be a cold emotionless killing machine so stop whining. Personally I found Agent 47 to be an excellent character. the re is on scene in particular that I liked where Agent 47 intentionally allows himself to be caught in a embassy. Once inside he, to no one in the audience surprise starts to tear the place apart. You have to see it to know what I mean.

The second part, or perhaps just the last third, of the movie turns into more of a search and destroy for Agent 47 and his new “partner”. this part is of course as action filled as the first part of the movie. Naturally it all leads to a big show down between the Agent 47 & Co. The end itself did not really deliver any surprises but was satisfying.

The one thing in the movie that annoyed me was this subdermal armor stuff. The idea was not a too bad one but they really overplayed it. Come on! Just shoot him in the head or an eye or some other “sensitive” part for Christ sake. Bulletproof my arse!

I honestly do not understand the low rating this movie has received. 5.7 at IMDb is really a bit harsh. Rotten Tomatoes rating is, not very surprisingly, abysmal. Rotten Tomatoes and their “critics” ratings must be the worst of any ratings site. When these dickwads rate down a movie, that’s when I start to get interested. First step is to drill down into the real audience ratings which more often that not gives a different picture.

Any way I digress. Bottom line is that, for me, this is a simple, straightforward, high octane action movie and I quite enjoyed it. || **This movie makes the 2007 Hitman movie look like a freaking masterpiece**. The source material is thrown completely out of the window. The story is now about super-powered Terminator-like assassins and some woman trying to find her father. The methodical stealth game is turned into a brainless action movie with no originality or stakes. Fans of action movies are going to fall asleep. Fans of the game are going to hate it. **Just watch the 2007 Hitman**. It is a bit more respectful of the source material, it's more fun and it's even somewhat smart in places."

This is so underrated. I mean it is not a great film, but surely does not deserve bashing. One of the rarest appearance on the screen for Meryl Streep. Totally transformed into a rock star and coming together with her real life daughter was another highlight. Impressive performances by others too. The Music was good with a combination of bit emotions and comedy.

It was the story of an aging rock star who failed to reach the heights. She once gave up on her family over the passion of music and now she returns after receiving a call that her daughter is in a trouble. So the tale focus on her struggling life, as well as because of her past she won't get a warm welcome. It's time to fix everything and as the years pass what changes brings is the remaining narration.

This is life. People are motivated to chase their dreams no matter whatever stands between them. This was a similar theme where a woman goes after what she wanted to be, but her family comes in between. And you know the success is not for everyone, so in that situation, how a person reacts to all the miscalculations in her life is what this film is about. It was actually a well told story, but the critics did not like it and given some lame excuses. To me it was a decent film, definitely not the worst, so all I'm saying is you should try it if you like music.

Whoa! Why I did not see it before! Seems I totally underestimated it. Lots of good films were released in the 2015 and this is surely one of them.

Awesome performances. I liked every one of them. Sean William was top of it. Olivia Thirby was cute as usual. I had some good laughs, a few of them were loud ones. I could not believe it was made by Coutney Cox. She did a fine job. It was screenplay she has got, but I hope she will be doing more such heartwarming drama films.

The first thing I noticed was after seeing the movie is there's some kind of mistake in the Oscars nominee. Rooney Mara should have been on the lead role list, while Cate Blanchett in the supporting character's. Maybe the Academy people misunderstood that the title role must be the lead character. Theirs switched place actually does not make any sense. Anyway the Oscars never made sense at all.

This story was okay, but adapted screenplay and direction, especially the music was excellent. For the ending scene alone, you will be tempted to raise your rating than what you initially thought it deserves. I was not expecting the movie to be awesome, so I'm not upset for the overall movie.

Believe me, the last thing I want in this movie is to see Cate Blanchett in naked. Maybe out of respect or her age or she's not attracted to me, there are plenty of reasons that I can't figure it out which one, but after knowing what this theme is, I was only praying for that not to happen. And obviously that is unavoidable, otherwise the movie will lose its soul and strength.

Well, it was better than I thought, both the actresses were good, but Rooney Mara dominated. Whatever category she's in for the Oscars, I'll be happy if she wins. It is not a must watch, but a decent movie and betters in some parts.

7/10 || 'Carol' is beautifully shot and very maturely made. The acting was very class all around the film. The whole thing seemed like it was taken from the 40s. I loved how fine it all looked and felt and it deserved a lot more awards than it got.

★★★★ || ""Therese"" (Rooney Mara) is pretty unfulfilled, clerking in a department store that's frequented by the far more interesting ""Carol"" (Cate Blanchett). Their first meeting ignites a spark, and that spark quite quickly takes over both of their lives as the story unfolds and there develops an inter-dependency between the women. The latter is married to the wealthy ""Harge"" (Kyle Chandler) but it's an hollow arrangement that is coming to an end in the divorce court - their daughter together proving to be quite an important pawn in those proceedings. ""Therese"" has a long-term boyfriend ""Richard"" (Jake Lacy) who wants to settle down and get married - so both have much to lose as their relationship becomes more important and intimate. ""Harge"" has shrewdly inserted a morality clause into their proposed shared custody arrangement and is none too shy of resorting to some fairly underhand methods of tracking his wife's activities to prove that she isn't fit to have any access at all to their child. We also have to consider the closeness of the friendship between ""Carol"" and her best friend ""Abby"" (Sarah Paulson) and by mid way through the internecine complexities of their lives they risk leaving everyone with nothing. It's a romance, this, but largely devoid of sentimentality. A love story that is more visceral in nature, where one love is essentially climbing on top of another for supremacy over the heart and the head! It's Mara who does most of the heavy lifting, her character seems the more plausibly conflicted; but Blanchett delivers well as the desperate mother increasingly hemmed in by circumstance little of her making. The film looks great, the production design and Carter Burwell's period score adding a richness to a theme that offers us some intricate characters and scenarios that are anything but straightforward. It's maybe just a little too dialogue heavy - there's a lot of verbiage - but that's incidental. It's still a classy piece of cinema."

From the director of the Oscars nominated movie 'Dogtooth'. If you are familiar with his signature movie, you will find it so good. This is not the best movie I had seen that set in the future, but like any other it was another dystopian tale. A black comedy-romance with a decent storyline, performances and overall a nice entertainer.

The pace was very depressing, but I kept hooked to it for its frequent unpredictable scenes. The first act took place in a hotel which is the introduction to the odd world and the situation where the plot opens. When it moved to the 2nd half, especially after Rachel Weisz come into the frame, the entire scenario changed to atypical romance mode and kept that way till the last with a simple twist in the finale.

Colin Ferrell's character was something like the one from the movie 'Her'. But not the same movie, or the theme, except the combination of the genres. It was a good movie, I enjoyed it, but not as much as others say they did. IMPO, it is a one time watch movie for its peculiarness.

7/10 || This was an odd experience, as I just recently ended a self-imposed 12-year moratorium on relationships, due to a couple of bad ones I had within a short period of time in the early 2000's. It was very intriguing to see a type of dystopia exist in which 'singledom' was so vilified to the point of actually being against the law. I would never have previously thought that such a state of events was possible, but recent trends in 'political correctedness' on the one hand and both religious and political radicalism on the other means that, sadly, nothing is impossible anymore. I thought it was a remarkable idea for a film, and both the soundtrack and cinematography were outstanding. The bizarre script and bold direction brought forth some of the best acting I have yet seen from Colin Ferrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly, as well.

I'm definitely looking forward to seeing other films by this brazenly original writer/director. Long may his almost-Bunuelian take on things go forth. || This was Yorgos Lanthimos' English language debut. It was really funny. All of the actors had to perform their lines straight-faced and with no emotion which is very strange at first.

The screenplay and direction of the film was very intelligent and perfectly highlights the themes of the film. This film was very quirky and unique and so I really enjoyed it.

The zombie apocalyptic drama that centres around a father-daughter relationship. When the daughter is infected by the necroa virus which turns humans into the cannibalistic, the loving father stands by her side, but how long is the remaining film.

One of the blacklisted screenplay and a low budget film that surprised me for having Arnie on-board. Chloe Grace Moretz was supposed to play the title character, would have been definitely a perfect fit. Because I've seen her excellence in the 'Carrie' remake, anyway her replace Abigail Breslin did perform well.

I had seen many movies of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but as I remember this is the first time seen him in a casual, realistic and emotional outfit. Maybe his age is restricting him from taking up the tough roles to play as what he was known for, but still I'm happy that he's doing movies that fits him right now.

For the one reason it is called a horror and you know why, but it was not horrifying. A slow paced simplest zombie movie. Enjoyable film for the sake of the cast, yet forgettable and move on kind of flick.

I don't mind whatever the others thought of the movie, but I enjoyed it, I got entertained well. It was not the low ratings or the bad reviews, I believed in the director, mainly because of her previous film 'The Guilt Trip' that I heartily loved. In fact, it was a short movie and I surprised how nice it was.

It was the same old story, an honest cop is framed into a shootout disaster during the witness protection program. She must bring all the strength and courage to fight back to clear her name. So the story is actually a road trip and all the actions are in the form of humour.

It was a good one for me, at least it should be a decent one as a collection of the everyone's thought, but leaning too much on the bad side that it won't deserve. Its very very sad a cute little movie like this and 'Tammy' are thrashed badly. Don't expect it to be the year's best, just watch it for the entertainment, or the time pass which might bring a better result.

The dialogues were fun, some scenes were good and I felt some were overused. The last year (2014) was one of the best years for Reese Witherspoon. Both the film of hers 'The Good Lie' and 'Wild' are the career's best ones. With this she's back to the commercial films. It might not be a great as those, but satisfies at least for the first time view.

A western movie set in the 1870 United States, but entirely shot in the New Zealand. The story of a 16 year old boy, Jay, from Scotland embarks a journey in the New World in search of his love, Rose. Later a bounty hunter joins him and makes sure his safe travel. Technically, it was a road movie, but reveals the plot from the other angles as well in the spare times like during camping at the nights.

The narration was too slow and the story was ordinary, but it was enough for me to get engaged. If you wait until the final scene, especially till you figure out the puzzle of the romance theme, you may like it better. The end was so good, just like what a western movie fan looking for, a gunfight. Interestingly, that was not to be heroic, except all the earlier disasters pushed for the finale and the post finale. It is rated R, because it is so brutal in some way and for being faithful to the genre.

It might not be a dream debut for the director like the big cast, the high budget and a great commercial success, but giving a satisfying movie in a simple way was his accomplishment in his first attempt. Kodi Smith-McPhee is almost 20 and he's yet to play his independent and powerful enough character that will bring acknowledgement. It was a close one, the narration started like it was his, and he was everywhere in the movie. Then going further, especially when it nears the end, he was kind of fading. But he was awesome, along with Michael Fassbender. Not a must see, as well as not refusable if you get a chance to see it.

7.5/10 || One's a falling angel - the other one's a rising devil.

Slow West is written and directed by John Maclean. It stars Kodi Smit-McPhee, Michael Fassbender, Ben Mendelsohn, Caren Pistorius and Rory McCann. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Robbie Ryan.

It's the late 1800s and a teenage Scottish aristocrat travels to the American West to track down the girl he loves with all his heart...

There has been a number of modern day directors who have not only refused to let the Western genre die, but also to not be afraid to take it to a harshness of the West level. They have chosen to strip it back to a sense of realism, with no frills and bunting, just a show of tough times populated by tough people and people tough out of luck. Slow West is one such Oater.

For his first full length feature, John Maclean has chosen to make a genre of film he clearly knows something about. It's got some familiar tropes - greenhorn, grizzled bounty hunter, deadly gang et al, but Maclean has still made a fresh picture, one that not only intrigues and excites, but also humours by way of some black comedy inserts.

Essentially it's a travelogue piece, McPhee's lovelorn Jay Cavendish ends up being escorted on his journey by Fassbender's mysterious tough guy Silas Selleck. It's an odd yet engaging pairing, and as they are pursued by Selleck's old gang, and they come across a number of eccentric or devious characters, you may find yourself hoping that all the hidden agendas - the secrets bubbling away in the background - do not shatter the surrogate relationship neither was looking for.

His heart was in the wrong place.

Ah, but yes! Maclean shows gumption to go all mud and blood on our butts, building everything to a quite terrific final quarter of film that has rode in on a black stallion straight from noirville. No printing the legend here, it's a bitter commentary on the romanticised view of the Old West. Western fans keen of ear will pick up on some historically spiky dialogue exchanges, whilst also noting the nods towards the immigration angles, where Maclean doesn't pull punches as to how desperate the Old West was for many of those who travelled hoping for a better life.

Predominantly filmed in New Zealand (superbly standing in for the American West), the panoramic cinematography is stunning, while it's great to see the backdrops are not just mountainous desert scapes, this journey goes through forestry as well. Cast are on prime form, Fassbender seems to be a given these days and it's hoped he will do a Western again, and McPhee plays off of him with genuine conviction. Then there's Mendelsohn, who has to be one of the finest Australian character actors working today, he's perfectly cast here, so his fans know exactly what they will be getting.

The poster art is hugely frustrating, showing Caren Pistorius with a big beaming smile on her face, that is very much a bum steer. You would be wise to take more note of the faces of Messrs McPhee, Fassbender and Mendelsohn on that poster, for their facial portraits are more in keeping with this cracker-jack Western. 9/10"

Maybe a bit visually raped. 

This has such a fucking weak beginning, like what is the relevance to the blonde bimbo being around and literally has no point to the rest of the movie whatsoever. Apart from being one of those cunts who says “Hey, wait a second” as you’re about to leave then instead of giving the burning words, says “never mind.” You never find out, I doubt it was Oscar worthy or chocolate filled coins worthy but still fucking irritating.

Also I did not have any forewarning about the genital mutilation in this movie, well almost. Like if movies are going to do this to me can you PLEASE advertise it better so I can avoid at all costs because it makes me want to die.

OKAY. So freshman lady spots this activist guy and seems that he tickles her fancy as she instantly becomes a fully interested activist and thinks fuck it I’ll go risk my life in the middle of fuck knows where with all of these random people that think I’m a sheltered suburban fool. I mean she’s even on the wrong side of the leader because his girlfriend has clicked on that our lovely freshman wants to suck his dick resulting in her attendance. These people scream out virgin sacrificing cult at all times.

Really brilliant and wise idea taking these rich white kids out to a deprived area, not asking to be noticed in the slightest are we. One even shouts in clear earshot about child abuse seeing a family carting their trike on a bicycle, skills on how to not get killed are just seriously flawless guys. 

Everything is just painfully obvious and this movie relies 90% on gore, which is actually done extremely well. There’s an eye scene and it’s captured perfectly as if you can watch it without looking away or squirming then maybe you should go join that tribe as you clearly belong there. I mean they just fuck off their belongings and go straight into the jungle unarmed, is anyone really shocked when the plane crashes and they end up in a bucket load of shit? Quite literally when one of them also explodes from the anus which was one of many “and the point of this scene is?” moments. I don’t need to see that in my life you trash.

I did like the nice man who looked like a bumble bee and seemed to be the go to guy if you wanted a body part hacked off for supper, he seemed like he could have moonlighted as a MUA. Had his contours down to a tee. Most of them reacted more offended by the poo scene than seeing eachother being led off one by one for torture, again I will say all of the gore scenes were fucking brutal and do give many points for those. 

Some parts are just a bit fucking stupid, one guy actually has a wank after seeing one of them just being like fuck this and slicing her neck open. Really, a wank. I’m all for the activity but there’s a time and a place and that was not where I imagine I would be feeling the moment can take me. They get the tribe stoned as an escape plan, again I’m not feeling the genius in this bunch? Dare I also mention none think to ever remove their luminous yellow suits, would have thought that would have been a pretty logical thing to do during an escape attempt….

I could think of better holidays than being ditched in a jungle and eaten by demonic smurfs. || **Their worst fear came from outside of their protest.**

I have enjoyed the Eli Roth's films, even though in some cases I've rated them lower than average rating it had received. But this is not what I was looking for. This is a terror-horror, not actual horror with supernatural or sci-fi viruses. I've learnt the storyline before the watch, but the film was too violent. Even for most of the grown ups. Usually I won't feel a thing for film tortures, because 'fake' is the word always pops up in my mind whenever I see gore.

Anyway, these days, killings in the films are considered entertainment. There is a separate group of fans who follow this kind of theme. But for me, the cannibalism was the one most disturbed. I have no issue with killings, but cannibalism brings totally uneasy. The story was decent, but intentional. You would guess most of the parts. But this film was not about that, just to make you go off of your seat with discomfortable and it succeeds on that.

It was totally opposite to 'Embrace of the Serpent'. It was inspired by the 80s Italian film with the similar storyline. The film was about fighting for the survival of passengers after their plane got crashed in the Amazon forest who are now hunted by Amazon tribes. There's already a sequel on making titled 'Beyond the Green Inferno'. I don't think so, it is a recommendable film, but some are doing that for fun, and some to challenge their friends. Overall, a decent production, with casting, locations and visuals. But I won't favour it.

_4/10_ || Didn't hate but didn't care for it. Acting was pretty bad save for a few scenes by Lorenza Izzo though these characters' naivety were absolutely annoying. As Eli Roth movies go, probably one of his better movies, and yet I'm only giving it a 3/5."

Jackson, Dove Cameron","Kyle Newman, John D'Arco","high school, assassin, agent","This movie is absolutely ludicrous! The core of the story is simply unbelievable. However, this is movie meant to entertain and I dare say that the target audience is not exactly my age. This is clearly a teenage movie. Well, I guess that there is still a bit of a child in me because I found it rather entertaining even though, with a bit less “Hollywoodish” and more intelligent directing it could have been a lot better.

I would say that this is a quite nice family movie. Well not for the really young of course due to the amount of action. Saying that this is a family movie is probably going to annoy a lot of people in the “bible belt” due to previously mentioned action as well as the fact that there is a bit of partying going on, including consumption of fermented and even distilled beverages on but hey, I am Swedish, when I was a kid, way too long ago, there was not a teenager around that had not tasted HB which is the Swedish term for “Hembränt” or in English home brewed alcohol.

Anyway, unless you are a moral fanatic, there is really not much to be upset about in this movie apart from the laughably ludicrous story. Kids being trained as assassins from young age. Ehh, okay. Could have been half plausible if it was not for the “training” scenes in the beginning of the movie. Toddlers operating machine guns and driving cars like Vin Diesel? Okay, maybe they were just above toddler age but I was laughing so hard it was difficult to judge.

What follows is pretty much without surprises (if you have read the blurb at least). Our heroin goes to school and, deprived of a normal childhood, finds it not so easy as she perhaps imagined. Here is where I feel there are a lot of missed opportunities. Our teenage assassin never really gets to truly impress. Sure, she gets to do a bit of clobbering but it is constantly hidden in a veil of ridicule. With a more intelligent script writer this could have been a really cool part but as it plays itself out it is just “okayishly” funny.

Naturally a few bad guys arrive in order to crash the party and, well, we get a bit more of the same as before just with some more action. The action is not bad, for this kind of movie at least, that has to be said. Unfortunately the way it plays itself out is a wee bit disappointing. It is just unintelligent. The beginning of the movie seemed to hint that these teenagers were trained in all areas, including the grey cells, but certain scenes where just, “I cannot believe that you were that stupid”, and for the record I have a teenage son that made the same remarks!

Nevertheless it was indeed a quite entertaining movie. Far from great but definitely worth watching. || **For some people, living a normal life is a challenge!**

Teen girl's film, but no usual romance-comedy. There are some small clichés, but being it is an action film, those parts looked kind of small. Yeah, nice casting. Hailee was really cool. The 'Descendant' girl Dove was good as well. The rest of cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Alba was fine. It was from the director of 'Fanboys'. It tells the story of a girl trained to be an assassin from a very young age who escapes the centre to live a normal life in the real world. And that's where she struggles to blend in, as well as to overcome from the tailing troubles of the past.

A well entertaining film, if you are not expecting anything big. It got a few great action sequences. Except Sam L. Jack, it is totally a chick film and most probably suitable for everyone for viewing. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I want a sequel for it. Particularly business wise that won't do well as this one was not received well by the film critics. Despite I approve it for a go, the rating wise it is just an average film. Sometimes that's where opinion divides for a film about what we felt watching it and how we're going to rate it later on.

_6/10_ || **You have definitely seen the movie before, just without the spies.**

A typical teenage coming-of-age flick with a new girl navigating the turbulent dangers of the high school social scene, except this time she's a spy. Barely Lethal felt like an old-school Disney channel movie with a slightly bigger budget and better stars. Whether that is good or bad is up to you. There were some funny moments, but it hit almost every cliché to the point I was guessing most of the dialogue before they even said it. While it didn't bring anything new, it was still a decent, enjoyable film. Some of the acting was good. Some was overtly cheesy. I always enjoy Samuel Jackson as a cranky mentor-type character. Ultimately, I didn't hate it and didn't love it."

Is this based on any famous book? The answer is simply no. Purely a cinematic work written and directed by a first timer. One of the very unique storyline and one of the beautiful indie films of the 2015 that needs wider recognition. The first thing anyone who decides to watch this must keep their mind open, because the majority would think it is an atheist propaganda. But I say it looks in whatever way you see it.

Quite similar to the British film 'The 7.39'. Both are completely different from each other, except that timeline where most of the story happens as it is denoted in their titles. Yes, 5 to 7 is the time in the dusk hours where two people meet. It all begins when a young writer Brian in his early twenties meets a woman called Arielle in her early thirties on a roadside and instantly they become friends. Like it's their destiny to meet, they found each other.

After the initial stumble, they decide to meet every day at the same time. Their new relationship is not based on the thousands of years of the human civilization, but beyond that with the mutuals understanding. When the rules have broken, the cracks begin to appear and it all ends after a series of turns in the tale. Predictable conclusion, but very much suitable and highly standard.

> ""Life is a collection of moments.
> The idea is to have as many good ones as you can.""

Like most of the movies this one opened with a background narration about the situation of the man of the movie. Like how it all began, then in the first 15 minutes itself, there are many tiny twists on the line of development of the story carried on and introduces a few other characters along. But keeps the tidiness on one relationship throughout the movie and explores only a certain kind of atmosphere to focus everything on a single line.

If you don't believe in religion means not this is a celebratable movie for you or anyone who are like you. The contents were very sensitive, even for the atheists. It was a lot like the hippie culture, but only on the matter of the relationship, especially 'One life-One wife' angle. In some angles, it gives the assumption that it is a clash of two cultures. But I don't think that's a true, especially in the French perspective as the story takes place in NYC.

The movie is a debatable, but if you take the movie 'Hall Pass' on the account, this film's concept is not that apart. I have heard that in the rural China, the brothers marrying a same woman due to large gender imbalance in the country after one-child policy set by the communist party. So this is not a strange thing, at least for a few people. This film might be accepted merely on a certain the section of the audience, but it's only a matter of time to adapt and accepted by a large number. I don't know about the prostitutions, but definitely it will abolish cheating within the marriage.

> ""I think that there are two forces on earth you never want to be fighting.
> One is mother nature. The other is love.""

It had a plenty of awesome lines. You know I collect the good ones from the movies I watch, so I had many pauses. It sentimentally strikes strongly, that means you can't wet your eyes, but can be felt in your deep heart. So romantically appealing beside the theme is uncomfortable for the current social lifestyle. The film is not about what's right and what's wrong, but giving commitment to the oath one has taken. Not to hurt anybody, even though you hurt by yourself from making a mistake.

But again, it's not either about mistakes, but respecting the individual's desire for what they think is keeping them happy. If you exclude religion from the social rule book, this film might make sense. I think this could be the film, the more it gets old and the future generation will think one of the advanced work regarding the lifestyle of that time.

Maybe this is an Anton Yelchin's best movie I have ever seen. Phenomenal performance along with the French actress who was so beautiful, especially her smiley expressions were what set a mood for the movie. Very handy supporting cameos by a couple of senior artists. I wanted Alivia Thirlby to stay longer, but she was another cameo like supporting character. Anyway, good to see her after a long time, though 'Dredd' came just a couple of years ago.

Like I mentioned, people see it with their own perspective on what they believe in. Does not matter what you believe in, but all I'm saying is it is a wonderful movie, so please keep aside your differences and watch it. Youngsters might show more interest in this than the old people, mainly, because in the last 50 years cultural lifestyle took a long leap forward by modernising and free to express.

There won't be any issue if you consider it a simple, but the atypical entertainment movie like hundred of others. Remember, it is a dark comedy as well, so often it filled with some fun scenes. I felt it was almost a masterpiece, but the fact is it is not, for being a non-traditional romantic drama is the reason behind to my consideration. Still, it is a must see film and I won't refuse that.

Fouad Mikati directs and Patricia Beauchamp and Joe Gossett write this slow burn drama that sadly never resorts to anything of note. It stars Rosamund Pike, Shiloh Fernandez and Nick Nolte. Music is by Daniel Hart and cinematography by Russell Carpenter.

A small town nurse is raped and takes the decision to befriend the rapist while he's in prison. Is it a way of exorcising her demons? Or something sinister?

You can see and feel that there's a real good film here trying to get out, a meditation on a number of things that only victims of heinous crimes can truly understand. There's interesting observations on sociopathy, fractured family values and loneliness, but in spite of the sterling efforts of Pike to make it work, it's constructed so poorly, too often wearisome, and it cheats by not paying off on the slow- burn approach. The final revelation only makes you realise that it has taken an hour and half of film to achieve what American Mary did in 20 minutes! Add in that Nolte is utterly wasted and that Fernandez simply isn't strong enough for the role (he's the guy that isn't Joaquin Phoenix), and you got one messy movie that's best avoided. 5/10"

The veteran auteur responsible for such pop cultural high-minded spectacles in ‘Alien’, ‘Blade Runner’ and even the mixed bag reception of ‘Prometheus’ certainly brings a sophisticated and thought-provoking vibe to the probing aura of ‘The Martian’. As with other Scott-helmed productions, ‘The Martian’ settles nicely in its majestic scope that taps into visual wonderment, humanistic curiosities, technical impishness and the surreal spryness of the SF experience.

The exploratory nature of ‘The Martian’ is its own noteworthy mission. Scott arms his frothy planetary odyssey with a sense of thematic inquisitiveness and intelligence while meshing human consciousness and scientific forethought. Clearly, ‘The Martian’ is astutely meditative and one can thankfully block in their memory banks some of Scott’s mediocre misses (anyone care to recall the monumental mishaps in the form of the flimsy ‘The Counselor’ or the unintentional laughfest that was ‘Exodus: Gods And Kings’?). Rightfully so, ‘The Martian’ shares its crafty crater of similarities with other space-place spectacles that resonated with the imagination and innovation such as the Academy Award-winning ‘Gravity’ and the under-rated ‘Interstellar’. 

Quite frankly, ‘The Martian’ is elegantly arresting in its sheer skin for both the character studies and the major plight involved (particularly anchored on the shoulders of star Matt Damon as the contemplative lead) as well as the trademark Scott-induced flourishes that incorporate crisp and cunning visual special effects and a sweeping musical score that invites a transfixing hold on one’s indelible spirit.

‘The Martian’ is the film adaptation of Andy Weir’s best-selling tome. Scott’s disciplined direction and screenwriter Drew Goddard’s ambitious vision of Weir’s compelling written material seemingly gels in convincing, cerebral fashion. The premise is not wildly original as it revisits the familiar foundation of a lost soul in survival mode trying to take on the treacherous surroundings with philosophical conviction. Nevertheless, this does not make ‘The Martian’ any less formidable in its soul-searching perspective. Scott’s narrative on individualism and isolation with a tremendous technological tilt truly registers with boisterous bounce. Amazingly, Scott has assembled a capable and committed cast that are dedicated to making ‘The Martian’ look resourcefully skillful in its masterful mischievousness. Sure, The Martian’s lengthy running time is staggering but it is compelling enough to invest in its meandering, adventurous narrative.

The ultimate nightmare (or perilous predicament…take your choice) has been realised for one stranded space traveler in Mark Watney (Matt Damon). You see…poor astronaut Watney had the misfortune of losing contact with his commander in Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and the rest of his crew when undergoing a scientific expedition to examine the terrain on Mars. Courtesy of an unexpected freakish storm Watney is separated from his comrades and believed to be dead as a result of the hazardous weather conditions on Mars. Lewis and her associates have no choice but to head back to Earth as searching for Watney may prove to be futile and endanger their lives as well.

Thus, Mark Watney is basically his own forced-upon version of ‘Robinson Crusoe On Mars’. There is no option for Watney but to allow his major survival instincts to kick in while striving for his jeopardised livelihood on the unpredictable and treacherous Red Planet’s jagged landscape. Despite being stuck in hostile territory, Watney must use his background skills as a trained botanist to cultivate the scarce food he must rely on for his unconventional nutrition. The only ‘companion’ that Watney has to relate to rests in the recorded device that captures his harried thoughts through video diaries (at least this is more practical than what Tom Hanks’s ‘Castaway’ character had in his possession with inanimate object best buddy, Wilson the volleyball).

In the meanwhile, the devastating news about Mark Watney’s possible death far beyond the reaches of home hits his colleagues understandably hard as tributes start to pour in remembrance of the seemingly dearly departed space pioneer. Soon, there is some measure of hope when NASA officials that include head honchos Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels from TV’s ‘The Newsroom’), Vincent Kapoor (the Oscar-nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor from ’12 Years A Slave’) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) find evidence that Watney may be alive and ready to be rescued. Naturally, a sense of urgency is warranted to retrieve the weary astronaut without causing too many public relations waves. This puts press aide Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig) into damage control mode in particular.

Okay...so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?
Okay…so it is not as scenic as Yellowstone National Park but the rocky region in THE MARTIAN still has some unassuming charm, right?
Importantly, ‘The Martian’ is clever and carefully conceived because it does not have to rely on the excess baggage to convey its entertainment value in a series of hyperactive and hedonistic happenings. Ridley Scott is soundly methodical in presenting a low-key terrifying tale of loneliness and resiliency and what it takes to handle the pressure of adversity when there is no glimmer of humanity around to reinforce or remind one of such psychological obstacles. The intriguing factor here is the science-friendly serving of intelligence and insight that builds up the audience’s appreciation for the underlying suspense. Interestingly, the conflict approached in ‘The Martian’ is not so much the back-and-forth high-scale struggles of man versus outlandish creature or an over-the-top diabolical deviant out to destroy the world in cartoonish fashion. No, the genuine combative and confrontational war of will is contained in one vulnerable man’s ability to face the unknown grounded in both doubt and determination. Hence, Scott has made a palpable thinking man’s Science Fiction exposition rooted in articulated forethought.

Damon more than holds his own as the disillusioned botanist/astronaut out on an ominous limb as his doomed odyssey of uncertainty is something that the common viewer can embrace and relate to without question. The perceived opulence in ‘The Martian’ is not contained in the film’s production values per se (Scott has made previous movies with more visual vitality and purpose) but subtly showcased in the concepts of  knowledgeable tidbits concerning food rations, mathematical equations, crucial time tables, planetary probes, NASA-themed procedural techniques and aerodynamics considerations.

Hopefully, ‘The Martian’ is not dismissed as a foreign alien in the minds of ardent movie-going SF enthusiasts looking for a realistic and soulful space-age adventure with a refreshing backbone of scientific curiosity and candidness.

MPAA Rating: PG-13

Genre: Science Fiction/Space Adventure/Science and Fantasy

Critic’s rating: *** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) || This is a movie that I have to say that I have a bit of a difficulty in rating. Quite honestly I was sorely tempted to remove a star, or even two stars. Why? Because it is full of Hollywood nonsense, scientific errors, it is rather predictable and it did feel a bit like a Apollo 13 rip-off. Why did I not remove those stars? Well, it is rather entertaining even if, at times, I squirmed in my seat.

The movie starts of with a somewhat implausible event where a unexpected storm hits the Mars camp which forces the ground crew of the Mars mission to hurry back to the launch vehicle before it tilts over. The launch vehicle gradually tilts a degree at the time. Is it just me finding this strange? Would storms on Mars defy the usual rules of weather dynamics that they would exert a constant pressure which would cause a slow but constant tilt of a construct like that. No gusts, no change in pressure? And why would it gradually tilt at all? Once the force would be enough for the landing struts on one side to leave the ground it would pretty much tilt right away. Okay, I am being picky so lets give that a benefit of a doubt for the time being.

Obviously one guy is lost during the dramatic events. This is equally obviously 100% predictable. The fact that the guy is still alive after the rest of the crew blasted off is obviously also 100% predictable but then, this you should have pretty figured out from the title of the move after all.

A lot of the rest of the movie is following this guys quest for survival on Mars using the left over equipment at his disposal and the NASA crew on Earth trying to rescue him. Yes the NASA crew on Earth does discover that he is alive which, again, is pretty much predictable. Of course this gave Hollywood the opportunity to add a utterly dislikable political bureaucrat that is pretty much in the movie for one reason and one reason alone…to be dislikable. Personally I just found him tiresome. But then, Americans seems to like these kind of people given the kind of trash that we see being pushed towards the upcoming presidential elections…from both sides!

There are a lot of good stuff in the movie. Even though it is rather predictable there are some suspense in it, there are a lot of good scenery, and even though you pretty much knows what is going to happen you do feel like cheering for the hero. Given the script I think a lot of the actors did a rather good job of their roles.

If the script writers would have brought on some decent scientific advisors I would say this would have been a great movie but it was frequently goofed up with issues that was just stupid. Like digging down a nuclear reactor a few feet in the ground. What the f… good was that supposed to do? And the constant use of simple plastic and duct tape to seal the environment. Yeah, right. Sure, Mars do have some atmosphere so it is not vacuum we are talking about but then in other scenes they seemed to assume almost zero atmosphere and made quite a bit use of explosive decompression effects.

Okay, okay I am probably nitpicking quite a bit here but, unlike many Science Fiction movies, this one tries to give an impression of being within the realms of realism and it is just too full of classical Hollywood mishaps for my taste.

As I wrote above I still think it is a movie worth watching. It has some suspense, it is well done from a photographic point of view and the actors are doing a decent job. I think 7 out of 10 stars is a fair rating but it should certainly not have more. || This is a movie following the lead started with Gravity with the human main character fighting for survival in space.

The plot has a good combination of suspense, action, humor and drama. Damon performs well and the rest of the cast does a good job and has been well chosen.

It is not a magnificent movie but it is good enough to fill a couple of hours of entertainment."

Half a year ago the first look poster of this movie's stirred everyone including myself. Not seen such kind of posters for even movies like 'Blue is the Warmest colour' and 'Nymphomaniac I & II'. It is obvious the director of the Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA winner for the movie 'The Great Beauty' delivered another similar ordinary concept about extraordinary fictional personalities. And the way of their life, especially when they meet the difficulties at some point of their lives.

From all, the casting of Michael Caine caught my interest on this. This is another wonderful movie with the hard work of the fine cast and the crew. There is a good chance for the movie in the upcoming Oscar and other prestigious awards node in a couple of categories, including for the Caine's performance. Because it looks like made for awards, rather breaking records at the box office.

Whatever the topic of the movie is, 'love' stands at the centre of the web. Human affections for each others, losing someone you love and at a same time falling for another. All about passing through 'love' in the life and in which, how strong is our grip on it to carry along with us to the end of the life was illustrated pretty compelling way.

The theme was bold, and everything shown was realistic. But it also makes some illusions to brief the other side of reality. For instance, a Buddhist monk who demonstrates his peaceful achievement, a fat man kicking a tennis ball high in the air et cetera, all these are the youthfulness of who are no more youths, citing as a desire for beyond their limits which is obviously what the title implies.

I won't expect everyone like the movie as I did, because it is not made for everyone. But you could try it and then decide your thought on this film. That is one of the way the movies like this can work for the people who are choosy sometimes.

I know Melissa McCarthy since 'Gilmore Girls', but never thought she would rise this far, especially to dominate in a movie with the presence of the big names around her, that too in an action film equivalent to top quality. She's one of my favourite actresses, even I enjoyed thoroughly her under-appreciated 'Tammy'. So this is where the action stars become comedians and comedians action stars. Indeed, it worked out so well.

It shames comedy-spy flicks like 'The Pink Panther', 'Johnny English' etc. From the director of 'The Heat', helmed another perfect female oriented comedy. Jude Law was a decent as usual, but Jason Statham was unbelievably awesome in his tiny part. I had plenty of good laughs, the loud ones after a long time. I still remember the unicorn joke and I can't stop laughing. And roof over a bike, gadgets and so on... I find Melissa McCarthy's line deliverance are so funny and I enjoy her films specially for that reason.

I know they used a stunt double and blue/green screens in the crucial segments for a better result. But still she excelled in all stunt sequences that required physically herself in front of the camera. One of the trivia says, after the end of each day shooting, she looked like fell down an elevator shaft. Her hard work definitely paid off very well.

There are lots of adult oriented comedy, so strictly it is for grownups only and may be matured teens. I'll be definitely disappointed if they won't make a sequel for this. If they do, I hope they retain all the cast, especially Statham along the lead actress. And finally I'm looking forward the director-actress's the third collaboration, 'Ghostbusters'.

7½/10 || These things are really, **really** not for me. I found a couple of laughs in Statham's role but beyond that _Spy_ did nothing for me. I know folks who do enjoy this, and other Feig/McCarthy films, but I genuinely do not understand the appeal, maybe Spy is better than the others, maybe not, but it did absolutely nothing to turn me around on these collabs.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || I have just got to say that I am a bit biased, simply because I love this movie. Jason Statham and Melissa McCarthy are awesome together in their roles, and even though Jude Law does a decent job as well, this movie is all about Melissa and Jason to me.

I find the language of the character of Jason Statham to be very ugly, but still, it is needed to make his character be in the way it is supposed to be. And to be honest, he is completely hilarious!

Melissa is something very similar, and she is perfect for her role as an analyst that has to work undercover, taking the place of all other agents whose identities have been revealed to the ""enemy"".

You will get lots of reasons to laugh throughout the movie, and it is incredibly easy to enjoy every second.

<h3>A little warning</h3>
You should be warned though... if you like this kind of humor, it is awesome. But, if you like to eat lemon and feel angry when people behave in stupid ways in movies (like in Mr. Bean and in Dumb and Dumber), this is most likely not a movie for you!

But, if you like crazy humor, you should go ahead and watch this movie - it is pure gold!"

I never saw the trailer, but I thought it was Rebel Wilson's film, that's who I saw on the poster and decided to go for it. In the movie she never came, then realised I was tricked or I failed to pay attention while choosing the film. So then, who the heck was this actress. Never seen or heard before, Not so romantic or funny, totally boring. I thought She might be Will Ferrell's sister. I'm kind of frustrated because of either the movie or the actors were not excited to keep going with my watch.

This is the same old story, but instead it's a woman's version. A playgirl loses the someone who loves her sincerely for what she's and later finds the one true love of her life, but it ends in a disaster due to her past. So how everything is going to be fixed is what brings curtain to the narration.

It might be a well known plot, but a well crafted movie as well by one of the best comedy filmmaker who has given many awesome ones. Despite his effort to make it big it is also his bottom of the list from his filmography. Well, not all the actors were so bad, John Cena was so funny with his gay jokes, but lot like in a guest appearance. The basketball superstar that I don't know him. Definitely better than average only if a quality movie like this would have had a proper lead actress. I think some people would find it hilarious, but not to me and I wanted to like it, but I couldn't.

5/10 || A relatively basic rom-com plot, elevated by Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. Schumer injects humour and reality to her character, even if you can see every story beat coming a mile a way. Not the best nor the worst Apatow film, it is heavy handed at times and a little too long. I also hate how these characters always completely quit drinking and partying for their partner, can't there be a happy medium?

Still, I laughed out loud on multiple occasions, and you can't ask for much more with a rom-com"

In 48 BC, a peace-promoting protection squad on the Silk Road in Northwestern China is assigned to construction work at Wild Geese Gate wherein they are assisted by a fugitive legion of Romans led by General Lucius (John Cusack), who befriends the leader of the security company (Jackie Chan). When shady Roman leader Tiberius (Adrien Brody) arrives with an army of 100,000, the other two groups team-up against them.

Supposedly inspired by real-life events, ""Dragon Blade"" (2015) is a Chinese action/adventure that cost $65 million and looks it. The film is top-of-the-line as far as production quality goes (score, cast, costumes, sets, quick editing, locations, etc.). Chan is entertaining as usual while Cusack and Brody surprisingly tower in their roles (I say “surprisingly” because I wouldn’t have imagined them cutting it as Roman commanders in the ancient past). The tone is serious with goofy quick-edited action and a modest amount of humor that’s actually funny.

If you happened upon any 2-3 minutes of this film you’d automatically think that it was a very worthy adventure flick. Unfortunately, it’s too manic for its own good. I tried to adapt to its hyper tone and did so until just past the halfway mark when the overkill action style pretty much lost me. I endured to the end, but it was difficult. It seriously needed to slow down and cultivate depth (but at least it tries to at times). 

“Dragon Blade” lacks the confident poise of the excellent “Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan” (2007) and instead shoots for overKILL. Consider the frenzied pace of the 2011 version of “Conan the Barbarian,” but up the ante a couple of notches. That’s this movie.      

The film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes and was shot in Hengdian and Dunhuang, China, as well as the Gobi Desert.

The original series had a quite successful run for almost a decade. I haven't seen that, after seeing this film now I want to try it. So this movie is like a bonus episode for its fans, and for the cast and crew it was a reunion for the one last time. But I want a sequel, because I kind of liked it without familiarity with the original story and its characters. Anyway, it did not give me any trouble in understanding, particular this story. But obviously I know I am missing something in those scenes that directly has something to do with the series.

What a simple tale about the film industry. It actually centered on a bunch of Hollywood actors and producers. When a lead actor wanted to direct his next film for the new production house, he gets a green signal, but the problem arises after production halts in the half way due to exceeding the original budget. All the struggle they go through, especially the studio head who acts between the filmmakers and their financiers is what narrated in this film.

I don't know what they thought of this those who saw the series, but to me it was a pretty good comedy. Because I had no pressure to expect or to compare it with the original material like they do. The cast was wonderful. I got quite an unexpected and enjoyable twist. Since it was related to the motion pictures, some big film personalities' cameo brightened the overall film. If you want your watch to be a perfect, go through from the beginning, but like I did, you too can have a good time without viewing the series. That's not a recommendation, but a small suggestion.

Now with the conclusive The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 ardent and casual fans of this imaginative and charged film franchise will get a chance to soak in the cinematic experience that has carried them through this durable trilogy. However, the question remains: does Mockingjay--Part 2 fulfill the adventurous swagger of its previous predecessors as it demonstrates its furious farewell in moodiness and mischievousness? Well, the answer is a resounding YES but some will still address the concept of the film's emotional and psychological leanings as merely serviceable to a string of feisty films that invited such passion, pronouncement and promise in its commentary on class struggle and societal survival means as a whole. 

The Hunger Games cinematic installments (and of course Collins's riveting literary outlets) have always been a solid and secure movie-going moment because it offered what so few action-packed features entailed: a perceptive and honest if not hedonistic look at the politics in the human psyche set aside from the rough-and-tumble sequences of action and suspense. The Games that were played in the minds of the audience were intriguing, thoughtful, compelling and smart about its wits and wisdom. All The Hunger Games editions were message-driven and presented a special kind of indescribable opulence and openness that was refreshing. Sure, there are the highs and lows that comes with the territory when mapping out a showcase of sequels bound to stumble on its lapses in story and characterization. Still, for the most part The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 leaves the viewers wanting more but being compliant with what amounts to be the swan song for courageous cutie Katniss Everdeen's big screen legacy. 

It is quite clear that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 and its previous outings has carved a decisive niche into the Young Adult film fiction genre as one of the most successful and consistently received chapters that sparkled in its over-glow of gallant gumption and soul-searching turmoil. Indeed, Mockingjay--Part 2 does add its measurement of tension, radiance,  redemption and resolution. Importantly, Mockingjay--Part 2 maintains its reflective and steady balance of hope and rebellious vibes and Lawrence has not lost a single ounce of momentum in the few years since she donned the respectable defiance of the roguish Katniss out to settle a continuous score with the controlling powers-that-be.  Instinctively, labeling The Hunger Games motivating movie series as a pop cultural phenom would not risk the intention of sounding overdramatic because for the most part this film franchise has been a saving grace to the aforementioned Young Adult film fiction craze that has offered cemented substance in comparison to the soapy sentiments of the immense Twilight umbrella that spread like wildfire in the unguarded woods years before.

As one can imagine Mockingjay--Part 2 picks up where the first Mockingjay left off in its initial premise. Director Francis Lawrence (back at the helm) starts his narrative rather slow and plodding but builds up the sassy momentum as his on-screen victorious vixen Katniss Everdeen pounces on her latest exploits to expose and agitate the corruptible Capitol and its lead manipulator in the likes of the diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The good news is that the determined Katniss is finally reunited with her former Games companion and romantic partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). The bad news is that poor Peeta has been manipulated and convinced to view Katniss as an enemy courtesy of Snow's menacing minions. Automatically, this is the difficult wedge that puts a damper on Katniss's ability to go after Snow and his vile followers with Peeta serving as their brainwashed Boy Wonder with the forced hatred in tact. 

So now the course is set for Katniss Everdeen to follow as she decides to pursue her intentions of gradually taking down the governmental negligence of Snow and his abominable administration. Naturally, Katniss needs the assistance of the rebels under the tutelage of District 13's President Alma Coin (Oscar-winner Julianne Moore) as well as the input from wily gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (late Oscar-winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to take down the dangerous and devious Snow and his governmental criminal cronies. Politically, the opportunistic Coin wants Katniss in her camp for the mere promotion of propaganda...something that just does not sit well with the feminine avenger.

The stakes are understandably high but Katniss is in company with the likes of her childhood sweetie pie Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and old-time buddy Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) as they join forces to combat the evil clutched of the Capitol. The bottom line: the venomous President Snow needs to be cut down in his treacherous tracks...plain and simple. 

Quite frankly, the beleaguered Katniss is caught up in the complicated web of a couple of political powerhouses in the insufferable Snow (that wants to destroy her) and Coin (that wants to use her reputation for marketing purposes) willing to go at it while using Katniss's exposed neck as the sacrificial pawn to determine their sense of twisted greatness. For the most part, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 2 does present a skillful display of confusion and identity and Lawrence's death-dodging diva Katniss Everdeen is the epitome of a Girl on Fire with flames of indecision and doubt burning all around her. Who can she trust? Who has the fortitude to stick with the plan and ensure that the tedious target of Snow is silenced for sure? Can Katniss overcome the obstacles of her great love Peeta's perverse distaste for her while battling one narcissistic leader as another one she is joined at the hip exploits her presence? There seems to be a constant continuity for conflict in warfare and wounded souls that elevates Mockingjay--Part 2 as a boisterous board game of physical and psychological movement. As usual, Lawrence's Katniss carries the animated strife on her dainty yet athletic shoulders with bouncy boldness. 

After four exhilarating films, The Hunger Games empire does not crumble but comes to a full scale halt as it understands the allegory claims for the distrusting contemporary times we all live in regarding the cynicism, abuse of privilege and the underestimation of the weary masses being led astray by the controlling elite of unassuming movers and shakers. The audacity of The Hunger Games odyssey was to get down and dirty about the give-and-take tendencies of a global society willing to challenge the authoritative scrutiny or kneel at its merciless ankles. Perhaps Mockingjay--Part 2 should not be perceived so deeply in its final revelation. Nevertheless, the effort in trying to do so should be acknowledged for an actioner that dared to approach such thought-provoking fodder within its bombastic boundaries.

(c) Frank Ochieng 2015 || The movie is not bad directed and the cast does a decent job. Actually, the script is a good adaptation of the book.

The problem is that the story of the book is already quite bad and has gone down the sink by now so the whole movie just doesn't work. || > A necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.

If the single book 'The Hobbit' was extended to three movies, then that's alright, because that was a large concept with hundreds of unique characters which can take the stretch in narration. But for this series, lucky to be the first film to get away with a big hit, mainly because of teen audience.

Honestly, I liked the 2nd film very much, but the third movie was a letdown, especially this one was utterly useless. Because the 80% of the story ended in the previous part and in this, it was a necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.

Might have been a better film if the 'Mockingjay' was a single movie. Nowadays there are many strange ways to make money, the art of storytelling in the movies is slowing vanishing while adapting a book for the silver screen by splitting them into two and/or three. This culture has to stop, the book fans are enjoying the original masterpiece, while film fanatic like me is suffering a setback. In this 2 hour long movie there are lots of scenes that simply wastes time to bring sufficient runtime.

Due to the circumstances that I mentioned, the flow was disturbed, mainly because of the release gap between the last two films. Emotions are not felt, actions were weakened, you could only recognise it rushing towards the conclusion. And that section should have been the ultimatum, what comes later is what we call 'happily ever after or the other way' should have been very brief, but in here it was not. Like a new beginning of a new story, it went on too far.

From the screenwriter's perspective that has to be done. I had seen the split movies like 'Twilight', 'Harry Potter' and others, but this one was the worst among them. Even if you try all the four movies in a single sitting, the first two will be the best you can get and the followed two would surely disappoint you because of the slowness.

It feels so refreshing to turn back the hands of time and recall all the wonderful memories and perks of our younger days and, what is not to consider about the days gone by when reminiscing about certain trends in music, fashion, entertainment or past relationships? For this particular theme regarding director Chris Columbus’s tepid comedy ‘Pixels’, the focus pays homage to the old school pastime of video games. Sure, ‘Pixels’ tries to recapture the glory days of 80s video game mania and wrap it into an off-kilter disaster comedy that awkwardly borrows heavily from another 80s iconic big screen laugher we affectionately recognize as ‘Ghostbusters’. Instead, the clunky ‘Pixels’ is nothing more than an updated poor man’s version of the aforementioned ‘Ghostbusters’ with little distinctive spark or  imagination to accompany the empty zaniness. This latest lame and recycled Adam Sandler-led vehicle should come with the familiar message that is flashed at every conclusion of a video game: Game Over!

Every formulaic bone in the body of ‘Pixels’ is fragile because the movie really does not strive for anything sensational outside of its ambitious special effects wizardly. One can somewhat appreciate the few outlandish moments that garner a chuckle here and there but for the most part ‘Pixels’ suffers from transparent character developments that take a backseat to the incidental mayhem that persists.

The good news is that ‘Pixels’ is one of the few Sandler-branded films that one could actually stomach without resorting to the usual eye-rolling exasperation. Still, that is not saying very much nor is this what one might call a glowing endorsement neither. Screenwriters Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling manage to adequately stuff enough throwback reminders to the heyday of 80s-era frivolity regarding video game fever and the baby-boomers (and strangely enough youngsters and young adults) will probably relish the reminiscent goofiness of the period. The need to mesh the sentimental fixation of video games with the reliable foundation of disaster flicks that still reign supreme in today’s popcorn cinema scene is challenging yet ‘Pixels’ just does not have the convincing giddy-minded gumption to pull off such a free-wheeling stunt.

As many may proudly admit their hours-long odyssey into video arcades where brain cells were bombarded by exceptional gaming skills, we come across a selection of a former (and some may even say current) ‘nerd herd’ of gifted gamers that were resourceful back in the day when their fierce video game acumen was something not to mess with at all. Leading the pack of players that were previously involved in the 1982 World Videogame Championship competition is Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), a slacker that has done nothing productive with his adult life since the notable achievement of being a runner-up at the WVC competition as a child. The champ, whose title was earned at Sam’s expense, is Eddie ‘The Fire Blaster’ Plant (Peter Dinklage). Rounding out the trio is game-playing expert and conspiracy-seeking ace Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad). Oh yeah…let’s not forget their mutual friend Will Cooper (Sandler’s comedy best buddy Kevin James) who just happens to be the President of the United States. How convenient, huh?

Well, the expertise of the video-playing ‘fearsome threesome’ will come into being handy when a misinterpreted recording of a video game competition recovered in space by perturbed aliens sets off the threatening agenda for these space invaders to conquer the arrogant earthlings. After all, the taped recording ruffled the feathers of the aliens so the planet Earth needs to be challenged for the rights to claim planetary property. So the question remains: can the uninspired electronics-installing Sam, the cocky-minded Eddie and paranoid puss Ludlow defend our world and use their gaming prowess to outwit, outplay and outlast the aliens as a high stakes game is proposed for ownership of the planet?

Some may dismiss ‘Pixels’ as a serviceable, quirky comedy that has a unique spirit onto its own. It does have its inserted nuttiness at various spurts. However, the overall presentation feels utterly choppy and the whole premise about these past gaming misfits returning to their childhood glory to rescue mankind through their glorified hobby comes off as manufactured, clumsy-minded campiness. There is nothing about ‘Pixels’ that screams originality besides being a faceless ‘Ghostbusters’ knock-off but with familiar video game branding (the gigantic Pac Man-eating creature comes to mind as he tries to swallow the entire metropolitan region). This frenzy-minded fable seems strained for canned laughs.

Sandler, although not as nearly obnoxious and grating on the nerves as he is in some of his other monotonous vehicles, seems to be sleep-walking in his role as the redemptive Sam looking for that second chance to come out as victorious to undermine his otherwise mundane existence. The breath-taking Michelle Monaghan, playing Sam’s shapely military protocol pop tart of a girlfriend Violet van Patten, is on hand to remind us that even labelled ‘losers’ that like to push gaming buttons on a console can get the last laugh in coming out feeling lucky. Monaghan’s Violet being Sam’s glamorous galpal and James’s Cooper as Sam’s Commander-in-Chief pal is probably the most outlandish and funny element about ‘Pixels’ to legitimately digest at this point. Gad is a mixed bag as the oafish Ludlow often opining for his indifferent pixel princess Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson). Dinklage steals the show as Eddie, a diminutive dynamo that is big on showy confidence within his small frame.

It is safe to say that the insanely amusing Bill Murray and his crew of ghost-busting goof-offs need not to lose any sleep over over the perfunctory put-on that is Sandler and company in the slight and forgettable silliness of ‘Pixels’. One might want to save their roll of quarters and wash a load of dirty laundry as opposed to playing a do-or-die game of ‘Donkey Kong’ with these video game vagabonds.

Critic’s Rating: * 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) || > I enjoyed it because it reminded me my childhood.

There are plenty of movies related to the video games. The 80s movie 'Tron' was one of those first I have seen, followed by many. But the recent one 'Wreck-it Ralph' was the game changer in the modern animation/CGI which led to another similar flick, 'The Lego Movie'. Lego and 'Toy Story' are the toys, not the video games, but very close to this theme and I'm very happy that Hollywood made this film for the guys like me who grew up playing them.

The film had a very simple story with the great visuals. Sometimes simple is very good rather going for hi-tech. Especially those who played these games in their middle-age back in the 80s could be now very old and they might suffer to understand the film due to the technology/terms/phrase gap, if it matched to the todays hi-tech hi-resolution video games. But the youngsters of the present era didn't understand that who are the backbone of any movie's success and that's why this movie sunk in the ocean of criticism.

My childhood and teenage was the late 90s and early 00s respectively, So 8bit games are on the edge of revolution. My favourites were the races and brick games, especially 'Duck Hunt', because I get a gun, not joystick. So this movie really brought me those sweet memories. A decade ago I used those unique sounds and music for message alerts in my 2G mobile phone(s).

I know recently Sandler had hit the rock bottom in his acting career, but, he's kind of lifted after the decent film 'The Cobbler' and excellent multistarrer 'Men, Women & Children'. This is not a massive comeback to what he's known for, comedies. But, sailing on average or above in better than falling downward in the career graph. To me this film was a better one, an above average, obviously not a masterpiece.

Guest appearances were unexpected, but was not that effective, except Ashley Benson, who was so hot in her 2-3 odd minutes. This film is not for everyone. Youngsters and oldsters never understand it. If you were born in the 70s and 80s, then probably you will know what to expect. Even it does not deliver to your expectation, definitely gives satisfaction for bringing those lost memories of our childhood.

7/10 || **Pixels is another dumb, fun Adam Sandler film that doesn’t deserve all the hate. If you like Sandler movies, this is a good one.**

I have seen this movie on so many “Worst of all time” lists, and it does not belong there. It’s an Adam Sandler movie, so that should give you an idea of what to expect - a goofy comedy with some absurd characters doing something ridiculous. And I’m here for it! I enjoy Sandler movies, and I really enjoyed this one. The characters were funny. The plot entertained. The effects worked with the 80s video game idea. Sandler and James are always a fun duo, and adding Gad and Dinklage cranked up the laughs. Michelle Monaghan was a good fit and knew how to play with the boys in this outrageous film. I’m not saying Pixels should win an Oscar, but it’s fun to watch and laugh with the family, especially if you’re a fan of other Sandler films."

But none of these three movies are bad movies so _Fantastic Beasts_ gets a pass from me. 

I was particularly fond of the degree to which it tied into the Harry Potter world at large. There were moments were I went “Oh Harry’s used that same spell before!” or characters that fitted naturally into the narrative being mentioned, as opposed to getting all _Agents of SHIELD_ season 1 on us, and awkwardly name-dropping something from the other films every 5 minutes, just in case we forgot, which was what I was afraid it might do.

End result, _Fantastic Beasts_ is a flawed film that I was still very happy to have watched, and exceeded my expectations.

_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._ || I must say I was expecting to like it, and I really liked it despite the few generic moments throughout the film. 

Can watch again/10. || Personally I found this movie to be 2+ hours of excellent entertainment. This is one of these movies where I simply cannot understand how people can give one and two star ratings stating that it is garbage etc. I do not get what these people expected? Maybe they just have to complain? The original Harry Potter books are very much books for children or young adults and so is this movie. It is a highly entertaining story in a magical universe with some adventure, some suspense and a lot of humor.

The magic and the magical animals are quite cool. The pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the Harry Potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. The story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. This is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. It is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. More importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy SJW nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. This movie delivers where it counts as far as I am concerned. It is entertaining, plain and simple.

If I should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. He did not really have much charisma. That and the fact that I never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, Grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.

On the whole I enjoyed the movie a lot and although it is perhaps not the absolutely best movie I have ever seen but it still deserves  a top rating."

After watching and, all in all, enjoying the main films from the <em>'Star Wars'</em> franchise, I thought I'd check out the many spin-off films. <em>'The Star Wars Holiday Special'</em> makes for quite the start!

I had heard bits and pieces about this down the years and those bits and pieces were usually pretty derogatory and now I can see why; it's far worse than I was anticipating though. The worst thing is that it doesn't even try to be silly and stupid, if actually attempts to be sincere and meaningful.

It's utterly dire, from start to finish. No idea how they roped Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher into this, you gotta especially feel for Fisher given that end scene... wow. I wish it was 'so bad it's good' so it could've been ironically fun to watch, but it's the furthest thing from that."

Ian McKellen as Sherlock Holmes, totally loved it. Directed by an Oscar winning filmmaker, the film was based on the novel 'A Slight Trick of the Mind'. It focused the long retired Sherlock Holmes, who now lives in the English countryside where he meets a boy. He tries to recall one of his old cases, but struggles as he's very old to remember. So with the help of the boy, he undertakes to correct the book version of the story and besides, they together establish beekeeping as a hobby.

It was not that great, though an enjoyable small drama. Having a greatest detective character in it, you just can't expect a boring regular drama of the life. The narration had a multiple layer, in each how much Mr. Holmes dedicates himself to solves the case was nicely told. And of course, all of them had its own twist. After all, that's what everybody seeks from a film with Sherlock Holmes.

I'm sure you would have seen several films and/or series based on this character, but this film was something unique and only one kind, except if there's a sequel planned for this. Some people might be disappointed in this for being somewhat simple, but for a 93 year old man this storyline looked very appropriate and Ian did a fantastic job. I anticipated someone young actor for those flashback parts, but in the end, I'm happy that it was a one man show as it should be. It is a must see for his fans.

Anyone who is fortunate enough to share their life with a companion animal will undoubtedly get a kick out of the latest Illumination animated effort, “The Secret Life of Pets.” The film soars when it focuses on animals interacting with their human guardians, with the canine and feline characters acting like real pets do (if my cats could talk, I’m sure they’d converse in  similar dialogue as portrayed onscreen). The first part of the movie is incredibly perceptive and clever, as is the last 10 minutes because it zeroes in on these very relationships (the opening and closing scenes of the movie are touching and have lots of heart). The problem comes in the middle when the story stops being about ‘pets being pets.’ Sadly, the majority of the film lags when it ventures into the dreaded animated movie territory of sheer stupidity.

Loveable human Katie (Ellie Kemper) and her pup Max (Louis C.K.) are the best of friends. Max has several animal buddies that live in the same New York City high rise, including dogs, cats, birds and guinea pigs that stop by for daily visits. When Katie brings home Duke (Eric Stonestreet) from the animal shelter, Max devises a plan to get rid of him. Problem is, the two dogs find themselves lost in the big city and Max’s would-be girlfriend Gidget (Jenny Slate) takes it upon herself to recruit other pets — including the elderly paralyzed basset hound Pops (Dana Carvey) and lonely falcon Tiberius (Albert Brooks) — to bring Max home. Along the way they find themselves at odds with the anarchist gang of “flushed pets,” a group of outspoken, anti-human animals led by former magician’s bunny Snowball (Kevin Hart).

The voice acting runs the gamut from phenomenally good (Slate) to wince inducing (Hart). Slate is perfectly cast as Gidget, a poufy white spoiled little dog who eventually saves the day. She proves herself tenfold as a legitimate voiceover actor, and I hope to see her get more work in animation in the future. There’s no denying that Hart is a super likeable actor, but his portrayal of Snowball the bunny is nothing more than repeated, strained yelling. His overall performance felt so labored and unnatural that listening to him onscreen actually made me uncomfortable. I will not hesitate to nominate Hart for a Razzie award for worst actor of the year because his voice work is that bad.

In the ‘oh no, not again’ category, there’s plenty of dopey, brainless scenarios crammed in with a feeling that their sole existence is to appease young kids. We get yet another ridiculous animal driving a car stunt that we had to endure in this summer’s nearly insufferable “Finding Dory.” In fact, in “The Secret Life of Pets” we get not only a rabbit driving a van but also a lizard driving a bus and a pig driving a taxi.

The absurdity isn’t the only problem: it’s the repetition. The filmmakers must’ve run out of good ideas and instead of moving the story forward, the audience gets the same monotony over and over and over again. I don’t require my animated films to be completely based in reality (there’s a particularly amusing Busby Berkeley inspired musical sequence in a sausage factory), but I do expect more originality than is delivered in this movie. The story at times takes a cynical approach in several places and some of the themes may be too much for sensitive kids (but the film provides a great starting point for a learning opportunity about pets and how animals shouldn’t be viewed as disposable).

At least the animation is commendable, nice and colorful with lively, fully realized backgrounds. It’s visually interesting enough for adults and fans of the genre but it’s also vibrant and bustling enough to keep the kids interested. There’s a lovely original score with a lighthearted, almost vintage sound. For me, the original music in this film is one of the standout elements.

Overall I feel like this film takes a great idea and almost completely wastes the opportunity. This dull, unremarkable action caper is mostly moronic, but the imaginative peek behind the door at an animal’s life when the humans are away is what’s pure gold. I really wish the film had focused on that component. “The Secret Life of Pets” is fine, but isn’t destined for greatness.  

**A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com** || **Street pets versus the house pets! A day adventure in a big city!**

Animation films always fascinate me, because of its varieties. Even animals can be the heroes and villains. So this kind of new story perspective, including technology, what makes adults too can enjoy them like the kids does. This is now in the list of top 50 highest grossing films of all time and top 10 of the year 2016. Moreover, it is the highest grossing non Disney and non Pixar animation film. This is a very enjoyable family flick that directed by the 'Despicable Me' famed filmmaker.

Kind of similar to 'Bolt', but totally a different experience. This story happens in just one day. It follows a young dog named Max, one day when his owner brings another pet dog, he thinks she does not love him anymore. So to keep his position safe in the house, he strikes a deal by blackmailing his new housemate, Duke. As a revenge act, when Duke tries to get him back, something goes wrong and they get stranded on the street. So getting back to home is their biggest challenge and it should be done before the sun sets. The rest is the Max and Duke's a day adventure in the New York City.

I was not expecting a masterpiece, just the last week I saw one, 'Finding Dory'. This is a good entertainer, that has some great names in the voice-over cast. Particularly you will love Kevin Hart like I did. But watch out for his impolite dialogues, if you are watching with your kids. Though there's nothing seriously affecting, just a typical Kevin Hart, but awesome. A simple story, a simple adventure, but very likable characters and screen presentation.

From the pets' perspective about during the daytime when their owners and the kids left for the work and school, respectively, how they make their day is what's revealed in this. So the 'Secret Life' means, theirs secret get together and do whatever they want to. But an unexpected clash takes place between the two gangs, the house pets and the street pets. In so many ways, it was better than I anticipated. There are lots of untold stuffs, especially the Duke's past which might be covered in the sequel which is officially announced now. So I'm waiting for the 2018 summer. Meanwhile, watch it if you haven't yet, particularly if you like animation.

_7/10_ || Very cute intro and some adorable animals, but the leads (voiced by Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet) were the worst part of the film... even if they did have a couple funny moments. What makes this worth viewing, however, are Gidget (Jenny Slate), Snowball (Kevin Hart), and Tiberius (Albert Brooks). In fact, I'd even consider watching a spin-off it it focused on them and left Max and Duke out.

BTW, the funny and adorable intro is pretty much all shown in the trailer and didn't give much of an indication into exactly what the film would be."

Like the previous year, the 2015 was also considered the year of sci-fi in the film world. Plenty of large and small scale flicks came out and among them I was eagerly waiting for this one. If the story is what you always prefer with a fine production quality, then this film won't disappoint you. The performances were also well supported. Then what was this film's issue?

The last time widely accepted movie by Tarsem Singh was when he engaged in the screenplay development. After that he did not see much success where all his directed ones were written by others. My perception is that he must do those both department where he's good at it. Take this film as an example, an awesome story and had a good cast, but the writing was let down according to many who saw it.

Even in the short period of appearance, Ben Kingsley's role's legacy carried out till the end, because the concept was designed like that way. Being one of the top actors, Ryan Reylands films are not that celebratable. Though he's doing a decent flicks often and those were failing to recognise in the higher level, which did not spare this one as well.

People are comparing it to 'Face/off', but to me it looked more like coming together of 'The Island' and 'Skeleton Key'. Whatever it is I had a good time. Not a fresh concept of an idea, but narrated differently and it needed a bit depth in showcasing everything in the film.

My formula/secret for watching a movie successfully even it considered as an average or worse is, I won't bother for all the departments come together to become a well crafted product like the critics expect, because I'm a movie fanatic and love watching them almost most of the time than arguing about its flawed contents. If I find anything solely interesting like acting, music, story, visuals, I respect the efforts. So do I to this one and believe me it is much better than what the critics say so.

One could not swing a dead cat without running into zombie-related cinema. It was all the rage at the box office that was experiencing a certain celluloid renaissance with overloading narratives within the “zombie zone”. Sure, zombies are still the norm in pop cultural media on both the big and small screen (anybody not heard of “The Walking Dead”?). However, another iconic horror-induced symbol–the witch–is making its way back into prominence in the cinema circles. Unfortunately, the “twitch of the witch” is explored in an over-the-top, messy and misplaced CGI-coated production of the outlandish The Last Witch Hunter.

So there are a number of reasons why the whimsical wasteland The Last Witch Hunter might be considered high-tech jumbled junk. Nevertheless, the consensus is that sometimes high-tech jumbled junk is one enthusiast’s treasured and enjoyable guilty pleasure worth its mindlessness in gold. Well, The Last Witch Hunter certainly will attract its share of followers as a gaudy and grainy fantasy adventure both big in scope and surreal absurdity. Still, this mythical monstrosity feels annoyingly strained and tries too hard to sell its outrageous, synthetic spryness.

The Last Witch Hunter is about larger-than-life throwaway silly thrills and cherishes its berserk-style entertainment with unapologetic relish. There is nothing inherently wrong with upping the ante in boisterous bounciness but Hunter is unfocused and all over the map while never committing fully to being a distinctive, impish-minded vehicle. Instead, Hunter is incoherent and erratically ridiculous as it shamefully incorporates bits and pieces from other better-made schlocky showcases.

The casting of the monotone and muscle-toned Vin Diesel seems inspired and logical for something as clumsily radical as The Last Witch Hunter. Diesel, the movie action star that made his notable mark in money-making film franchises that include The Fast and the Furious and Riddick entries, sinks his teeth into another so-called explosive characterization in Hunter’s 800-year old immortal witch hunter Kaulder. Of course Kaulder is a tortured soul and has made it his mission in hunting down naughty witches throughout his eternal existence. Kaulder needs to eradicate these magical misfits in his bid to deal with the tragic curse that has dominated his tattered psyche.

Kaulder may have an affinity for seeking and wreaking havoc on the notorious witches that threaten to corrupt the surroundings but he is partial to one witch in particular–the youngish Chloe (Rose Leslie from “Game of Thrones”) whose assistance is invaluable to the brooding Kaulder. Also, Kaulder is joined by diminutive cleric sidekick Dolan 37 (Elijah Wood) as well in the quest to hunt down these wily witches.

The mysterious vibes pertaining to Kaulder is somewhat realized. For instance, we know that Kaulder works steadily for the organization known as Axe and Cross. Plus, we are introduced to Kaulder’s only close buddy Dolan 36 (Oscar-winning Michael Caine) and are given a vague backstory about Kaulder’s troubled past and histrionics. The no-nonsense Kaulder’s passion for witch hunting is the only straight-forward sign that we definitely have no doubt about one way or the other.

""Witch"" way to go? Who knows but only one witch hunter can answer that in Vin Diesel's Kaulder from the flaccid fantasy THE LAST WITCH HUNTER
“Witch” way to go? Who knows but only one witch hunter can answer that in Vin Diesel’s Kaulder from the flaccid fantasy THE LAST WITCH HUNTER
In addition to highlighting Kaulder and company’s expectations to wipe away the “broomstick broads”, the plot starts to thicken as concerns are brewing involving the resurrection of the menacing creature in the Witch Queen (Julie Englebrecht). Naturally, the Witch Queen presents an immediate danger to the cautious Kaulder because of their nostalgic convoluted conflicts previously. Can the crazy-minded coven that looks to promote the Witch Queen succeed and overcome the slaying methods of Kaulder and his crew of crusaders?

Notoriously clichéd and cockeyed, The Last Witch Hunter is a corrosive concept meshed together with all the creative comparison of a tangled ball of yarn. Similarly, director Breck Eisner’s toothless witch fantasy adventure Hunter echoes the same kind of forgettable computer-generated gibberish that was evident in this year’s bombastic medieval miscue The Seventh Son featuring the Academy Award-winning Jeff Bridges front and center in another numbing sword-swinging, supernatural sideshow of sorts. The overall film project, plagued with Eisner’s scattershot direction and a tepid script by a trio of screenwriters in Cory Goodman, Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama (responsible for the disastrous Priest and Dracula Untold), screams of a flavorless stew–many ingredients are mixed in but a natural taste for the concoction never comes into fruition. Relentlessly murky and misguided, The Last Witch Hunter fails to trigger anything remotely intriguing beyond the furious flourishes of shocking, cartoonish imagery.  

The premise can be regarded as feeling woefully forced and choppy. The dank cinematography is indistinguishable and the visual special effects are an ambivalent hit-and-miss result depending on what frame of the movie’s indescribable spectacle that grabs your undivided attention at the moment. The storyline is hardly gripping or contemplative even from a campy standpoint. The Last Witch Hunter is frivolously flaccid and never manages to capture any of its dizzy-oriented imagination no matter how wildly off-kilter it tries to achieve in its aimless execution.

Diesel fans may buy his high-wire act in Hunter and go with the flow but the actor does not deviate away from the familiar characters he has revisited countless times over in his better known on-screen outings. For years Diesel has reveled in preposterous volt-making vehicles for the most part has captured the curiosity of his targeted demographics in both excitable fanboys and hormonal female followers alike. The question remains: can they show some solid consideration in having the balding bad boy of action-packed capers toil among the foolish inclusion of wayward witches and sorcerers in an exposition that looks as if it was conceived with a Middle Ages crayon? The supporting players in Hunter are as arbitrarily acknowledged as the saturated and over-indulgent whims of this far-fetched fable that seems uniquely colorless despite its chaotic grand package of black magic banality.

Somehow labeling Diesel’s Kaulder as the “last witch hunter” feels deceptive because if the Hollywood sequel machine has its way their version of “last” will undoubtedly be continuous into the next eye-rolling chapter. The real sinful hex at large that some unsuspecting moviegoers will ultimately suffer is succumbing to the laughable supernatural spell that The Last Witch Hunter will cast in insufferable, confusing fashion.

I have seen Vin Diesel in many avatars, from the sci-fi to action, adventure and thriller, they all suits him better, but this supernatural theme seems weird. There was lots of action, so it does not feel like a fantasy film, which is merely the idea of film concept. From the director of 'Sahara', the story of an cursed with eternal life witch hunter named Kaulder. Except the opening, the remaining film sets in the present New York city where he has to stop a witch who is trying to bring back the witch queen from the dead.

It was just another those films where the ancient meets the modern world. Okay, I agree a few films did impacted from the last two decades since the evolution of the CGI. Even though, they were not considered the greatest, in the meantime, I don't know where did this one come from. It was not based on any book, but I think just to make a few quick bucks using the star power. Other than that this film offers nothing new.

Yes, I liked the Diesel's presence in this, but he should not do films like this, except if the screenplay and role developed to his caliber. It was not a big box office hit, but merely survived and critically didn't. Even the film fanatics and fans of the star disappointed with it. Now I can't believe the sequel is announced, but I hope it won't take off. Anyway, it could become a decent television series rather than a film franchise.

Diesel is the reason for this film to look okay and the story was maybe the hundredth time used. Come on we all know this story, but with a new cast and the settings, it looks different. So for me the film was an average, other than that, I don't think it is worth recommending to the others. If you still want to see it, then pick the digital 3D version where you can at least enjoy some special effects.

5/10 || **The initial tableaux:** 

**Initial, part I**: We're in the black plague era in Europe, say 13th century.  The spread of the plague is attributed to the spellcasting of evil witches.  Vin Diesel's character, Kaulder, is one of the witch hunters who finds the Witch Queen.  Kaulder and company put an end to the plague, but at the cost of Kaulder's wife, his only child, and most of his hunter friends.  While dying, the Witch Queen curses Kaulder.

**Initial, part II**:  In current New York City, Kaulder is still hunting witches.  Yes, the same Kaulder. He's allied with an old group within the church, the Axe and Cross, which tries and imprisons witches.  They also keep secrets.  Kaulder's main contact with Axe and Cross is Dolan the 36th, played by Michael Caine, in one of those short roles that he does so well.  Dolan is quite old, and Dolan the 37th seems ready to take over being contact with the immortal Kaulder.

**Delineation of conflicts:**
In the present, witch activity seems to be picking up.  Something large is brewing.  Kaulder suffers a number of reverses, and his list of allies shrinks.

The film began in apocalyptic mode, and near the end it is almost there again.  Kaulder must face what he did not face the first time, 800 years ago.

**Resolution:** Will Kaulder find new allies, or must he carry the day himself?

**One line summary:** Attempt at another Vin Diesel movie franchise.

**_Statistics:_** 

**Cinematography:** 8/10 Well done on the whole; the visuals kept my attention.

**Sound:** 8/10 Dialog is clear.  Music seemed appropriate.

**Acting:** 5/10 Michael Caine was fine in his short role as noted above.  Vin Diesel is convincing as an action hero, even here with swords, magic, fists, and intention instead of cars, guns, and explosives. Julie Engelbrecht had her fine moments as Kaulder's arch nemesis, the Witch Queen, at the very beginning, and at the very end. Olafur Darri Olafsson was a blast as Belial, an in-your-face opponent for Kaulder.

Elijah Wood's performance sucked rocks.  Rose Leslie (Game of Thrones, 17 episodes) was almost interesting as Kaulder's on-again, off-again witch ally.  That was a bit weak, since she was supposed to be the female lead.

**Screenplay:** 5/10 Violence and threat moves the plot along, so the 106 minutes runtime does not drag too badly. I'm glad I saw the film, but would not watch it again.  Why not?  The narrative is not well-constructed.  It seemed like every five minutes there was some change or rules, or some impressive (?) artifact to consider.

At the end of the film, I felt that I should have been happier for the protagonist, but just could not be. Would there be major challenges for him in the centuries to come?  Would Chloe be a reliable ally? By this time I did not care, and I felt this to be a major failing of the film.

**_Final Rating:_** 6/10 I liked it better than most people did, but I would be hard pressed to say, 'you must see this one.'"

Probably no one would have anticipated it, this is a surprise movie, especially being an anti-Christmas theme. Possibly the one last time I enjoyed was a Finnish film called 'Rare Export', that's the name came in my mind after watching this. I also could not believe this rated PG13, well it differs in other countries. Of course, there are plenty of intensified frightening scenes, even for the adults, but no gores. The violence parts were well edited/shot, yet it makes sure they're still part of the story without showing them. I think it was a smart filmmaking keeping in mind the family audience. So in the end, I guess it paid off well.

I did not know the plot, as well as a few words that referred in the movie. But while watching it, I was worried about the graphics, because this is not a big budget film. Even the cast was not from the top league. Overall, it achieved a good result, that's the point. There are no major flaws as well, and the small ones can be easily ignorable. Because on the other side the movie provides a good suspenseful entertainment that makes you not to move the body or the eyeballs. After I'm saying all these, you should at least consider giving it a shot. But remember there's no story in it, it was constructed on a panic situation during the heavy blizzard when one after another begin to disappear.

7/10 || A mixed bag.

<em>'Krampus'</em> has a lot of potential, based on the dark themes we see. However, unfortunately, it dumbs itself down in festive family gathering melodrama. I also didn't rate the ending that much, not that it's bad per se - it's just meh to me.

Adam Scott is alright in the role of Tom, though is bettered by Toni Collette as Sarah; albeit minorly. The most interesting character is Krista Stadler's Omi, though they don't delve as deeply into her as I expected/wanted. Elsewhere, David Koechner's character, Howard, is kinda lame, but Koechner himself is solid. Of the younger actors, Emjay Anthony (Max) and Stefania LaVie Owen (Beth) are OK.

It does do positive things. Some of the tension building is good, even if their eventual pay-offs are a little underwhelming. The antagonists look cool, especially the gingerbread men and the jack-in-the-box. It works Xmas music vibes into the score well, also.

Nothing terrible, but it didn't work out all that enjoyably for me personally. || Heard some good things about this rendition of the forklore and while not bad with some funny moments and a decent cast, I wasn't totally enamored with this one. The effects were alright and the horror elements were fine, but never really was fully engaged. I don't know, not exactly a horror Christmas classic and not much desire to revisit anytime soon. **3.25/5**"
297761.0,Suicide Squad,"From DC Comics comes the Suicide Squad, an antihero team of incarcerated supervillains who act as deniable assets for the United States government, undertaking high-risk black ops missions in exchange for commuted prison sentences.",Worst.

Following the super-sized dud that was _Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice_ released a few months ago must really put some major pressure on Warner Bros. to gamble on ensuring that the presence of **Suicide Squad** does not meet the same kind of indifferent reception. Well, it turns out that although the anticipation was high for writer-director David Ayer's supervillain saga involving high-powered imprisoned rogues recruited as U.S. governmental operatives out to stop other skillful baddies (as it was for Zack Ryder's aforementioned ""Dawn of Justice"") the concoction of **Suicide Squad** feels like a colorful mishmash of collective misfits laboriously taking up space in a disjointed eye candy-coated spectacle that never manages to match its intended sizzle.

One would think that the premise for **Suicide Squad** would tap into the intriguing naughtiness with more robust gumption given the collection of super-powered oddballs asked to be immediate anti-heroes in this toothless jamboree of renegade rejects. Strangely, the grim and brooding presentation of **Suicide Squad** is more of an erratic downer than a hyperactive high-wire act as intended at the creative hands of Ayer. There is no reason why this lively group of adventurous agitators should appear so flat and inconsequential in a boisterous blockbuster that sporadically limps.

Given the twisted members that comprise this elite team of terrorizing tools it is very disappointing to see how **Suicide Squad** struggles with its so-called subversive themes. Sadly, this splattered mess never firmly grasps its bid for distinctive irreverence or off-balance exploitation. Instead, **Squad** feels strained in its execution and we are never really invested in entirely watching these treasured troublemakers find redemption because the story is soggy and uninspired. Furthermore, not all of the **Squad** participants are fleshed out satisfyingly for us to get behind with thirsty cynicism. The headlining leads in Will Smith's Floyd Lawton/Deadshot, Oscar-winner Jared Leto's green-haired Joker and Australian beauty Margot Robbie's Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn get the meaty standout parts while the lesser known supporting cast get stuck with chewing on the thankless remaining bone while seemingly acting as background furniture to the bigger names.

Naturally, desperation has set in for the U.S. government as they need to safeguard national security against advanced sinister forces that threaten the fiber of American self-interests everywhere. What better way to hire gifted protection than to consider employing the world's most incarcerated corruptible, cutthroat cretins to perform the dirty work in unforgivable mission ops that require death-defying determination. Enter U.S. Intelligence agent Amanda Waller (Oscar nominee Viola Davis). Waller's duties are to assemble the ragtag team known as the Suicide Squad--ominous (yet talented) jailbirds tapped to step in and assume superhero status (especially when the real superheroes are tied up in other crime-stopping affairs) while helping out for the greater good of our vulnerable society. In exchange for the Suicide Squad's sacrifice in turning from hell-bent heels to reluctant heralded heroes they are promised commuted prison sentences should they effectively defend and destroy the deadly foes out to promote heavy-handed havoc across the board.

Conveniently, bureaucratic bigwig Waller (through voiceover) introduces the Suicide Squad and describes what beneficial assets they bring to the turbulent table. Among the naughty notables include the well-known ace sniper Floyd Lawton/Deadshot as well as legendary lethal joy-boy Joker and his better (or perhaps worst half) in girlfriend Harley Quinn. The other toxic tag-a-longs along for the thrill ride of becoming rebellious rescuers include George Harkness/Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Chato Santana/El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Waylon Jones/Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje),  Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana, Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman).

Overall, **Suicide Squad** is surprisingly depressing and goes through the proverbial motions without so much as taking advantage of its surrealistic makeup. The movie never realizes its excitable potential and drifts into yet another superhero yarn that is more patchy than pronounced. Smith's Deadshot is out in the forefront but for the most part feels restrained and not as spry and savvy as one would imagine. Leto's Joker obviously pales in comparison to the brilliant and mesmerizing psychotic take on the role that earned the late Heath Ledger his posthumous Oscar statuette. In all fairness, nobody could inhabit the Clown Prince of Crime as Ledger uncannily did with committed concentration. Still, Leto's Joker--although viciously off-balance--felt recycled and furiously empty at times. Robbie's turn as Joker's misguided main squeeze merely comes off as a bratty Barbie Doll with synthetic edginess. The other **Squad** participants settle for the back burner more or less which is a crying shame because they should have been more engaged than the tepid material allowed them to be initially.

Woefully sketchy and missing the fueled opulence that one would expect emerging from this cockeyed costume caper **Suicide Squad** is a detonating dud for the missing explosive DC Comics movie brand that needs to step up the pace if they expect to make a consistent and challenging impression on the devoted fanboys at the box office looking to move beyond the sardonic fantasy-based realm of another redundant serving of a _Batman/Superman_ entry.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016) || Suicide Squad is the third and latest entry into the DCEU, and is about a bunch of bad guys that are rounded up to fight for someone else. And just like this year's BvS, this movie received overwhelmingly negative reviews by the critics and was divided among the fans. I was super curious to watch it because unlike many, I actually enjoyed the DCEU till this point. Enjoyed both Man of Steel and BvS. But unfortunately, this one's a mess.

The majority of the movie just feels choppy, editing was all over the place. Like they had a final product but because of disagreements, they took out a lot of scenes, shorten the runtime, and added others, making a giant choppy mess in the end. Scenes don't properly flow, including the flashbacks. Some scenes feel like they were added later (Probably the re-shoots) and they definitely didn't fit, particularly the elevator scene with Harley. The songs were all over the place as well. Some worked with their respective scenes, but most of them didn't, and again it felt like something added later, to give the movie a more jolly feel. And difference between development given to each member of the squad is astounding. Some were completely left in the dust, while some got a bit of line here and there, while some got a lot more development. Basically, to me it felt like that the movie reeked of studio involvement.

Also, the focus was just off. Movie is called Suicide Squad yet there is a whole lot of other stuff that gets way too much screentime. The whole end of the world plot was totally generic, uninteresting and unnecessary. The villain wasn't good, and the movements were weird, and not in a good way. Joker-Harley romance was also something padded on, and could have been removed in exchange for more screentime with the squad. 

Speaking of the Joker, he and his whole weird mafia/gangster lord type vibe didn't work for me. Jared Leto felt like he was trying too hard at times. There were moments where I saw the Joker I wanted in him, but those moments were swiftly followed by over the top feel that he gave most of the time. And that laugh....Yeah NOPE!!  

Even the action was mostly OK, apart from a couple of good scenes. There was no proper thrill, no proper buildup. Too many cuts. Say what you want about Snyder, but you have to admit that the dude can atleast direct amazing action sequences. 

And all of that sucks because there is stuff in the movie that works, like the main squad. Will Smith as Deadshot was great. He played his usual cool self and it worked. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was sexy and mostly good, because there were few instances where her dialogues gave me cringe. These two had a good chemistry together too. Also liked other members like El Diablo, Killer Croc, and captain Boomerang, all of whom were likable, had some fun moments etc. 

Plus, among all the mediocrity, there were glimpses of what the movie could have been like. Fun moments between the squad, some touchy moments, rare cool action sequences, full group scenes or rather a scene, the bar scene and such. 

Ultimately, The movie is like a mediocre cake covered with a thin layer of good frosting. The overall taste isn't bad, but it isn't good either. You enjoy the good frosting for a short while, and then have to deal with a whole lot of mediocre tasting body of the cake. I was disappointed. I really REALLY wanted to like this film. Pushed back all the negative or positive criticism and went in with an open mind. I'm not too hopeful what the extended cut will improve as 13 mins of footage isn't much, and I'm guessing it is Joker footage mostly.

It's funny that after watching this, I respect MCU more now considering what they were able to do with the more risky project: Guardians of the Galaxy.

Read the full review here: http://screen-space.squarespace.com/reviews/2016/6/22/independence-day-resurgence.html || **The earthlings are united to defend the home from another alien attack.**

I have said it many times that when I love a film, I always pray for a sequel to come. But I won't do that for all the films like perhaps 'Taken' and this one. These are not designed for that kind of a stretch or to own a franchise. So anyway they have made it and I'd watched. Since I was not expecting it, I did not care about the how it ends. I mean critically failed and the box office was okay, but did not meet the expectations. I mean not found anywhere near to the original film's collection.

For me, minus half point for the Chinese flavour. I think the Hollywood must stop leaning towards Chinese contents. It is like they are ignoring the rest of the world. I want the old days American films, not this yuan targeted films. Sorry, that is one of the reasons why I disliked films like this, 'Now You See Me 2' and many other recent sino-Hollywood films.

This story takes place 20 years later to the original film. Only a handful of characters returned and many of them were new. So now the humans leaped forward after adapting the alien technology. But when they learn the distress call was sent to the base of the enemy from the 20 years ago event, they are underprepared for another alien attack that follows very soon. Without any option they push their full force to defend the earth and it would they succeed or not is what the remaining film to reveal.

Nowadays the graphics are not an issue. The filmmaking had touched down for a standard in the visual quality, especially a big production like this. So those parts even overplay the performances of the real actors. We have seen that from Gollum, King Kong and many other monster films. So if you are watching a today's high end film means, it is a pleasure from the blow ups we expect the most. Similar to killings from the horror thrillers. This film does that so well, that mean it is entertaining, but not the overall film very praisable.

This story can be easily connected to many classics such as 'Star Wars' and 'Avatar'. Because how it ends seems like a story about the origins of those films. So the third film is like definitely takes us deep into the space. Looks very interesting, but does it work is the real question. It is already in the work with the same director. So lets wait and see how it corrects its mistakes. Meantime, you can watch this if you haven't yet, but it is an average film.

_5.5/10_ || Independence Day: Resurgence is pretty much what I expected. Actually, given all the negative reviews floating around, it is almost better than what I expected. As is almost always the case, all the 1 and 2 star ratings and “worst movie ever” reviews are pure bullshit. The biggest advantage the original movie had was the novelty of it all. This movie is really pretty much the same except for the special effects being even bigger to the extent that they are somewhat over the top at times and the plot somewhat thinner. Having said the latter, the original movie did not really have much in terms of plot either and the nonsense of giving a totally alien computer a virus was so bad it really dragged down the movie.

In the relatively short timespan of two decades humanity have improved their technology base by several orders of magnitude (ray guns on the moon etc. etc…). The speed of improvement is of course pretty unrealistic, even with access to alien technology, but hey, I can live with that in order to increase the coolness factor of the movie.

Then comes an alien ship. Not the aliens we all expected by another one. The ship is totally different from the previous ones, do not seem aggressive but of course dumbass politicians manage to screw everything up. Fast forward a couple of scenes and the “real” aliens arrive. Of course this time they have a bigger flyswatter and they perfunctorily proceed to swat away the puny, extremely slow firing, little ray guns of the humans and we are back to where we started in the original movie. Huge space ship parks on Earth, time for plan B.

Well there were quite a few scenes of big space ships, destruction and mayhem before the aliens finally manage to park their spaceship. I guess finding a parking space for a 5 000 kilometer space ship can be a bit tricky (I though I had an issue with my Jeep). Here is were I have quite some gripes about the movie. The special effects are cool, no question about it, but they are also exaggerated and throws any attempt to be remotely adhering to the laws of physics out the window. It is clear that whatever low intelligence storywriter that wrote that garbage flunked science classes in school, if he ever got that far of course. For instance, we have a 5 000 kilometer (the Earth radius is about 6 370 kilometer) that is big enough to generate its own gravity (apparently the engines somehow contributed to this) flies in and lands on earth. When it approaches items on the surface, cars, trains, ships, skyscrapers and bits and pieces of the Earth itself starts to fly upwards. It makes for cool effects but anyone with a mediocrum of intelligence ought to realize that such a force would actually destabilize Earth itself. Possibly change the speed of rotation as well as the orbit around the sun.

The story is full of other typical Hollywood stupidities and plot holes. Christ even my kids could spot the plot holes which were often big enough to drive a battleship through!

As for the acting. Well, I would say there is not too much to say about it. Most of the main actors managed to make it through the movie without screwing up too badly. Given that it was not the deepest or thought provoking movie one could imagine I would say that was good enough. The best character in my opinion was Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson. The worst one was probably Dr. Okun. Not that Brent Spiner was making a bad job of representing him but the character was just to crazed out for my taste.

Okay, I will stop whining now. This movie was pretty much exactly what I expected. Great special effects tied together with a paper thin story. I went into it hoping that the effects were going to be good with little expectations on the rest and that is exactly what I got. The movie fulfilled my expectations completely and thus I consider it worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed the two hours watching it."
188927.0,Star Trek Beyond,"The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a mysterious new enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.",The final frontier...and beyond.,"Action, Adventure, Science Fiction",122.0,2016-07-07,en,6.784,6781.0,5.6152,"Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldaña, Simon Pegg","Justin Lin, Doug Jung, Simon Pegg","spacecraft, sequel, stranded, hatred, lgbt, space opera, gay theme","Some diehard **Star Trek** fans may not necessarily feel that the Justin Lin-directed third installment of this science fiction/space saga film franchise “boldly goes where no man has gone before” creatively. Surprisingly, Lin (director of two “Fast & Furious” flicks) shows some engaging and intriguing heft in **Star Trek Beyond** as the adventurous exploits of the USS Enterprise crew are likely to stir the collective pot where the nostalgic sentiments of the Star Trek brand from yesteryear bridges the gap to the current cinematic explosiveness of modern-day Captain Kirk and company. Although it is extremely difficult to immediately dismiss filmmaker J.J. Abrams’s resourceful fingerprints concerning the imaginative **Star Trek** (2009) and the thoroughly enjoyable **Star Trek Into Darkness** (2013) he graciously steps aside to allow Lin’s energizing directorial vision to further explore Trek mythology on the big screen.

Essentially, **Star Trek Beyond** is a vibrant cosmic canvas that is expansive in its boundaries of exploration. Visually arresting, well-paced and armed with compelling story-telling and a healthy dosage of curiosity and mystery, Lin manages to stay true to the traditional Trek-oriented universe by incorporating rousing special effects and offering a galactic grandeur of planetary peculiarities and exotic alien races to stimulate the exquisite narrative. Screenwriters Doug Jung and Simon Pegg (Star Trek’s on-screen character Montgomery “Scotty” Scott) incorporate an eye-opening mixture of dramatic edginess, off-the-cuff humor and the cohesive rapport among the cast-mates that have inherited the iconic Star Trek personalities and made these familiar faces from the classic 60’s TV show and previous non-reboot films a revelation in the millennium age of blockbuster sci-fi action adventure.

The plot channels in a sense of challenging malaise for the USS Enterprise’s top officers in Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). What seemingly spices things up regarding the deja vu space journeys aboard the spacecraft is the questionable and powerful device that Kirk and his crew are babysitting. This powerful tool of destruction is capable of destroying humanity as we know it. In particular, the opportunistic Krall (Idris Elba) is the lizard-looking culprit determined to get his diabolical hands on the corrosive contraption. Naturally, Krall and his menacing minions must subdue Kirk and his crew to achieve success in having this ominous object in his deadly grasp. Krall’s willingness to cripple the USS Enterprise proved to be an ambitious mission fully accomplished. For Kirk and his group the results were disheartening as Krall’s forceful attacks rendered the ship disabled as it crashed on the desolate planet of Altamid. Thus, Kirk and his charges are stranded on his rocky haven with no hope in sight. The harsh reality for the vulnerable USS Enterprise visitors, besides being divided and scattered in all directions on this problematic planet, involved getting into survival mode as the hostile reptilian creatures surrounded them at will.

The aforementioned split of Kirk and his exposed cohorts called for a series of various crisis carried on at different, chaotic spots. Kirk and Russian crew member Pavel Chekov (played by the late Anton Yelchin) were primarily tasked with trying to rescue their colleagues from the claws of Krall and his cronies. Elsewhere, Dr. Bones (Keith Urban) tries to patch up the injured Spock following the aftermath of the ship’s wrecking. Pegg’s Scotty and womanly warrior in alien Jayla (Sofia Boutella) make the valiant effort in trying to reach Kirk in the middle of total ribaldry.

**Star Trek Beyond** has stylized flash and Lin ensures that his pulsating production stays faithful to the Trek legacy. Sure, **Beyond** is not anything innovative or wildly distinctive in comparison to the other earlier entries but it still thrives where it counts in the spectacle of space-aged escapism. The cast is solid as the players–Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Urban, Yelchin as well as Zoe Saldana’s Uhura and John Cho’s Sulu–all demonstrate a suspenseful unity on screen and give the audience an indescribable excitement in this latest chapter that far from disappoints. Elba’s Krall is robustly villainous in physicality and attitude and the alien race featured are interestingly hypnotic in creepiness. Lin, in the same vein as Abrams, is not shy about gift-wrapping his **Star Trek** edition in boisterous, sweeping helpings of scope and whimsy.

Overall, this kinetic outing of **Beyond** practically guarantees that the rebooted **Star Trek** phenomenon will not be experiencing its final frontier any time soon.

(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2016) || I saw this movie two hours ago and I can't remember how it started. Ah. Diplomatic mission to offer a truce artifact to one of the warring sides from the other. It does not go well. Just a tad shy of 3 years into the 5 year mission and Kirk is bored enough to take a desk job. Screenplay set-up signifying it's all about to get much less stultifying. I don't know enough about camera angle choices to know if that's what makes the film feel disjointed, or the script, or editing chops, but something certainly felt unconnected. I started noticing details I had no business noticing. Everybody's hair is bigger. I watched Galaxy Quest recently, and when Krall showed up I choked on popcorn. In fact, prosthetics needed an above the title billing. Running from intruders in a dark corridor, I could see Uhura's earrings glinting. If I could see those, the enemy could, too. The device designed to End The Universe is too much like Big Hero 6. The space station too much like Elysium. And the jumpstart of a starship too much like Furious 7. One of these days in the near future scenic designers will stop putting skyscrapers on hula hoops in deep space. And it's a space station - where are all the people running to when the bad stuff starts happening? It's a scene device that needs to go. The Bad Dude airship docking station is right out of Independence Day. Can we get a little new here? Visual effects are gooey (literally) with some stuff that may or may not be a cue to the bee reference, and is at one point, squished out I don't know how while Kirk rides a vintage motorcycle in circles. And then the squish hardens. I also don't know how, or what that goo was supposed to keep in or out. Much of this is superfluous, but the story was not interesting enough to make me stop looking around. There are way too many wire bundles, a feature of Star Trek Next Gen Borg episodes. When we finally get the Bad Dude's backstory, it isn't enough. Kirk's bored, Bad Dude is disappointed, and how the hell Uhura survives every encounter requires too much suspension of belief. I also noticed that the guys in the theater were sporting ball caps with sunglasses perched on the brim. Noticing fashion in the cinema is not why I go to the movies. Read this week that Chris Hemsworth has signed on to the next Star Trek as George Kirk. Does not bode well for new better adventures. || Star Trek Beyond is what a summer blockbuster is all about.

No surprise why this film failed to excite me, but a few people thinks its a passable sequel. The original movie was atypical, so the success followed it. In my perspective better that should have left as a one-off movie. But as a low budget product, they knew it was going grab back twice, thrice they spent because of the star value and indeed the first film's influence.

There is no story, simply based on the usual Hollywood road adventure like the flicks 'Fanboys', 'Dumb and Dumber To', 'Not Suitable for Children' et cetera, except the character Ted which makes this theme a special. A couple of good jokes and that's it, the rest were ineffective, sometime keep repeating the same ones. The 2 hours in a too plain concept, is way too long to sit and watch/focus.

The cameos were weak, or maybe worthless/meaningless, especially Liam Neeson's. The best things were the production quality, acting and like I mentioned before, the character Ted. For the one time watch, I think kind of manageable, but definitely not suitable for repeat viewing or to recommend it to the others. But overall, a little disappointed with the outcome. They have got one more chance to end this franchise on a high note as a decent trilogy if the next film gets a better storyline.

6/10 || Ted 2 packs more unhumorous stuffing within its formulaic synthetic fur. MacFarlane is a talented comedian, I’m sure of it. His profusely crude humour captivating millions with his legendary ‘Family Guy’ TV show. Even ‘Ted’ was tolerable to a certain degree, and that’s saying something. Yet here we are, with an inevitable sequel, that essentially felt like a glorified episode of the aforementioned animation. It’s cutaway structure for unrelated gags. Relentless wave of pointless cameos. Ted becoming Peter Griffin. Close your eyes, let the voices infiltrate your senses and you’ll soon realise it’s just ‘Family Guy’, just less funny. Ted now married and struggling to maintain his relationship, has his rights taken away when he is no longer viewed as person but property instead.

A particularly strong aspect to this comedy that more or less is the power source of its story, raising a civil rights lesson in ethics and morality. It was so *interesting* that Morgan Freeman himself got involved and slam dunked the jury with his God-like soothing voice. And despite Seyfried actually picking up the script’s remnants and transforming the scraps into a functional film, it’s utterly forgettable. So much so, that once Wahlberg becomes drowned in rejected semen samples (literally swimming with the sperm...), I experienced a moment of déjà vu (ironically, so did Ted). Surprisingly, I had seen the first half before. Yet it took me a decent forty minutes to encounter this epiphany, that’s how unmemorable this comedy truly is.

It exercises all of the same plot points from its predecessor, the inclusion of the mentally unhinged Donny and the friendly break-up between the leads cement this sentiment, and rarely explored new avenues. Sure the friendly chemistry remained intact, but only one or two lines made me frustratingly chuckle, mostly due to Warburton’s comedic execution (urgh, that voice...). Besides that, there’s nothing here. Same old MacFarlane profanity. Worth a squeeze if you enjoyed the first film, but exhausts its preset lines of dialogue extremely rapidly. “I love you”? Eh, please don’t."

To be honest, I have been looking forward this since the day I came to know about it. But it took so long to come out, even the Windows OS has upgraded thrice since then. After all these years, now I feel this is not what I wanted. It should have been different, especially the story. It was a fine animation, including all the technical aspect had no issues, but the story was not convincing.

Seemed just like another version of 'The Croods'. In fact, crossover between these two would be awesome like the boy from this and the family from other title as an original family who lost each other for some reason. But the trouble is, both are from the different production house and coming together is a tough task.

The civilised dinosaurs? That's kind of weird, but in a children's story and animation, all are fair. So I turned into one and enjoyed it. Apatosaurus are farmers, T-Rex are cowboys, yeah whole new perspective, apart from the humans who are still in lower on the chart of dominance and intelligent.

In my opinion, I'm being honest with what I felt. The theme about self discovery and to throw away fear is inspiring for the little children. At a same time, it is not a freshly developed story, kind of reminds 'The Lion King'. I know they're not same, but the initial parts are, between father and son. You can watch it once or twice, because it is not a boring film, but not the best.

7/10 || Okay. I loved this up until the end. His height has been clearly defined.

Wilderness in this is incredible. I love that forest canyon. Wide sweeping shots. Fun characters and good conflicts. So much crazy tension built up to the scene where everything comes to a head. And it's dinosaurs running around bashing stuff up.

I once swam in a river down stream from a dam. Every moment I imagined I would die smashing into rocks and trees as a wall of water took me out. || I know I'm about fifty years too old for the demographic here, but I quite enjoyed this adventure. It's all fairly routine as timid young dinosaur ""Arlo"" gets accidentally washed downstream after an altercation with a tiny human whom he quickly names ""Spot"". Both of these characters want to find their way home but there are a flock of pterodactyls who have their eyes fixed on a small, bite-size, snack. Despite their initial reservations, the two realise that they have a better chance of survival if they work together and so off they set on a series of escapades trying to find their way back. It's not terribly original, no, but the two characters - especially the young lad, are quite engaging to watch as they demonstrate the benefits of inter-reliance, affection and all the usual messages typically conveyed in these sort of family animations. That said, it does manage to steer clear of too much cheesy sentiment for the most part and there's some fun in the dialogue as the menacing, though thankfully quite hapless, dactyls give them quite an hard time. The animation is grand scale and colourful - though maybe a bit on the two-dimensional side at times, and the story flows along effortlessly for ninety minutes that you'll probably never remember but it's a solid and light-hearted watch."

We're in too deep, and he knows it! God help us all. 

Black Mass is the story of Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), who was the brother of a state senator and the infamous violent leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang. It charts his criminal activities and his subsequent dealings with the FBI.

Directed by Scott Cooper, Black Mass is one of those instances where a great lead performance deserves a better over all film. Depp literally inhabits the role of Bulger in a fully formed perf that reminds us of what a fine actor he can be. Unfortunately the edgy material to hand never really ignites in filmic form. Maybe we were spoilt by the offerings of Coppola and Scorsese previously? For this comes off as a cheap imitation of far greater films, with the crafters of the pic giving us something of a caricature piece.

Although compelling as a lead character study, much of the narrative is rendered as playing it safe, putting emotive heart where it doesn't belong. Most of the support characters, and key to the story, are under developed, while the pace is decidedly attention sapping and not adroitly understated. Nevertheless, we do get good acting perfs to support Depp, notably Joel Edgerton as corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while Masanobu Takayanagi's (Hostiles) cinematography is delicate of moody hues.

There's a fascinating story trying to get out of this, but the 15 year wait to get it to screen hasn't been worth it. There's some truly electric scenes, but they are few and far between, which gives us ultimately just a compact and safe piece of gangster film making. 5/10 || Second time watching this and honestly outside a couple of scenes, I barely remembered anything. Thought the acting was fine, as was the direction but considering the cast that included Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon and others, thought what an epic crime-thriller could've been instead was a solid enough film but not much more than that. Also, the make-up job done on Depp was distracting more than anything. **3.5/5** || Not as bad as Depps other true life stories, but nothing great that you'll want to explore more then once. If you're watching for Cumberbatch, he's barely in it. I get they were using him in the marketing and on talk shows. But the clips shown on chat shows and shots in trailers are every scene he's in. Once again the US government and the people who work for it are corrupt. Big surprise."
206647.0,Spectre,"A cryptic message from Bond’s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.",,"Action, Adventure, Thriller",148.0,2015-10-26,en,6.56,10764.0,6.6554,"Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Monica Bellucci",Sam Mendes,"based on novel or book, spy, secret agent, sequel, mi6, british secret service, united kingdom","<a href=""http://www.cutprintfilm.com/reviews/spectre/""</a>

In hindsight my excitement for Spectre seems a bit foolish. After Skyfall, director Sam Mendes openly stated that he wouldn’t direct another Bond movie. And even so, Skyfall wasn’t the best of the new Bond films by any measure – dragging on for much too long. But somehow I got sucked into the hype of Mendes’ vision for an homage to the classic Bond, with that somewhat iconic poster of Craig mimicking Roger Moore, and trailers the emphasized a kind of retro re-visitation of some old villains and themes. But Spectre is none of those things, instead it is a film where everyone involved feels like they are just going through the motions. Spectre tries very hard to be an homage to the vintage James Bond classics, but instead ends up feeling more like a mockery of the series.

For starters the script is outrageously weak and predictable. Bond goes from shootout, to chase, to sex scene, saying and doing the exact same things he has done for the last 23 movies. Instead of a complete story, the film is just a collection of set pieces and scenes loosely stitched together. And while some of them work well on their own, by the second or third fight scene, you won’t be able to stop yourself from yawning. When you aren’t yawning you’ll be laughing, and not in a good way. The dialogue is downright cheesy. Gone is all of Bond’s smooth charm and ability to sting his opponent’s with his tongue just as much as with his gun. Instead at one point, he throws a watch bomb and says: “Time flies!”

Bond is one a secret mission, assigned to him by M (Judi Dench) via a video message delivered after her death. The film doesn’t ever attempt to invest the audience in this mission, or in Bond’s motivation for seeking out Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz) – which apparently has something to do with his foster-father and his childhood, again – but it never seems important to the story or to James. Meanwhile, a new joint secretary, Max or C as he is known (Andrew Scott), is attempting to unite the world’s intelligence under one surveillance network – and through doing so making the Double-0 program obsolete. Lucky for him, Sam Mendes is already doing that for him.

However, Spectre is a beautiful film. There are about five or six huge set pieces, all of which are wonderfully filmed. And if you are just in the mood the veg out and watch Bond cruise through the streets of Rome in a prototype Aston Martin, than this is the movie for you. But things go on for entirely too long, which would be fine if something of interest were happening. But almost nothing does. Bond gets in a situation and gets out, all while throwing a few pithy, laughable, lines out.

Daniel Craig has never been more disconnected from the character James Bond, than he is in Spectre. I must say first, that I love Craig as an actor and as James Bond – he is my favorite of all the Bonds. But here, he is uncharacteristically not James Bond. A scene for instance where bond throws his gun into the river, is done in such a fancy foppish way that I cringed. It is tough to properly convey how Craig misses the mark in Spectre, but when you see it, you won’t be able to help feeling the same way.

Maybe Sam Mendes and screenwriter John Logan did succeed at creating a perfect homage to the Roger Moore era Bond films? Because in reality, none of those films standout as great movies. From start to finish, Spectre feels like someone filling out a madlibs of Bond scenes, and praying that when they read it back, it makes some sense. || Well, cinema’s most treasured and resilient British spy guy is back as the legendary James Bond makes his twenty-fourth outing on the big screen in the highly anticipated and slickly-made Spectre. Worldwide Agent 007 fans understandably maintain their embedded expectations and vision as to what calculating and cunning mission their suave and sophisticated gun-toting, martini-sipping espionage thrill-seeker will encounter in his latest globe-trotting episode. Whatever Bond enthusiasts have in mind for the future twenty-fifth entry of the “licensed to kill” Lothario they should simply settle for the present stimulating currents that trickle as mind-bending material in the polished and percolating Spectre.

As for the dynamic performer that have served his time with action-oriented cinematic sensibilities through three previous super-charged James Bond installments, the steely-jawed and diligent Daniel Craig is back on the saddle again for his fourth stint as the crafty 007. Naturally both ardent and casual Bond followers can rattle off the filmography of Craig’s on-screen tour of duty as the debonair and daring secret service operative and even rate the previous films as they compare and contrast each edition.  Some may give special attention to Craig’s first foray into stepping inside Bond’s explosive shoes for 2006’s Casino Royale that is considered a spectacular introduction for the dramatically trained actor. In 2008’s Quantum of Solace, it was a mixed bag at best as Bond followers for the most part gave this second 007 rendition an ambivalent sign of approval (not too many were thrilled with the awkward movie title either). Thankfully, 2012’s Skyfall bounced back for Craig’s take on the roguish Bond and made for some exceptional brownie points as the cagey spy returning to creative prominence. Now 2015’s Spectre hopes to make some hearty tie-ins to Craig’s past big screen adventures as the stoic jet-setting dynamo ridding the world of masterful riff raff.

In actuality, Spectre is serviceable in that it is an elaborate and excitable reminder of the preceding Bond films where bits of nostalgic elements from yesteryear are sprinkled throughout its presentation. Sure, some wily 007 fanatics may spot a few of the tossed in nods to the aforementioned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace in particular as the proceedings unfold. For the most part, Spectre acts as a mere bridge to the launching of the upcoming 25th Bond actioner in waiting. To be fair the other Bond films have served as a welcome mat to the next chapter of the late Ian Fleming’s engaging and charismatic man of action so why should not Spectre be any different in this regard? Still, this spy caper has its signature swagger that Bond aficionados relish with familiarity: heart-pumping action sequences, exquisite locales, desirable and devious Bond women, majestic car chases, larger-than-life villains and their loyal henchmen, imaginative gadgets and inventive technology and yes…the indomitable James Bond at your service. Nevertheless. the minor knock on Spectre is that it could have risen to the occasion more than it did as it occasionally feels as if it is going through the mischievous motions. It never resorts to the levels of Bond-ish drudgery in Quantum of Solace so that certainly is a relief in that aspect.

Spectre does incorporate its share of opulence, mystery, suspense, shadowy tension and perilous plight. However, where the standard Bond film-making characteristics are somewhat consistent and captivating (i.e. the breathtaking opening sequence of the Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City) there is also a questionable consideration for the weak-kneed Bond theme song in Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall” which seems so inadequately suited for a James Bond signature tune. Even the indifferent observers of the James Bond film franchise for the last five decades can attest to the two most important stamps of a Bond film–its opening scene and surging theme song.  Thankfully, Spectre’s grand opening sequence obeys traditional Bond practices but Smith’s doggedly tired-sounding “Writing’s on the Wall” feels as it belongs attached to an old televised After School special from the mid-70s. Wouldn’t you give your kingdom for Paul McCartney and Wings’ “Live and Let Die” or Carly Simon’s “Nobody Does It Better” or perhaps even Sheena Easton’s “For Your Eyes Only”?

One thing that can be said about Craig’s Bond in Spectre and that is his image transformation has been elevated to that of a fashion plate whose GQ stylized look has taken quite a step up. Not since Roger Moore’s Bond has there been a clear case of dazzling attire on display for Agent 007 to strut his stuff in spiffy clothing accessories throughout his ventured travels. Craig, billed as a “blue-collar” Bond whose demeanor is more blunt and workman-like, takes comfort in basking in the finesse shadows of a classic Agent 007 almost foreign to his distinctive spin on the iconic spy. In fact, the overall vibe for Spectre seems to lie in the middle of old school and new school James Bond mythology where the shading suits both camps of the ever-lasting film franchise.

Director Sam Mendes, who handled the direction for the previous Skyfall, finds the right tone and temple for Spectre that certainly shows off its lavish and ambitious production values as the set designs, scenic locations, fabulous pre-credits action sequence are all indescribable in majestic scope. No one can accuse Spectre as to not holding its own in visual functionality. Wisely, Mendes does not forget his Skyfall background players as they reunite with Craig’s Bond and partake in the sensationalized cat-and-mouse caper. It is refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes back as “M” not to mention Ben Wishaw’s “Q” front and center. And a Craig-fronted Bond film would not be the same without Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny.

Agent 007 fans will find a common ""Bond"" with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinettic SPECTRE
Agent 007 fans will find a common “Bond” with Daniel Craig and his fourth outing as the licensed to kill Lothario in the stunning and kinetic SPECTRE
It is a given that the diabolical criminal network known as SPECTRE has always had its affiliation with the Bond universe especially in the classic Sean Connery Bond-age years. Instinctively, SPECTRE’s evil heart and soul was pumped continuously by that organization’s dastardly mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Oscar winner Christoph Waltz does the sordid honors of taking the reins as Bond’s nemesis Franz Oberhauser in Spectre with devilish delight and is more colorfully corrupt thanks to his handy go-to muscular minion Mr. Hinx (ex-professional WWE wrestler and “Guardians of the Galaxy” star Dave Bautista) echoing the memories of beloved brute Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel) from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker). 

We can never forget that along with Agent 007 folklore comes the responsibility of being labeled a treasured Bond babe. And although the latest sultry women represented in Spectre will never make us forget the iconic likes of Dr. No’s Ursula Andress (Honey Ryder) or Casino Royale’s Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) for that matter they still hold their own and give a measure of titillation to both Bond and the vast amount of male admirers wishing they carried a gun and wore expensive tuxedos while being at the receiving end of a provocative smooch by these vibrant vixens. Lea Seydoux’s Madelene Swann and Italian siren Monica Bellucci’s Lucia are on board as the Bond bombshells for hire.

As a whole, Spectre has its up and down moments and never is quite sure about standing alone as an independent Bond story or being dismissed as a pit stop for 007-related flashbacks and reference bits ode to yesteryear’s glory of the super spy’s engaging and raging exploits. The verdict is that Spectre ultimately satisfies one’s craving for the invincible James Bond whether you can to relive his vintage reputation or look forward to a millennium-enhanced production that will grow with the ageless wonderment pertaining to Fleming’s literary ladies man-turned movie-making mainstay of action-packed cinema for half a century. As one-time Bond songbird Carly Simon would attest in her soothing lyrics, “nobody does it better…”  Yet in the dimensional escapist world of James Bond this particular go-around could have been a tad bit better.

Fassbender gives a very good performance, but it swallows everybody else in the movie.

What I don't like that much of this version is that Lady Macbeth almost fades away. Her character is not as important as it should be and, in the end, everything is expected and everything becomes a bit boring. || The thing about this play is that it is almost impossible to distil it down to two hours. Like most of Shakespeare's tragedies, there is immense richness in the language; in the pace the story develops; in the nuanced characterisations and in the imagery. Sure, the medium can reduce the need for much of the more descriptive narrative but it still takes time for the plotting and scheming; the menace and the power lust to percolate through. Now this isn't a terrible interpretation. Michael Fassbender is reasonable as the ambitious Thane of Glamis. He is informed by three witches after a battle that his accession to King Duncan's throne is assured, and together with his equally determined wife (Marion Cotillard) he sets about expediting that process. Not everyone believes his feigned innocence though, and that means he has to start removing his detractors - not least Banquo (Paddy Considine) and the late king's son Malcolm (an oddly cast Jack Raynor), and it's at this point that their cunning plan begins to unravel. The film looks great, the soundtrack is eerie and effective and the costumes, scenery and lighting really do help to convey something of the real Scottish environment; but again the absence of many significant plot lines - the caveats with the witches' initial prophecy, for example, rob the storyline of much of it's complex potency. The character of Lady Macbeth is underused as an underpinning motivation for her husband's actions and essentially we are just left with a rather straightforward story of power-hungry murder. It is worth watching, but it is also underwhelming."

US film or UK film is not an issue, but the real question was the second movie required? Plenty of films are made in a short period of gap about the same person like 'Infamous' and 'Capote', themes like 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'White House Down', and sometimes remakes like 'Deaths at a Funeral' from other film industries. So the history says audience accepts only they are different from each other and so this film was, but very very sad it bombed at the box office.

Like everybody I was not interested in this, even though it was from a renowned filmmaker. But after watching it now, I felt I was terribly wrong. Actually, this is the best version so far about the Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs. It was entirely a different narration than the previous one, everything was like the backstage drama that takes place before every product launch. That means most of the film was shot in the auditoriums and its corridor, parking lot, rooftop, and other surround places.

All the affairs like family, friends, co-founders, business, troubles et cetera are brought into one place and dealt there itself. Surely a very cleverly written screenplay and display by the actors, especially the two Oscars nominee Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslate. Once again Danny Boyle proved his directional skill with this beautiful biopic. I did not LIKE the end scene, but LOVED it. In fact, this film's end and Ashton Kutcher film's opening scenes has a clean follow. I also felt the movie was very honest, but I don't how much since I'm not into the books to learn about the famous personalities. It's not a must see, but definitely worth a try.

Having not seen any previous films in this series, I had nothing to compare with it and to blame for. Though I have seen many similar films, but it was not as bad as they say. In this kind of theme, the basic storyline always remains same, the remaining parts like the characters, locations and the diversions in the story developments are the key. I think they did that decently, the two new directors who also penned the screenplay.

Well, this is the story of the Griswold family of a couple and their two teen sons. After realising his family is spiritless with the normal life, the husband surprises his wife and the children to go a vacation. The trip is supposed to have fun, but they find hard to come along in a single mood as a family. Meanwhile, their journey begins to face many hurdles, though they are not giving up. So how memorable their adventure becomes is what unfolds in the remaining section.

The cast was good. Both, Ed Helms and Chritina Applegate was impressive, though the film is not laudable. Not all the jokes, but some of them were really cool and most of them were adult stuffs. Yep, this is an R rating film, not a family film, despite the impression you get from its posters. So for the grown ups, this is not a bad film to give a try. I can't suggest or reject on the merit of its previous installments, because I've already given the reason. People like me can definitely have a good time with it.

_6.5/10_ || As one theres has seeing the originals, I have feared it was a complete rip-off, but yes there is many smilarities, but they have actual succefull made a movie with so much fun and new spins. || <em>'Vacation'</em> is a poor final film (for now, you know they'll make another some day) of this series. It is officially a sequel to the previous films, though it's practically a reboot of sorts - one that, evidently, didn't lead to much. All of this just feels lacklustre and forced.

Ed Helms and Christina Applegate aren't the best pairing, their performances aren't anything to shout about either. Helms particularly feels ill-fitting for his role. Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins, the kids, are actually fairly decent, better than the adults for sure.

Chris Hemsworth's part is a little amusing, though very quickly gets repetitive; despite minimal screen time. Another two who also appear for only a short time are Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Good to see 'em return but again, forced. D'Angelo is super sidelined, barely has a line iirc.

Some of the 'supporting cast' are at least interesting to see involved, namely Charlie Day, Ron Livingston, Keegan-Michael Key, Regina Hall and there's a small cameo from a certain <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> star - I didn't expect it, but welcomed all the same.

Anyway, yeah... glad this was the last movie. This 2015 flick is very short of laughs. 5/10 it is, for me."
250574.0,Creep,"Looking for work, Aaron comes across a cryptic online ad: “$1,000 for the day. Filming service. Discretion is appreciated.” Low on cash and full of naiveté, he decides to go for it. He drives to a cabin in a remote mountain town where he meets Josef, his cinematic subject for the day. Josef is sincere and the project seems heartfelt, so Aaron begins to film. But as the day goes on, it becomes clear that Josef is not who he says, and his intentions are not at all pure.",Like the song by Radiohead?,"Horror, Thriller",82.0,2014-06-23,en,6.386,1494.0,4.1276,"Mark Duplass, Patrick Brice, Katie Aselton",Patrick Brice,"psychopath, bath, mountain, stalker, woods, dying man, murder, serial killer, cabin, axe murder, found footage, video tape, animal mask, ax","The disturbing and mind-bending ‘Creep’ certainly startles with its sense of sophisticated salaciousness, so why should it not meet the expectations of its haunting and hallucinatory hedonism? After all ‘Creep’ was from the handlers that gave fright fans unnerving and twitchy thrills in fear-monger flicks such as ‘Paranormal Activity’ and ‘The Purge’. Granted that the found footage genre has become rather obligatory but there are moments when one can declare a sense of distinction and devilish freshness where frightfests in the realm of ‘Creep’ can compel with warped and contemptible glee. When a flinching film can muster up an erratic combination of chaos and comedy and still manage to stay on course in its horrific havoc then vehicles such as ‘Creep’ can claim bragging rights in the slight re-invention of the aforementioned and omnipresent found footage theme.

Part of ‘Creep’s unctuous appeal is steeped in the wicked and wayward imaginations of collaborators in director/co-writer Patrick ‘The Overnight’ Brice (making his directorial feature debut here), co-writer/co-star Mark Duplass and producer Jason Blum (‘Paranormal Activity’, ‘Insidious’, ‘Sinister’). These morbid masterminds effectively instill the aptly-named ‘Creep’ with bountiful black humour in this glorified goose-bump fable that proudly struts its low-budgeted, atmospheric indie chops armed with outrageous dares and scares.

Unemployed videographer Aaron (Patrick Brice) unknowingly fishes out the on-coming scrutiny when he answers a Craigslist ad requesting the secretive side of film-making. Thus, Aaron travels to an isolated cabin in the middle of the desolate mountains to meet up with Josef (Mark Duplass, from TV’s ‘The League’). The sickly Josef, proclaiming his supposedly cancer-stricken condition, wants to be filmed on video as he prepares a diary for his unborn son. Well, the gesture seems heartfelt enough under the surface and something that Aaron should handle with kid gloves, right?

Aaron’s assignment at first appears innocuous as he gathers the insights and intimate moments that Josef provides for the sake of his future offspring. In fact, the two men even become somewhat close and bond together as they wander in the mountains mixing business with a bit of pleasure tossed in for good measure. Soon, Josef steadily starts to show his true colors as his interviews become intense and erratic. The darkness of Josef’s moods shift ominously back and forth. Hence, Aaron understandably becomes quite weary of his videotaped creepy companion’s behavior. It certainly does not help that Aaron unravels some sordid secrets regarding Josef’s unsettling backstory. Just where does Josef’s degree of delusions figure in as far as Aaron’s perspective is concerned?

The shocking moments in ‘Creep’ serves its purpose effectively, especially when the cat-and-mouse titillation and tension is enveloped in a low-budget, knee-jerking production that thankfully is refreshingly taut as it is naughtily off-kilter in its serving of several jittery jump scares and, of course, the edginess of the two men, one armed with suspicion and paranoia and the other one bottled up in a hefty grip of psychosis. The constant antagonism that the creepy Josef demonstrates towards Aaron is a traumatising tease that eerily registers with numbing realization. Fittingly, the found footage fear factor angle does not overtake or drown out the psychological give-and-take anxiety between the defensive Aaron and demented Josef.

If anything, ‘Creep’ manages to not exhaust the found footage foundation as a gory gimmick that many of these kinds of fright flicks fall victim much too often. Instead, the movie is shrewdly aware to take a smirking poke at the impish concept through shaky satirical means. The real trepidation lies in the sometimes quiet yet manic motives of Josef, a live wire that can explode at any minute yet leaves one wondering as to when and where his menacing madness will filter out as it is directed toward his nearby guinea pig in the vulnerable Aaron. Both Brice and Duplass are convincingly engrossing as contributing co-writers and co-stars of an edge-of-your-seat chiller that does not necessarily need to overwhelm the audience’s nervous system with grotesque tactics of torture to bring along the bloody chase of a detached thrill.

Creep (2015)

The Orchard

1 hr. 20 mins.

Starring: Mark Duplass and Patrick Brice

Directed by: Patrick Brice

MPAA Rating: R

Genre: Horror and Suspense

Critic’s Rating: *** stars (out of 4 stars) || I'm pretty far from on board with Found Footage Horror, and _Creep_ hits a lot of the reasons why. It also seems like there was no reason it had to be Found Footage in the first place. But that all said, Mark Duplass' performance is enough to elevate the piece somewhat, and kudos to director Patrick Brice for trying something new with the format.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._ || Not to be confused with the 2004 British slasher set in Charing Cross Underground Station, 'Creep' is an American Handheld horror movie about a film-maker who answers an advert to film a dying man to leave something for his unborn child.

The screenplay and performances are not very good but the film's over reliance on annoying jump scares make some scenes fill with tension. The film tries to bring up connections with 'The Blair Witch Project' but fails to be anywhere near as good due to the fact that it is poorly executed and has unsympathetic characters.

It has a silly ending to top it all off but it leaves quite a resonating impact.

Being a B movie, it is not that bad. It is eligible for some minor exceptions and if you consider that while watching it, then it does not disappoint much. Yes, there are many similar films like this, but what makes it somewhat special is that it is quite freely explored its contents without stressing out on detailing everything. I meant it was a simple road adventure film and you would feel it very familiar yet you will realise that it is not worth criticing it.

The actors were decent, but expected much better. Directed by a newcomer who had written many screenplays similar this theme. Like I said it was quite predictable, at a time decently enjoyable with a few laughs now and then, especially that Mexican police station scene was hilarious. You might get a million reasons to dislike it, but you achieve nothing from it. According to me it was surely a decent watch, hence not a must see, but if you do, then don't take it seriously, try to have fun within its limits.

I missed it's theatrical release but finally watched it on blu ray today and I was very underwhelmed. The story start with a future were everybody are locked inside their houses by robots. I'll make the synopsis very brief to avoid any spoilers ...Humans all received some sort of tracking device on the side of their neck that alerts robots of their every move.If a human dare to step away from their house they will have 10 minutes to get home or they will be turned into dust by robots. We follow a bunch of kids that realize accidentally that this tracker can be turned off by receiving an electric shock so they shock themselves and go out then it leads to a rebellion. One of the kid also realize that he has the power to control the robots and that as you imagine comes rather handy. First of all this film feels like a TV film you will get from the CBBC in the 80's.It's very Doctor Who-ish.If you expect (like I did) a trow back to Amblin films , this is not it. This is a very British film and it embrace the type of Sci Fy Britain's has been making for decades. My biggest complain is that on the opposite spectrum of some reviewers on here who felt it was campy , I personally felt the opposite and that it took itself far too seriously. I would have liked the director to add a bit more fun to the script.The dialogs keep things very serious. The film go from Point A to B , it is very straightforward. The characters are not really fleshed out , you get introduced to them very briefly then they are immediately on their Journey.We really don't get enough time with them before hand to really gasp who they are nor really care about them. I would say this : If you are a fan of Doctor Who you might enjoy it as it feels like a feature long episode of something from the same universe as the good old Doctor.If you are after a fun family romp with adventure and comedy , you might be disappointed.It's pure British Sci Fy and it definitely not to try to be something else. It is not a bad film and like all reviews on IMD this is just my opinion and mine is that I believe that only a very specific audience will enjoy this film."

Villain is directed by Michael Tuchner and adapted to the screen by Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais and Al Lettieri from the novel The Burden of Proof written by James Barlow. It stars Richard Burton, Ian McShane, T.P. McKenna, Donald Sinden, Nigel Davenport, Fiona Lewis, Joss Ackland, Cathleen Nesbitt, Colin Welland and Tony Selby. A Panavision/Technicolor production, music is by Jonathan Hodge and cinematography by Christopher Challis.

Ruthless London gangster Vic Dakin (Burton) agrees to orchestrate the robbery of a wages van. However, when it is requested for him to work with another gangster’s firm, Dakin is less than enthused, especially as his private life is hanging heavy on his shoulders.

1971 saw the release of the magnificent Get Carter, surely a benchmark film in the pantheon of British neo-noirs. The year also witnessed Straw Dogs and A Clockwork Orange bursting forth to bother the tabloids and gnaw away at the paying public’s conscious, there really was something stirring In the violent belly of Blighty. There was also another very violent British film out in 71, Villain, a criminally overlooked slice of grim Britannia.

Richard Burton, he a bastion of rugged masculinity and hard drinking legends, is here playing a sadistic homosexual gangster with a paunch. He is not beyond using a razor to enact retribution on a squealer, or to beat his boyfriend Wolfie Lissner (McShane) before making love to him, but he loves his mother beyond compare though! This was a tough sell to Burton fans one would think, which may go some way to explaining why it disappeared quickly and has still to this day been largely consigned to cult status appraisals only. In fact some of the more intimate scenes between Burton and McShane were cut, so the supposed fall out could have been worse. I say supposed because there’s conflicting stories as to how the film actually performed at the box office…

Viewing it now reveals Villain to be a biting piece of British cinema, often uncompromising and filled to the brim with character’s either damaged or carrying around some sort of affliction or kinky trait. It is pure neo-noir, both in characterisations and narrative drive. Dakin is a maelstrom of tortured emotions, his anger issues frightening but off set by his mother fixation. Wolfie is a bisexual pimp and in a rut, Gerald Draycott (Sinden) is the MP with a thirst for sex getting in deeper than he can handle and on it goes. Thug with an ulcer, hapless girlfriends, snitch, blackmail, murder, violence unbound, nudity, sadism and two hard bastard coppers not beyond giving someone a few lumps to get what they need.

Then of course there is the robbery itself, a chase and heist sequence of events that are excellently constructed by the makers. The script pings with menacing humour and the writers have a good ear for London dialogue. The London backdrops are classic early 70s monuments and iconic period points of interest, all photographed in that grubby low key way that sits perfectly with the unfolding story. Cast is a who’s who of British actors of the time, and all perform well up to standard to make this a riveting and potent viewing experience. There were some complaints about Burton’s accent, but it really isn’t that bad and only becomes noticeable when he is called on to shout. Burton is great, a bold role gets a bold performance and it is definitely one of his most under valued turns.

Not as brill as Get Carter, but it’s something of a must see for any fan of British gangster films, while it actually makes for the perfect companion piece to Michael Caine’s magnum opus. 8.5/10 || Quite a few big stars tried their hands at these gritty, criminal underworld, style stories in the early 1970s and this rather procedural effort was Richard Burton's. Doubtless he was well paid, but his performance here is nowhere near his best. He is ""Dakin"" - a sort of Kray-esque character who runs an organised crime network extorting protection money from small businesses. A violent man, he takes his anger out on foe and friend alike but must learn to co-operate when the chance to hijack a lucrative factory payroll presents itself to him and his rival ""Fletcher"" (TP McKenna). Meantime his favourite ""Wolfe"" (Ian McShane) also suffers from his fury - and shares his bed - and he dotes after his ailing and aged mother (Catherine Nesbit). As crime thrillers go, this is all rather dreary. It's really predictable with a very stilted and unimaginative script, little character development and a star who just didn't impose himself on the story or the screen as I had expected. A decent supporting cast of well known faces tries hard to beef it up, but somehow the sense of menace is just lacking. Perhaps it resonated more then with tales of political corruption in the 1960s still fresh in the public conscience and also with the recent repealing of the anti-homosexual legislation in the UK, but now - 50 years later - is completely forgettable fayre."

It was in the pre-production for over a decade, before reshuffle and recasting happened with the existing one. It was supposed to be an Indo-Aussie joint production, but later the Belgium production company joined the project. After the several hurdles it managed to get completed. It was an Anglo-Indian historical romance-drama, during the British raj in India about betrayal, coup, revenge and a journey movie. Also simultaneously set in the modern world focusing an archaeological couple who discovers a lost ancient Indian jewel in a shipwreck. From there the story gets a perfect beginning, later moves back to India.

I don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well, but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics, then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it, the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes, swords and other gadgets.

How the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that, many stuffs make no sense, especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.

> ""Love has many faces,
> and one of them is jealousy.""

The quality was top notch, the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look, so depressing. That is the way her character was developed, so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well, and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak, maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations, and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.

The major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priest/saint/sadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it, but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for, very excited for the merge of historical subject with sci-fi, but did not stand tall. Thankfully, either it was not a bad movie of the year, I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it, but there's a slim chance that you might like it, so choose it carefully.

Best Action sequence.

**Slow in the first half** || One would think that the ultimate showdown between two of the most iconic super-heroes would make for some downright compelling action-oriented exploits against a landscape of angst and destruction. Plus, it certainly did not hurt that exhilarating filmmaker Zack Snyder (‘300’) was at the helm in bringing together the colorfully and concocted confrontation between The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel. Also, it should have been an effortless task to bring together **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** leading men Ben Affleck and Henry Cahill since they had prior experiences donning heroic attire as mighty super-heroes on call to save the day. So why then does Snyder’s big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless?

The dour randomness of **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** is quite disappointing because this moping actioner wants to grab more than it can chew in its crowded mouth. Snyder and screenwriters David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio aspire to plug in such contemplative issues pertaining to moral ambivalence, political platitudes and religious themes but none of these factors energize or sustain this action-packed narrative that seems to slouch all at the expense of a sluggish approach to the mechanical hedonism that labors.

There is no doubt that **Dawn of Justice** has its share of visual opulence as this is obviously expected in an expansive superhero saga where the proven selling point are two mythical comic book titans spearheading the pumped-up proceedings. Again an overreaching script that plods along, a couple of super-powered sourpusses going the moody motions and the lack of carefree robust action undermine the potential explosiveness that **Dawn of Justice** could have capitalized on with dynamic aplomb.

Sure, there is a noted curiosity and interesting element about the topic of “heroism fatigue” and hidden demons that could have certainly contributed to the psychological strain for our Caped Courageous Ones. Still, **Dawn of Justice** never quite turns this premise into a sparkling case of burn-out conviction, Instead, knuckle-dragging duo of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) and Clark Kent/Superman (Cavell) make the common sleeping pill look like an excitable bag of M&M candy treats. Thankfully, another fan favorite superhero in the form of Wonder Woman (Gal Godot) is thrown into the mix to break up the monotony of the boorish Boys Club. Unfortunately, the appearance of the wily Wonder Woman during the tail end of the second half is too little and too late for her welcomed presence to rescue the film’s clunky pacing.

Gotham’s Bruce Wayne and Metropolis’s Clark Kent are experiencing setbacks that could be perceived as reaching the depressive crossroads. For starters, a maturing Wayne’s/Batman’s crime-fighting prospects have been tailing off drastically. As for Kent/Superman his existence at the Daily Planet newspaper seems mundane especially when his boss in editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) declares that the public has moved away from print given the major impact of social media and other online resources. So yes…Wayne and Kent are in a critical funk in their professional lives both in and out of their familiar costumes. However, can the slumping cities afford two down-and-out superheroes when one can probably carry the load in rough, unsure times?

When the film establishes the dilemma that there can be only one muscle-bound ego to handle the affairs of the region’s unprotected this is where the **Batman v Superman** portion of **Dawn of Justice** looks as if the frenetic fantasy will percolate. Inexplicably, the hype involving the sparring twosome is put on hold as the exposition takes its tedious time building up the conflict to satisfy the clashing insecurities of the capable caped crime-stoppers. For those that witnessed Cavell’s mediocre **Man of Steel** a few years ago will probably understand the current bad blood that exists between the two super studs. Whatever the case both Batman and Superman have pegged each other as brawny bad news ambassadors…something that does not sit well with either struggling superhero as their revered reputations are on the line.

Naturally, there are other outside forces to consider as the acrimonious overtones continue to flow between the brooding mega-powers. The famed instigator in Superman foe Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is realized as the high-tech billionaire nuisance that has an underlying scheme to eradicate both bickering super powers once and for all but not before Luthor pronounces his take on philosophical tirades. In the meantime, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is on board to profess her undying love and support for her desired dreamboat Superman. Luthor loathing Superman while Lane fantasizing about her strong flashy fly boy. In other words it is business as usual. While Superman is trying to figure out his place in the sun Snyder piles on the bothersome dreamy anxieties that plague the aging Wayne.

**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** is a jumbled mess. Snyder undertakes a convoluted production and tries to sell it as a sophisticated meeting of the misplaced minds between two embattled entities embroiled in uncertainty and super-sized cynicism. Still, Snyder’s vision is mishandled as he seems to have forgotten one crucial point–simply making an action movie that registers with genuine thrills. One cannot help but stumble upon the pretentiousness and piousness that ruins this boneless blockbuster. The film finally decides to stack on the combinations of boisterous match-ups involving everyone but the kitchen sink but all comes off as frivolously forced. Cavell was never really an enticing Superman ever since he donned the big “S” on his chest back in 2013’s** Man of Steel**. Affleck’s Batman is a little more palatable but the constant scowl (both on his face and on the mask) is too much to digest. One would not mind yelling at the screen for Affleck’s alter ego to lighten up a bit.

The supporting players are virtually wasted in this exhausting CGI popcorn pleaser. Eisenberg, normally a trustworthy performer with considerable scope, merely irritates as the punkish techno-magnate Luthor. The always radiant Adams is a wash as the gushing Lois Lane. Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons’s Alfred the butler won’t make anyone forget Micheal Caine’s take on Wayne’s trusty man servant anytime soon. Even the reliably adventurous Oscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon cannot exuberantly bring to life the menacing presence of Zod.

Humorless and hackneyed, **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry. As for others, they will wonder what lies ahead in terms of other League of Justice movies that hopefully can muster up more entertaining stimulation than this over-indulgent doomsday dud. Is anyone up for **Wonder Woman vs. Redwing** with an empowering feminine twist?

After her father’s dubious death at his manor in Malibu, a young woman and her beau (Mary Beth McDonough & David Wysocki) trace the truth to a mortician who holds cult-like seances (Christopher George), not to mention his psychologically troubled son, an embalmer (Bill Paxton). Lynda Day George is on hand as the mother. 
   
""Mortuary"" (1982/1983) starts as occult-oriented horror akin to ""Midnight Offerings"" (1981), which also starred Mary Beth, but it takes a different path, morphing into a horror-thriller mystery à la “The Night Strangler” (1973) with slasher elements in a mortuary/cemetery setting. The last act throws in something reminiscent of “Don’t Go in the House” (1979). ""One Dark Night"" (1982) also comes to mind.

Speaking of “Midnight Offerings” and “The Night Strangler,” this has a made-for-TV vibe except for the explicit embalming sequences, gore and sex scene (using body doubles, of course). The score is notable in an early 80s way and unrecognizable young Paxton is a highlight with his over-the-top performance. But the weird cult bits at the beginning are curiously never elaborated on and the lights going off-and-on at the Malibu mansion is annoying padding.

Nevertheless, there’s enough good here to entertain those who appreciate some of the aforementioned flicks.  

Beth Scheffell is notable as Bonnie at the skating rink (the blonde in the red shorts), but her role amounts to being a wallflower cameo.

The film runs 1 hours, 33 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles (cemetery and mortuary), Malibu (Christie’s house), Burbank (florist shop) and Marina del Rey (driving/plaza scenes).

Do you think anyone says 'I should have known him' after watching 'This Is It'. The answer is definitely yes. In the non-English speaking countries, many people don't know who Michael Jackson is or was. To me, this documentary is a similar case, I had no clue about who Amy Winehouse was or I never listened her musics before. So thanks to the director for this film and I also congratulate him for the Oscars nomination.

The movie was not complete. As any documentary this one too based on the recorded audio and video clips, and a series of interviews of whom she had worked with and closed ones. It was like a puzzle, but was arranged neatly in the chronological order. You know, you won't get all the truth from them, many stuffs remain mystery. So this is only a person's quality and character from many (people's) angles, but the accuracy, the honesty is with Amy that's never going to be revealed. Because only she knows about all she went through in her life like we do in our life.

Without arguably I agree films and documentary films are too short to squeeze all in about 2 hours to depict a person's entire life and people who watch it to judge that person is not justified. In this, the end was so sudden, like they had no more footages about what really happened. The trivia says Amy's father was not happy about the movie for the portrayal of his daughter, especially the last few years of her life. Only a very few know how much true this film is, but anyway something was very clear that he has not been the father she has wished for.

Every child deserves a good parenting. I feel Amy's struggle began from her childhood itself. But after the teenage, while becoming more independent, she lost her path, besides the fame poured in. She definitely had a gifted voice, she did not know how to manage it and someone should have been there to guide her. According to this film, I think the marriage was the beginning of the dark side of the Amy.

> ""When you looked at her lyrical and melodic capability,
> she was a very old soul in a very young body.""

I have not seen all the Academy Award nominees except this and 'Cartel Land', but I certainly think this film has the edge to win the best Documentary film. Definitely Amy's life story deserves to be made as a feature film and I'm up for it. Because somewhere I read the reply to a question 'why Bill Gates is not celebrated as the Steve Jobs? After all bother of them achieved a lot in the same field and contributed to modernise the computer technology'.

The reply was like this: 'Bill Gates was from a financially well settled family who was good at studies and his life was very smooth, support was poured from all the corners. While Steve Jobs was a child of an immigrant parents and had to struggle for his achievements. So he went through many ups and downs in his life and people have soft corner for that'.

This film had all qualities to inspire from the Amy's achievement as well as lessons to learn from her personal life. Everybody has their personal issues and so the Amy. Becoming a prey for the drugs and alcohol is very common these days among the celebrities. For example Heath Ledger, Philip Seymour Hoffman and many other stars are the victims for the drug addiction.

That does not mean their achievements are nothing. Simply, we see one of the many faces of them. After all, we're humans go after what we desire for, but everything has limits, after that what comes is a self-destruction. It is a very nice movie. If you know her and still want to know better, and if you don't know her and want to know about her, for both it is a must see.

The life and times of Amy Winehouse were tracked with glee by the world's media, and news of her death somehow came as no surprise. The 2015 documentary simply named _Amy_ charts the life of Winehouse, from pre-fame to discovery to the heights of her fame to her spiral into drugs.

This is a dark and bleak documentary, and in parts is really really sad. I've heard this documentary referred to as ""the best found footage horror movie of the year"" and while that was said tongue in cheek, I definitely get what they mean. Because its a collection of phone calls, interviews, and home movies this has a very intimate feel to it, and at times it almost feels voyeuristic to watch. While giving it a creepy tone, the home movies aid with making this all feel so real.

I do feel like it could have benefited from a narrator. It just kind of moves from stage to stage in the timeline with the odd flashback here and there. I think with a narrator there could have been expanded explanations of what we were seeing on screen, and maybe some more background info. The lack of a guiding voice made this feel to me like something was missing. But that's just a minor gripe.

This is a difficult documentary to watch but gives a very raw and open glimpse into the horrible effects that drug and alcohol abuse can have on people. It is not a tribute to Winehouse and her music, but a dive into the darker side of the entertainment industry. It's worth a look, but go into it prepared for a very rough ride."

This was shot in the summer of 1980, but not released until three years later. So, while it’s listed as a 1983 film, there’s a lot of late 70s’ residue.

Regina Carrol as Kate is one of the main highlights. She was 37 during shooting in the summer of 1980, but still very beautiful (physically and inwardly), even stunning. There's a good scene that specifically explains why she was a little long in the tooth as the magician's assistant. She happened to be director Al Adamson's wife from 1972-1992 when she died of cancer at the too-young age of 49. Al passed away three years later.

There are other points of interest, like Don Stewart (known for his ten-year stint in Guiding Light) as the brooding-yet-principled magician with mesmerizing powers learned in Nepal, as well as the setting of the traveling carnival itself. I realize it's a 'B' production with some third-rate acting (e.g. Stoney), but the flick works mostly because it fleshes out the characters and you care about them and their story. 

Anyone who appreciates low-budget movies involving circuses, like ""When the Circus Came to Town,"" ""Roustabout,"" ""Circus of Horrors"" or ""Circus of Fear,"" aka ""Psycho-Circus,"" should find something to like.

It runs 1 hour, 25 minutes, and was shot in Shelby, North Carolina, which is almost an hour’s drive west of Charlotte; as well as Gaffney, which is a half-hour drive south of there, across the border in South Carolina.

I have seen the first part and I don't remember I felt the same way as I did for this. My point is, this film is for women and maybe that including the gays. Being a straight male, I find it's not fun or entertaining, but I felt it pulled me further away as the movie progressed without balancing the content as a product for everyone.

I know, no one asked my opinion. I respect the movie, at least it aimed for a certain section of the audiences. The road trip was fine to me, except the music and the dance parts. Thankfully, there's no nudity, except once, but still an R rated movie for strong sexual appeal.

Whatever the theme was about, I expected a good story. But it was a lot like a documentary. No focus on any particular characters, but Channing Tatum was in a prime position. No development either in the story other than a group that embark a road trip to participate in a competition. Nothing anything like the first film, kind of detached from afar.

So I won't expect you to feel as the way I did on this, but you could consider my points and can judge whether want to watch it. Still, I'm not suggesting to boycott the film. I'm neutral, and all I'm saying is that it did not impress me, but it might you, especially if you are a woman.

The Rudyard Kipling's famous children's book was adapted numerous times for stage shows, television series, live-shot and animation films, and now here's the modern version and also the first digital 3D version. The Disney done it again bring all the classics to a new life, but it is a great team work, especially the post-production was terrific.

It is one of those stories never gets boring for repeat reading/listening/viewing. Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew.

Neel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film. The entire film was shot in the studio settings and the whole time he had to act alone, because the remaining characters in the film are CGI. So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young.

The CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others. These are very small things to notice, but for the todays technology, it was not bad, especially thinking the film is primarily targeted children.

The story was simple, like half of the film was an introduction and almost all the important characters from the book were launched at a high profile. It was actually the story with a backdrop of red flower. So the narration moves different part of the jungle, lot like the levels in a game. Various adventures take place and well composed stunt sequences.

I mentioned stunts right, but there were no violences, I mean nothing seriously to concern about as expected for a Disney film. Yet because of those actions, the film is very much suitable for adult viewing. So apart from the children and families, it can be watched by anyone. One of the top Disney films to do best at the box office worldwide by grabbing almost $1b.

So aggressive, furious Shere Khan ever to portray. I think the little children may get scared for his unpleasant face look and the strong roar. By the way all the songs were amazing and the end credit was very interesting. Finally, I saw it after a long wait and anticipation, most importantly, I'm very happy how beautifully it was made.

The film was not shot in India, but the locations were so resembling and gives the perfect Indian feel. Climbing a cliff by Baloo and fighting the monkeys, like that there were numerous jokes. Surely one of the grandly made children's film at the recent time. I've heard the sequel is already on the progress, so bring it on, at least a trilogy before Neel turn to a big boy.

8/10 || I had only one true issue with Jon Favreau's _Jungle Book_, and while it does seem like sort of an unfair one, it's also a pretty huge one.

For months before I got the chance to see this remake, I heard non-stop about what a great actor the kid playing Mowgli was, how photorealistic all the animals were, and how you would never be able to guess that the backgrounds were all actually sound stages that had been animated over. Well I just watched _The Jungle Book_, and I found all three of those compliments to be patently untrue. That might sound like three issues, but in reality they all boil down to the same one thing, suspension of disbelief. Or more accurately, the lack of it. From the word go, there wasn't s moment that I found myself being continuously drawn out of the story because of one of those reasons (usually the look of the creatures). I was not once able to fully engage, and though I recognise that from a plot point of view, this version was even better than the 1967 one, I still found myself constantly aggravated by the harsh meshing of Mowgli against the world around him.

_Final rating:★★½ - Not quite for me, but I definitely get the appeal._"

So it is not much of a shock that Ritchie’s big screen adaptation of the iconic 60s television series that featured the retro-suave Robert Vaughn and golden-haired heart-breaker David McCallum takes on a sleek, stylish and impishly erratic mix of intrigue and frolic.

The consensus is that ‘The Man From U.N.C.L.E.’ continues the wave of nifty and naughty-minded colourful espionage spectacles that seem to have invaded the summer of 2015. Perhaps when one cries ‘U.N.C.L.E.’  it will not be as challenging or convincingly crafty as the more cerebral and stimulating ‘Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation’. Still, Ritchie’s off-beat serving of ‘The Man From U.N.C.L.E.’ is mindless fun and roguishly cheeky.

Sure, at times the boisterous bounce in ‘U.N.C.L.E/’ feels rather strained as Ritchie’s foray into the James Bond-esque territory featuring the off-balance smoothness of twitchy twosome  Brit Henry Cavill (the ‘Man of Steel’ star portraying American CIA Agent Napoleon Solo) and Armie Hammer (incidentally sporting a catchy and clever moniker) as Russian KGB Agent Illya Kuryakin spirals into a cliched cavalcade of mischievousness drowned out by surging surf music, crazy-minded and bright-coloured landscapes, perfect-looking protagonists and wildly penetrating predicaments in its manufactured action sequences. Nevertheless, ‘The Man From U.N.C.L.E.’ still generates a sense of rousing charm and insane impishness to carry out its agenda for off-the-cuff espionage escapist frolicking.

Some may not mind the make-up of ‘U.N.C.L.E.’ as a saucy buddy action flick in disguise as Cavill and Hammer drolly inhabit the kooky coolness of TV’s dynamic duo spies from yesteryear. Nobody will ever claim that Cavill and Hammer are trying to ape the small screen spying antics of original U.N.C.L.E. bad boys in the aforementioned Vaughn and McCallum any time soon. The exaggerated juiced-up chase scenes, the inclusion of high-volume spunk and wit, devious femme fatales that parade around as hormonal trophies…all add to the high-wire hedonism of Ritchie’s off-centered international gun-toting caper.

Ritchie’s co-written screenplay, along with Lionel Wigham of ‘Sherlock Holmes’ fame with ‘Harry Potter’ producer credits, does not provide much of a deep-seeded story other than its need to indulge the audience in its shifty shenanigans as an over-the-top ode to a classic couple of televised operatives that baby-boomers will fondly recall from their childhood reminiscences. The premise is somewhat painfully familiar as two clashing spy guys with different approaches to the espionage game join at the hip to stop a madman planning to engineer nuclear destruction for a vulnerable world. Of course, in attempting to stop such unthinkable madness we are overcome with the philosophical tactics and mannerisms of the targeted tandem looking to spread some spice along the way in saving the world from certain cartoonish devastation.

Solo is the capable cad whose free-spirit and ease on handling a sticky situation is met with instinctive, cavalier American ingenuity. Kuryakin, on the other hand, seems to be disciplined in his uptight ‘play-it-by-the-book’ demeanor as the cold Russian enforcer without a sense of straying from his boundaries. Together, this debonair ‘ying-and-yang’ pair of free-wheeling agents form as one in their mission to foil the demented deed of others. Isn’t that special?

In essence, ‘The Man From U.N.C.L.E.’ believes in its wheeling-and-dealing hype and that is not necessarily a bad thing. It does not pretend to be anything other than what it is at large, a spry, jet-setting caper where playful doom and gloom is played out against a backdrop of elegant locales not to mention a spruced-up soundtrack to accompany the animated proceedings. As usual Ritchie punctuates his theatrical releases with loose-minded lunacy happening at a fast pace. The outlandishness of ‘U.N.C.L.E.’ is truly true to form in the tradition of the funky and frenetic fables that Ritchie loves to spin at will.

Both Cavill and Hammer seem to get inspiration out of their dressy roles as the inventive spies with a knack for carousing and chaos. The wily women that are at the center of attention for Solo’s/Kuryakin’s romancing interests in Elizabeth Debicki’s vivacious Victoria and Alicia Vikander’s toxic Gaby is refreshingly stimulating and reinforces the suspenseful jolt. As the commanding Waverly that oversees Solo and Kuryakin, Hugh Grant does not hold a candle to the late great character actor Leo G. Carroll, that was so memorable as the head honcho that pushed the buttons in the background for both Solo’s ‘The Man From U.N.C.L.E.’ and later April Dancer’s (Stephanie Powers) ‘The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.’ 

So here is to the jousting ‘U.N.C.L.E.’ enjoying its considerable A.U.N.T (‘A Unique Nifty Time’) at the busy summertime box office.

Critic’s rating: ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) || I know Ritchie gets a lot of flak for being a Tarantino copyist, but I really enjoy the films of the Brit that I've seen so far. They're great fun and more enjoyable than the grim-a-thons that the James Bond, Mission: Impossible and Jason Bourne franchises have churned out, though I love those as well. I thought the casting was a nice in-joke, pairing DC Comics' Superman with Marvel's Captain America, and I have loved Alicia Vikander's work since seeing her years ago in 'A Royal Affair'. I thought at the time she exuded both acting chops and sensuality out of every pore and would be a real monster if she ever went international--which she definitely has, both here and in 'Ex Machina'. Though I have never seen the TV series, I felt the camaraderie between the stars was refreshing, the car chases and other stunts were excellent, and, in a year most saturated with spy films (thankfully, for enthusiasts such as I), although it tanked at the box office, I for one hope it becomes a franchise. Why put the brakes on a good thing?... || > A very pleasing action-comedy with the balanced sensitive contents.

Another brilliant action-comedy from Guy Ritchie. I never saw the 60s television series of the same name, but this was very convenient for his style of portraying the tough men showing off their strength. The actors were simply wonderful, two year commitment by the two lead guys for this project definitely payed off well and Alicia Vikander filled the feminine void perfectly. I think it was one of the best trio in the movies I ever seen, very powerful and I hope it lasts for a trilogy.

The story sets in the 60s during the cold war tension between the world's two superpowers. But the film's specialty was, it does not render clash between them, instead they come together to fight the rogue forces who plan blitz against them. Very humourous, highly entertaining with a swift pace and amazing action sequences.

I don't think the narration had any unique twist and turn, instead I call it a smartly written screenplay. So the overall movie was so good, but not a top-notch. My disappointment came from the technical side in some of parts, especially the bike and car chase in the last quarter that you can clearly tell a fake (greenscreen/bluescreen shot). Other than the main plot and its clever scenes, the movie did not offer distinctive features. Just taking away a ½ point is what places it on a line between good and average, but I definitely consider it a good.

This is a 45 minute mockumentary made for the television that was aired on HBO last year. Directed by a some television director, who recently made his feature film comedy, 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates'. It is an American film, but the story takes place in England.

This is the story of two top tennis players who class for a big match that lasts for the 7 days. You heard me right, the film reveals how the game was dragged for a week and in between that, some flashback clips and interviews were attached.

The film sets in the 2001, but when you look at the settings, particularly the players' appearances that gives the impression of the 70s or maybe the 80s. Whatever, it was so good, miles ahead to those real comedies from the recent time. The jokes were amazing, sometime I laughed loudly out of the control.

I think they designed this story and its characters so well. The actors, totally nailed it. I usually like Andy Samberg's films and his performances, but for the first time I liked him for real. If you ask me, I would say this is his best film so far I'd seen. Sadly, it was not a theatrical film.

Looks like the director aimed it for a short film, as he has made plenty of them prior to this. But I appreciated him for making it as an independent television episode with a fine length where he developed the story and its character brilliantly.

> ""This is like nothing I've ever seen. Spectacular! Absolutely spectacular!""

Less than an hour, but the entire film was shot within the three days of time without compromising on the production quality. The actors too were not amateurs while displaying their sporting skills. Since it is a comedy, that could have been neglected, but really well done drafting those scenes accurately.

Recently Andy Samberg did another mockumentary on the music theme called 'Popstar; Never Stop Never Stooping', but looking at this one and its success, there won't be any surprise it is going to be turned into a feature film-come-mockumentary.

Of course the preference was given more to Andy's role, but Kit Harrington was equally amazing. He's in a very important role and I think between these two, it reminded me the Nadal and Federrer taking on each other.

There are some guest appearances which were very crucial for this tale to narrate what it wanted to tell in the most comedic way as much as possible. So there's no way you end up unsatisfied, but you should be open minded for that.

I was surprised by the overall film, Because I was not expecting it to be so smart, at a time funny as well. Definitely this film is for the grownups, because there are many adult jokes with unexpected nudities and sexes. But who cares, if you are old enough, just enjoy what it offers.

From the great title to the wonderful performances to the beautiful writing, this is definitely a must see. I hope you won't miss, especially if you are a tennis fan, you would find it a lot funnier than the others. My final word is, recommended!

It is an action-thriller-war version of the 'Argo'. Based on the true story where the most of the film was the 13 hour long armed battle event took place in Libya, 2012. I remember the middle-east's protest over the western films, this story is set in the same time when the islamic terrorists targeted the American diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, but six brave men stood and fought against the uprising.

It is an American patriotic film, but because of the hatred over their own countrymen Michael Bay, they're surely missing a nearly a war masterpiece. The rest of the world saw it as a fine film and appreciated that. If you haven't seen it yet, I say just don't ignore it. It was a well made realistic war film, the actors were amazing and the scenes were suspenseful to spectacular. Definitely one of the best in this theme.

It was simply focused on the armed conflict between the two forces, so it won't reasons out us how and where it all began, because that might take another film to tell the tale. That's really a very clever writing. In this 150 minute long film, the first act was full of characters and story development. Then begins the gun fight that commences from the dust hours till the dawn breaks out. With many twists in the narration during confrontation, surely not a film to be missed.

8/10 || If you fancy yourself a big swingin' dick yank, then I'd recommend you watch _13 Hours_, but of course, you already have.

I can move past the xenophobia and jingoism pretty easily, even the typical Bay tropes don't ruin a movie for me, but what I find difficult to abide is boredom, and with _13 Hours_, I personally found that in spades.

Though it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, though I didn't care about any of the characters, and though I am giving this film a negative review, I can still say it's Michael Bay's best work in years.

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._ || ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is a 2016 war film directed by Michael Bay and based on the non-fiction book ""13 Hours"" by Mitchell Zuckoff. The film recounts the true events of the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012. Starring John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, and Dominic Fumusa, the movie focuses on the six members of a security team who valiantly defended the compound against overwhelming odds.

Michael Bay is known for his expertise in crafting intense and visually striking action sequences, and ""13 Hours"" is no exception. The firefight scenes are visceral, chaotic, and capture the intensity of the real-life events they depict. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI enhances the realism.

The film features impressive cinematography by Dion Beebe, who captures the harsh, war-torn landscape of Benghazi with gritty realism. The use of handheld cameras during action sequences adds to the immersive and chaotic feel of the combat.

The cast delivers solid performances, with John Krasinski, known for his comedic roles, convincingly portraying a seasoned and determined military contractor. James Badge Dale and Dominic Fumusa also shine in their respective roles, bringing authenticity to their characters.

The film successfully conveys a sense of camaraderie and brotherhood among the security team members. It emphasizes the dedication and sacrifices made by individuals in service to their country, fostering a strong sense of patriotism.

While the movie focuses on the immediate events surrounding the Benghazi attack, it largely avoids delving into the broader political context that led to the situation. Some viewers may find the lack of a comprehensive geopolitical background unsatisfying.

The characters, while based on real individuals, are at times simplified and stereotyped. This can lead to a lack of emotional depth, making it challenging for the audience to connect with them on a personal level.

With a runtime of over two hours, the film may feel lengthy to some viewers. The pacing, especially in the first half, can be slow as the narrative establishes the characters and setting. This may test the patience of those expecting a faster-paced action thriller.

""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is a compelling and intense portrayal of a tragic real-life event. While it excels in its action sequences and captures the heroism of the individuals involved, it falls short in providing a nuanced exploration of the political complexities surrounding the Benghazi attack. The film, however, serves as a tribute to the bravery of the men who fought against overwhelming odds. Rating: 7/10

It is my personal opinion that I did not find the film any good. There's nothing new in it. Even those who haven't seen many films could name a couple of similar films. The best ones. The worst part was, in horror films, ten guys go in and only one comes out. Sometimes none. The found-footage presentation was okay for such concept. The film was short and one day event based. Most of the story was on the night in an auditorium. The initial part had fair space to kick-start the tale with a simple intro. And then the following event did not stay up to the buildup.

The basic storyline itself was very weak. The characters, and their behaviours, all easily gives out the upcoming scenes. So predictable, even the twist was ordinary. The way it ended was worse than ordinary. I felt the final scene with the cops was totally unnecessary. There's nothing wrong with the actors. Even filmmaking was acceptable. But I don't know how the production company okayed the screenplay. One of the low cost film, but earned better. Despite not received well by all the quarters. I would always encourage such small films, but I can't suggest it.

_2/10_ || A near exact replica of that _Goosebumps_ episode ""Phantom of the Auditorium"" both in essential plot as well as video quality/acting calibre.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || **Predictable, unoriginal, without great qualities, but still minimally decent.**

I usually have low expectations when it comes to horror films because, in order to find a hidden gem, we have to dig through a lot of rubbish. This film, however, isn't as bad as I thought it might be: it's not original (the “Stage Fright” films are good examples of very similar material), it's not memorable, it's not perfect, it's stupidly predictable, but it entertains and creates some dramatic tension.

The story is anything but new: a high school theater group will try to stage the play in which, around twenty years earlier, a student met a tragic and stupid death because of a failure in one of the stage props. It turns out that, in these twenty years, this play has become almost cursed, saying the name of the boy who died on stage has become bad luck and the very theater where it all happened seems to be haunted. To make things even more complicated, several members of the cast are disgruntled and don't want the play to go ahead. That's how three of them decide to go to the theater at night and vandalize it. From here on, everything is prepared for the scare show that the ghost will offer us.

The film intelligently bets on “found footage” cinematography, which would be better and more credible with fewer cuts, edits and sudden transitions to night footage. I've seen several films with this style and this was the most imperfect and unpleasant. I dare say that Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing, directors and screenwriters, were happier filming than editing their work, and that this was, in part, the consequence of several failed attempts to obtain a softer parental rating. The production budget is visibly weak and there is an effort to make the most of what there is but, as a whole, the film is surprisingly effective, without complicated graphic resources or expensive effects.

The cast doesn't have any big names, but young promises trying to make their way in the tough world of entertainment. None of them seemed particularly gifted to me, but Reese Mishler and Pfeifer Brown at least tried to do something good. Ryan Shoos is simply stupid, and Cassidy Gifford is only in this film because the directors felt it necessary to include a girl with breasts big enough to widen the eyes of teenagers in the audience."

Sono, known for such colorful feisty-minded fare such as Guilty of Romance and Suicide Circle will have one scratching their bewildered noggins trying the grasp the latest twisted tale of sexual and violent gumption in the wildly impish and imaginative gang-bang musical street-tug-of-war crime caper Tokyo Tribe.  Outwardly frivolous, frenetic and fueled with a bizarre combination of opulence and outlandishness, Tokyo Tribe will indeed stimulate the senses with its hodge-podge of hedonistic heft in the realm of instantaneous insanity. 

There is no doubt that Sono's turbulent and tactical offering in Tokyo Tribe is a devoted salute to the memorable gang movies and notable musicals that have graced moviegoers' consciousness throughout the decades of cinema in general. The homage to the influences that Tokyo Tribe festively borrows from is delightfully thrown in one's exhaustive face in gaudy, grand fashion. From obvious gangster tributes to rousing gems such as A Clockwork Orange, Scarface, Ichi the Killer and The Warriors to finger-snapping sing-alongs that include West Side Story and Moulin Rouge, Sono's melodic meltdown of fists, firepower and fury is a serving of potent street turf stew ready to be sampled with sensory overload. Clearly, Tokyo Tribe is proudly off-balanced and curiously unstructured to the point that the free-for-all bombastic action and strife is celebrated with indescribable excitement.

Sono's crime and fantasy landscape of a dystopian Tokyo gone up for grabs in clashing ecstasy leaves some wondering if the overwhelming elements of its boisterous flavored parts are truly worth the powder keg production as a whole. Well, Tokyo Tribe dutifully captures the haunting and high-spirited wrath of its yakuza-style boiling point. Although at times seemingly uneven and over-indulgent in its zest for collaborative craziness, Tribe does manage to wink at its super-charged exploitation with a dynamic giddiness that wryly registers. Saddled with sadistic criminal gang-bangers, hip hop-induced tunes piercing through the film's booming soundtrack and skin-clad beauties for the hormones to race aimlessly at will, Tokyo Tribe is both caustic and cockeyed while reveling in its need for the featured Japanese rap musicians to convey a sense of creative yet corrosive urgency in the showcased horror of the furious Far East streets of mayhem. 

There is something that can be said for Sono's energetic direction of a gun-toting narrative that could easily be dismissed as overblown and pretentiously shocking. This, however, is actually the appeal to Tokyo Tribe because it is willing to be unconventional, unnerving and unapologetic for its pumped-up presentation of wayward will and war on the mean streets and alleyways as carried out by larger-than-life machete-swinging merchants whose taste for blood is undeniable. Sono's frenzied fable of street-minded violators with a code for chaos and conflict is what feverishly steers Tokyo Tribe into a grinding and gritty guilty pleasure of a crime story peppered with dream-like delusion and confusion. Granted that Tokyo Tribe is not as high-minded or observant as Sono's moving The Land of Hope. Still, Tribe feels joyously experimental as a volt-oriented vehicle with reckless promise and panache.

The premise is set as twenty-three gangs are vying for ultimate control of the targeted tough streets in futuristic Tokyo in what appears to be a fierce face-off for the ages. Naturally, these gangs (or ""tribes"" as they are deemed) look to make their presence known within Japan's vulnerable capital city. In particular, the overbearing and menacing overlord Bubba (Rika Takeuchi) envisions taking over the entire region and having dominance over the other crime lords and their minions. The ruthless Bubba means business as he wants the existing tribes at his feet of mercy. Hence, Bubba calls for an all-out war in an attempt to challenge his equally evil-minded rivals. 

Of course when Bubba and his underlings (including his son) are not trying to take over the Tokyo street operations they look to hook the attention of pretty and prestigious Sunmi (Nana Seino). The jeopardized Sunmi just happens to be the daughter of a prominent local bigshot in the community. Nothing says complete triumph to Bubba and his backers should Sumni succumb to his personal needs within his felonious organization. Soon, the realization comes into focus--the rivals all over Tokyo must come in unison to stop the diabolical Bubba from becoming the master manipulator and prevent him for furthering any power hunger proclivities. 

Surely the audience will find themselves surrendering to the various devious angles that Tokyo Tribes turns its tricks towards in spontaneous, off-kilter fashion. Over-the-top characterizations, animated violent sequences, fleshy females, combative confrontations, flashy choreographed movements, the aforementioned inclusion of some well-known Japanese rap artists, dizzying colorized overtones, provocative wardrobes, both silly-minded and stirring gang-style antics--all are assembled with weary finesse that propels Tokyo Tribe as an overactive romp that knows its role all too well. And what role is that one might ask? Perhaps to be an entertainingly odd and ludicrous genre flick that acts as an unsettling messenger for our indiscriminate preferences in cinematic mob mentalities and musical musings.

Based on the book of the same name, a story about a dreadful massacre in the rural America where a young girl lived to testify against her own brother and then she never recovered from it. So many years later, the case takes a new twist when some young crime solving enthusiastic shows interest in it and that's where the rest of the narration takes its direction.

The suspense was the highlight, though, feels like not a complicated puzzle. Brilliant writing for sure. You know, from a novel to screen is not an easy task. Sometimes book fans and sometimes film fanatics will be disappointed, but this was a good film. In my opinion, it was an underrated film. Some people are disappointed, because mainly their anticipation was too high.

It was the tall South African beauty, Charlize Theron's show. However the others came into the play when the narration was in the flashback. Since the film 'The Hunt', it is really scaring to see the little kids as the prime witness in a major trial. Because of their lack of the consciousness of the world, the truth struggles. This film was kind of similar, but only the final act resolves everything. Until then, as a viewer it is about trying to link all the possibilities. Surely a fine film for the one watch.

7/10 || Negatives of the film, each of which deducts a star out of ten: -

1- Promoting smoking.

2- The director did not make the difference clear between scenes of the present and scenes of the past.

His happy-go-lucky lifestyle goes for a toss when a ghost who is his look-alike approaches him with an offer.,,"Comedy, Thriller, Horror",151.0,2015-05-29,ta,5.0,42.0,0.4172,"Suriya, Nayanthara, Pranitha Subhash, Premji Amaran, R. Parthiban",Venkat Prabhu,,"As his previous five films have shown us, a Venkat Prabhu film cannot exist without certain must-haves. For starters, his brother Premgi Amaren will be the film's designated comedian. There will be cameos by the Venkat Prabhu company of actors (here, we get Jai, Vijay Vasanth, Aravind Akash, Subbu Panchu to name a few). There will be twists galore in the plot. There will be endless pop culture references (this one invokes Engaeyum Eppothum, Mankatha, 7aum Arivu, Kaththi, Singam 2, Pammal K Sammandham, Pizza, Vaaranam Aayiram, Naan Kadavul, Raja Rani, actor Vishal's fight against movie piracy, the catchphrase Ennamma Ippadi Pannreengalema and many more). The heroines will be strictly functional (Nayanthara's role here is more a cameo). The focus will be more on entertaining even if means sacrificing some of the seriousness in a scene. And most importantly, there will be a subtle subversion of genre — Massu Engira Maasilamani (MEM) has ghosts but it is not a horror film but rather a revenge saga in the traditional 'mass' film mould. Some of these might come across as forced but there is no denying that they have become the director's signature.

So, when we step into a Venkat Prabhu film, by now, we sort-of know what to expect. The fun lies in finding out how the director packages all these elements to surprise and entertain us. MEM shows that the director's flair for delivering an unpretentious and undemanding film is still intact, even if a slight amount of predictability has crept into the filmmaking.

Venkat Prabhu makes his intentions quite clear right at the start when he introduces his hero, Mass. It feels like a typical hero's introduction scene with Mass taking on a few hoodlums who are stealing from a TASMAC shop on Gandhi Jayanthi. He fights them off and then we are told that the entire thing was staged. And even as we get the mandatory hero introduction song, the director uses it to introduce the heroine, Manini, as well and in swift strokes shows us that Mass has fallen in love with her. The plot kicks in when Mass and his friend, Jet Li steal from a local gangster to help Manini, but are involved in an accident while trying to escape the gangster's henchmen. Mass is admitted in a hospital and when he wakes up, he learns that he can see and talk to ghosts. He strikes a deal with this bunch of ghosts — they want him to fulfill their last wishes and he wants them to help him use this 'gift' and make money. But then he encounters a new ghost, Sakthi, who is his look-alike. Playing on his greed, Sakthi soon starts using Mass for his own needs. What happens when Mass realizes this and who is Sakthi?

What makes MEM different from previous Venkat Prabhu films is that the second half becomes a bit sentimental and that is both good and bad. There are moments when the sentimental bit works very well. For example, the scene in which Mass learns of one of the ghost's cause of death and the moving song during which he satisfies the last wishes of some of the ghosts. But things turn somewhat melodramatic during the moment in which Mass finally learns who Sakthi is (though the revelation is a genuine surprise). And the backstory for Sakthi is also cliched and takes too much screen time. In contrast, the director gives us the backstory of Mass and his relationship with Jet Li in a matter of minutes without resorting to melodrama. The villains are quite generic but Venkat makes up for it with the character of Vikram, a cop, who is neither good nor bad. It also helps that Vikram is played by Parthepan who brings his own quirks to the role — in one scene, he romves the shades of a character who he is arresting and remarks in typical Parthepan-speak, ""Enna kalutunanu yaarum ketrakoodadhu illa?'

The songs are plain indulgences (the Thriller-like Poochandi is visually interesting but brings the story to a halt) and the pacing dips a little during the second half despite some nifty editing (KL Praveen), and even the director acknowledges this by making Jet Li remark that Mass has slowed down. The film lacks the raciness of Biriyani or Mankatha, but there is enough inventivesness and joie de vivre to the scenes to keep us entertained. || **A conman and his ghost team!**

I truly don't know what is the original title. 'Mass' or 'Masss' or 'Massu' or 'Massu Engira Masalimani'. Since 'Mangatha' I haven't seen any Venkat Prabhu's films. He has lost his midas touch. His films are used to be youthful and fun, but not anymore. This was a different than his usual theme, but did not deliver. Particularly, I hated the graphics. Those CGI characters ruined the film in the initial part, I thought it was a very cheap thing I ever seen in a big production film. The action sequences were so stupid as well. The comedies were okay, but still it had lots of references of old films. So you can't enjoy them if you are not familiar with the original.

Surya is a very dedicated actor that you would find in Kollywood today, but the filmmakers are not using that properly. Compared to any other actors, he does many varieties of films. I watched it only for him and nothing else. I appreciate the experimental theme, but they did not get a better screenplay. The storyline looked decent, especially the flashback, but did not develop well. Like what the title hints, it was too much mass which suits better for Tollywood fans. Might be Surya fans or Venkat's would like it, sadly I'm not one. Surely you will have some laughs, other than that this is not good. So skipping it is not a bad option.

Exte was easily my ""most uncomfortable"" watch of 2019. I've only watched one other film of Sono's, so I knew he was very good when it came to gore, but I didn't know what to expect from him when it came to ghosts and ghouls.

Dear Christ, I will NEVER be getting hair extensions for the rest of my life.

Before I go into it, do remember, this was 2007. The CGI and such are not going to be amazing and top of the line. Watch this as you'd have watched a film you were going to see in the cinema in 2007 for the best impression of this film.

With a very unique plot - I for one, have never come across a horror film personally that has hair extensions as the main ""evil"" object. This has drawn me in for quite a while and it's not hard to see why this has become a very influential horror film.
Starting off very serious and dark this film promises quite a lot at the start. This does fade after a little while and we become a bit more upbeat and a little more fun. I'm not faulting the film for this - it must be pretty hard to keep a film about hair extensions murdering people to a degree of seriousness - however, it really does pick up after a while.

Once the spooky things start going down, we get uncomfortable scenes of body horror (I wouldn't really call them body gore, but either way) that made me feel a little queasy and very uneasy. I was rubbing at my eyes, picking my lips and trying my best not to pause the movie and leave it for a while and return to it.

Sono creates such a stunning piece of art that is so uneasy and makes the viewer squirm. Although the plot doesn't seem to make much sense. There's two different plot lines going on at once - the investigation of the woman murdered and a secondary plot following Yuko - and I don't think that the investigation got much attention once it first switches to Yuko. Both plots do eventually overlap and come together, but I just don't think this was done as 100% as it could have been. Everything comes to a close well, but I did find myself wishing for JUST a little bit more from Sono to bring this up just one or two notches. (And that bloody song is gonna be stuck in my head all day...) The ending is pretty vague and more of a horror-comedy piece than a horror, but that's who Sion Sono is, so definitely a plus in this situation.

This all said, I do very much love this film. It's spooky, it's unsettling, it has definitely made me a little uneasy at the idea of having hair extensions. The atmospheric creation of Sono is something that I truly appreciate. The 2000s of Japanese horror have a legacy for their moments of unease and Exte is no different. Truly unnerving, extremely uncomfortable and breath hitching, this film truly is one of the gold films of the 2000-2010 Japanese iconic ghost horrors.
All of the cast were amazing (and I can't imagine some of these scenes were easy to record either), and it really helped develop the film further.

Again, I will never be having hair extensions and secondly, I think I have a new found fear of hair in general. Some of these scenes were just too creepy.

(My only qualm is... doesn't Yuko have to like legally adopt Mami... not just move her into her place?)"

The story is the one told a thousand times without many new details that would make it any different. The directing is correct but the story is just too well known. || I can handle the rules, man, I'll handle the rules.

Ultimately this is just another one of those sports movies about someone who went off the rails due to tragedy, but came back to make the audience cheer. There is absolutely nothing new here, every cliché is adhered to, every chance to tug the heart strings is prominent, while the finale is as obvious as any one who watches sports movies will expect. But these things don't make it a bad film.

It's very well mounted by the makers, expertly performed by the principal actors, and, well, there's often a time when you need a rousing pick-me-up movie. The camera work and choreography is high grade, while director Antoine Fuqua is able to keep a realistic feel to the drama throughout. It is what it is, a very well made boxing movie, it's just not champion in story, just merely a contender. 7/10 || As far as boxing sport movies goes Southpaw isn't a film to remember, but the whole aspect of a criminal being made a successful man because of his wife/daughter, people in his life the MC deemed to fight for, added that one drama notch to get you all goose bumped.

Regardless, as far as boxing goes, these fights weren't doing it for me as a boxing sport fanatic and practitioner myself. They were unrealistic to a certain extend."

This was really a great film. Fighting against the drug trafficking was the theme. The story of an FBI agent who was recruited to work in an elite force that no one knows its existence. Their's aim is to tackle the main source, instead to deal with its lower order. Something that impossible to do without international cooperation. Every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. Like I said, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'Cartel Land'.

The story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. How a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. But the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.

The cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with Emily Blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'Edge of Tomorrow'. And then Josh Brolin and another one, an upcoming young British actor who I really don't know, but Benicio Del Toro was actually the show stealer.

His part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. Especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is. No doubt any top actors would have denied to perform that, anyway well shot with minimum violence, but the intention was very clear as fighting against the dark forces to cut off the head first. One of the best movie of the year, so definitely recommended if you're interested.

8½/10 || An stereotypical plot with, somehow, some interesting addition.

The plot is not superb but the script is really good, Del Toro makes a good performance and, as alway, a great pleasure to watch any movie with Emily Blunt on it. Great performance.

The directing is also really good and the soundtrack is remarkable, creating quite an atmosphere.

Finally, the action scenes are very well done, with a sense of contempt. No fireworks here, just something that can be the closest to reality. || 'Sicario' was a really good action film. The acting all around was very good (in particularly Emily Blunt). The set pieces were very well made.

The Austrian thriller-drama, is going to contend with another nearly 100 movies from the different countries for the upcoming (2016) American Academy Awards. I hope it will make into the final shortlist and my wishes to the cast and the crew. A minimal cast movie, set in an isolated lake house where the 9 years old twin boys and their mother lives. After their mother returning from the major facial surgery, the brothers doubts is she's the same person. They have no choice, but have to go for an unusual route to find out the truth.

Initially it was very slow, but keeps accelerating since the beginning of the second half and it ends strongly. You have to be an open minded, that is very important especially for this movie. Try to understand what it delivers than what you want see. I mean prediction is okay, but don't assume in a wider aspect. The narration was so simple and you may think the end is so cliche, but the movie does not bother to provide a surprise. Before going to talk about the twist, you have clear a couple of things.

The first question you have to answer yourself is what is 'horror' mean to you. The demons? The ghosts? Other creepy creatures? The zombies? Possession and exorcism? Haunted places and objects? Imposter? You know 'terror' is also called 'horror', which is a very close to the 'thriller' than being an actual 'horror'. Different movies explain in a different way, but this movie is not that distinctive from those, except being unconventional in revealing the details related to the story and characters.

> ""I want you to repeat ten times
> that I'm your mother.""

This film had a few diversions in the name of the genre. That is the reason why it failed to satisfy the horror fans, but so much better without mentioning that around. You have to be careful from the beginning itself, observing closely every scene. Because the storytelling commences with a hint within the first 10 minutes which is equivalent to the twist. You must get it right, or the rest of the narration won't be interesting enough.

So it is a one time shot, for the second time watch it won't be that effective. Some people deny the casual twist that comes in the first act which is too early for them and so they expects one in the final section only to get disappointed. Nothing wrong with the audience getting annoyed, but the film being atypical, just changing the order of all the three acts, that's it. The writer wanted the viewers to keep guessing throughout the their watch. That's the twist in the filmmaking, not in the actual film. Other than that it was not a smartest movie with the turnovers to amaze or confuse you.

I mean it has a proper conclusion, and you would know what it is, but should have to wait for how it's going to take place. I have seen many guys criticising that part particularly, but I felt it was good and made the movie a better product. Definitely one of the best films of the year, especially in my perception. From the posters to the trailer and teaser to the movie, it was being truthful. Never intend to cheat you, except like I said if you assume the things to happen in your way. Specially a big NO to the fancy stuffs like graphics and high pitch sudden sound/noise that's very common in horror to scare you. If you are a Hollywood fanatic, you definitely miss those doses and blame the movie.

A great directional debut as well as the twins with the real names on-screen. It got some intense scares, but limits the grossness. Had less dialogues and more in acts. Pretty rare movie and I am surprised that the critics liked this film more than the movie fanatics. But I'm happy that I'm not one of those to dislike it being a movie buff. My only disappointment is the outro scene (the exit scene) (in Hollywood it for kissing) which comes after the conclusion and before the end credit (sometimes, along the credit). I strongly recommend it, and I hope you consider some of the points I wrote in this review, otherwise I barely recommend it.

8/10 || Less than I hoped it would be.

I went into this film spoiler free, knowing nothing more than the tag line.  While it was well acted and well paced for the most part, the twist was heavy handed and obvious from early on.  Maybe I would have liked this film more if there was more subtlety to it.  A good film should still entertain if you know the twist or not, and for me, guessing it so early just hampered my enjoyment.  The denouement was handled well, but the lead up let it down."

In his 15 year old acting career it was the Chris Evan's first direction. Many actors had tried that and only a few had succeeded, but some of them just preferred a low cost, simple project to avoid a major disaster. He also produced it and acted alongside the British actress Alice Eve. The film was a one night event based theme which begins when a young woman misses her train, and later forced to spend the night with a stranger after her purse got stolen. During lots of time left for the next train, theirs little adventure begins as they embark around the city.

This is really a solid film. Well written screenplay and performed with a beautiful night adventure in the city that never sleeps. The problem with me was, I had seen many similar flicks, so this one looked okay, in a good way, but not that awesome. Still a fine film and definitely highly recommend others who like drama-romance. The plus point was the actors, the chemistry was brilliant. The story was very good, yet like I said it was so simple.

It was not just two who meet and develop a friendship or a relationship, but they both reveal their story behind their visit to the city. At first it was a casual disclose, but the true reason comes out when they begin to trust each other and feel comfortable. So each of their tale has a small twist in the same night to overcome that was troubling them for some time. The film makes the impression that they two are made for each other, but only the final scene reveals how their destiny ends when the dawn breaks out. Not so clever, but an enjoyable little gem, maybe a perfect film for the date night.

6.5/10 || Excellent Film!

Delicious Chris Evans offers us yummy acting and tasty directing in this feature about two people learning about the realities of love and friendship (and money)!  

Chris Evans' character Nick is down-to-Earth; witty; whimsical; and caring and it all seemed to unfold naturally for Mr. Evans.  Beautiful Alice Eve's performance was wonderful!  Her character Brooke was genuine, complex, easy for many to relate to, and lovable.  Both Chris Evans and Alice Eve were perfectly matched, for both their characters and one another.

I was shocked when I learned, at the end, that Chris Evans directed the whole thing.  Cheers to Chris!  I like the focus on the characters' faces; I liked the mood that was maintained throughout the film; and I like the light-hearted approach to two complex characters faced with the complexities of love, emotions, friendship, and money.

The film kept my attention until the end.  I am waiting for Chris Evans to direct again.  I am waiting for Before We Go 2, hoping that Nick and Brooke find one another and again find true friendship, true love."
291270.0,Anomalisa,An inspirational speaker becomes reinvigorated after meeting a lively woman who shakes up his mundane existence.,Welcome to the Kaufman surreal-neorealism tale in a dull world of sameness.,"Animation, Drama, Romance, Comedy",91.0,2015-12-30,en,7.104,1744.0,1.252,"David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tom Noonan","Charlie Kaufman, Duke Johnson, Charlie Kaufman","depression, nightmare, love at first sight, puppet, stop motion, adult animation, existentialism, convention, anti-depressant, philosophical, clinical, adoring","> Through the eyes of one who thinks everyone in the world is alike.

The film was based on the stage play. Originally it was meant for a short movie, but during in the production it was extended to a feature film length and ended up knocking the Oscars door. A R-rated stop-motion animation, which is the first in the history of the Academy Awards to get a nomination. My last stop-motion was the last year's 'Shaun the Sheep Movie', so that makes this kind of filmmaking is going extinct. For that reason alone, I just don't want to miss it out, as well as I prepared to enjoy every bit of it and so I suggest others to do the same if they find it interesting.

My expectation was quite simple which is entertainment. But usually animations are comedies, in that perspective, this is slightly a letdown. Wait, this film is for adults and of course the humours in this narration was delivered on its own style like a black comedy. It is a weird title right! But the film explains it in a simple manner. That's not it, there are more weird stuffs in it, like I was confused over the character voice tones for both the sexes and again the film had the reasons which will be revealed at a crucial segment.

It was something like 'Lost in Translation', about a middle-aged man named Michael Stone, who is on a trip to Cincinnati to promote his latest book. Slowly it unfolds what kind of person he's really and going further, his struggle in the married life comes the prime focus. So this tour opens a new door for him once again to fall in love which leads him for a tough decision to make. But at a certain extent, the reality check comes into play. About everything he's doing and all the life he left behind makes him feel he's trapped in some kind of delusion. His ultimate decision is where this tale going to conclude.

> ""Sometimes there's no lesson.
> That's a lesson in itself.""

The camera never takes off its lens in its throughout narration on the main character, Stone. Right from the beginning till the final scene, the film follows him like in a real time. So the entire film was like everything that happened in a 24 hour. That's the character development you would get. Besides, there are scenes, like the sex part that may stun you. Because it was not like I have ever seen one, not in animation. Even compared it to the Hentai, Hentai was 2 dimensional pictures whereas this is technically a 3 dimensional, so the effect was much more realistic and the impact on the viewers definitely will be strong.

The real problem those who saw it to end up in a disappointment is that it's not your regular animation. Which is usually aimed for children and family audience, but adults too can have a great time, whereas this film had a very matured and sensitive contents. Maybe they did not want the display of the real life experience to be narrated with a bunch of toys. But in the perspective of stop-motion animation, it is a great artistic achievement. It is not only their anticipation that killed their joy, but failing to accept the fact that we see regularly in the live-shot films to see them again in a different format.

What I liked the most in it was the message regarding the main character on his suffering. When he sits in front of the antique he bought for his son which makes him realise himself on what he's seeking in others around him. But what's his delusion is that he thinks the world is not balanced, everyone are alike. So what he actually needs is a redefined life, in which this film portrayed how close he came to one before everything shattered.

This is not just a comedy, but a very real film for the people who wants to understand the life on its different stages and threat it poses where every one of us go through in our lifetime. Surely it is no masterpiece, but there's no reason to ignore on the subject it deals. It will remain one of the best stop-motion animation, exclusively made for adults. There are grown up who simply ignore animations, because they think it is too cartoonish. Undoubtedly it will be a good film them to try.

7/10 || Reviewing this film gives me great pleasure as I thought it was very well made. It is a beautiful film about the isolation and the disembodiment of modern society. 'Anomalisa' tells the story of a man called Michael Stone played by David Thewlis on a business trip and we realise how lonely he is.The film is made using start-stop animation puppetry which had been chosen for amazing effect. Each character has the same face (seemingly like masks) and everyone has the same monotonic voice apart from the two main characters. This makes the themes of identity and loneliness so very profound and imaginative.

The repetitiveness of the main character's lifestyle comes to a halt when he overhears a guest in his hotel which is cleverly named The Fregoli which is the name of a mental condition to do with paranoia. This guest turns out to be voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. She is the only other voice heard and Stone is enchanted by her and instantly asks for her to go back to his room. He makes her sing and listens to her intently. There is a very graphic sex scene which would be humourous in any other circumstance but it is very moving and beautiful.

I won't talk any more about the story as it'll ruin it. 'Anomalisa' is a very clever film from the mind who brought us 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'Adaptation.' and 'Being John Malkovich' and it shows. Everything about it is expertly done. It is sad that this was only up for 'Best Animated Feature' alongside two dimensional children's cartoons at the Academy Awards and it wasn't recognised for being the great film that it is.

★★★★ || A reminder of what movies can do. That is, revitalize the soul. I usually watch movies in spurts. I won't see anything for 9-13 months, because things in my life are going for the most part smoothly, but then comes this inevitable (it would seem) slide back into not so much a depression as much a soul-level detachment from reality. Lethargy, I guess you'd call it. So I put together 40-50 new things to watch and marathon at the pace of 2 or 3 per day, until I'm finished. Every time I do this, one or two movies come along that splash water on my face and bring me back to life. The rare breed of original, endearing, honest, careful and considered filmic experiences like 2001, or Ikiru, Hannah and Her Sisters, City Lights, or Anomalisa, are, for me, the antidote to a dying spirit. This one got me shook"

First of all, I did not know it was a real event based film until the texts from the film's end. But even before that I liked it very much. The film was very edgy, I have not seen such film in a quite long time. It feels like a familiar theme, but that is only the theme, the story was marginally different. Emma Watson was amazing, maybe this her best performance I have seen so far in her career. Daniel Bruhl was not bad either and so other co-stars.

The locations, the atmosphere created for narrating the tale, all were amazing, just feels like a very real. The story of a young German couple in the 70s Chile, when the military coup takes place, the supporters of the overthrown president were arrested including these two. Now they are separated and one of them was sent to a secret detention camp. The other one decides to rescue him by risking her own life by joining the same organisation. That's the film to reveal how she plans and all other troubles during her undertaking.

Despite what this film reveals, very sad to read the end text. I have been looking for such kind of thriller for some time, so really I'm happy I saw this one. The pace was moderate, but the developments at the right time gives the edge. So from the entertainment perspective to revealing facts, this film well managed. From the director of 'John Rabe', another same intensity film, the majority of those who watch it would definitely like it. The thriller film fans must not miss it.

It was a decent romance-comedy, but Pierce Brosnan was too old to play this role. However, I liked his performance and this film is worth watching because of his presence. The two female leads were just okay, especially Salma Hayek looked much better over Jessica Alba which seems her career is almost over. This is a story of a Cambridge professor who moved to the States after fallen in love with an American student. But just after a few years later he comes crashing down with trouble in the marriage, but he decides to fight for his son at any cost.

The story was good, but should have been improvised a little. And the theme might make uncomfortable for some because of a man falling in love with both the sister. Yet very matured and a fine flavour for people with the open mind. There were some fun, especially comparing the booze culture and students' behavious between the two countries. This is a three year old film, but got released different market at different time and I saw it now that I think it was much better than I anticipated after knowing the respond it's got.

I would definitely say it is the director's best film. I have liked her other films, but this is a lot different from them. I mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual. So the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and I completely enjoyed it. Don't think it would be another 'The Internship' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway.

You are going to agree with me that the film's posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. When there's something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here.

This is not a comedy where you're going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. For them to remind only they've changed, not the physical world and that's where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people.

So the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. The 73 years old Robert De Niro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. I don't know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. And then there's Anne Hathaway on the opposite side who equaled with De Niro with her part.

From the narration point of view, it started with DeNiro's, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. And then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won't disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. Surely recommended, especially the youngsters who're addicted to the digital world!

8/10 || 'The Intern' is a comedy/drama movie, which was directed by Nancy Meyers in 2015. The movie takes place in Brooklyn, New-York. The first thing, which attracted me, was the cast – Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro as the main characters. This duo seemed to me quite curious, so I wanted to find out what the plot is. Another reason why I decided to watch it was the place. A lot of movies and series are made in New-York, and I like when a movie contains breathtaking views of this city. As for me, it makes movies truly esthetic. 

'The Intern' is a story about Ben Wittaker (Robert De Niro), who is 70 years-old. He has a family (son and grandchildren), which live quite far from him, and he’s a widower. He has plenty of time and desire to do something new. Ben finds a vacancy in online-store of women’s clothes. There he becomes an intern, and his duty is to help Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a young woman who runs this business. I think, the most fascinating thing about the plot is relationship between Jules and Ben. She’s young and not experienced, he’s wise and he has rich background in business. No matter, they have a huge age gap, they become good friends. Ben supports Jules, not only when it's about work, but in her private life. Jules's family is about to fall apart, and she thinks, if she hires a new director, her family will be fine again. It's a choice between her work, which is extremely important for her, and her family. What should she do? Can this decision save her relationship with her husband? It's a tough decision, but with Ben's help she makes a right one. 

‘Experience never gets old’. This is the general idea of the movie. I guess, it means that experience's always needed, it's always modern and it's always useful, no matter, what sort of experience it is. I love this idea and this movie in a whole. It's so kind and also dramatic. Acting makes you laugh, cry and then laugh again. Especially the very last scene makes you feel so calm and peaceful, and that'll be your emotions after watching the whole movie. I've seen 'The Intern' about 6 times, and every time characters make me relive these feelings.

 I think, if you want to watch something easy, warm and heartfelt, you should certainly watch this movie. 'One of my favorite movies this last year was Nancy Meyers’ The Intern. They’re not considering that for the Oscars even though I think Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances this year in that movie. I thought the script was actually one of her best', said Quentin Tarantino and added that it's Oscar-worthy."
