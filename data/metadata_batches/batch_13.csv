I seriously hope he abandons his wish to only do two more films (after his recent 'The Hateful Eight') and then retire, but chacun son gout, as the French would say, and everyone should be able to do whatever they want as long as they don't hurt anyone else, right? And if anyone of recent vintage (the past 25 years) deserves that, it's Tarantino, I suppose, but still, I hope he's lying. || I am apparently one of the few who saw ""Grindhouse"" when it came to town. Great, grisly fun in the theater on the big-screen. A double-feature complete w/ fictional ""previews,"" several of which became feature films themselves (""Machete,"" and ""Hobo with a Shotgun,"" which wasn't one of the previews shown in my hometown.)

But then the dumb decision was made to split the two features into separate, longer ones. Bye, bye fun previews (except on YouTube.) Hello, longer films that were just the right length in the theater.

""Death Proof"" especially suffers from extra-padding and more of Tarantino's blah-blah-blah dialogue. Instead of a breezy film about a whack-job who gets his jollies terrorizing women in his souped-up stunt-car rides, we get a talky film w/ action scenes that take forever to get going. And when they do, they're too easy to pick apart and criticize.

Stuntman Mike dispatches four young women w/ the first vehicle were shown (having already murdered his unwilling ride-hitching companion) and the Police decide to speculate on his intentions, vs. trying to prove them. Some justice system in Texas.

Later (or perhaps earlier; some viewers feel the 2nd 1/2 of the film actually takes place before the 1st...an opinion I don't agree with) Stuntman Mike goes after three women taking a joy-ride while re-enacting a particular hood-riding stunt. After a few minutes of bumper tag, he is shot by the sudden appearance of a revolver (which was where during the chase...taking a nap?) 

At this point Psycho Mike becomes Blubbery Mike and somehow is caught up w/ after he'd taken off in a great hurry; apparently they equipped certain 70's muscle cars w/ GPS's sent back from the present.

I can't explain why, but in the theater ""Death Proof"" was silly (if nasty) fun. But watching at home brings all manners of ""Oh, come on"" moments that really detract from appreciating it in the same way. The bar scenes drag on, and on, and on. The talk scene at the diner goes on, and on, and on. The scene where a local yokel is asked to let the three ladies test drive his car goes on, and oh you get the picture. 

Sorry, QT. You turned a 6/10 flick into a 4/10 slog-fest. Those ""mast-head"" scenes aside, ""Death Proof"" has little to recommend it to anyone not a fan of Tarantino's work...which has been awful since ""Basterds,"" and even that film is over-rated in spots. || A soured stuntman (Kurt Russell) targets young women with his death-proof cars

Created by writer/director Quentin Tarantino, “Death Proof” was originally the second part of the double feature called “Grindhouse,” released in 2007.  The other movie was “Planet Terror” by Robert Rodriguez. Both were standalone stories, although vaguely connected. They were a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes, etc. Trailers for fake movies, like “Machete,” were part of the package.

The plot of “Death Proof” involves an embittered stuntman (Kurt Russell) and his psycho obsession with murdering young women of dubious character with his death proof stunt cars (but only the driver’s side). It’s like a melding of “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” (1965), “Village of the Giants” (1965) and “Vanishing Point” (1971), but with a more modern vibe and Tarantino’s unique brand of moviemaking.

The first half is very good, opening with the excellent “The Last Race” by Jack Nitzsche, which was the theme song for “Village of the Giants,” an instrumental. But the movie’s hindered by the inane chatter of the girls. The dull drivel goes into overdrive in the second half, particularly that involving Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson. Yet viewers are eventually rewarded by a thrilling car chase in the country that’s supposedly Tennessee, but obviously Southern Cal.

Russell’s character is perversely charismatic and the movie perks up whenever he’s on screen. There are no less than eight female co-stars playing mostly classless types (thankfully, not all of them) and, depending on your tastes, four of them are quite alluring: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier (yes, Sidney’s daughter).

The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in Austin, Texas, and Buellton, California.

1408 is based on one of horror writer Stephen King's short stories. It stars John Cusack as a supernatural investigator who rents room 1408 at The Hotel Dolphin in New York. It is said to be a most haunted room and the scene of many deaths. He soon finds his scepticism tested to the max.

Although it has deep themes of grief et al, this essentially boils down to one man in a room being plagued by psychological and physical attacks, with the intended chills and shocks surreal in presentation. It's all very twisty and big on conundrums, which makes a second viewing something of a necessity, whilst Cusack's performance is also reason to check in for another viewing. However, it's not the scary movie some have lauded it as, in fact it's more fun-house palaver than anything terrifying, but there's no doubting the intelligence and skill of the writing. The mind is a curious, wonderful and troubling thing, and 1408 wants us to know it. 6/10 || Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

While the setup is a little bleh, it serves a point, but I could literal start the movie at Samuel L. Jackson's office and be fine.

Once in 1408, the intensity creeps perfectly.  It really gives you the atmosphere of a cat playing with its food.

It'll mess your head a little, but that's just from a great John Cusack delivery and wonderful cinematic display.

And the ending is almost perfect: the are two minors points that could be bad, but they're unclear.

As the manager said, ""It's and evil room. || The storyline and basis of the movie is kind of dumb. It is entertaining though with a lot of weird and crazy stuff happening in room 1408."

This is a great example of a movie.  That may seem like a nothing statement, but more movies, especially ones that insist on multi-threaded story lines should pay attention to how this movie works structurally and mechanically.  There are about 10 different story lines happening, and it is almost perfectly balanced.  There are pivotal moments when the story lines come together (very similar things in ""Crash"", ""Love, Actually"", ""Snatch"", and ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels""), but without having to cut all over the place or having to re-tell parts of the story from other character perspectives.  The movie moves on almost seamlessly from event to event, at a rather tilted rate at one point, and is never distracted from the movie.

There are a ton of interesting characters, each with their own motivations, and the increasingly ridiculous scenarios that occur are all well established earlier on so it doesn't seem sudden or jarring.

And if nothing else, Alan Tudyk losing his mind as he deals with being drugged is amazing, and well worth the watch all on it's own.

Unless you're just crippled with anxiety about funerals, I expect that you'll enjoy this one very much."

When coming to the story fully packed once when we got that situation really no one will going to surive us. An excellent actions,stunts,technology,etc. It is totally a full pack ""FIRE SALE"".:) Superb MOVIE || Big, dumb action flick delivers

RELEASED IN 2007 and directed by Len Wiseman, ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the fourth installment in the Die Hard series. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is ordered to pick up a youth hacker (Justin Long) who's targeted by cyber-terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel and Mai Linh (Timothy Olyphant & Maggie Q). Their goal is to create chaos by taking over the USA's transportation grids and stock market. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's cute and feisty daughter while Kevin Smith has a small role as a computer geek living in his Mom’s basement.

Rigid fans complain that this sequel is ""Die Hard in name only"" because I guess it deviates from formula but, really, the Die Hard series is ANY challenging adventure that John McClane experiences just as the 007 flicks consist of James Bond in differing challenges; same thing with Dirty Harry. In any case, “Live Free or Die Hard” works as Die Hard sequel or as a stand-alone action flick with Bruce Willis. The story holds your attention while the action scenes are out of this world. They're so over-the-top that some write the movie off as absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone so it helps the viewer go along with the ridiculous things that happen rather than tune out.

""Live Free or Die Hard"" is the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns,"" but ""Live Free or Die Hard"" evades that ditch by giving us fairly interesting characters and a compelling story. It may not be great but it certainly fills the bill if you're in the mood for a wild action flick.

I like the continuity of the series: McClane’s wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is acknowledged here and we meet his daughter, now a hottie, and hear of his son, Jack. We learn of the severe price that John’s bold, serious approach to his profession has had on his personal life. These things are further explored in “A Good Day to Die Hard” (2013), which is basically just as good as this installment.

THE MOVIE RUNS 128 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California. WRITERS: Mark Bomback and David Marconi conceived the story/script based on an article by John Carlin.

GRADE: B || After completely ruining his daughter's hot date, ""McClane"" (Bruce Willis) is sent to pick up a young hacker in response to what the FBI think might be a city wide cyber-attack. The youngster ""Farrell"" (Justin Long) is a cocky geek who is ill-prepared for what now ensues as ""McClane"" arrives just in time to save him from a barrage of gunfire that turns his apartment into a war zone. They now have to try to get the kid to safety but his pursuers are not giving up. What has this lad done? What has he got? Well swiftly we learn amidst the growing chaos that the not so angelic ""Gabriel"" (Timothy Olyphant) and his pal ""Mai"" (Maggie Q) are pulling the strings and will stop at nothing to see both of them go the way of the dodo before they cause mayhem across these United States. Can this unlikely pairing thwart his devious plan? To be fair to both Bruce and Long, they do manage a bit of quite engaging camaraderie as they lurch from one death-defying scenario to another but there's no getting away from it. The story is weak and far too thin to stretch across two hours of action that becomes increasingly far-fetched and repetitive. The cop character's disdainful attitude is also starting to wear out a bit as what limited jeopardy there ever was with these films becomes just a little too much like an exhibition of the stunt arrangers creative pyrotechnics and the lively production design. It's not terrible, Willis still oozes charisma, but maybe ""McClane"" needs to be put out to pasture now before he does himself a mischief - or bothers to read another lacklustre script."

The star is easy on the eye and has a soupçon of charisma to bring, but otherwise this is just a shockingly derivative series of repetitive fight scenes featuring robots between whom it is almost impossible to distinguish. Their vocals all seem to involve them speaking into the microphone through an old pair of socks, and as it lurches on I gradually found I really couldn't care less whether the red robot beat the black one - you just know this is but the start of a never ending franchise with only two purposes. 1 - to restart the flagging career of Josh Duhamel and 2 - to sell toys, thousands and thousands of toys. Marketing has often been behind some of the most successful movie spin-offs, but somehow this is just a touch more cynical than the rest.

675.0,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Returning for his fifth year of study at Hogwarts, Harry is stunned to find that his warnings about the return of Lord Voldemort have been ignored. Left with no choice, Harry takes matters into his own hands, training a small group of students to defend themselves against the dark arts.",The rebellion begins.,"Adventure, Fantasy",138.0,2007-07-08,en,7.675,19998.0,20.2304,"Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter",David Yates,"witch, dying and death, court, magic, prophecy, loss of loved one, professor, supernatural, child hero, school of witchcraft, black magic, sorcery, occult, ghost, wizard, christmas, scholar, mystical land, ministry, based on young adult novel","Front and Centre for Dumbledore's Army.

Term 5 at Hogwarts for Harry and the gang and it's a deeply unsettling time. Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that ""you know who"" is not back again.

Given that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.

New into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.

Roll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10 || Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is another solid entry into the series with fantastically high stakes, production value, and emotional scenes that leave a lasting impact.

From the beginning minutes, the movie is doubling down on the dark tone the previous two began to establish. The threat of Voldemort still looms, but it is incredibly frustrating that no one seems to believe Harry and Dumbledore. That frustration is perfectly mirrored with Harry as he grows incredibly angry throughout the film, paralleling his connection with the Dark Lord. This more mature and seasoned Potter is a highlight, and his leadership begins to take center stage as he organizes his classmates to train to fight against the dark arts. These scenes are some of my favorites in the film.

This entry expands on the wizarding world with the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix. The Ministry of Magic is terrible in this film, they are completely mad and delusional to accept any other explanation for the events that have taken place in the previous entries. This is none more present than the introduction of Mrs. Umbridge. She is the worst, and Imelda Staunton does an excellent job of being the worst. I hated her throughout the entire film and every one of her sly smiles was like nails on a chalkboard. Safe to say her finale was oh-so-satisfying.

The ending is slightly rushed, but the action is fantastic. It was a bit unbelievable that a group of students could face the Death Eaters by themselves, but the movie addressed the criticism when the Order came to save the day. I do have to say, the death scene of Sirius Black was pretty anti-climactic. The hit he takes happens so fast and he gingerly falls back into the portal never to be seen again, it did not have the resolution I would have hoped for with him being such an influential person in Harry's life. Plus, his limited screen time in the series draws back the effectiveness of his death. Despite that, the special effects in the Dumbledore and Voldemort battle were spectacular and unique, a brilliant way to cap off the film. Especially with the ending shot of Cornelius Fudge just realizing ""He's Back""

Overall, this is a slow movie with a limited amount of action. But the world-building and character development are some of the best in the series. It is not going to be everyone's favorite, but it was a great addition, even though the rewatchability is not that high.

Score: 85% | 
Verdict Great || ""Harry"" has an extra-curricular experience with a ""Dementor"" which draws the attention of the newly rejuvenated Ministry of Magic and after a show trial in which he is ably defended by ""Prof. Dumbledore"" our trio return to a school that is all but under martial law. A new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher (a rather Margaret Thatcher-esque Imelda Staunton) is taking over the school by degree, imposing strict rules that merely serve to encourage the pupils to go underground to learn the more practical skills that will be needed if they are ever to face and defeat the evil ""Voldemort"". All of the characters from the previous stories are now knitting together much better; I still miss Richard Harris as ""Dumbledore"" but Stauton is as magnificently evil as Emma Thompson is wonderfully pathetic and we have a cracking battle at the end. Our wizards are now fully cognisant of the dangers they face and have a much clearer idea of the enemy, too. David Yates does better, I think, in condensing this super-long novel into one film; again a two-parter would probably have done better justice to the detail and nuances of the JK Rowling story; but we get more than enough of the gist of the story to make do. Great stuff."

A smooth-talking charismatic salesman in New Mexico (Guy Pearce) consults a psychic at a rest stop on a whim (J.K. Simmons) and becomes increasingly paranoid that his ‘fortune’ might be accurate. Piper Perabo plays his girlfriend, William Fichtner his friend at work and Shea Whigham a former best bud from childhood.

""First Snow"" (2006) is a gritty, desolate exploration of freewill and fate, not to mention the struggle with guilt, paranoia and doing the right thing. It has the bleak, reverent tone of movies like “The Woodsman” (2004), “The Mothman Prophecies” (2002),” “Dark Country” (2009), “The Dry Land” (2010), “Leo” (2002) and “The Cry of the Owl” (2009). Don’t expect any overt supernaturalism, but there are hints of mysterious forces beyond human decision or activity.

Pearce is very reminiscent of Brad Pitt in this particular role while Perabo is always a pleasure. Yet the film isn’t pleasurable in any conventional sense. It’s grey and film noir-ish with a sense of desperate inevitability. You have to be in the mood for slow-burn mundaneness to appreciate it.

The movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the heart of New Mexico: Albuquerque, Bosque Farms and Moriarty.

37292.0,Broken Arrow,"Indian scout Tom Jeffords is sent out to stem the war between the American settlers and Apaches in the late 1870s Arizona. He learns that the Indians kill only to protect themselves, or out of retaliation for white atrocities.",The most powerful weapon is courage...,"Western, Drama, Romance",93.0,1950-07-21,en,6.705,207.0,3.495,"James Stewart, Jeff Chandler, Debra Paget, Basil Ruysdael, Will Geer",Delmer Daves,"peace, settler, mail","To talk of peace is not hard. To live it is very hard.

As the war rages between the American settlers and the Apache, former soldier Tom Jeffords happens upon a young Indian wounded after an attack. Taking upon himself to aid the boy, it's not long before the Apache show up intent on killing Jeffords by way of the war instincts. Pleading for Jeffords' life, the boy manages to get him spared by the Apache chief, Cochise. It's the start of a friendship that may just bring and end to the war and peace across the west.

Tho not the first ""social"" Western film made, Broken Arrow, it can be argued, is maybe one of the most important and telling genre films of the 50s. Showing humanist portrayals of the Apache and dealing out level headed tellings of the relationships between whites and the Native Americans, Delmer Daves' film is as relevant today as it was back on release. Adapted from Elliott Arnold's novel Blood Brother, the story follows Jeffords (a measured and fine James Stewart) as he attempts to broker peace between the warring factions. Firstly by convincing Cochise (Jeff Chandler bang on form) to allow the mail run thru the pass, something that brings suspicion and calls of Indian lover from Jeffords' own kind, and then to finally set up a peace pact at a time when violence and hatred was rife in the west.

As the friendship between the two men grows, Jeffords and an Apache girl fall in love (beautiful Debra Paget as Sonseeahray), thus giving the story a further jolt of momentum. The screenplay then really hits its stride, as Daves and his crew pit peace and inter racial love against a backdrop of bloodshed and savagery. Never glossing over just how hard peace is going to be, Broken Arrow retains intelligence and a sensitivity even as breakaway factions from both sides (for example we see Geronimo split the Apache and form a renegade front) are intent on killing off the peace process. It even has time for deep emotional kickers to reinforce the point of just how tough and unlikely peace and tolerance can be sometimes.

Broken Arrow was, and still is, a bold picture. In fact it can be argued that for the likes of Daves and Stewart, it was at the time very bold and risky career moves. But it paid off because the film stands up today as a picture of some distinction. It's themes and approach to its subjects are something that this generation, and all the future ones, will always find to be socially important. Boosted by Hugo Friedhofer's luscious score and taking advantage of the Lone Pine location shoot, Broken Arrow is a fine fine film that even non Western fans should be looking to absorb. 8/10 || If you're looking for a traditional cowboys and indians film, then this might not be for you. Sure, there are the odd confrontations between the ever expanding white man and the Apache braves, but this is essentially a more cerebral look at the efforts both sides made to find an enduring peaceful solution. After months of no stagecoach and mail getting through, a pretty lightweight James Stewart (""Tom Jeffords"") decides to try to find a better solution to their problems than the stalemate series of skirmishes between the two sides. He learns some basic Apache and goes off in search of their leader Cochise (Oscar nominated Jeff Chandler). After the usual scepticism, the two men agree to let the mail run. From then on, their trust begins to grow and the story follows their determination to cement this arrangement; despite reservations and resistance from vested interests on both sides, whilst ""Jeffords"" falls hook, line and sinker for ""Sonseeahray"" (Debra Paget). It's a touch sentimental, and it over-simplifies the problems and the solutions of the factual elements of the history, but it's still an engaging watch with a tragic but fitting conclusion and some epic cinematography along with a decent screenplay from the blacklisted Albert Maltz (who is actually credited in the version I saw)."

“Hot Rod” (2007) is quirky with goofy humor, but good-hearted. There’s thankfully no raunch to be found. Samberg is effective as the protagonist while Isla is always a winsome pleasure.

The story is engaging, sometimes quite amusing, and the visual effects - especially towards the conclusion - work well with plenty of chemistry between Danes and Cox. It's too long, there's no denying that, and maybe we could have condensed the first twenty minutes better, but Pfeiffer is a good baddie and there is plenty of action to keep it going.

_Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._ || Forgive this forward, but I literally watched all 31 seasons because I was sick and have never understood what the fuss was about the Simpsons.

I really have to conclude that the appeal of the Simpsons was a simple lack of options when it first came out, and then it just grew in power by simply existing for so long.

For this movie:
Uninspired watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend, unless you're already a Simpsons fan.

It's really just a lot of the Simpsons being Simpsons, but that also means that the overall story writing is actually pretty good, even if the character writing is rather repetitive.

I did enjoy the introduction of Ploppers, Spider-Pig, but it doesn't really even out everything else.

The big adversity is an ""under the dome"" scenario, which is actually interesting enough to explore, but because it's the Simpsons, we know that nothing ultimately interesting is going to happen, and that everything is going to resolve like its TV counterpart.  Now, that said, the TV show does drop unexpected, unexplainable shifts, like the death of characters.  I don't think Fox was brave enough to put such a thing in the movie, which would have completely changed the gravity of the movie.

It's fine, it's well produced, it's just not very interesting, and I don't think I'd ever watch it again unless I was binging the Simpsons again, and wanted to watch it in order."

Now spoilt he may be, but “Charlie” is no fool and after a few sessions with his own shrink, and the appreciation of just how empowering a little medication can be, he does a deal with his nemesis to go into business offering counselling services to his fellow pupils. One thing leads to another and his increasing awareness of their problems is used vicariously with his own doctor to procure not just medication but also treatments! Before we know it, he’s flavour of the month and even “Susan” (Kat Dennings) whose dad runs the place is becoming fond of him.

Perhaps a new scheme might give him, and his schoolmates, a less toxic purpose? Yelchin just oozes charisma here as someone whom we ought to dislike becomes someone we actually quite like. Sure, he’s got no dad; his mum hasn’t really a clue and money is no object for him so we expect him to be a bit of a pratt, but you always feel that he just needs a stronger hand on his tiller - and who better than Downey Jr. whose character is not without some baggage of it’s own. The script is really quite fun at times and even when the romantic genes do kick in, it still manages to stay on the right side of sentimental as the engaging Yelchin delivers a characterfully mischievous performance that has just a little bit of the home truths to it, too. It’s tough to radically reinvent these teenage angsty style dramas, but this one emphasises more the characters and provides us with a decent story with less reliance on a soundtrack of AOR or power ballads.

Still, some good chase and fight sequences though the great trailer line (""If you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face."") makes Bourne look like an arrogant a** because if he hadn't tipped off his location, he would've avoided the chase and made it to the E. 71st location having the element of surprise.

Anyway, still was entertained but probably rank this as the third best of the series (right now, going to revisit Legacy soon). **4.0/5** || **The Bourne Ultimatum provides an exciting conclusion to the original Bourne storyline, answering questions and leaving a trail of bodies in the process.**

The Bourne Ultimatum picks up immediately where The Bourne Supremacy left off, once again raising the stakes and ratcheting up the action. This time Bourne’s memories are flooding back more and more, and he’s hellbent on bringing those responsible for Treadstone to justice. The story focuses much more on answering the questions of Bourne’s past and the CIA’s illegal activities. I enjoyed the reunion of Julia Stiles’ character with Matt Damon’s. It developed some care between them, providing a little hope and stability in a world filled with betrayal, greed, spycraft, and subterfuge. The Bourne Ultimatum is an explosive conclusion to the original Bourne trilogy and is incredibly satisfying. Still, compared to the first two, it is a little bogged down with all the questions it needs to answer the wrapping up the story. But that is a minor complaint when the movie is one of the best in the spy genre. || I got off to a bit of a bad start with this third instalment - the idea that a bloke in a building in Langley was issuing orders to murder a British journalist in a London railway station used by almost 100 million people a year really didn't sit at all well with me; so I already felt that whatever our hero wanted to do here was OK by me! Just as well, because Matt Damon has his hands full trying to stay alive and to discover the nature of the upgraded ""Treadstone"" operation - this time called ""Blackbriar"" which may well shed more light on just how ""Bourne' became who he is! Again, Paul Greengrass elicits the best from his star - ably complemented by Joan Allen, again as ""Landy""; David Straithairn as his ruthless pursuer ""Noah Vosen"" and Edgar Ramirez (""Paz"") who is never far from his tail/trail. It features more end-to-end action - again, though, not gratuitously long and violent like many others I've seen and although the script is not so good in this one , it remains of the few franchises where the third film is up there with the others.

I've watched this movie several times, but had a couple different reactions: sometimes I agree this is overhyped, other times I'm completely in line with why it was overhyped.  You mood might be a factor in your movie watching, it's all I'm saying.

Overall, this is decently funny in dialogue, delivery, and writing.  The movie is full of cringe humor and ridiculous circumstance, it's essentially designed so the characters have a good story to tell later on, and it definitely meets the criteria.  The big problem is that it's a high school, ""let's get laid adventure"" starring 2 idiots and their idiot friend.  I've never seen 2 guys work so hard to prevent themselves from their actual goal.

When you look a little closer too, it's really two movies wrapped around each other.  ""McLovin"" could have been its own movie, but neither story really has enough meat too it.  ""These high schoolers tried to get alcohol to impress girls for this party."" is the whole movie, but it's so much more fun of an experience than that.

You're not going to get a rich and fulfilling story, though they try to make it into a life lesson in a traditional ""coming of age"" style, but it's a pretty funny movie, if a little over the top. || Good, funny, dated.

If you can deal with a bit of cringe and some dated humour it's a good movie. I wouldn't consider it a ""top movie"" but it is _very_ funny if you just want something silly to watch casually."

Ah look, as you have most likely heard by now, this is not as good as the first two films and it's just a little bit tired in formula. However, it's still a bunch of fun if you already buy into the fastest mouth/fastest hands pairing of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. The plot is incidental, thus simple, and the emphasis here is more on fun than electrifying action. Though the finale here is edge of the seat exciting and laugh inducing in equal measure. There's some truly good one liners thrown out and the chemistry between the two actors is still very much evident.

Undemanding it is for sure, even disposable if it was to be judged as a single action/comedy entry, but it closes the trilogy down safe enough and the smile should rarely leave your face upon viewing. 6.5/10 || Arguably works as an example of the sort of red flags one might want to look out for if they suspect that a film's director is (like Brett Ratner) a sex offender.

Even though I am not a big fan of the original ""Halloween"" film directed by John Carpenter, I do acknowledge it as a film that started a horror slasher trend and served as an inspiration for many of the films that came after it. Since I am not crazy about the 1978 film, I thought I would be able to enjoy this remake without being too influenced by my love for the original film. After seeing this remake, I started to appreciate the original version a little bit more, since Rob Zombie turned the story and its characters into a vulgar mess.

The original film mostly focuses on the life of Laurie Strode going on about her business and interacting with her friends for the most part, while we see the mysterious Michael Myers stalking her, appearing from out of nowhere, and we never really get to know why (without taking the sequels into account). In this remake, Rob Zombie attempts to explore little Michael Myers' psychology, giving our villain a soul and establishing the roots of his evilness, taking away all the mystery and darkness surrounding the character. The results are not good by any means and the only thing it proves, is that sometimes, mystery is scarier and more disturbing than having everything explained, especially if the explanation is as predictable as ""he was raised in a bad environment"". The audience doesn't want to be spoon fed and I think it's clear that one of the main reasons why the original villain was scary, it's because Michael Myers remained as an enigmatic character from the beginning until the end. In the original film, Myers appears to come from a seemingly normal family, but for some reason, he turns out a merciless killer anyway. While the original ""Halloween"" film is not my favorite, as I established before, I do give the film credit for giving us a villain that no one could ever sympathize with. This film basically tries to portrait Michael as a poor little thing who was poorly raised and eliminates any possibility of seeing him as a genuinely dark and fear-provoking character. This overexposure of Michael's early years lasts about 40 minutes, which gets tedious, it makes the villain more pitiful than frightening and in the end, they don't really manage to establish a point about his insanity all that well either.

Once again, Rob Zombie casts his wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, who was great in 'House of 1000', playing a Insane, trashy girl… but why did she have to play almost the exact same character here? I don't know what's the deal with Rob Zombie having the need to show us his wife stripping and being sexy all the time, maybe it's some kind of fetish they have and it's all good... but 'Halloween' was not the right choice to show Sherri Moon dancing and showing her body again. Another thing that Rob Zombie seems to borrow from his film ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is the fact that the characters are swearing most of the times and while I have nothing against foul language whatsoever, but I think it sounds repetitive and silly when we hear the f-word every 5 seconds. The amount of stupid lines that could be easily compared to some of the crappiest PG-rated films that came out throughout the last years.

I'm really disappointed. I didn't think I was going to hate it so much, but I do and it's a shame because I really wanted to like this film. Better luck next time, I guess. My noble advice for all fans of the original 'Halloween' movie is: Don't watch this remake if you're sensitive, because this hurts a lot. I know I felt cheated, even if I'm not a fan of Carpenter's version either. || The film’s first act is simply a huge version of the 1978 classic’s opening scene; following Michael Myers as a child through his first murder(s). Though many people found this tedious and far too drawn-out, personally I relished the opportunity to get more than a half a minute of character-development on the antagonist. In fact, we don’t only get to see Michael growing up and being arrested, the film then goes on to show us his evolution in a mental asylum. Once again, I know that was less than appreciated by quite a number of people who saw the film, but I find the sequence fascinating every time I watch the movie. Things like the relevance of the mask and kitchen knife are explored more deeply than the original, and the brutality of the character of Michael Myers is more striking. Though this is not considered good to hardcore fans of the silent bogeyman-characteristics from the original.

The protagonist of the piece is a character by the name of Laurie Strode, just as she is in the John Carpenter version, and she has two similar off-siders as the original (one of whom is portrayed by Danielle Harris of _Halloween 4_ & _5_ fame). Where the film does not advance in comparison to its predecessor is the dialogue between these three characters. They use virtually identical language to that of the 1978 film, which felt outdated and artificial even then (I can only hope that this was an intentional throwback by Mr. Zombie). 

The Ahab to Laurie Strode is Doctor Loomis, Michael Myers’ psychologist, acted by the consistently fantastic Malcolm McDowell. I believe it is his performance that makes me appreciate Rob Zombie’s remake so much. He steals every scene he is in with his overwhelming presence, particularly in the Zone 2 theatrical version of the film (which to my knowledge is unfortunately not available in Australia).

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || The critics are wrong…again. Well, at least as far as I am concerned. This remake is not bad at all. A lot of people are comparing it with the original which is understandable. A lot of people says that it is crap compared to the original which is not understandable. At least not by me. This is one of the movies where I have seen the original and it was even one of my favorites at the time. I think this remake holds up quite well.

At first I was a bit worried that it was said to be a prequel. At least partly. However it is not really what I would call a prequel. It has a bit of extended background in the first quarter or so but that is not really what I would call a prequel.
I think the movie was pretty much what I expected or perhaps I should say what I hoped for. It is a slasher-movie of course but it resists the temptation to go all overboard. Nowadays you do not really get scared or even shocked by these kinds of movies so I was not really expecting to be. I was just enjoying Michael’s rampage through the town. It is of course a bit scary in itself that you are watching a madman going on a killing spree through a small town and enjoying it but hey, it is all fake!

One problem with the extended background at the beginning of the movie is that now there is kind of a plot-hole that is a bit annoying. When and, more importantly, how did Michael turn from a deranged kid to a supernatural killer with the strength to carry away one ton worth of tombstone and survive being stabbed as well as shot at?

Apart from that I think this movie was not bad at all. Sometimes I actually felt that Michael was behaving a bit too human like when he was stumbling when crashing through walls etc. but on the whole I quite liked this movie. The style is different from the original for sure but I do not feel it is worse or better for that matter.

It is a bit surprising (well maybe not, the French are bizarre when it comes to scheduling movies and TV-shows) that Cine+ did not schedule this movie for actual Halloween instead of the crap they did show. This one would have been perfect then instead of a day after."

The camaraderie between the two brothers is similar to DUMB AND DUMBER, but laughs are even fewer.

I got this movie because I enjoyed Will Arnett's work on <i>Arrested Development</i> and in an infamous Human Giant sketch where he plays a hyperbolic pervert ultimately killed by a sex machine. His acting here is similar to <i>Arrested Development</i>, and may not be all that great, but he's so much better than Will Forte, one of the most unversatile and unlikeable comedians ever cast on Saturday Night Live.

Created by writer/director Robert Rodriguez, “Planet Terror” was originally part of the double feature called “Grindhouse,” released in 2007.  The other movie was “Death Proof” by Quentin Tarantino. Both were standalone stories, although vaguely connected. They were a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes or, in this flick, a whole reel supposedly missing. Trailers for fake movies, like “Machete,” were also part of the package.

The plot of “Planet Terror” involves a biochemical outbreak in central Texas that (big surprise) turns people into zombies and the ragtag group that teams-up to fight ’em, led by Freddy Rodríguez and Michael Biehn, the latter a sheriff. Hotties Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton are on hand, the former acquiring a machine gun implant in replace of her amputated leg. (How exactly she pulls the trigger to massacre zombies is anyone’s guess).

The movie comes across as a melding of “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” (1965), “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) and “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), but with the modern tone of “Slither” (2006) with its gross, deliberately offensive black humor. McGowan is a highlight throughout, especially her opening go-go sequence whereas Freddy Rodriguez is surprisingly formidable. Their romantic arc is kind o’ touching. Another point of interest is the quality cast, rounded out by the likes of Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews and Fergie.

At the end of the day, though, “Planet Terror” fails to rise above the low-budget sorta-genius of Syfy schlock like “Flu Bird Horror” (2008), “Wyvern” (2009) and “Sasquatch Mountain” (2006) even though it cost literally twelve times as much. Go figure.

The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes and was shot in central Texas (Austin and Luling, which is 22 miles south of Austin) and Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico.

GRADE: C || Planet Terror failed to terrorise with its blood-bubble bursting infestation. The first feature of Rodriguez/Tarantino’s homage to the “Grindhouse” exploitation genre, is one that exercises the practical magic of independently produced B-movies. No dramatic theatricality to be seen here, on the misty darkened roads of rural Texas where “Fergalicious” Fergie screams the countryside down whilst being devoured by infected military units. This is Planet Terror, baby. The only quality that matters is the amount of bloodshed that splatters onto the screen. Rodriguez may have directed, produced, written, scored, edited and shot the entire feature, he seemingly tried too hard in replicating the exploitation aesthetic that, if you strip away the grainy filter, comes across as a mildly engaging experiment. A one-legged Go-Go dancer, her legendary ex-boyfriend, and a plethora of other survivors, make battle with a zombie horde that have been infected with a biochemical agent known as “Project Terror”.

I saw it in the poster. You’ve seen it in the poster. We’ve all seen it in the poster. McGowan, with the stance of a badass, equipped with an assault rifle as a leg. That’s the level of awesome stupidity we are dealing with here, and to say I craved it would be an understatement. Rodriguez had the freedom to construct a feature so devilishly fun, that it could’ve been absolutely non-sensical and still be thoroughly entertaining. This is the genre where all rules are broken. Literally! Yet I found myself restrained to the confinement of my sofa. Why? Well, Planet Terror barbecued itself by never letting go. Something was constantly weighing down the feature, and I just can’t put my finger on it. The acting smelt of mild cheddar as opposed to stinking bishop. Aside from a few quotable lines, mostly from El Wray, Rodriguez’ screenplay was forgettable and largely an unfocused mess. For example, the sub-plot involving Brolin’s stern doctor character failed to inject any characterised purpose other than to pad out the runtime. But as soon as McGowan acquired that machine gun, catapulted herself into the air (beautifully terrible green screen and all...) and decimated the zombie horde ahead. Bam! That’s when Planet Terror worked! Piloting a helicopter at a slant so that the propeller decapitates the infected? Yes! Tarantino attempting to be a rapist? God no! Turn it off! It was unfortunately too late before it manifested the pure qualities of its genre.

Aesthetically though, Rodriguez was able to imitate that exploitation feel. The mass amount of blood spewing from the practical makeup design was exceptional and eloquently highlighted the visceral power of pragmatic effects. Limbs torn off like a family tucking into a KFC bargain bucket. Delicious. The grainy filter that imitated a film reel, “missing reel” included, had authenticity despite its occasional annoyance when infecting the entire screen with black marks everywhere.

However, strip away those aesthetic qualities, and the B-movie shine that Rodriguez aimed for suddenly dims. It’s too serious in execution to be considered full “grindhouse”, and that’s a shame. Had it embraced the sheer lunacy of its climactic ten minutes throughout the entire feature, Planet Terror could’ve been bloody special."

3:10 to Yuma is directed by James Mangold and co-adapted to screenplay by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. A remake of Delmer Daves' 1957 film of the same name, it's based on a story written by Elmore Leonard. It stars Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Peter Fonda, Ben Foster and Logan Lerman. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael.

After the capture of notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe), a posse is put together to escort him to the town of Contention from where he will be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Joining this posse is broke rancher Dan Evans (Bale), disabled in the Civil War, Dan is struggling to keep hold of his land and to support his family. Seen as a flop in the eyes of his eldest son William (Lerman), Dan sees this opportunity as a way out of his problems. But with Wade an intelligent foe, and the outlaw boss' gang on their trail, Evans and the posse will do well to make it to Contention alive...

Daves' original film is a fine effort, very much pulsing with psychological beats and cloaked in claustrophobic atmospherics. Backed up by two excellent Western performers in Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, there is many a Western fan who cherish it and never felt it was a genre piece ripe for a remake; myself included. But the logic behind the reasons Mangold and his team put forward for remaking it made sense. A story of great thematics for the adults, and action a go-go for the younger modern film fan. Thus putting a Western back in the headlines at yet another time when the genre was gasping for air. All that was left to do was get two of the modern era's biggest stars to play Wade and Evans - which of course they duly did - and it was good to go. Just don't mess it up was all that was asked of the makers.

Running at nearly half an hour longer than the original, Mangold's movie slots in a new mid-section and changes the ending. The former works a treat as the posse venture through hostile Apache country, meet some ne'er-do-well railroad ruffians, while Wade's gang, led by the supremely fiendish Charlie Prince (Foster), are on the bloody trail. The latter is a huge misstep, both in execution and character development. Most film fans are happy to suspend disbelief in the name of good entertainment, but here we are asked to ignore some impossible athletics while also being asked to swallow a character turn around that beggars belief. Such a shame because up till then the blend of traditional Western character themes such as morality and redemption had dovetailed nicely with the pistol banging and all round breezy action construction. While the father and son axis also gives the narrative some extra bite.

Even bad guys love their mothers.

The performances are also of a high standard. In the support slots Fonda, Foster and Lerman are top dollar. Fonda is all leather faced and gruff as bounty hunter McElroy, Foster does a quality line in sneering villainy, and Lerman, in a tricky role, utterly convinces as the conflicted boy breaking out into a man. But this is Crowe and Bale's movie. Crowe has Wade as an intelligent dandy, a man who loves and understands women, an artist who also has a tongue as quick as his hands are on his guns. We know that Wade is callous, but Crowe ensures that we never know what is around the corner or truly on his mind. Bale puts much dignity into Evans, he's a put upon man, tortured by his failings on the home front, but there is stoic nobility there and as he and Wade venture further on their journey, a grudging respect begins to form and Bale and Crowe really start to put credibility into their characters. And then that last quarter nearly undoes all their excellent work...

In spite of this, 3:10 to Yuma is a good time to be had as a modern Western production with old traditional values. Energetic and never dull from first frame to last, it's recommended on proviso you don't mind unscrewing your head and taking out your brain for the last 15 minutes. 7.5/10

 || The price of redemption -- READ THIS if you had problems with the ending

This remake involves the capture of a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), who is then escorted to the town of Contention to await the train to Yuma, where he'll be hanged. A desperate rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), hires on for the escort job because he needs the $200 for his family to survive. Wade plays psychological games the entire time trying to corrupt Evans, but things turn out differently.

The cast is outstanding (which also features the beautiful Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda), the New Mexican locations are great and the score ranks with the all-time best. Most importantly the picture is engaging throughout its 2 hour runtime, not to mention the story gives the viewer a lot to chew on.

The first hour of the film is realistic but what turned me off during my initial viewing was the second hour's mounting implausibilities. Thankfully, most of these can be explained.

One issue is when a man burns to death locked in a wagon carriage. The quibble is that he doesn't scream enough in fiery torment. But watch the scene and you'll clearly hear him yelling in the background. Evan's loss of a limp at the climax is more of an issue, although this can be explained by an adrenaline rush.

One problem I had was that Ben Wade (Crowe) came off as super-human. There was seemingly nothing he couldn't do, even while handcuffed. I suppose this could be explained by the fact that there ARE people who are incredibly gifted to the point of being nigh super-human. 

In any event, this is not a realistic Western like, say, ""Wyatt Earp"" or ""The Long Riders."" No, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a MYTHIC Western with an potent message. If you can't handle strong mythic elements in Westerns look elsewhere.

When I first saw the film I didn't get the ending and it turned me off. But it was clear that there was more to the picture than what first meets the eye so I decided to view it again. It DOES make sense, it's just that you might miss it on your initial viewing because the events flash by so quickly. When you DO see it, it'll blow you away.

***SPOILER ALERT*** DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FILM! 

Wade is a confident and talented man who smugly looks down on others, acting like a disciple of Nietzsche who has no moral obligation to anyone, least of all God. He senses simple purity in Evans and plays the role of tempter, trying to corrupt Evans and win him to his way of thinking. But as they wait in the hotel room it is Evans who ""converts"" Wade, in a sense. Evans doesn't accomplish this in any type of contrived manner, he accomplishes it simply by being WHO HE IS -- an undefiled, courageous family man who stubbornly refuses to give up on hope, faith, life, righteousness and family.

As they're waiting, Wade sketches a picture of Evans in a book. It is later shown that this sketch was made on an opening page of a Bible. This reveals that Wade came to view Evans as a Christ figure, at least subconsciously, and that Evans is clearly a type of Christ in the story.

What exactly was it that caused Wade to ""convert"" and support Evans? (1.) He saw in Evans a man that refused to be bought -- a man who refused to be corrupted by filthy lucre, which was something he never experienced before. (2.) Evan's son insisted that there was still some good in Wade despite his wicked history. Regardless of Wade's denial, the kid was right. The idea that SOMEONE saw a glimmer of good in him, that SOMEONE out there BELIEVED in him despite his past evil deeds ultimately moved him and compelled him to support Evans. (3.) Wade turned evil because he was abandoned as a kid. He saw in Evans and his wife a REAL family -- parents who stayed together and refused to abandon faith, hope, righteousness and family come hell or high water. He became convinced that Evans and his family were worth supporting, even perhaps dying for. (4.) Evans made a deal with the Pinkerton that if he successfully got Wade to the train the Pinkerton would make sure Evans' family got $1000, which would bail them out of their hardships. Wade wanted to make sure the family got that money. Somewhere deep inside he wanted to redeem himself of his wicked past and this was the opportunity. This could be the beginning of a new life.

(5.) Wade's relationship with Evans lasted only a few days but he found something that was missing in all his other relationships - a friendship based on respect rather than familiarity or shared events. Great friendships like this can happen quickly similar to love-at-first-sight. Such relationships are conducive to transparency, which explains why Evans reveals to Wade the real reason he lost his leg in the war.

After Evan's brutal death Wade has an even greater revelation: To see a truly undefiled man -- a simple but GREAT man -- murdered by a group of immoral swine fills him with disgust. You can see it on his face. Yes, he should be thankful that his men remained loyal to him but this was about their only redeeming quality. To truly start a new life he would have to be judge and executioner of the corrupted souls who would pull him back down into the slime.

Why did Evans have to die? Because redemption can only be paid via the spilling of blood. It was the price for Wade to live and have a new life.

GRADE: A || This is the best Western of the 21st Century so far (for mine, just edging out Django Unchained). 

Building on the classic movie from 1957, James Mangold's remake adds in much needed scenes to fill plot holes and build nuanced characters that were sorely lacking in the original.  

Our hero now, is a man struggling to keep his farm and the respect of his family whilst the ""antagonist"" (I stretch the use of the word here) is almost tired of his way of life and his ""family.""  Adding in the concept of children to these two was smart thinking on the part of the writers and this really deepens Bale and Crowe's characters.  

Speaking of which, both give perfectly nuanced performances here and you can watch their characters grow in response to each other as the movie progresses.  Both ""sons"" (Lerman and Foster) fit into their roles of the naive teen becoming a man, and the unhinged ""son"" idolising his ""father"" respectively.  The rest of the cast have been perfectly chosen. 

The cinematography is stunning at times, but unlike most Westerns, this does emphasize the country - it is more of a silent character here.  But when it is shown, it is just gorgeous...seriously, I hadnt seen snow in Westerns until this - but it just looks brilliant. 

The score drips with the memories of older, more famous Westerns, but Beltrami makes this one unique.  Sound design is also great, even using the heartbeat-like rhythm of the idling train's engine in the final scene.  

Everything else is perfect - the lighting, editing, costumes, set design...this does not look like an independently made film that the major studios didnt want to touch.  The people who worked on this, really wanted to.  And that's also probably why its so good.  

THIS is how to remake a movie.  Enjoy."

It's love, though, and the young man is doing his best to fit into their privileged world by studying (at their expense) at Cambridge with a view to becoming a doctor. Meantime, following a scene that she has completely misinterpreted and the reading of a letter that wasn't any of her business, their behaviour is being rather unhealthily scrutinised by her thirteen year old sister ""Briony"" (Saoirse Ronan) who soon becomes fixated on the couple, on destroying the couple and to that latter end she concocts a story that not only achieves her goal, but sees ""Robbie"" wrongly incarcerated for a fairly heinous crime. The war intervenes and that gives the lovers a chance to recalibrate their feelings for each other whilst the now more mature ""Briony"" (now Romola Garai) with whom her sister has become estranged, is having a serious crisis of conscience and travels to London to be both a nurse and to take responsibility for her behaviour five years earlier. This is a complex and detailed piece of cinema and McAvoy delivers really well as the honest and decent lad caught up in a web of deceit and envy. Knightley is less effective - but still contributes well enough as the truth is finally known before an inevitable tragedy strikes. It's a story about the ramifications of a lie, but it's also about people's abilities to love, forgive and to judge. Loyalty might only be skin deep but regret lasts for ever, and ever might not be so long as you might hope. Dario Marianelli has created a masterful score to accompany this story and the writing and Joe Wright's subtle direction ensure we steer well clear of the melodramatic and the sentimental as the denouement looms and Vanessa Redgrave appears for a quite fitting final mea culpa. A straightforward British period drama this isn't and it's well worth a watch on big screen for the a cinematography that marries the rustic charm of rural England with the horrors of bombs, bullets and blood poignantly."

Erica Bain (Jodie Foster) survives a vicious subway attack that saw her intended husband killed. Unsatisfied with the police efforts to catch the killers, and submerged by grief, she decides to take matters into her own hands and clear the streets of criminal vermin...

Well there's no getting away from it, this is basically a feminist version of Death Wish. Director Neil Jordan pitches the always great Foster right into the moral quagmire of vigilante justice. This is a smart and provocative vigilante thriller at the core, yet the preposterous machinations on show render it somewhat annoying - none more so than with the finale which is just ridiculous.

Erica takes up a gun, it becomes her comfort blanket, and as she battles with self loathing of what she is doing, she amazingly starts ridding the streets of scumbags. We are also asked to swallow that she becomes very tight to the lead detective investigating the vigilante crimes, played by Terence Howard (superb).

Unfortunately, Jordan seems to run out of guts to follow through in creating something worth saying. Instead pitching Erica in increasingly daft situations, with dialogue to match, for a film with a lady lead kicking butt, the whole thing actually lacks balls. The lead actors ensure it's no stinker, and who doesn't feel a punch the air moment in them as scumbag criminals gets what's due? But really it's an above average vigilante film at best. 6/10"
6973.0,In the Valley of Elah,A career officer and his wife work with a police detective to uncover the truth behind their son's disappearance following his return from a tour of duty in Iraq.,Sometimes finding the truth is easier than facing it.,"History, Drama, Thriller, Crime, Mystery",124.0,2007-09-14,en,6.785,1023.0,1.1024,"Tommy Lee Jones, Charlize Theron, Susan Sarandon, Frances Fisher, James Franco",Paul Haggis,"police, parent child relationship, war crimes, homicide, detective, patriotism, investigation, iraq, military service, cover-up, disappearance, murder investigation","A soldier disappears after he has come back from Iraq. His father, Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones), is alerted and sets off in the hopes of finding his son. He soon finds out that his son was actually killed, brutally you might say, his body cut up and burned. The evidence lead in no real directions, but it soon becomes apparent that his army bodies are lying, also, the images that Hank recovers from his son's phone, seem to suggest that something happened in Iraq.

To say anything more would be to ruin the movie. However, this movie is not just a crime story, where we follow the father and cop (Charlize Theron) as they get to the bottom of the mystery. This is a story about war, the people in it and at hoome, as well as bravery and sorrow. It is told carefully, and with skillfully precision by the entire cast, and Paul Haggis.

By the end, we don't even really care about the murder being solved, just that the father finally made peace with his son. He understands better than anyone what war does to a man, you can see that clearly in his eyes  throughout the movie.

Only one thing bothered me about this movie, and it is actually something that bothers me quite often. Music. I don't mind music in movies, I don't even mind music that enhances a certain emotion, sorrow, happiness etc. No, what bothers me is that moviemakers feel that they need music so badly, when really, they don't. More often than not, the images and actors speak the words clearly, we don't need the sad tones to emphasize what we are already feeling. It's not that bad in this movie, but I did notice it a few times, where it bothered me.

_Last words... don't watch this movie and feel like you need to ""figure it out"". It's not about that at all, just allow yourself to be swept away be the amazing cast and let the story onfold itself in front of you. This is not a story about a crime, but a story about a father... and a son._ || When “Hank” (Tommy Lee Jones) gets a call to say that his soldier son “Mike” has gone awol shortly after his return to the USA from Iraq, he sets off to track him down. Initially, he hits a wall of indifference from investigators but then an hacked-up body is discovered and quickly identified as the missing man. Together with police officer “Sanders” (Charlize Theron) - who is, herself, having to prove her worth in a chauvinist department of clods, they decide it’s best to work together on a case that seems to suggest that drugs might be at the bottom of the case and that some of his son’s erstwhile colleagues from the war might know more or even be complicit. Of course “Hank” doesn’t want to believe that his son could be involved in dealing narcotics, but as they begin to piece things together with some spurious clues and conflicting testimony, it looks like that might just be the only solution. The first hour or so of this is quite a potent look at just how war takes away any perception of the value of life. “It’s how we coped” is often used, and plausibly so on many occasions, but as we near the denouement the structures of the story start to fall away and the denouement is distinctly weak - as if the writer hadn’t quite the courage of any convictions necessary to see the thrust of their story through to a more honest conclusion. It just sort of peters out with a denouement that seems to want to make an entirety independent statement about the effects of war that makes decent men less so and bad men more so. There’s too much chatter about who has jurisdiction and the sparing appearances from Susan Sarandon as wife/mother “Joan” can’t really add much more than the desperate mother wondering what her son was doing in the military in the first place, and that of course points a finger squarely at a dad who perhaps demanded too much of his child. It is worth a watch as there is a degree of chemistry between Jones and Theron but there’s simply not enough meat on it’s bones."
4629.0,December Boys,"For many years, four teenage orphans at an Australian outback convent have watched their younger comrades find new parents, and realize that they may never be adopted. The Reverend Mother sends the four boys away on a seaside vacation, where they meet Teresa and Fearless, a couple who would make perfect parents. The youths compete with one another to be the one Teresa and Fearless decide to adopt.",After that summer nothing would be the same.,"Drama, Romance",105.0,2007-09-14,en,6.0,201.0,1.3407,"Daniel Radcliffe, Lee Cormie, Christian Byers, James Fraser, Jack Thompson","Marc Rosenberg, Rod Hardy","sea, friendship, beach, orphanage, hope, adoption, male friendship, rivalry, teenage crush, best friend","_**Coming-of-age in South Australia... and tantalizing Teresa Palmer**_  

I was interested in ""December Boys"" (2007) for two reasons: I like (non-raunchy) coming-of-age flicks and the fact that it takes place on the Southern coast of Australia (actually it was shot on Kangaroo Island, part of South Australia). As for Daniel Radcliffe, the star of the popular Harry Potter films, I've never seen him in a movie before and have no interest in him or Potter.

The story revolves around four boys from an Outback Catholic orphanage who get to celebrate their December birthdays by taking a Christmas holiday on the coast. They discover that a young childless couple are interested in adopting one of them, which creates a bit of rivalry, although the oldest one (Radcliffe) could care less and spends his time learning about girls and romance. Their time at the coast becomes a cornerstone experience as they ultimately discover what family means.

Unless you're Australian, I encourage you to utilize the English subtitles to understand the nigh-unintelligible Australian dialect. Otherwise you'll only comprehend about half the dialogue and the story will be lost to you. No kidding.

After seeing the film a few times I only remember two of the boys: Maps and Misty. The others might as well have been phantoms. The plot is interesting, but the story as-played-out is not very compelling (although the epilogue is slightly moving). The film tries too hard to be “magical.” Scenes come and go with largely ill-defined characters and little dialogue or explanation. This is definitely a picture where you'll have to read in between the lines to appreciate, which might make it good for repeat-viewings.

On the positive side, the Kangaroo Island locations are fabulous, especially the high shots of Remarkable Rocks in Flinders Chase National Park.

The picture really comes alive when Teresa Palmer is on screen; she plays femme fatale Lucy. The movie poster (or DVD cover) is deceiving in that Teresa looks to be about 12-13 years-old. Actually she was 20 during filming and plays an about-16 girl with curvy legs from here to New York. Lucy's scenes with Maps are the highlight of the picture (and not at all ""awkward"" as another reviewer contended). Lucy is aware of her tantalizing feminine powers and skillfully utilizes them to bewitch Maps with her spell.

Other highlights include a secret cave high up on the rocks, a wild black horse who seems to fish, an Evel Knieval-type character who may not be as ""Fearless"" as he lets on, a colossal fish named Henry and the cantankerous old man fascinated by it.

The DVD feature about 10-minutes of deleted scenes that should have never been deleted. Make sure you catch 'em as they help explain the story better.

In the book the story was set in the 30s, but the filmmakers decided to switch it to the late 60s. Some people found this confusing, but I didn’t. Others complained that the children-as-adults at the end were too old considering they were kids in the late 60s, but the epilogue obviously takes place in the near future, like the 2010s or 2020s, which would put them in their 50s or 60s.

BOTTOM LINE: Although the story is merely okay as far as captivating and moving cinema goes, the highlights noted above compel me to give ""December Boys"" a decent rating, in particular the scenic rocks/coast and Lucy.

If you like Teresa Palmer in this picture be sure to check her out in ""Bedtime Stories"" (2008), ""Restraint"" (2008) and ""The Grudge 2"" (2006).

The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes.

The third movie in the Resident Evil franchise and the beginning slide into outright sci-fi action.

Unfortunately, umbrella’s experiments on Alice have results that sometimes become the focus and begin dragging the franchise further from survival horror. I enjoyed this entry with the addition of Claire Redfield from the games, the return of Carlos Olivera, and the hopelessness of the deadly sun-scorched wasteland continually claiming the lives of the struggling survivors. But Alice’s superpowers distract from the core of what makes this franchise great: surviving zombie horror. || This one is kind of boring till you get to the end.

A new-age, brilliant vampire movie that never got the acclaim it rightfully deserved.

_30 Days of Night_ is one of the few films I like that I can never understand why other people don’t. Though I do prefer other movies like _Revolver, Doomsday and Donnie Darko_ to it, with those I can always understand when people don’t see in them what I do. With _30 Days of Night_, if you don’t have a problem with gore, then you shouldn’t have a problem with the film. And yet I have personal friends as well as people I’ve heard from online who totally dig horror, gore, vampires etc. and yet don’t like _30 Days of Night_, which confuses me all to Hell, let me tell you.

Though I was mildly aggravated by the inconstancies in the number of vampires around, other than that I can find virtually nothing bad to say about _30 Days of Night_. Firstly you have Josh Hartnett (_The Faculty_) as Sheriff Eben, protagonist, secondly you have Danny Huston (_The Proposition_) as Marlow, leader of the vampires, who attack Alaska during the winter period of 30 days without sun (which in and of itself is an awesome concept, and thirdly there’s Ben Foster (_Pandorum_) as the vampire’s human lapdog, all of whom are personal favourites of mine. That’s not even mentioning the fact that Eben’s wife is played by Australian Melissa George (_Triangle_), who was born in my hometown, so even if she wasn’t a great actor, she’d get auto-points.

Basically every point in which _30 Days of Night_ differentiates from the comic it’s based on is an improvement to the story, which is (gasp, shock, horror) a mildly realistic Vampire film. God forbid. I love the vampires in this. Though they’re not quite as sexy and well-dressed as they are in _Underworld _or as demonic as they are in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, they bring a totally new brutality to the vampire class. They wear what you’d expect late 30-ish people living in 2007 to wear, they’re stronger than the average human, but not impossibly so, they hunt in packs and give off bloodcurdling, atavistic shrieks (of which I give quite a good impression; sidenote) they’re unrelenting an animalistic but just as intelligent as a regular person, they’re quick, dark and deadly.

There’s no camp to be found here, not always a good thing, but in _30 Days of Night_, it is. I honestly cannot recommend this one enough, despite its intense gore and general panning, I implore you to at the very least give it a go, and decide for yourself.

Both the human survivors and the vampire invaders are there simply trying to stay alive, the vamps through their sadistic, systematic hunting of the local populace for their food-source, blood, and the people by trying to both hide, and fight back, but mostly the former. Ironically, it’s the “humanity” of the humans that causes every one of their downfalls, while they’re leached from above by a far superior race, who goes so far as to call humans a “plague” and invent a new language all for themselves, just so as to not have to speak the same filthy way we lower-beings do (and I mean, if your choice was between that and having to put up with American-English, wouldn’t you?).

-_Gimly_ || Barrow, Alaska. The most northern town in the United States, where for 30 days every year it is has no sunlight.

This is the perfect opportunity for a gang of merciless, & blood-thirsty vampires to feed on the remaining inhabitants of this small town, after most leave for the month of darkness.

As people are leaving, and others are making preparations for their time of hibernation, mysterious occurrences are uncovered; mobile phones stolen, and destroyed, an entire team of sled dogs butchered. The ground work for the impending doom of a malevolent force.

Once the killings and feedings begin there is no let up. I have watched my share of vampire films, and frankly this is definitely one of the best made, its stripped back, bare, and unromanticized. This group of vampires, led by the visceral Marlow (Houston) take no pity on the town of Barrow as they tear it apart looking for their prey, and using people as bait to lure hiding survivors out into the cold and snowed out streets of the isolated mining town.

The second half of the film becomes a tale of survival, as town Sheriff Eben Olemun (Hartnett) and his soon to be ex-wife Stella (George), lead a group of survivors who manage to hide themselves away by staying in an attic, scared and cold they realize that it is only a matter of time before they are discovered and killed.

Even though this is a film that does involve a fair amount of blood and gore, the film's real heart lies in the way it scares you with what it doesn't show in the lead up to the early killings, this for me is true horror, show me next to nothing, and build the most amount of tension, then deliver the shock, and you'll have me pissing my pants every time. There is also a fair amount of brutality shown, not only in how the vampires kill their prey, but also how they are dispensed by Eben and the others.

On an interesting note, this is a film based on a graphic novel written by Steve Niles, who co-wrote the screenplay to the film. Niles had actually pitched the original idea as a film some years before, but reworked it to graphic novel after being knocked back by several producers, it was then picked up afterwards by one of those producers to make this film we have now. || Eh, it's OK."
4771.0,Gone Baby Gone,"When 4 year old Amanda McCready disappears from her home and the police make little headway in solving the case, the girl's aunt, Beatrice McCready hires two private detectives, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro. The detectives freely admit that they have little experience with this type of case, but the family wants them for two reasons—they're not cops and they know the tough neighborhood in which they all live.",Everyone wants the truth... until they find it.,"Crime, Drama, Mystery",113.0,2007-09-18,en,7.307,3907.0,2.4862,"Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, John Ashton",Ben Affleck,"robbery, corruption, based on novel or book, police, kidnapping, boston, massachusetts, blackmail, detective, drug addiction, murder, conspiracy, gang, pedophile, drugs, alcoholic, addict, child kidnapping, neo-noir, anxious, cautionary, critical, frightened","Do you know people in the neighborhood who don't talk to the police?

Gone Baby Gone is directed by Ben Affleck and Affleck co-adapts the screenplay with Aaron Stockard from the novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane. It stars Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, John Ashton and Amy Ryan. Music is by Harry Gregson Williams and cinematography by John Toll.

Private Investigators Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Monaghan) are hired to find missing child Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien). It appears to be a simple case of a kidnapping, but the deeper the investigators go the darker the truths become.

A potent drama, Gone Baby Gone offers up a mystery that is propelled by moral murkiness. Unsurprisingly given it's from a Lehane novel, the twists and deep characterisations dovetail seamlessly with the very real feel of a Boston neighbourhood, the sense of place and community superbly marshalled by Ben Affleck (in what was his debut as a director). The story is so strong it makes us the viewers part of the search for missing Amanda, which in turn forces us to answer the ethical quandaries thrust upon Patrick Kenzie.

With tech credits firmly in the plus column and the director un-showy and assured enough to keep the key third act from dragging the picture down, this proves to be very good film making. Pic only has minor faults to be bothered by. Monaghan is a fine actress but she is hard to take here in a street wise role, though with a nicely cast Casey Affleck dominating their scenes she gets away with it. The sharp of mind should pick up on what is driving the mystery forward, whilst the ambiguity at resolution point can go either way for respective viewers appreciation or otherwise. But this is all told a rewarding piece of adult cinema and recommended for sure. 8/10 || **Overall : A well-done mystery thriller with a melancholy tone that never lets up and ultimately leaves the viewer a little more sad than satisfied.**

Ben Affleck's debut as a director was a decent start. Gone Baby Gone is a crime thriller with significant surprises and twists. The excellent cast and performances accentuated the emotional toll of working on a kidnapping case, and that emotional weight saturates every aspect of the film. Unfortunately, that heavy tone makes the movie a little challenging to enjoy. The dismal and somber mood throughout left me just feeling sad at the end. That poignant hopeless nature was clearly the goal and was well executed but keeps it from being a traditionally ""enjoyable"" film. || Private detectives ""Patrick"" (Casey Affleck) and ""Angie"" (Michelle Monaghan) are drafted in by the mother of a missing girl to try to find out what's happened. This is pretty much virgin territory for the pair, but they are local and so might be able to unearth sources unwilling to discuss with the police efforts being led by ""Doyle"" (Morgan Freeman). Now it's fair to say that the child's mother ""Helene"" (Amy Ryan) is probably not the most attentive of parents, but she is determined to be reunited with her daughter. What now ensues follows this investigation into their Boston suburb - one that takes them into contact with crooks, drug dealers and an whole fraternity of dangerous hoodlums. Their searching does, however, start to bear fruit - and not a kind of fruit that they really want to discover. The plot thickens and twists and evidence of just who did what and, as importantly, why emerges that causes quite a moral dilemma for the pair. There is a strong dynamic here between the very much on-form partnership of Affleck and Monaghan and the former's brother (Ben) directs this film with consistent pace and a plausible degree of menace. Serendipity takes just too much of an hand in the ending for my liking, but it's still a compelling and thought provoking story that ends up by asking us all a question - the answer to which is not necessarily straightforward. Freeman really only features sparingly, but there are solid supporting contributions from Ed Harris and, to a lesser extent, from Titus Welliver that all help deliver a taut and intriguing drama that is well worth a watch."

Melora Hardin look great in this.

I think I will just come right out and say it from the off, this is a masterpiece, a truly spell binding, mesmerising tour de force that seeps class from every pore. I have often found myself cringing and turning my back on those who use in film debate the tired old defence of ""it's not for everyone"", but here I find I have no choice because this picture is purely for those enamoured with poetic beauty and precision film making at its highest. Those in search of an all action gun toting western need not apply, in fact those merely after popcorn fodder to while away an evening viewing should steer well clear. Andrew Dominik's second directorial effort is a character and dialogue driven piece of work, its thematic heart swirling with intelligence and elegiac beauty.

The story centrers around the final days of notorious outlaw Jesse James, and how one of his young disciples came to murder him on April 3rd 1882. Using Ron Hansen's novel as its source, it also fills in the gaps as to what became of the murderer Robert Ford as regards the subsequent aftermath of killing the infamous Jesse James. The film is dealing with issues all to prevalent in modern day society, we are witnessing perhaps the first instance of celebrity status gone berserker, we see how the press glamorise the nasty piece of work that was Jesse James, turning him into some sort of quintessential noble outlaw. We observe a stalking menace yearning to be like his hero, a young and impressionable fellow who's hurtling towards infamy completely oblivious of the pitfalls and irony of it all.

Structually the film is perfect, and to me the film defines the old saying of art on the silver screen. The performances of the lead actors are incredible, Brad Pitt gives a career high as Jesse James, all teetering villainy yet perfectly befitting the prince charming outlaw persona so gleefully built up by the press. Sam Rockwell is Charley Ford, and here he proves that movie big wigs really need to start giving the guy some more dramatic roles to get his teeth in to. Yet as good as Pitt & Rockwell are, both men are left trailing in the wake of Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford, childish emotion fused with flecks of dark undercurrents as Affleck layers a perfect show. How the academy chose to ignore this performance should be seen as an act of treason against American cinema.

Few films have left me open mouthed in admiration at the quality on show, but shot after shot, frame after frame, this really is as gorgeous as it comes. Roger Deakins photography sublimely pleasing the eyes at every edit, be it lush rolling hills cloaked in snow, or shadowy figures appearing like ghosts from locomotive smoke, with Deakins firmly cementing his reputation as a master of his craft. The score from Nick Cave & Warren Ellis perfectly captures the ambiance and texture of the piece, with Cave himself bagging a cameo performance as a bar room busker. It's incredible to think that this is only director Andrew Dominik's second feature film, following on from the hugely enjoyable Chopper in 2000, it is now evident that New Zealand can lay claim to producing a talent that if all goes to plan, will go on to become a director to rank up with the best of them.

As it is, and just right now, The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford should be filed along side Vertigo as a member of that club that only admits the greatest American films of all time, and that be even if it was directed by a Kiwi, wink wink America.

Black Sheep, written and directed by Jonathan King is a wonderfully kooky horror comedy filmed out of New Zealand. Premise is simple, genetic tampering by unstable farmer man-child type has produced psychotic zombie sheep who like to chow down on human flesh. If you are ""lucky"" to still be alive after being bitten, you turn into a human/sheep hybrid - who likes to chow down on human flesh! All inhabitants of this island are doomed unless three spunky young heroes in waiting can overcome monumental odds and save the day!

With effects done by Weta being no bad thing, Black Sheep is a whole bunch of popcorn munching fun. Many of the jokes aren't really surprising but they hit the mark because the comedy is drawn nice and broad. It helps as well that much of it carries a sense of mischievous depravity about it, while the snarky asides to scientists and tree hugging environmentalists shows King to have a semblance of world awareness about him. The cinematography (Richard Bluck) is gorgeous, capturing the magnificent landscapes as a backdrop to the ovine carnage, and Victoria Kelly's musical score is jovial supreme.

Nothing earth shattering here, so those horror/comedy fans who venture in for the first time expecting otherwise will be disappointed. However, at under 90 minutes in length King's movie never once sags in pace or gasp for new comedic air. It's a short sharp shocker of a rib tickler and well worthy of a look if in the requisite mood. 7/10"

It stands up because it is staged in Rio and created by Brazilians.

The plot is not very surprising but good enough. || **One of the best films that Brazil exported internationally.**

Being Portuguese, I believe that I know the realities of Brazil reasonably better than most foreigners. After all, historical and cultural ties connect the two countries to this day. For this reason, I am not at all surprised by the portrait that this film leaves us, about a world that rarely appears in the tourist magazines of Rio de Janeiro: the poor areas that, from the top of the hills, observe the noblest neighborhoods of the city.
I could talk a little more about these slums, called “favelas”, but the truth is that I don't know much about them. Until the first decades of the 20th century, the visitor walking the streets of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo or other cities would observe that the poorest generally lived in very compartmentalized buildings, called “cortiços”, scattered throughout the old neighbourhoods of the city. From the middle of the century, however, we witnessed the renewal and gentrification of the urban centers, with the demolition of large degraded areas and the building of modern structures and even skyscrapers. Pushed to the periphery, the marginalized ended up building their homes freely, without a plan or project, using leased or unowned land, giving rise to chaotic and disorderly urban tissues that climbed the hills. Total poverty, which has always driven Man to crime, was soon associated with drug trafficking and consumption, and other crimes such as illegal gambling, arms dealing and prostitution, and led to the birth of criminal mafias, heavily armed, which took advantage of the geography and difficulty of entering some of these “favelas” to transform them into fortresses, where not even the regular police dare to enter.

Thus, the issue of favelas was, and still is, a serious social, urbanistic and human problem for Brazilian cities. I don't have reliable data, but as far as I know, there is a long way to go to solve issues such as the lack of infrastructure, the lack of security of the land and the construction of houses in unstable lands. I know that measures have been taken to resolve them, and above all to combat crime (the film reveals this, taking advantage of Pope Benedict XVI's visit), but to what extent are they effective? What I can say is that, for now, Rio and São Paulo are off the list of the most dangerous cities in Brazil, but there is much to be done in other cities such as João Pessoa, Fortaleza, São Salvador or Natal.

In this film, we follow the journey of two recruits on a course for an elite police force, trained to intervene in the most complicated scenarios: the BOPE. Each is guided by their own reasons, but they are united by a feeling of weariness at the impunity of criminals. The head of the recruit, Captain Nascimento, is also at the center of the plot, as he is discreetly looking for a replacement in order to retire and be able to dedicate the rest of his time to his family, and the little psychological sanity he has left. It is a very raw portrayal of the extremely violent training of these units which, however, prepares them for the authentic urban warfare they have to face. It also lets us foresee a little of the gravity of the problem itself: armie-like bandits who commit brutalities without thinking twice, and a police force that could go to war if needed.

With this film, Wagner Moura achieves one of the most outstanding and important works of his career. He was not, until this film, one of the great Brazilian actors, one of those that we always remember when we think of Brazilian drama. However, I had already been appreciating his quality in some TV works he did, and even so, it was quite impressive to see him here. And although the film features other talented actors, such as André Ramiro and Caio Junqueira, it is Moura who stands out and dominates the film. I also liked the work of Fernanda Machado who, in a much more discreet way, shows the somewhat utopian and dreamy way in which upper-class youngsters seek to cultivate a sense of social justice without knowing, however, how to solve the problems at their root.

Technically, the film stands out for its enormous realism. It's a work of fiction, the characters and situations are invented, but everything was thought to seem true and authentic as in a documentary. We observe this, for example, in the enormous amount of profanity and slang used in the dialogues, or in the careful selection of the filming locations used, which include some “favelas” in Rio. Another point of praise is the quality of the action scenes, worthy of a big-budget American film and filled with good special effects and sound. It is a film inappropriate for children or to watch with that narrow-minded granny, but very good, one of the best films that Brazil managed to export internationally. || **As a brazilian, i can approve this movie as relatable**

As a brazilian, this movie i can agree with. I love the drama, the action parts are good. But best of all, THE POLICE. In Rio de Janeiro, there are favelas that have drugs. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS RUN BY CORRUPTION AND GREED. If you are portuguese, download the app called Globo and read the news. There are a bunch of cartels, gangs, and worst of all: MAFIAS. They've spread to the U.S. In Brazil, you cant trust the police, nor the government. The president of Brazil (bolconario or whatever his name is) got arrested for corruption because he stole from the government! This movie is relatable."

Washington and Russell perform really well, so, as a characters movie, it works. It doesn't work at all as a biopic. Too much Hollywood on it. || A thoroughly entertaining 157 minutes!

<em>'American Gangster'</em> delivers in every area it needs to. Enthralling premise, immaculate music, phenomenal casting and great pacing. I was surprised slightly with how it finishes, but it's far and away from a disappointing/underwhelming conclusion.

Not much really needs to be said about Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. They're exactly how you'd expect them to be, outstanding! Washington is fantastic as Frank, while Crowe is superb as Richie. You have to wait a while for their proper screen time together, but it's worth the time it takes.

Away from the leads, you have a load of recognizable faces - I was literally that Rick Dalton meme for the first 45-60 mins! Chiwetel Ejiofor (Huey) and Josh Brolin (Trupo) have sizeable roles, though there's also appearances from Carla Gugino (Laurie), Cuba Gooding Jr. (Nicky), Idris Elba (Tango) and Norman Reedus (Norman). Excellent casting, that!

I was expecting slow moments due to the run time, but there aren't any - at least in my opinion. As noted, the way it ends is a tad differently to how I would've predicted, but I still enjoyed it alongside the rest of the it.

It might not be accurate on the real life Frank Lucas, but all that truly matters is does it excel as a film? Yes it does. Highly recommend! || Denzel Washington is on top-form here as he takes on the role of the unscrupulous and devious heroine importer ""Lucas"" in this superior crime drama. Following the death of his boss, he spots an opening in New York's drugs market which he deftly exploits by importing top grade product directly from Thailand and he sells his ""Blue Magic"" cut-rate to an increasingly willing population. Largely insulated from risk by his very profitable links with organised crime, it falls to ""Richie Roberts"" (Russell Crowe) to head up a narcotics task force charged with stopping this lucrative trade that has made ""Lucas"" one of America's most wanted. It has to be said that his method of importation is extremely shrewd, and as the narrative unfolds we discover that this is not just a tale of drug smuggling, but of police corruption, violence, addiction and brutality and director Ridley Scott gets the best from both his stars - especially a terrifically plausible Crowe. There are strong contributions from a superb Ruby Lee as his mother and from Josh Brolin as the dodgy cop ""Trupo"" and an ensemble cast that keep this well scripted, paced and scored drama moving along in a characterful and interesting fashion. Certainly one of Scott and Washington's better efforts, and though long it flows well and passes just over 2½ hours compellingly."

Released in 2007, ""Bee Movie"" is an animated movie about a bee, Barry B. Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), a fresh college graduate who becomes disillusioned by his limited career choices in the hive. Upon taking a special trip to the outside world his life is saved by Vanessa (Renée Zellweger), a beautiful florist in New York City. As their relationship develops, he discovers humans actually harvest honey by enslaving bees; and understandably decides to sue humanity, but this has repercussions.

I'm not big on animated flicks, but this one has frequent laugh-out-loud moments, particularly the first half. But you have to pay attention to the rapid fire dialogue and the details in the frame or you'll miss out on half the laughs. Consider for, for example, the ATFH officer (What's the 'H'stand for?). The second half remains compelling, but is more low-key in amusement. Bottom line: ""Bee Movie"" is one of my all-time favorite comedies. By the way, I know Vanessa's animated, but she's actually HOT.

Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Kelly Masterson. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Ron Fortunato.

Two brothers with differing financial problems plan to rob their parents' jewellery store. But when all does not go to plan and tragedy strikes, it sends them, and those close to them, into a world of fear, shame and violence...

It opens with a raunchy sex scene, man and wife in the throes of committed passion, for these brief moments there is pleasure. Once over, though, it proves to be a false dawn, the last time anyone on screen will taste pleasure in Lumet's biting morality tale. From here on in the film unfolds in a dizzying array of multi-perspectives and over lapping of narrative structure, a three pronged assault on the senses as a family implodes in a haze of greed, lies and inadequacies. A botched robbery underpins the plotting, the aftermath of which is what is most cutting, we zip around learning the wherewithal and whys of the key players, learning exactly what we need to know to fully immerse in this bleak world. This is a world populated by love cheats, drug abuse, embezzling, bad parenting and blackmail, a world where the brothers Hanson (Hoffman & Hawke) now dwell, either ill equipped (Hawke's Hank) or stuck between idiocy and smug evil (Hoffman's Andy). Their folly, their greed, impacting with a juddering severity on the family circle.

My life, it doesn't add up. Nothing connects to anything else. I'm not the sum of my parts. All my parts don't add up to one...me.

It would be Lumet's last film (he passed away in 2011), thankfully it is a fitting final offering from the talented Philadelphian. He's aided considerably, mind, by a razor sharp script from debut screenplay writer Masterton. It's full of nastiness and tension, but still observational as a family tragedy, with major bonus' being that it never resorts to stereotypes or cops out come the crushing denouement. Where Lumet excels is in drawing near faultless performances from his cast. Youthful and downtrodden haplessness portrayed by Hawke, Hoffman's powerhouse manipulator with emotional issues, Tomei proving that over 40 is still sexy while dialling into a very touching performance. Finney, a cracker-jack of grief from the wily old fox, Ryan's hard edged ex-wife and Michael Shannon strolling into the picture late in the day exuding notable menace. All splendidly guided by the great director who asks them to portray characters convincing in going deeper for motivations and means.

Bleak, brutal and near brilliant across the board. 9/10 || The outwardly successful ""Andy"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) needs to raise some cash before his business gets an IRS audit. His weaker brother ""Hank"" (Ethan Hawke) needs cash to settle some childcare costs with his divorced wife. The two concoct a plan to rob their parents' jewellery store to solve both of their problems whilst, they hope, harming nobody but the insurers. A staffing alteration changes all of that, though, and as it turns out, mom is no pushover so the raid goes quite spectacularly wrong leaving her and one of the robbers in the ground. ""Hank"" is emotionally struggling, ""Andy"" still faces his problems and now they have their father (Albert Finney) determined to track down just who these attackers are! Now, to add to this already quite toxic mix, we discover that ""Hank"" has also been having an affair rather too close to home for his sibling and so the tension is soon building to a point where something is going to have to give - and lethally too. Finney features sparingly here, but he does steal the show as the Hoffman/Hawke dynamic builds to an effective and powerful conclusion that does rather powerfully portray just how family's are not always sweetness and light. It's a solid story well cast and written, with Sidney Lumet letting his talent do the heavy lifting with minimal interference from him or from any extended dialogue. I did like the ending, too!"

INSTANT CLASSIC.: YES, this film is as good as the critics say. YES, the performances are as good as the Academy says. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is one of my favorite films and I have watched it many, many times. Javier Bardem, makes an excellent screen villain, this guy is really scary, you would not want him chasing you. Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones turn in Solid Performances, and Woody Harrelson also. I'm saving my praise for KELLY MACDONALD, one of my favorite actors. KELLY nails that southern accent. which is always surprising because her speaking voice is so Scottish, she does not have a lot of screen time but when she is on screen, you will know, you are watching a great performance. I absolutely give NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN <> Ten Stars 10********** || I literally liked the Movie. Its story is outstanding and innovative. However, I wish the ending was more of action scenes than dialogues. 
Not to forget that Javier Barden's acting is breathtaking and marvelous. His smile 4:49 is petrifying! || I always figured when I got older, God would sorta come inta my life somehow. And he didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I would have the same opinion of me that he does. 

No Country for Old Men is directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and the Coen's adapt the screenplay from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harelson, Javier Bardem and Kelly Macdonald. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Roger Deakins.  

When a hunter stumbles upon the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, he decides to make off with cash left at the scene, that violence and life threat will follow from here on in...

Not quite the genius masterpiece some would have you believe, this is however and decidedly dark, sombre, gothic type thriller with noir shadings. The ultimate message slowly pulsing away is one of how making a fateful decision can shape the course of many people's lives, with fate ready at various junctures to trip you up. 

The Coen's and McCarthy are not in it to offer hope for a better world, this really is a life stinks and is evil narrative, none more so than portrayed by Bardem's chilling psycopath. The unpredictable nature of the story keeps things on the high heat, even as Deakins brings beauty via his colour photography, his teaming with the Coen's brings visual smarts.

The screenplay is tightly formed, giving the actors something great to work with, and as they respond in kind, while we the audience are drawn in close to the slow burning madness. It definitely finds the brothers Coen returning to their best, as they take McCarthy's melancholic machismo and drip their self aware irony over proceedings. 

The finale lacks a punch, and in fact it's a little boorish, while this narrative has been done well before in film noirs of the original wave - so it's not as fresh and exciting to us more mature film lovers. Yet it's still a great piece of film making, the like we could do with more regularly. 9/10

The premise is solid at first glance, but as the film moves along it delves deeper and deeper in to melodrama, and then eventually patronising and insulting trash.  I am agnostic, but I found the religion bashing heavy handed and unnecessary. 

Most of the actors were doing the best they could with the script, but everything comes across flat and lifeless.  None of the characters rang true.  None of the dialogue sounded like how real people actually talk.  If you want to make a science fiction film that shies away from special effects, and instead relies on realism and storytelling, you had better make the dialogue realistic, and the storytelling compelling.  Sadly neither are found here.

The look of the film, I get that it is a low budget film made on a single location, but the quality of the film stock!  It may seem petty, but I could not get over the thought that I have seen better looking lifetime films.  Honestly I have seen better looking daytime soaps from the 80s.

Basically I don't get why anyone would call this film good, let alone a masterpiece.  I have read rave reviews, 10/10 reviews, gushing about how thought provoking and challenging this film was.  My thoughts were ones of disdain.  My challenge was to finish this abysmal film.  Many of the reviews seem to fixate on the fact that the writer of this wrote for the original Star Trek series.  That to me is not a good enough reason to rate this film highly.  

I honestly felt ripped off by this film.  I've been told I didn't get it, but sadly I did.  I understood every scene, I understood the implications, I understood the moral dilemmas and deeper meaning of what was being said.  It's just that the deeper meaning was shallow and unconvincing. I've been told maybe I should have watched Transformers instead.  Just for the record, I was looking forward to a slow, intelligent film minus explosions.  Instead I got, this.

3/10, avoid unless you have already drunk the kool-aid and are pre-conditioned to love the film because the writer worked on Star Trek. || I'd like to invite you to **believe the hype**. This movie is very well written and simply great. Keeps you at the edge of your seat and doesn't fail to amaze you till its very last second."

""Beowulf"" (2007) is an animated version of the epic poem of antiquity featuring Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn. It uses live action motion capture animation, which was previously utilized for “The Polar Express” (2004) and “Monster House” (2006). Although it's a ""cartoon"" it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture with brutal violence and openly sexual situations & dialogue.

The film has the same characters as the epic poem – Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon – and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's ""sea hag"" mother and the dragon; other than this the film deviates from the poem with some interesting ideas to tie everything together. Needless to say, don't watch if you're a Beowulf purist.

However, if you don't mind the animation or the re-imagining and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, you'll likely appreciate this. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching it back-to-back with 2005's ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which is a live-action version with Gerard Butler and Sarah Polley, shot on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland.

I should add that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title, ""What We Need Is A Hero,” and the two versions of ""A Hero Comes Home,” the first is the shorter version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits.

The message of this animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend because it has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero, but he’s certainly heroic, faults and all. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't heroic, what is? So he exaggerates his past exploits and has a weakness for women, what else is new?

The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.

Other morals include: Apart from redemption, the ""sins of the fathers"" will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally, in this case); even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws; deal with your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt & shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead; offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter the cost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak; men are easily entranced by feminine beauty, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions; the importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.

Some things to chew on: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?

Some criticize that Beowulf is not a Christ-figure, as in the poem, which isn't accurate. (***SPOILERS FOLLOW***) Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only ""weeping martyrs,"" ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer (a “son of God”), who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in the movie is the son of Beowulf and ultimately revealed as a hideous dragon.

All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even “heroes” like Beowulf which, again, is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about ""weeping martyrs"" is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement. Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.

One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, ""KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!"" Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invulnerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending shows that he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality.

The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes.

GRADE: B+ || Beowulf hasn't aged well; it looked like crap when it was released in 2007, and it looks like old crap 15 years later. This movie plays like someone made a videogame based (loosely, natch) on the epic poem, then took all the cutscenes out and edited them together into feature length. Now, if only Beowulf came with an option to skip the cutscenes.

The film features human characters animated using live action motion capture animation, but I fail to see why they even bothered. Five years after The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was the first feature film to utilize a real-time motion capture system, the novelty should have surely worn off; moreover, this technology hasn't aged any more gracefully than Beowulf has, and even today the best motion capture in the world can't make a silk purse out of the sow's ear that is even the best computer-generated imagery in the world – in fact, putting the two together is just piling crap on top of crap.

It's too bad, because a good live-action film could be made with Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, and Ray Winstone – though not a good live-action Beowulf film, mind you, because it would still go the CGI route for Grendel and the dragon and who knows what else; a fully animated movie would at least be consistent, or in this case consistently crappy.

Not that consistency is something of which one could accuse Beowulf; some characters look vaguely like the actors who provide their motions and voices (namely Hopkins), while others not at all (Malkovich) – and there there's Winstone, who looks for all the world like a poorly-rendered digital version of Sean Bean. || It was just too much...but to be fair I saw it in 3D. The none 3D version may have actually been better, but honestly I have no way of knowing.

At first it was, well, it was wow. I had never actually seen anything in 3D, being far too young for for the first round of popular 3D movies to hit the theater, but my father assured me it was nothing compared to this...

He also assured me it didn't make him as nauseous, and sometimes I can see where he's coming from on that point.

It came out right in the first wave of the new 3D, right when 3D was becoming popular again and actually worth it.

And it was jaw dropping even if some of the motion made my old man sick.

But it was also too much. A new technology and one that was a spectacular in itself, but not exactly tested to perfection.

It seemed like a 14 year-old girl putting on make-up and not yet understanding that less is more.

Less than half an hour into it, I had no idea what was going on, the 3D was too distracting to even attempt to follow the plot.

About an hour into it, the 3D got boring, and yes, still over-the-top distracting.

By the time I left I had the feeling that I had just experienced something that I had never experienced before. I had the feeling that watching a movie on the big screen would never be the same again...but I still couldn't figure out if I saw a movie or not."

This one here is an incredibly frustrating King work. A lot of what makes this one so uneven is due to there being a lot to really like about it, a few points to love about it and then there were elements to utterly loathe about it. The film is at it's best with the way the mounting hysteria over the situation with them trapped within the supermarket and how the groups resolve their problems and start new ones which was pretty good and makes for a realistic feeling to the story, detailing how it all breaks down and what the group resorts to in order to keep their sanity. Likewise, that in turn leads into the films' best efforts in the first few attacks with the unknown creatures inside the mist killing off the victims as they refuse to believe what's out there and rush foolishly into the area which makes for a series of fun times out in the cargo hold and the different attempts to reach safety outside and then encountering the different creatures and their powers were all good points. The flying insects and them trying to keep them out as the different creatures break in resulting in a series of great encounters trying to clear them out of the store, and the insane battle in the pharmacy during the pitch-black interior is a rather stark and creepy experience fighting off the array of creatures that gives this one a ton of impressive points. The final few battles and escapes to get out, the blood and gore and the way that the creatures are dealt with are all loved points here as that all leads into the stellar finale which is an absolutely unforeseen and shocking in what goes on as there are some rather disturbing parts in this section. Along with the fine creature effects, these here are the good parts to really love about it although it does have a few issues to be had here. The film's biggest problem is the mere appearance of the religious babble that gets spewed in here which is so wrongheaded and rather off-putting it just makes the viewer feel like not watching it all that often. Yet another big issue here is the length and how overlong it feels, with the rather overlong sections in the middle really making it feel it's length somewhat. While there's plenty to like here, these do hold it back.

The Mist is directed by Frank Darabont and Darabont adapts the screenplay from the story of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Toby Jones, Laurie Holden and Andre Braugher. Music is by Mark Isham and cinematography by Rohn Schmidt.​
​
Residents of a small Maine town become trapped in the local supermarket when an otherworldly mist brings deadly creatures in full attack mode. That's not the only problem, for two groups form inside the market, one in favour of escaping, the other for expiation.

As is the norm, King adaptations vary in quality and divisive fan appraisals, so with ""The Mist"" on screen not exactly setting the box office alight, and it even getting delayed releases in Europe, one would think this is one of the lesser King adapted lights? Not so, in fact, it is now proving to have a longevity of worth in horror fan circles. So much so, that the great horror writer at the literary source gives it the full thumbs up whilst giving the ""changed"" ending his full pat on the back approval.

Darabont is of course the director who previously took King's more human interest stories and crafted much beloved movies out of them, so why was he in the chair to direct a film about alien creatures unleashing bloody dread on small town Americana? Well actually the answer is why ""The Mist"" is such a cunning chilly delight. For this not only features monstrous creatures straight out of a Lovecraft/Barker nightmare, but also the monsters of the human kind, where the venality of the human condition is laid bare under duress, of which it is very frightening.

The alien creatures themselves creep the flesh, ok the effects work sometimes sags under the scrutiny of ""HD"" viewings, but this is nightmarish stuff, none more so than with a quite brilliant and terrifying sequence of events in a pharmacy. Yet it's the human monsters within the supermarket that usurps our creature invaders, where religious fervour and mans propensity for survival comes crashing together for dynamic results - the cast utterly in tune with the material and delivering quality portrayals.

Once the human battles within dissipates, and we come to the resolutions and reasonings of what has caused the creature invasion (hello subtext), we arrive at the much talked about finale. It actually deserves to be divisive, for we don't want yet another horror film finale that has people shrugging their respective shoulders and saying ""fair enough, but is that it?"".

If you buy into the all round bleak tonalities that the pic has been serving throughout, then this ending hits all the right buttons. For sure, this is no easy cop out to send you home with a smile on your face, it's brutal, and crucially it's befitting the word of the genre it sits in - horror. 8.5/10 || The more I watch this movie, the more convinced I become that this movie is _less_ about the mist as a horrific result of military experiments gone awry, and _more_ a commentary on the fear of death and the unknown beyond.

The mist and its Lovecraftianesque creatures are symbolic of humanity's existential dread and the abject fear that there is quite possibly nothing else but this, and the end here is the end forever; or even worse, that what lies beyond is not a benevolent Creator, but rather an entity that either is indifferent to our existence and our plights, or is actively malevolent against us. Jean-Paul Sartre described this fear as ""existential nausea.""

Mrs. Carmody's ever growing religious cult was the very opposite extreme. She proclaimed to be a prophet of the one true God, yet was hypocritical, judgmental and quick to cast stones even in light of her own sins. Her fundamentalist extremism insured they _never_ escaped their box. But what seemed the logical end result of her many violent transgressions only served to martyr her in the eyes of other extremists -- as it so often does -- and serves, in their twisted minds, as vindication of what they've been preaching all along.

And there are those who simply did the best they could with the circumstances they were given, but in the process, did not sacrifice the wills of others for their own gain while simultaneously giving of themselves unto the service of others. No one can say with absolute certainty what lies in wait beyond this life, but we shouldn't squander the moments we _do_ have on this Earth entombed in fear and letting that fear manipulate us into becoming the monsters we sometimes create ourselves.

The end of this movie has always been, in my opinion, the most tragic. The ending was _almost_ a happy one, if only they'd held out for a few moments longer. But in relation to the underlying theme laid out above, this group of people's break from the store to the car to the literal end of the road was metaphorical of venturing out into the unknown, even if it means leaving the comfort yet unstable illusion of safety and well-being, to take our chances navigating life the best we know how. We may feel as if ultimately the only thing we have any control over is when and how we die, but even this is just another illusion."

_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._ || Amy Adams is really quite entertaining in this latter day take on the ""Snow White"" fable. Falling pray to the envious Queen ""Narissa"" (a few fleeting appearances from Susan Sarandon) who wants her power, as well as her beauty, ""Giselle"" finds herself crawling out of a manhole cover and arriving in modern day New York City. Dressed as for a children's fairy tale party, she quickly finds herself a new friend in the form of ""Robert"" (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter ""Morgan"" (Rachel Covey). Initially he thinks she is not quite the full shilling, but the arrival of her pursuing beau Prince ""Edward"" (James Marsden) and his wily butler ""Nathaniel"" (Timothy Spall) soon sets him straight - and makes him realise that he - egged on by his daughter - is falling for this young woman. Who will win her heart? Can they get back to their home land of ""Adalasia""? I could have been doing with a little more animation mixed into this, but as it is, it is a quickly paced and enjoyable family drama with a decent degree of chemistry between Adams and the admittedly rather wooden, but easy on the eye, Dempsey. Marsden is probably the star for me, he manages to carry the character of chivalrous dope quite amusingly at times, and Spall always did manage these ever so humble, slightly obsequious, parts well too. Idina Menzel is here, yes, but no real chance for her to belt out any power ballads - indeed, the triple Oscar-nominated soundtrack is not one of Alan Menken's more memorable, I thought. Maybe a little too long, but it's still quite a creative interpretation of the original story, and is an easy to watch feel-good film."

More effort has been spent on cool action than on depth of the story. Well, you know what? I do not care! I quite liked this movie. Agent 47 is cool and kicks ass. The bad guys gets plenty of ass whooping. The action is good. There is quite a lot of high tech and gadgets. What is there not to like?

The movie starts of with a quite cool sequence introducing Agent 47. I have to say that I got into quite a bit of “wow” mode right a way there. The movie continues with plenty of action sequences with just a wee bit of slowdown in between. Actually the first-half, at least, of the movie is pretty much one long chase.

Perhaps I should point out that I have not played Hitman and do not really know what the original story is about. From a lot of the comments I have read it appears That this might be to my advantage when it comes to enjoying the movie.

Some people are probably complaining about bad acting since Agent 47 do not really show much in terms of facial expressions or emotions. Well, news for you, he is not supposed to! He is supposed to be a cold emotionless killing machine so stop whining. Personally I found Agent 47 to be an excellent character. the re is on scene in particular that I liked where Agent 47 intentionally allows himself to be caught in a embassy. Once inside he, to no one in the audience surprise starts to tear the place apart. You have to see it to know what I mean.

The second part, or perhaps just the last third, of the movie turns into more of a search and destroy for Agent 47 and his new “partner”. this part is of course as action filled as the first part of the movie. Naturally it all leads to a big show down between the Agent 47 & Co. The end itself did not really deliver any surprises but was satisfying.

The one thing in the movie that annoyed me was this subdermal armor stuff. The idea was not a too bad one but they really overplayed it. Come on! Just shoot him in the head or an eye or some other “sensitive” part for Christ sake. Bulletproof my arse!

I honestly do not understand the low rating this movie has received. 5.7 at IMDb is really a bit harsh. Rotten Tomatoes rating is, not very surprisingly, abysmal. Rotten Tomatoes and their “critics” ratings must be the worst of any ratings site. When these dickwads rate down a movie, that’s when I start to get interested. First step is to drill down into the real audience ratings which more often that not gives a different picture.

Any way I digress. Bottom line is that, for me, this is a simple, straightforward, high octane action movie and I quite enjoyed it."

Her adventures are well put together but are too episodic to knit the whole story together very well before a denouement that clearly illustrated that this story is part of a series and that more was yet to come in a sequel - if we were to make enough sense of the continuing dynamic. It's also rather wordy, too, which paired with the manner in which Weitz has decided to present this leaves it all just a bit dry, dull even. Great looking, though...!"

I mean, shout out to Will Smith. In 2022 he might be a beta fool, but he was still charming as all get out in this movie.

It just wasn't what it was supposed to be.

The source material was pretty amazing. Richard Matheson was on a pretty high horse when he wrote it and it came out as a pretty philosophical masterpiece in the way that only science fiction can.

It examined something and then it took that examination and turned it into a story... like science fiction should.

But ""I Am Legend"" just sort of examines Will Smith and the philosophical musings that made the source material great took a back seat to special effects and monsters and Smith.

It could have been something that people are still talking about instead of something people forgot. || **I Am Legend is not a typical sci-fi action thriller but an excellent deeper story that focuses on a lonely man and the price he pays to try to save humanity.**

I Am Legend follows the story of an isolated survivor still trying to find a cure to a pandemic that turned the world into crazed mutants. The movie's scale and cinematography are impressive, with large wide shots of nature slowly reclaiming the city of New York. Will Smith's performance carries the film (and kind of has to since he is alone for most of it). His emotion and conviction brilliantly convey the cost of his isolation and the toll years of suffering have taken on him. Long before John Wick had his dog, Robert Neville (Will Smith) had his dog in I Am Legend, and their relationship tugs on the heartstrings throughout the film. I Am Legend gives moments of suspense and horror, great action scenes, and psychological drama. I also enjoyed the religious references in the movie. There are really only two flaws I see in this film:

> 1. The CGI is dated and disappointing by today's standards, but it wasn't all that bad when the movie was first released.
> 2. The theatrical ending was decent, but if you can watch the alternate ending, do it! It is significantly better and helps fill some plot holes from earlier in the film (I believe the alternate ending was probably the original ending).

I Am Legend is an excellent story of survival and the breaking of a survivor's hope and mind. Will Smith's incredible performance makes this movie one of the better survival post-apocalyptic films. || Awesome movie! See kind of what life would be if you were the last one on it. The problem is battling the evil that took over."

Kind of funny and cute to see these little hairy beasts singing pop songs. At least the songs weren't bad. || Alvin and the Chipmunks is a nice, family friendly movie about finding a place and your family in life, development of care and empathy for each other and many of the usual US comedy tropes.

While the movie in itself is nothing crazy special, I consider it to be quite cutely done.

The three Chipmunks look and are animated very nicely and while, like the original story of them, requires quite some suspension of disbelieve on how the world simply accepts talking rodents, they make for a really cute movie.

The familiar care of the three brothers is cute, their singing and dancing is well-animated and the fur detail is really nice.

Knowing the 1986 cartoon it was unusual to see Dave so ""cold"" towards them, but that only allowed the movie to show more of the very beginning of how their relationship grows.

The one thing I was not a fan of was the temporarily tried-for romance between the human characters, but this luckily didn't have a big place.

It was a good start into the franchise, I like it.

A Survivor-like reality show meets in the backwoods of West Virginia where the contestants & crew find themselves assaulted by a family of mutant yokels. Henry Rollins plays the Drill Instructor-like host of the show.

“Wrong Turn 2: Dead End” (2007) is the first of many sequels in the franchise about cannibalistic hillbillies in Appalachia. The reason ""Deliverance"" (1972) is so iconic and unsettling is because the story actually COULD happen. The first “Wrong Turn” film from 2003 started out this way but became increasingly unbelievable as the story progressed. As such, it was entertaining and compelling but not genuinely scary. 

This one adds some overt camp and goofiness while increasing the gore factor. It may well be the goriest film ever made at the time of its release. And it is entertaining to a point, despite the disgusting elements (not just gore, but sleaze as well), yet it’s not truly chilling because it’s so over-the-top it’s cartoonish.  

Still, Rollins does well as the gung-ho host and a few of the protagonists emerge as likable people worthy of surviving. Unfortunately, the most agreeable character is one of the first to buy the farm. I’m of course not taking about the annoying Kimberly Caldwell in the opening, although what happens to her is amusing in a “shocking” black humor kind of way.

Petite Aleksa Palladino (Mara) stands out on the feminine front. Crystal Lowe (Elena) is alluring but her character is a loathsome skank. Erica Leerhsen (Nina), who was a highlight as the Wiccan lass in ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" (2000), still looks good, but has unfortunately lost weight and looks stick-like.

The mutant hicks are well done, but most of them look like Klingons from Star Trek from back in the day, just uglier.

While “Wrong Turn 2” has some entertainment value, it’s so excessive in its attempt to be revolting & amusing it loses impact. Less is more.

The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

She is not like disrepectful or anything, she just knows who she is and what she likes, even though she thinks that she haven't figured it out yet. She totally has.

Juno gets pregnant with Bleeker. She thinks about getting an abortion, as it will be the responsible thing to do, but can't get herself to do it (I mean, the kid already has fingernails!), instead she finds a cool couple to adopt the child (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman).

Juno is a movie about being a kid and growing up, about taking responsibility for your life and doing the right thing, even though it's damn hard. I mean, imagine being a pregnant teen on your school... you think people would talk about you? Well, they do... a lot. Also, imagine how your parents would react and how you would react to giving it up, whether its abortion or adoption.

Anyways, Juno is cool and takes everything as it comes. She'll figure it out eventually, we know this the minute we see her. Nothing will break Juno.

Ellen Page is amazing as Juno, and the rest of the cast is so carefully casted that it's not even funny.

When she becomes pregnant, she decides against an abortion and so offers the baby up for adoption to ""Mark"" (Jason Bateman) and his rather obsessive wife ""Vanessa"" (Jennifer Garner). The remainder of the gently entertaining film follows this young woman as she gradually deals with her pregnancy, her relationship with her parents and starts to bond with ""Mark"". It's this latter storyline that begins to illustrate to her not just the cracks in that marriage, but also her own feelings about herself, her unborn child and it's father. The film offers a witty and sometimes quite emotionally effective observation of how she evolves as a person and though the denouement itself is rather flat, it's still quite a fun outing for all concerned. Allison Janney and JK Simmons work well together as her parents who inject a certain amusing realism to the fact that their daughter is expecting a baby, not doing heroine! The dialogue is well written with an enjoying degree of sarcasm and plausibility to it that quite frequently raises a smile."

Yet, the story behind it is more interesting than you might believe, not to mention the influence it's had since its creation, both by its design and by the creation of an anti-Helvetica faction that rebels against its button-down and now traditional design. The influence of that rebellion alone is actually quite interesting, and as you watch this film you realize the design and the work that's gone on behind the scenes for things that we see every day and likely take for granted. Afterall, someone had to invent it at some point (like I've always said, the first person who figured out that you could drink cows' milk had to have been really weird).

Its message is simple, its filming style equally so. It's performed with such quality by Nicholson and Freeman (if the whole film had just been the two of them chatting in the hospital room it would have been a winner), with director Rob Reiner astute and wily enough to let them flow, that even as the inevitable sadness follows the laughs, you will feel far better for having watched this film.

Jamie Campbell Bower also delivers well amongst a supporting cast of solid British stage talent - a rather menacing Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall amongst them. It is dark and gritty, and stays fairly faithful to the theatrical performance that impresses not just with it's solid performances (perhaps not so much with Johnny Depp who comes across as eerily uncomfortable) but with the super costume and make-up effects, the lighting and, of course, a score that marries cleverly the threatening with the frequent (very black) humour. HBC is probably at her best here, I have rarely seen her more effective in a role and she can certainly hold the attention, if not so much perfect pitch, whilst having fun converting customers into pasties. Like the stage play, it has highs and lows but on the whole it progresses entertainingly enough to a conclusion that I didn't like so much - I always like a good baddie, and these two were certainly of the most creative.

As with the enormously successful first film, this sequel irritated as many people as it entertained. It's just the nature of the family friendly blockbuster, that some film fans refuse to accept them as viable fun family fare, whilst others can easily run with it and have a great time. The highbrow versus the lowbrow? Well maybe if you want to really be speaky arty about it... 

National Treasure: Book of Secrets made over $450 million at the worldwide box offices. Now we are told that financial success is no marker for quality of product, that's fair enough, but what is undeniably true is that it means there were considerably ""a lot"" of happy paying punters! From way back in the day when we had the likes of Gunga Din, Beau Geste and The Adventures of Robin Hood, there has been a considerable market for the action adventure movie. Some are better than others, some are even more brainy, but mostly they deliver a set pattern of what many people want.

The makers of this sequel just go bigger than the first film whilst following exactly the same formula. Nicolas Cage's treasure hunting Benjamin Franklin Gates has to follow clues to treasure again, only this time it's to clear his family name since his granddaddy has been implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger are again along for the ride, while Jon Voight gets more screen time as Daddy Gates. Helen Mirren joins the fray as the estranged Mommy Gates, Ed Harris slots in for villain duties and Bruce Greenwood adds class as the president of the USA.

The stunts and set-pieces are humongous, the traps and clues more elaborate than before and the photography (Amir Mokri and John Schwartzman) once again is gorgeous. It hurtles along at a nifty pace, stopping only to explain the various plot machinations to younger viewers, and the comic by-play between all the principal players is set in stone. Is it full of implausibilities, insulting history and credulity stretching beyond belief? Yes! Of course, that's why many of us action adventure fans escape into such high energy nonsense. Those expecting cerebral tickles or those offended by basic family blockbusters should quite simply stay away. 7.5/10 || Well, what do you know, a sequel that's pretty much the same story as the original. But so what? This movie isn't as good as the first but it's just as enjoyable. So let's get on board and find some treasure. Just one thing, can someone explain to me why Nicolas Cage got so loud in this one? || Following on from the original 2004 adventure, we discover that ""Mitch"" (Ed Harris) is now alleging that Nicolas Cage's ""Gates"" family were embroiled in the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln - and he claims to have proof from a diary by none other than John Wilkes Booth himself! It seems that in order to disprove these scurrilous rumours, he must galvanise his now estranged wife ""Abigail"" (Diane Kruger) and partner ""Riley"" (Justin Bartha) to track down a legendary city of gold. Surely it doesn't exist? Well there might just be a clue in the President's ""Book of Secrets"" - but he doesn't even know if that exists - and to find out, well he's going to have to get face to face with the President before embarking on a trip that will take him to Paris and then to the Queen's private study in Buckingham Palace before asking his dad (Jon Voight) and academic mum (Dame Helen Mirren) to chip in to help them rescue the family's reputation. Oh, and yes - menacing ""Mitch"" is hot on his trail, determined to use ""Ben"" to do all of the heavy lifting whilst he hopes to sneak in and claim the treasure for himself! It's very similar to the first film in style and pace, but the story is not so good and the quirkiness of the adventure struggles to stay as entertaining. There's a little too much familial dysfunction from both couples and the hapless ""Riley"" is much less engaging here, too. It's watchable enough, but nothing much to write home about."

Very good story and atmosphere 10 stars. || ***Weighty, morose period drama with complex characters and Daniel Day-Lewis*** 

In the early 20th century, an industrious prospector in Southern California, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), becomes a shrewd oil magnate, whose journey is paralleled with a dubious Pentecostal pastor of a remote church, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).     

“There Will Be Blood” (2007) is a one-of-a-kind period drama with Western elements. It’s arty and the furthest thing from a conventional blockbuster. You have to be in the mode for a deep, slow-moving, epic flick like this in order to appreciate it. The contemporaneous “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” and “No Country for Old Men” are good comparisons.  

Whilst the story and main characters are simple on the surface, they go deep and there are some things to mine: What good is success if you have no one to love and enjoy it with? Is Daniel a sociopath or a quality individual who acquires sociopathic tendencies because his choices put him on the road of madness? Was Eli a “false prophet”? If so, was he always a con or did he become one? 

Why is Eli paralleled with Daniel? Does Daniel have the capacity for genuine love? Does he mean what he ultimately says to HW or are they words born from a sense of betrayal? Would a sane person rashly resort to murder? Is there a positive protagonist in the movie? If so, who and why? If not, why not?

Unfortunately, the flick wallows in the negative side of life and is the furthest thing from inspirational.  

The film runs 2 hours, 38 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal and Texas (Shafter & Marfa); and Lakewood, Washington (Thornewood Castle).

GRADE: C+ || I remember reading about just how much money Rockefeller was making at the height of his prowess and the sums were eye watering. His Standard Oil company is referenced in this powerful drama with Daniel Day Lewis as “Plainview”. He’s a prospector looking for silver but who has a bit of a fall and discovers that there is something much more valuable and plentiful - if you know how to find it, He gradually buys up leases and together with his stalwart “Fletcher” (Ciarán Hinds) and young son “H.W.” (Dillon Freasier) starts to develop his business with a view to building a pipeline of over one hundred miles  to reach the sea. Along the way, their lives are fraught with dangers and tough choices have to be made - especially when an accident at one of the wells renders the young boy deaf. It’s at this remote site that “Plainview”meets his nemesis. Not in a competitive, business, fashion - but in a puritanical Christian one. The son of a local homesteader is aspiring preacher “Eli” (Paul Dano) and the remainder of the film sees the one trying to humiliate and outmanoeuvre the other and disclaim each’s strongly held values. It’s a slow burn, this film, but DDL is on super form as a man striving for success but for it’s own purpose. His wealth does not bring him contentedness nor, for that matter, does it bring joy to anyone else. This also demonstrates just how poor rural parts of the USA were at the turn of the 20th century, and at how vulnerable the population were to exploitation and the venality of the oilmen. The photography is immersive and the pace works well in drawing us into the perfectly constructed characterisations that were the natural successors to the earlier pioneers. I didn’t love the conclusion. It seemed a little unnecessary, underwhelming - rushed even. The last ten minutes have an intensity of their own that though they well illustrate the skill of Dano and DDL, they just didn’t quite wrap things up as I might have liked. Still, it’s a great piece of cinema with some strong writing underpinning a series of lusts…."

This stinks, it really does, and this coming from a man who owns and loves many a cheese filled B/Z movie. Although I would in no way say that AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) was a good movie, I have a tiny soft spot and found it watchable at least, this hack job makes that film seem like the pinnacle of creature feature nirvana. 

A Predator ship encounters problems on board by way of a newly born predator/alien hybrid, it crash lands on Earth (America) and thus Requiem is born as face huggers go crazy, aliens run amok, predator fights back, and the cast of genre stereotypes kill or be killed, the end! All the makers have done here (apart from attempting to kill off the franchise it seems) is splice together various staples from the other films in the series. Be it the settings or confrontations, they have just upped the blood quota, the film has no substance what so ever. Characters so dense and unlikeable you root for the monsters by way of having no choice, dumb teens in angst, Rambo mom, ex-convict trying to do good, you name it and chances are you have seen it in other rubbish murder death kill movies. 

There is gore galore which I'm sure will appease the easily pleased, and in one particularly monstrous scene involving a pregnant woman, a sequence for the squeamish to chat on the playground about come Monday morning. But you honestly would be better off watching some cheap no budget slasher film from the 70s, because unlike the money backed hack directors here, they had an excuse back then. Drek 1/10 || Out of all the _Alien_ and _Predator_ franchise, a series stretching out for nearly 40 years, a cultural phenomenon that has wormed its way into all manner of media, and has produced no less than eleven official movie entries, _Aliens vs Predator: Requiem_ is the worst. It's so blatantly obviously the worst that I don't think any _Alien_ or _Predator_ or even _Alien vs Predator_ movie that we ever see from now until the end of time will ever unseat it as the worst.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid where possible._ || So if you recall the last scene from the first AVP film (2004) you will know that the ""Predator"" ship is carrying an unwelcome passenger. Well, it manages to run rampage forcing the ship to crash-land in Colorado. A nicely wooded area where the two races can pick up their unfettered hostility with enthusiasm. An added bonus for our hungry visitors is a local community of humans ripe for the eating. Maybe 90% of this is either filmed in the dark, or in dark and dingy interiors and that does nothing for the menace of the film, nor does it make it enjoyable to watch. The human actors are pretty mediocre delivering a dialogue that was clearly of little importance when it came to the commissioning of this completely unnecessary and unrewarding sequel; indeed I found myself very much in the corner of whatsoever wanted to make a feast of these rather uninspiring, hormonal, teenagers who are delivering a pizza one minute, then wielding a pump-action shotgun whilst driving a tank the next. Sci-fi is, of course, meant to be far-fetched, but this is just a beastie too far and the ending just ridiculous (if, mercifully, quite, quite final!). This gift stopped giving long ago, let's hope we can recall the glories of Arnie and Sigourney and let this nonsense just RIP."

I only recommend this as I think enough people like J.C. Reilly, and SNL style skits.  This movie is essentially a long series of SNL sketches sewn together.

I'm not a fan of this style of writing because it doesn't seem to matter what order you put some of the bits in, it's just stopping the story to tell a joke or two, moving onto another joke or two, etc., until they decide to go back to the part of the movie that progresses the story.

Perhaps, watching a movie like this critically is counter intuitive, but even if I were to turn my brain off and enjoy it, I'm not a fan of drug humor, Dewey Cox is a jerk, and the music focused comedy isn't that good to me, despite the music actually being enjoyable itself.

His **MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING** and his **HAMLET** reinforced my opinion.  I even thought it possible that we would eventually see 37-ish Shakespeare stories enjoyed by modern audiences. While it may still happen, its unlikely to be completely under the directorial eye of Branagh.

Maybe others felt this way, as a new company was formed - _THE SHAKESPEARE FILM company_.  A production company under Branagh dedicated to Shakespeare productions.  The company underperformed considerably with **LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST** and was shuttered after the only slightly more promising follow-up...

Duke Senior reigns over a happy community, until his jealous brother banishes the Duke and takes his throne by force.  The story follows the banished king's daughter as she navigates her love for a young farmer while under the gaze of the disapproving uncle.

This film has a high powered cast.  There is another lyrical score by Patrick Doyle.  The cinematography and production design are beautiful. Placing the story in Japan is intriguing. It has a lot going for it.  Yet, it seems muddy and unclear.

The first portion of the film confidently plants Shakespeare's story into a Shogun ruled Japan. Yet, the story seems to meander away from that until only the costuming suggests Japanese influence.  Maybe relocating the story to this cultural environment was a meal not fully cooked.

Bryce Dallas Howard carries the film as a smiling and intelligent Rosalind.  The excellent Alfred Molina is the clown whose scenes contain the only humorous material.  Much of Branagh's Shakespeare community fills in several roles including my favorite, Brian Blessed playing the empathetic banished king and his tyrannical usurping brother.  Depressingly, the usually wonderful Kevin Kline gives a quiet and toothless performance of Jaques which renders him forgotten by the time the credits role. Similarly wasted is Adrian Lester.

Branagh certainly knows how to make money look good on screen.  His approach adapting the bard's work is not as strong or confident as his earliest efforts.  Maybe this says more about the original source, but there are surprising things that have to reflect today's choices. Most obviously, why is the plays most popular _All the world's a stage_ quote is delivered over a soft focus pan of Jaques sitting in the blurred distance.  It is lost and forgotten.

**AS YOU LIKE IT** is leaps better than **LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST**, but not enough to keep the new _Shakespeare Film Company_ alive.

Other filmmakers have stepped up and are offering great modern takes on Shakespeare without twisting his language and story to unrecognizable propaganda.  We may see the Shakespeare Cinematic Universe after all."

REC is one of the best found-footage and zombie movies ever made. The panic, chaos, and terror that grows and spreads through a small apartment building as residents fall one by one to a zombie plague is overwhelmingly suspenseful and believable. REC starts slow but exponentially builds into a bloodcurdling frenzy with horrified characters frantically struggling to survive. This low-budget horror film belongs in the hall of fame for creativity and genius in the genre. I saw the American remake, Quarantine, many years ago, which is very similar to this film, but REC edges Quarantine with originality and a franchise of 3 other films following it. Any zombie or horror fan needs to add this to their watchlist immediately! || ""Ángela"" (Manuela Velasco) is a pushy television reporter who is with her cameraman ""Pablo"" (Pablo Rosso) doing a feature about some local hunky firemen. When they are called to an emergency, they accompany the crews but upon arrival the find themselves subject to a terrifying lock-in as the raging fire proves not to be their most imminent danger. It seems that there is also something afoot that is hungry, and that hunger breeds more hunger... It's filmed from the perspective of the camera and has a lot of ""Blair Witch"" (1999) to it - and that's where I lost interest. The intensity of the photography in the dark and winding corridors of this expansive apartment block works quite well for about ten minutes, thereafter the hysterical acting, constant screaming and overdoses of ketchup just made me think that they hadn't the budget or the imagination to make something different or memorable. If Velasco's plan was to make the audience dislike her character intensely then she hit the nail on the head and if I'd been one of the fire crew trying to save lives amidst her increasingly annoying histrionics, I'd have happily sacrificed her to their tormentors. It doesn't hang about, but even at just eighty minutes I was weary of it's repetition. Not for me, sorry."

Some of the decisions they make - admittedly under a fair degree of duress - seem staggeringly risky and/or stupid; the sound editing overdoes the screeching and wailing to such an extent that the dialogue can be barely audible at times, and though well paced eventually, it still takes just a bit too long to actually get going. It is certainly an interesting concept, and if the style of cinematography doesn't drive you mad after twenty minutes, then I reckon you will quite enjoy the intimacy of the thing - at times, it is actually quite scary."

The movie market is full of movies based on video games. I even dare to say that practically all the most popular games have already known a film adaptation, from “Super Mario” to “Angry Birds”. I've seen quite a few of them, and so far I haven't found one that I could say I liked. Or rather, what I can remember right now...

I don't know the game “Dungeon Siege”, but from what I saw in a quick search on the Internet it must be very similar to other games of the pseudo-medieval genre. Wicked kings, dungeons and sorcerers are part of this universe. They are fantasy, intended to stimulate the imagination and thirst for action of those who have never picked up a real medieval sword.

Directed by Uwe Bol, a director I didn't know until now, and of whom I have not very recommendable references (but let's not, because of that, judge in advance!), the film I've just seen is relatively pleasant, and is based on a struggle for power in a kingdom called Ehb. On one side we have a wicked sorcerer and the late king's nephew, who wants to reign in his place, and on the other we have a poor farmer, at the head of an unlikely revolution. We've seen a lot of this, medieval themed films are always exploring these themes.

While originality is lacking here, the film works reasonably well and isn't as bad as some have claimed. There are far worse things floating around between big lauds. All right, the film lacks a more effective direction and a greater epic sense, much of what you see has already been done in other better films and the characters are sketches without personality. But considering that the movie is based on a game, I think a decent effort was made.

The cast has several big names. For me, the best and most competent is Ray Liotta, who really makes an effort to raise the quality of what he does with the poor material he receives and manages to steal our attention whenever he appears on the scene. However, I also liked Ron Perlman and John Rhys-Davies. I didn't like Jason Statham, he seems to be in the movie just for the pay, and the rest of the cast has little or little time to do something.

Technically, the film deserves praise for its excellent cinematography, the good shooting options and the chosen locations. The soundtrack harmoniously unites an excellent original soundtrack and several hard rock themes that appear more during the credits, and stays in the ear for some time."

Tired of partying on Bourbon Street, a guy and his buddy (Joel David Moore and Deon Richmond) decide to take a night sightsee with other tourists at the alligator-infested bog, unaware of the dubious nature of the tour and the legend of a notorious hatchet man lurking the woods.

""Hatchet"" (2006) is a horror/comedy/spoof that combines the indoor swamp sets of “Man-Thing” (2005) with elements of the “Wrong Turn” or “Friday the 13th” franchises and the parody tone of “Club Dread” (2004). Regrettably, it’s the least of these. There’s nothing wrong with the cast or technical filmmaking as the gore, F/X and swamp sets are fine, although the ‘monster’ make-up looks kinda cartoonish (which fits the genre).

While it’s relatively amusing and occasionally funny, it’s hindered by an odious raunchy air right out of the gate. For instance, the two supposedly hot girls flash their breasts every 5 minutes in the first half hour. Don’t take that as prudish, I’m just pointing out that a movie is questionable when it goes overboard with female nudity to hide its deficiencies. Meanwhile the heroine played by Amara Zaragoza is interesting, but she has little sex appeal, although that’s a matter of taste.

I could handle those flaws if the story was more compelling and the humor more amusing, yet that’s not the case. Although the plot is great, the script needed a rewrite to flesh out better prospects. But that takes time & money and the flick only cost 1.5 million, which is almost six times LESS than what “Club Dread” cost.

I should add that Kane Hodder plays the Jason-like antagonist while Robert Englund has a cameo in the opening.     

The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, with a longer version running an additional 9 minutes. It was shot in New Orleans (Mardi Gras sequences) with the swamp scenes done in a convincing indoor set at Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California.

There really isn't much to recommend here, outside of a solid performance from Diane Lane as Marsh, and some newer ingenious deaths to woo the gorno crowd, it's a buy the numbers horror thriller that seems to come along every three months. The villain is incredibly weak, the script is tepid and uninspiring, and the ending is as predictable as anything that has been done badly before.

Amazing, especially being the fourth entry into the series. || _**Intense with more depth than you might think**_

John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is alone, bitter and living hand-to-mouth in Thailand when a group of Christian missionaries enlist him to take them into Burma (aka Myanmar) to aid a village. Rambo discourages them in light of the political instability, which includes persecutions and mass slayings, but they insist. Weeks later he learns that the missionaries are missing so he goes back with a group of mercenaries.

""Rambo"" (2008) is the fourth installment in the franchise after ""First Blood"" (1982), ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985) and ""Rambo III"" (1988). I'm a huge fan of the first one, which I think is an action/adventure masterpiece, but the next two films are too comic-booky and the characters are cardboard, although Stallone never looked better and the locations are fabulous. 

This third sequel makes up for that because it's not comic booky at all and there's quite a bit of depth, albeit not much in dialogue form. It combines elements of ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Killing Fields"" & the first two Rambo films and is grim & intense from beginning to end, not to mention it's one of the most violent films ever made. The picture powerfully illustrates the best and worst in humanity. The Christian missionaries are willing to risk everything to help the villagers, whereas the Myanmar militarists revel in slaughtering scores of unarmed people for ""fun""; they're also shown abusing/raping women and boys. Obviously they've given themselves wholly over to the darkside of their natures. Such reprobates are only worthy of one thing: Utter annihilation.

Several important themes are addressed in the picture besides the main one:

* BITTERNESS/DESPAIR AND DELIVERANCE. The beginning of the film shows Rambo in a state of utter bitterness: He's just existing. He has no friends. He doesn't talk much and, when he does, it's few words laced with expletives. The male leader of the missionaries is completely unable to talk him into helping them. Two Biblical proverbs state ""a gentle answer turns away wrath"" and ""a gentle tongue can break a bone."" The female missionary (Julie Benz) knows this and skillfully talks John into helping them. Yet there's more going on here. This woman with a heart of gold is Rambo's ""golden connection"" out of the rut of bitterness. Despite his gruff exterior, she sees something in him, something in his eyes – a good heart, even greatness, a genuine glimmer, however faint. Is Rambo helping the missionaries or is she the one helping him? John instinctively realizes the rope she's throwing him and takes hold of it. There's nothing sensual about their relationship, despite her attractiveness; it's solely spiritual. She stirs in him the hope and faith he's been longing for.

* VIOLENCE IS NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY. Although this is a very violent film it skillfully shows when pacifism _is_ appropriate. Note the incident on Rambo's riverboat when the lead mercenary continually insults John and tries to provoke him into a fight. Rambo just ignores him, not even saying a word. In other words, he refuses to allow someone to victimize him and draw him into a conflict that has no positive purpose. It takes true strength to do this and Rambo has this strength. Indeed, John treats the guy as if he's a bothersome gnat. What do you do when a gnat bothers you? Do you break out a machine gun or merely ignore it? This is the ""turn the cheek"" principle.

* TOTAL PACIFISM DOES NOT WORK. The New Testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism, but rather limited pacifism (only resorting to violence when justified). For instance, Christ’s ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves & murderers. Also, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are God-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. The vast majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists who refuse to be BALANCED with the Scriptures on this topic and insist that conflict, and especially armed conflict, is never appropriate. The lead male missionary represents such a person, but perhaps he'll learn the error of his ways. The simple fact is: Some people are so degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice I said ""ultimate"").

* RAMBO’S SPIRITUAL REBIRTH. The first two sequels show Rambo searching for truth and flirting with religion and spirituality. In the second film he gets a Buddhist necklace off the Asian woman he befriends and at the beginning of ""Rambo III"" he is shown living & working at a Buddhist temple helping the priests; later, he meets and wins the hearts of moderate Islamic villagers and gives his necklace to a Muslim boy who helped him. In this movie the female missionary is key to John's positive transformation; at one point she gently asks him whether or not he has any family in the USA. He mumbles that he might have a father, he wasn't sure, and didn't seem to care. Shortly later she gives him a cross necklace for helping them (he wouldn't take money). Anyway, the end of the film shows Rambo walking to his family ranch in southern Arizona. Obviously John had a positive spiritual metamorphosis in the story that leads to a decade of peace & love before the next film, “Last Blood” (2019).

""Rambo"" was written & directed by Stallone and shot in Thailand (and Arizona). It’s short & sweet at 1 hour, 32 minutes.

Grade: A || Sylvester Stallone is in his element as the eponymous Vietnam veteran who has retreated to a rural community where he acts as a tourist guide for visitors on his ramshackle old PT boat. When he is approached by some human rights folks who want to charter his boat to seek out some missing Christian Aid missionaries up-river in strife-ridden Burma, he eventually acquiesces and they are soon in a world of pain at the hands of the brutally sadistic ""Maj. Tint"" (Muang Muang Khin). It's an end-to-end action movie, pyrotechnics galore with some seriously graphic - thereby authentic - scenes of violence that have their roots in a plausible storyline based on well documented abuses from South East Asia in the 1970s. The dialogue is a bit gung-ho, but this is about characterisations and Stallone, Graham McTavish (""Lewis"") and Julie Benz (""Sarah"") help create a suspenseful drama that is light on message and heavy on delivery..."

The signal beams through TVs and radios, causing fear and paranoia.  Almost no-one is truly sure of anyone else or their motives.  Fear,  leading to hate, anger and violence.  The true horror of this film is that it is an accurate take on our world, only amplified to make its point.  

However, The Signal is not merely a bleak film with no answers to the horrors expressed.  It provides hope and shows that love, support and trust are a remedy to the induced madness; a shared psychosis based on brainwashing.  It makes the case well for community over individualism, solidarity, substance over style, questioning, understanding, and hope instead of hate.  It does this through characters and situations that, although amplified, are poignant and credible reflections of our own societies.

If you like thoughtful horror films which make important points rather than the sheer pointless butchery of films like Saw, I highly recommend pulling the aerial out of the back of the TV and watching The Signal."

Then there are great movies. And then there are perfect movies. Movies like In Bruges fall in the last category.

But what is In Bruges? It's a simple story of two hitmen hiding in Bruges, Belgium, while waiting for further instructions from their boss. It is a relatively simple story. Even the cast lacks any star names. Then what makes this film ""perfect""?

Well, pretty much everything. You see, rarely do we see a film which makes us feel a range of emotions; In Bruges is one of those films. We laugh in the absurd and often downright offensive jokes; we sympathise with the characters' woes in life; we feel scared at the bullets flying in the crowded Belgian streets. We ""feel"" everything when we are watching this movie. It's not a movie, it is an experience.

This character-driven movie is cinema at its finest. It's a must-watch for everyone who wishes to know why British humour is loved around the world. If nothing else persuades you, just watch it to see Colin Farrell deliver a performance of a lifetime. || In a fairytale city with a couple of foul mouthed hit men.

Ray (Colin Farrell) & Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are two Irish hit men who are sent to lay low in the beautiful city of Bruges by their gangster boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). As they wait for instruction from Harry the pair start to address many things that are troubling them, with one pressing matter particularly relevant to their lives post the Bruges visit.

Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, a man more known for his play writing abilities, In Bruges is a rare old animal indeed. Not only is it a winner in the very wobbly sub-genre that encompasses the British gangster movie, it's also a hugely funny and tasteless button pusher to boot. From the outset the film sets itself up to not be to everybody's cup of tea. As Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson exchange expletive after expletive whilst surrounded by the considerable beauty of Bruges, it's obvious this is not going to be a ""normal"" movie. Throw in drug abuse, prostitution and a racist dwarf, well you can understand why the film is seen as unpalatable to some - yet still be digestible brilliance to others. What is for sure is that those who haven't seen it really should do so for it may just become one of your favourite movies, yes, it really does deserve the chance to pull you on board.

By definition, it's an ultimate black comedy, But in amongst the laughs, and there are many, lies a potent and affecting human drama involving love, guilt, morals and redemption. With the trick pulled by McDonagh being that of having every character in the piece dislikable, and yet easy to be on side with. Don't be surprised if you find yourself welling up with emotion during some of the more critical scenes. For the screenplay (BAFTA Award Winning) and the performances of Farrell (Golden Globe Award Best Actor) & Gleeson are razor sharp and very involving. Even Fiennes' spiv gangster boss is shown to be a ruthless sweary anger merchant, yet still capable of apology and genuinely respective of good principals. If that sounds odd? Then good, because it's an odd and strange little movie. I mean the love interest comes in the form of pretty Clémence Poésy, a criminal femme fatale type here, but once ""Fleur Delacour"" in ""Harry Potter"" & ""The Goblet Of Fire"". While Canadian dwarf actor Jordan Prentice is more well known for playing ""Howard The Duck"". Each of them serving genuine purpose, both for the funny side of the story, and for the more humanistic elements that unravel as we hurtle towards to the coup de grâce a like finale.

A barbed wire black comedy led by a towering performance from Farrell - where just like him you should laugh, cry and swear to your hearts content. 9/10 || <em>'In Bruges'</em> is a film that I was expecting to like. Unfortunately, it's one I was underwhelmed by. We were clearly on to a good thing with Martin McDonagh, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson (see: <em>'The Banshees of Inisherin'</em>) but I didn't enjoy them on this occasion.

There are glimpses of it working and there are still a couple of moments where I could see myself liking it. I will say that the final 30 minutes or so is better, though what precedes does the damage in my opinion. The humour is its biggest fault, only one or two jokes got me.

Farrell and Gleeson are, nevertheless, a solid pairing, as we see to far greater effect with that 2022 film. The latter is the stand out here, Farrell's character is a bit too irritating for my liking. Away from them, Ralph Fiennes is decent, his distracting accent is bad though.

Elsewhere on the cast, there are not one but two stars from <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> universe in this - from differing spin-offs, interestingly. Clémence Poésy of <em>'Daryl Dixon'</em> (great in that, fwiw) and Željko Ivanek of <em>'Dead City'</em>. Love me some TWD.

I also love McDonagh's other work in <em>'The Banshees of Inisherin'</em> and, especially, <em>'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'</em>. So I guess one was gonna be a miss at some point, fingers crossed I enjoy 2012's <em>'Seven Psychopaths'</em>."

Based on a true story, <em>'Rise of the Footsoldier'<em> is your standard London-ish gangster film - literally, given the cast. It does everything you'd predict and then some. However, it does come out more watchable than I thought it would. I wouldn't say I enjoyed it or that it's that good, but it makes for an OK watch.

The casting is as obvious as possible. It features the likes of Terry Stone, Roland Manookian, Neil Maskell, Billy Murray, Kierston Wareing and Frank Harper - none of which are surprising to see, I'm more shocked Danny Dyer didn't appear. Ricci Harnett plays the lead role, he's alright.

One negative, though, about this 2007 film is Harnett's Carlton, who isn't likeable whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, the characters in these sorta films are always bad people but with ones like <em>'Green Street Hooligans'</em> or <em>'The Football Factory'</em>, there is at least a small reason to 'care' for the main character. I never did for Carlton, even at the end when it wants you to.

Other negatives include the pacing, dialogue and overall story really. I will say it isn't anything that bored or irritated me, but there isn't much - if anything - that I liked either.

With that said, I'm still planning to watch the three sequels."

Teeth is based around the myth of vagina dentate, where it was believed that in some ladies a set of teeth were hiding away in their vagina. The lady in question here is Dawn O’Keefe (Jess Wexler), a comely virgin, teenage spokesperson for Christian abstinence, from a very young age it was clear something was not right.

A great and interesting premise is never truly fulfilled for maximum potential here, but with slices of dark humour, some cringe inducing prosthetic gore and a bold performance from Wexler, Mitchell Lichtenstein’s film safely keeps its head above mediocrity.

The makers are dallying with a number of unsubtle themes, from female empowerment to the fear of sex in general, and of course the perils of letting shallow hormones dictate the teenage mandate. There’s even dashes of obsession, religio slights and a meditation on grief that earths the electricity buzzing about the hormonal place.

Thankfully, Lichtenstein keeps away from I Spit On Your Grave territory, finding a nice balance for Dawn, she is a character bombarded with a myriad of emotional conflicts, but hysteria does not dominate her make-up, and she’s never cartoonish either.

Aside from watching it with your legs crossed - regardless of which sex you are - this is mildly entertaining in a squirmy sort of fashion.

Released in 2008, ""Fool's Gold"" stars Matthew McConaughey & Kate Hudson as a couple on the verge of divorce in the Bahamas, the former a treasure-seeker. Donald Sutherland plays Hudson's new rich boss and Alexis Dziena his bimbo-ish daughter. Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart also factor in as potential villains.

If you can imagine serious island-thrillers like ""The Deep"" and the two ""Into the Blue"" flicks mixed with a heavy dose of comedy and cartoonish action you'd have a good idea of ""Fool's Gold."" It's basically ""The Goonies"" as adults in the Bahamas. 

Kate and McConaughey look great and are great together, and everyone else is likable, even the villains (sort of). The problem is the movie is too long at 1 hour, 52 minutes. A silly, fun film like should limit the runtime to around 85-100 minutes.

The story takes place in (or near) the Bahamas, but the film was shot on the east coast of Queensland, and you can tell. The coast of Queensland is gorgeous but it lacks the lushness of the Caribbean. Regardless, the film is worth watching just for the locations, especially on a cloudy fall day or a cold winter night.

So this is a fun island flick with romance, treasure-hunting and adventure, but it’s a little too long for such goofy antics. For the real deal in oceanic thrillers check out 2009's ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef,"" which IMHO is way better than the original ""Into the Blue"" from 2005. 

GRADE: B-/C+ || It is far from a bad film...unless you are the kind of person that just can't stand a fun, pulp adventure story.

Basically all this movie is is a pulp novel turned into a movie.

Had it been made in the Golden Age of Hollywood right up to the 1980s it would have been a hit. Had it been made in the 1990s it would have been a modest success...

But it was made in 2008 and the tastes of the world had changed. 9-11 had come and gone and people lost that childlike innocence that is needed to enjoy films like this. The Computer Age dawned and everyone wanted nothing but over-the-top special effects.

So fun adventures were shoved to the side and the critics--that still claim to love fun adventures like Captain Blood--turned their noses up at anyone that even hinted towards enjoying them.

What you have is a treasure standing in for the MacGuffin, a roguish hero, a little bit of a love triangle, and the open seas.

It is classic Hollywood. It is also, unfortunately, they kind of movie we need today and the kind that Hollywood is most reluctant to make."

What would be possible if we could all teleport at will? It would be chaos. For some reason, God, or whoever you want, didn't want to make it possible for humans. This is the belief of the Paladins, who hunt down and kill the “Skippers”, individuals who can, in fact, travel between different places in the blink of an eye.

The film starts off with a very good premise and would have been a remarkable teen movie had it not been for the poor practical realization of it all. The film is beautiful, and the script is good, with a good story… but things just seem too imaginative, and the excessive use of CGI and green screen does not help to mitigate this feeling, quite the contrary.

Hayden Christiansen secures the protagonist with efficiency, not to mention talent. He doesn't have big similarities like what we saw in “Star Wars”, he manages to make us forget what we've already seen of him and give us something good here. Unfortunately, there's no one in the cast who can keep up! Of course, except for the veteran and impeccable Samuel L. Jackson, although his character is somewhat cliché, and the actor sometimes seems to limit himself to giving us a darker and colder view of “his” Nick Fury.

Despite the weaknesses, the clichés and the fragility of some points and production values, it is not a difficult film to recommend: it really entertains its audience well and, for those who haven't seen it or don't know much about it, it can be truly a good surprise."

This is a good film to watch with the family because it will easily appeal to young people and adults alike. However, I think it never received the attention it deserved, perhaps due to the fact that it was released at a time when the fantasy genre was dominated by a group of other much stronger and more relevant films. The film also strives to show the hidden side of knowledge as something dangerous, less than desirable, following the logic of “there are things we simply shouldn’t know”.

The story begins when a recently divorced woman moves with her children to a rustic house in the forest, which belongs to a great-aunt hospitalized as crazy. This house has been closed for a long time, there is salt on all the windows and an industrial amount of tomato sauce and honey in the kitchen pantry. Intriguing. It is quite evident from the beginning that the brothers get along badly, and that the youngest is very attached to his father and waits for him to return. And it is precisely he who begins to hear noises that convince him that there is something more in the house. He discovers a book with a dark warning, but still decides to read it, finding himself in the power of a series of hidden knowledge that should never have reached him, and that were collected eighty years earlier by a great-uncle, who disappeared without a trace.

Like I said, it's a good film and tells a good story. The characters are good, from the humans to the enchanted figures, and there's a lot of entertainment and creativity here. It didn't have a great reception in America, but it was a success in Europe and continues to appear on television from time to time. Directed by Mark Waters, who already has some experience in films for young people, but was far from being a name to consider from the outset, it has a good group of actors. Freddie Highmore shows talent and commitment, which opened many doors for him in the following years, and Irishwoman Sarah Bolger is not far behind. David Strathairn and Joan Plowright are the adult actors who deserve the most praise for their efforts here. Both were very good, and brought credible and adorably magical characters to life. Nick Nolte also makes a cameo appearance.

Technically, the film relies heavily on high-quality CGI, great visual impact and scenic effect. There's no doubt that there was a lot of money invested in the visuals and cinematography, and it paid off: the film doesn't feel unrealistic or overly fanciful. The enchanted objects and characters seem realistic, worthy of the credit we want to give them. The colors are magnificent, the light is ideal, the studio filming was well done and the house where the film takes place is visually magnificent, worthy of a fairy tale. James Horner provides the soundtrack in an effective but not memorable way."

With Jason Statham as the lead, I expected The Bank Job to have fight scenes and car chases. It did not. Compared to other Statham flicks, The Bank Job was slow-paced and more dramatic than action-focused. Some of the pacing results from the story being based on an actual bank robbery in 1971. As intriguing as that is, it also made the story drag on. The heist takes place halfway through the film, with a full hour of runtime before the end. The robbery's aftermath is filled with political maneuvering and negotiation between several dangerous groups interested in the contents of the safe. With an hour to tie up all the loose ends, the ending somehow felt abrupt and disappointing. The Bank Job has a few cool moments, but even with a strong lead like Statham, it was average at best. || Based on a true story, Jason Statham does his usual as struggling car dealer ""Terry"" who is alerted to an opportunity to get rich quick by ""Martine"" (Saffron Burrows). She knows that a safety deposit box facility is going to be without it's alarm systems for a week or so and therefore if they can assemble a skilful team and... yes, think ""League of Gentlemen"" (1960) only with tunnelling. Now ""Terry"" doesn't really stop to answer the obvious question - where did ""Martine"" get this information? Millions of pounds of cash and jewels in these well protected boxes, well of course - but what else might they contain? Who, as importantly, is likely to get a bit narked if their precious cargos are appropriated. Success will come at a price, and that is something that soon descends on them all once they end up with considerably more than the bargained for. This might have worked better with a stronger supporting cast, but neither Burrows nor a motley collection of British regulars really add much to this vehicle for a star who has charisma on screen and a glint in his eye - but that can only take a film so far. This is quite a dry, procedural heist drama that, like so many of the genre, is more fun in the planning but that peters out once the execution and it's aftermath kick in. It's enjoyable enough to watch, and you can only imagine just how many secrets - state or otherwise - are or were holed up in facilities like these all around the world. Somehow, though, this just doesn't ignite nor live up to it's potential and is all a bit flat and forgettable with not enough action and some seriously banal dialogue."

The bits with (the also underwhelming, just less so) Steve Carell's Mayor hold the most intrigue, though the barrage of Horton (also you'd expect, in fairness) meant that I couldn't even get into that part of the story. The rest of the cast, despite some well known names, aren't good either.

As a boy, I had a bit of a fascination with Genghis Khan (meaning Great King) and even drew a picture of him titled, naturally, ""Temujin,"" his actual name. I don't know what it was that attracted me; likely his cool-sounding title and world-conquering exploits. With the exception of Iron Maiden's great instrumental, ""Genghis Khan,"" that ended my flirtation with this historical figure. That is, until I saw the Russian-made ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" (2007) yesterday.

As the title suggests, the film explores Temujin's origins and what led to him becoming the great king of the Mongols and world-terrorizer. Despite being a foreign film with subtitles the movie successfully pulled me into its world and characters. The Mongols on the vast Asian steppes lived similar to American plains Indians. I've seen numerous photos of Mongols living on the steppes with their yurts, etc. over the years, but I could never relate to them as people. Just as, say, ""Dances With Wolves"" made American Natives come alive to the viewer so this film does with Mongols.

""Mongol"" eschews the American ""blockbuster"" syndrome and simply tells the story of Temujin from his early boyhood to his crowning as the great Khan. Although there's a steady amount of action throughout, there are a lot of quiet lulls with Temujin calmly waiting-out his various imprisonments and seeking Tengri, the god of the blue skies. Regardless, I found myself drawn into the characters and simple story.

I liked the fact that a monk was able to ""see"" Temujin's greatness and future world-conquering potential even though he was only a lowly slave, which others understandably couldn't see. I also liked the low-key commentary on people choosing their leaders and forsaking the less worthy, and the resulting strife, as well as the focus on Temujin's many quiet times in the wilderness seeking the Divine for wisdom and power to walk in his greatness and fulfill his dream, not that I'm suggesting Genghis Khan was God-ordained, of course. The lead actors are all great, especially Honglei Sun as Jamukha, Temujin's ""brother"" and then greatest enemy in Mongolia. Despite all this, people who require constant eye-rolling action and explosions will likely find ""Mongol"" boring.

Speaking of ""constant eye-rolling action,"" this was the very thing that ruined the 2011 version of ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Jason Momoa, who was excellent in the role. That film needed more downtime, realism and depth, similar to the original 1982 version (not that that version didn't have its share of cartoony-ness), the filmmakers instead pushed for overkill action with minimal dramatic weight. The result? A mediocre Conan flick that looked great but was ultimately too shallow and goofy, in the ""action-packed blockbuster"" sense.

Interestingly, ""Mongol"" reminded me of John Milius' version of ""Conan"" and of Robert E. Howard's Conan in general, albeit without the sorcery. I believe if the 2011 remake of ""Conan"" shot for the realism and seriousness of ""Mongol,"" as REH himself portrayed the character and the Hyborian Age, it would have been a more worthy Conan film. It goes without saying, if you like REH and Conan you'll probably appreciate ""Mongol.""

The soundtrack is simple but effective, often just an eerie-sounding violin/cello, reminiscent of parts of ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). I found it interesting that when the credits hit a great epic metal riff kicked in for a few bars before morphing into the expected Eastern-styled credits soundtrack. It was a pleasant surprise.

The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes, and was shot on the remote and godly landscapes of Inner Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan.

I didn't like that you could only watch it through their camera view. I also didn't like that if you died you became a zombie. Even if you weren't bitten. || ""What a piece of trash!"" Is what I would like to say about this movie. Because Romero has made it personal and criticized my favorite zombie franchise of all time. Of course, this is not healthy. I do not know the man, and it really is not personal. But I do have the urge to get back at him and his hardcore following that I feel can be quite pretentious when touting his work as some genius social/political commentary. To me, it has never felt like anything special in that area. But at least there was always some quality fun and entertaining characters to enjoy! But I must say that is now gone. I had the slightest hope that there may be something good here (given that it has 61% on Rotten Tomatoes. [A whole 8% better than Bullet Train?!?! Pfft!]) There are a couple characters to enjoy, but nothing you can't find in your average straight-to-SYFY channel Zombie flick. The dialogue was ROUGH. And I spent the whole movie wondering how bad it was actually intending to be. Was it a full-on parody? I don't think so, because it'd be a lot more fun. Was it dead serious? No; then it should be a lot smarter. I will say that the point about our relationship with technology has aged pretty well. People are more obsessed with it now than ever. But it still doesn't make the character's actions reasonable. It is still dumb. And it isn't a unique take. Everything feels one-dimensional and unrealistic. I must not vibe with Romero's style where it feels like he is making his point so bluntly and sacrificing everything else to do so. This is down with the worst of The Walking Dead's worst spin-offs. But possibly still in with the best of the large pool of terrible zombie movies. I mean, a couple of the effects were actually impressive compared to the rest of the film. (I'm Looking at you, Acid-Kill Zombie!) :D So...would I call it a piece of trash? There are much worse zombie movies than this. But there are SO many better ones, too. (Four of his previous works included!) Compared to its older siblings: Yes, it is a big pile of trash stinking up your bin for a week. But as just another zombie movie: It is an expired can of soup. Still trash. But you can throw it out and move on. No biggie. ;D"

Released in 2007, “Snow Angels” is a drama revolving around a handful of ordinary couples, young and older, in a Northeast hamlet at winter time (filmed in Nova Scotia).

Some criticize that the film is depressing but it's inaccurate to say the WHOLE movie is depressing. Nor does it leave the viewer in a totally depressed state. There's a lot of beauty and hope amidst the shadows and darkness. Plus it leaves you pondering many things, including the numerous real-life people the characters remind you of. One of the storylines is tragic and depressing, no doubt, but that's not the whole focus of the story (although it is the dominant focus). The picture is about romantic relationships in various stages and whether they're successful or not depending upon their responses to the inevitable crises & temptations of life:

Arthur and Lila's high school relationship is just budding and seems healthy and promising. 

Meanwhile Glenn and Annie's relationship has been devastated by Glenn's alcoholism and anger/obsession issues; Annie wants to move on but takes a foolish course of action. She's not only foolish, but also treacherous! Glenn is trying to recover from his personal demons, he even gets born-again, but for some reason he has a hard time getting over his ex and moving forward with life. His struggle between the positive and negative forces within us all is real. Both Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale are outstanding in their roles, Rockwell particularly so. In fact, I've hardly ever seen such a realistic and powerful performance. The viewer sees his sincere desire to improve his life but foolish and selfish temptations manifest when he's faced with rejection and tragedy. Will he take the wise or foolish path?

Elsewhere Nate and Barb's relationship hits its first major crisis: Nate is discovered to be unfaithful. Barb responds with fierce anger, at first, until a tragedy shows her true angelic nature. 

Arthur's parents separate but maybe there's still hope for their relationship and family. 

Glenn's parents are in the latter stage of a committed relationship, which seems to have been successful. 

Glenn's loving & loyal retriever is the anithesis of Annie, who treats Glenn with hostility and desires to move on in life, away from him; although this is understandable, the viewer can't help but empathize and root for Glenn in light of his sincere attempts to improve his life and reconcile with his ex. After all, he's genuine & humble, he loves his daughter (and vice versa) and he's not an unfaithful scumbag. Pay attention to the very last scene to discover the fate of Bomber.

Take note of the scene where one of the main characters takes down a painting of the cross and there's a kid's handprint on the wall accompanied by the word ""me.” This signifies the turn he's decided to make.

The film leaves the viewer with hope despite the foolish, tragic and criminal events — hope that love will triumph, a certain couple will stay together and a youthful couple will make wise decisions and overcome the potential pitfalls that destroy others. It could go either way. Yes, the young couple looks happy and natural together, but every couple is like that in the early years of their relationship. Although the movie shows someone’s hostility toward another, it’s revealed that the person in question used to help the other person focus on the positive side of life and the support was always comforting.

A young character is shown flirting with alcohol and pot; not all people get thrown off-track by flirting with such things, I know, but one main character obviously did. Will he?

Only time and wrong or right choices will answer these questions.

After seeing the film I read a story about a recent incident in Arizona that mirrors the main storyline in the film. It happens.

""Snow Angels"" is reality. Once seen, you'll never forget it. Some will treasure it. My only complaint is that sometimes the camera bobbles around too much, which smacks of amateurishness. I realize the director was trying to be hip or whatever but the camera should never draw attention to itself. Fads pass away while solid filmmaking endures.

The movie runs 1 hour, 47 minutes.

Nothing else has ever come even remotely close. These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

RELEASED IN 2007, ""Youth Without Youth"" was Francis Ford Coppola's return to filmmaking after a ten-year absence. The story revolves around a 70 year-old man (Tim Roth) in Romania at the outset of WWII who is struck by lightning and miraculously regains his youth, looking like a 40 year-old man. He acquires amazing powers as well, like psycho-kinesis and the ability to ""read"" a book by ""scanning"" it with his mind. The Nazi's catch wind of his amazing evolution and want to study him to contribute to the “master race” (or whatever). The second half of the film takes place after the war years when the man finds a woman who looks like a young version of his deceased love (Alexandra Maria Lara). Incredibly, she too is struck by lightning with differing results and it aids in his research on the origins of languages.

The plot brings to mind two films from the mid-90s that also address people with fascinating powers: ""Powder"" and ""Phenomenon."" The latter was decent whereas the former shot for greatness and in some ways attained it. ""Youth Without Youth"" is completely different in tone, mostly due to the WWII time-frame, but also because it's less of a wannabe blockbuster and more artsy and nigh unfathomable.

It has been said that ""Youth Without Youth"" was an intensely personal project for Coppola. The topic, based on the novel by Mircea Eliade, resonated with him and he was driven to convey it on film. You get the impression that Coppola had discovered the answer to the mysteries of life and wanted to share it with the world.

Think about it: Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and he had a full decade to conceive, prepare, make and release a film. He could've churned out blockbuster drivel like the ""Transformers"" movies (not that there's anything wrong with that, lol), but as a true artist he's beyond caring about creating popular popcorn fare and the ""success"" thereof. It brings to mind Willard's observations about Col. Kurtz (Brando) in Coppola's renowned ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979): ""He could've gone for general, but he went for himself instead."" Francis could've gone for mindless and lucrative entertainment, but he had something more important in mind.

So ""Youth Without Youth"" is a work of art, and certainly interesting and entertaining in some ways, but it requires willingness and effort to handle the 124 minutes runtime. It is a dense film, loaded with depth; it may even hold the secrets to life itself! Beyond that, it features some beautiful cinematography, music and women.

Speaking of the women, I found it curious that women are shown to be universally attracted to Dominic, the main character played by Roth. After all, Roth is short and hardly a George Clooney. But then I reflected on it and accepted it. Why? Because women have a sort of sixth sense, typically called ""women's intuition,” where they see or sense things beyond the physical. In other words, Dominic had highly evolved and was, in essence, a superior human being. He may not have been an Adonis, but women instinctively picked up on his evolutionary superiority and drew to him like a magnet.

Another plus are the locations, shot in Romania and Bulgaria with establishing shots of the Himalayas and India.

Needless to say, this is a difficult film to rate. If you're in the mood for conventional cinematic entertainment ""Youth Without Youth"" won't fill the bill even though there are several entertaining elements (the aforementioned cinematography, music, women and locations); but if you're looking for cinematic art and weighty mind food it's an ""A."" As such, my balanced rating is...

Kimberley Peirce’s (Boys Don’t Cry) movie proved to be controversial in military circles. The story is about the stop-loss procedure used by the American military, a kind of small print tactic that can extend a soldiers service should their country deem it so. Sergeant Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) returns home from the Gulf Wars with his mentally scarred pals fully expecting to get back to a domestic life without blood and brains dominating his personal landscape. Yet he is called back in for another tour of Iraq under the stop-loss procedure, something he rebels against and goes AWOL. He has done two tours already, surely he has earned his retirement?

It starts off in electrified fashion, the horrors of the war in Iraq bursting from the screen as a firefight ensues, character traits are introduced to us, we are left in no doubt that the soldiers at the end of this tour of duty have seen it all. Pic then settles into a sort of cross between a road movie and a PTSD portrait awash with emotional strangulation. Peirce and her co-writer Mark Richard have honourable intentions, but too much is given over to stereotyping, of stock clichés and the bold signposting of character’s futures. They carefully paint King as a model soldier, this is definitely not about cowardice, but come the cop-out finale it’s evident that the narrative suffers glaring inconsistencies and confused messaging.

On the bonus side is the performances of the youthful cast, where some fluctuating accents aside, Phillippe, Channing Tatum and Abbie Cornish are superb, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a weakly written part crackle with pained emotion. Of the elders, most are underwritten, which is a shame when you got the likes of Ciaran Hinds in the cast. We are left as a whole with a film that is as uneven as a dusty road in Tikrit, not only in narrative structure, but also in actual facts as regards the procedures of the American military, both on the written documents and execution of duty in battle.

It was a flop at the American box-office and it’s not hard to see why, but it still has merits. Even as the familiarity tries to breed contempt, the anguished reality of a soldiers life, during tours and post service time, strikes a mightily distressing chord. 6.5/10"

RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Carter Smith based on Scott B. Smith’s novel, ""The Ruins"" refuses to make the mistake of too many conventional horror flicks by NOT going over-the-top with the situation, the ""monster"" or the horrific thrills; films that do so are usually more goofy than horrifying. Take the ending of ""The Ruins,” which is different than the book and, in my opinion, better: In a typical horror movie there would've been a wild (i.e. thrilling but totally unbelievable) vehicle pursuit by the Mayans; not here. It's the BELIEVABILITY of ""The Ruins"" that makes it effective, which is reinforced by the acting of the five protagonists.

Speaking of whom, the main cast consists of Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric and Joe Anderson as Mathias, the German. The two girls and Tucker (Jeff) especially stand out. I found these protagonists likable and fairly fleshed-out for a 90-minute horror flick. For one, they're not the typical frat trash you see in so many horror flicks. Secondly, we see signs of character again and again, which I detail below.

Critics complain that the antagonists are decidedly un-scary, but that's one of the main points of the movie. Like 1963's ""The Birds,"" it takes something we see every day and are NOT scared of and turns it/them into a source of horror.

One memorable scene is when Stacy and Amy are in the dark bowels of the pyramid searching for a cell phone they keep hearing. What they discover is equal parts shocking, surreal and amazing (more on this below). Another memorable sequence is when Jeff & Eric are forced to perform a gruesome operation. The climax is also well-done and suspenseful.

While the story takes place on the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, it was surprisingly shot at Gold Coast and Tamborine Mountain, Australia, just south of Brisbane, which is on the East coast. In any case, the locations are spectacular.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Ruins"" surprised me in light of the inexplicable mediocre ratings and incessant panning. It's an adventure story mixed with psychological horror utilizing something common and un-scary as the ""monster."" It features quality gore, excellent locations & props, quality performances and proficient filmmaking in general. Plus it takes advantage of the presence of Laura Ramsey and eschews the overdone cartoony-ness of too many horror flicks, which are more funny than creepy or horrifying. In other words, ""The Ruins"" delivers the goods.

The theatrical version runs 90 minutes and the unrated version 93 minutes. I viewed the latter.

GRADE: B+/A-

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

The plants that live on the pyramid and what they are able to do spur a fascinating point: The animal kingdom spans the spectrum of worms to human beings. What about plant life? The plants at the Mayan ruins are obviously from the higher-developed end of the plant kingdom – they work as a team to obtain sustenance and are able to mimic sounds, like human voices and the ringtone of a cell phone.

I've heard complaints about how the protagonists constantly make the wrong decisions. Answer: The foursome had befriended Mathias and therefore trusted him. They wanted to experience some Mayan history off the beaten track. When the Natives suddenly arrive on the scene and brutally shoot one of their members in the head the only place for them to safely flee is the pyramid. At that point they're stranded because the Natives have the ruins surrounded. How is any of this a wrong decision?

Someone complained that the youths never attempt to escape the pyramid until it is basically too late, which supposedly defies logic. Answer: They're only on the pyramid for two nights and were waiting for help to arrive. Their only other recourse was to make a run for the jungle, which was impossible because the pyramid was surrounded by Natives with deadly weapons who already proved they would kill without mercy anyone infected by the plants. As such, the most logical thing to do was to wait for help and only make a run for it (to the jungle) if they absolutely had to, which is what happens. It sounds logical to me.

Another criticism is that the protagonists are imbeciles with little character development. I found them likable, as noted above, and there are numerous examples of character: They desire to experience the culture of the area and not just utilize their exotic vacation to party, like the average one-dimensional spring-breakers. Also, they refuse to leave Mathias for dead in the pyramid and the girls risk going down the same dubious rope that resulted in his fall. Moreover, Jeff insists on performing the gruesome task of cutting off Mathias' legs and Eric agrees to help even while the primitive operation causes him to vomit. Lastly, Jeff willingly sacrifices himself so that Amy has a chance to escape and she makes a bold dash for freedom. All this sounds like character to me.

Needless to say, the criticisms leveled at the film are mostly invalid or easily explained."

RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Nicholas Stoller, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a romcom starring Jason Segel as Peter, a genial musician from Los Angeles who composes music for a popular detective show, which stars his hottie girlfriend, the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). After she breaks up with him he vacations at a resort in Hawaii where, unexpectedly, his ex & her rock star beau (Russell Brand) also happen to be staying. Mila Kunis plays a concierge at the resort who takes interest in Peter.  

This is a compelling, amusing romantic comedy with Segel likable as the protagonist and Bell winsome and charismatic as his ex. Brand is great as a Jim Morrison-like rock god who doesn’t drink; the way he performs on stage is laugh-out-loud funny (poking fun at rock stars). The resort locations are a highlight and the story is sprinkled with several notable guest stars (Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Da'Vone McDonald, Jonah Hill, etc.).

Unfortunately, there are several NC-17 (aka porn-ish) scenes that I wasn’t expecting since the version I watched was supposedly rated ‘R.’ I’m talking about several scenes of simulated sex, including one involving fellatio, as well as full-frontal male nudity right out of the gate (Seriously?). I basically ignored these scenes or rolled with them and laughed. I’m sharing this info for those who don’t care to see a movie mixed with nigh-porn elements.

It is nice that they shuffled the structure around a little, giving Kumar the love interest instead of Harold, but he's still the ""problem causer"" in the pair.  This turns into more abuse humor focused on Harold, even more than the first movie.

Where the first movie had a much more passive antagonist and it was more of situational adversity, this has the U.S. Government as an active antagonist.  This makes it political and a little less fun, but more importantly it about them running FROM something as opposed to running TO something.

While this formula is a little less fun by structure, they managed to up the ridiculousness of the situations from the first movie.  I honestly think they just did everything they thought they couldn't get away with in the original.

""SPOILERS"" 

Outpost is the feature length directing debut of Steve Barker, it's written by Rae Brunton and is produced by Arabella Croft & Kieran Parker; who financed the film themselves by mortgaging their own Glasgow home. Starring are Ray Stevenson, Julian Wadham, Richard Brake & Michael Smiley. The plot sees scientist and businessman Hunt (Wadham) hire a mercenary crack team headed by DC (Stevenson) to protect him on a perilous mission into Eastern Europe. There they are to locate an abandoned bunker in no-man's land and seemingly gather information to aid Hunt's research. However, once at the outpost, the men make a horrific discovery - one that is only the start of the terror to come.

Lets get the blatantly obvious negatives out the way first, the kind that pithy critics enjoy beating an independent film with. Outpost is not fresh, certainly not in story, setting and god forbid -- logic. Channeling (by the makers own admission) John Carpenter's spooky 1980 movie The Fog - with more than a nod towards Michael Mann's The Keep & Ken Wiederhorn's Almost Human - Outpost does, from the off, have a familiar ring to it. Yet Barker's movie can stand on its own two ghostly feet on account of it having heavy atmosphere that's nicely blended with no short supply of the grisly. This is not about cheap shocks, though. Barker slow burns the first half hour and then steadily turns up the heat as the secrets of the ""Outpost"" start to unravel, with the sense of dread that accompanies said unravelling palpable in the extreme. 

Away from the rewarding creepy vibe that dominates the piece, the technical aspects also stand up considerably well. Barker's directing is unobtrusive and aware of its genre roots, with a cartoon/animation section deftly effective, while Brunton's screenplay is lean and lets the characters breath. That it has commentary on the barbaric nature of the Nazis and slots in a Die Glocke for its core, also, should not be understated, war is hell is as apt a saying here, as apt can be. Note worthy on the war is hell theme is that here the makers are saying war is always and everywhere, not only is the film set with one foot in a historic war and the other in a ""today"" war, but each of the mercenaries represent a soldier from a different war-zone around the world. With the wooded valley of Dalbeattie near Castle Douglas in Scotland standing in for Eastern Europe, Gavin Struthers does wonders on photography. Smartly stripping the colours down to a near monochrome finish that lends weight to the historical context of the story, he also makes the interiors claustrophobic and captures rich detail for the exteriors. The score from James Seymour Brett is one of the better ones for a low-fi British horror, suitably pulse like, and the acting is no-nonsense and befitting the characters within.

With a no cop out and suitably bleak ending, Outpost isn't after the popcorn crowd. It may be heavily influenced by past down in the woods army like shockers, but it sure as hell shows the likes of Rob Green's awful 2001 movie, The Bunker, how it should be done. 7/10"

It combines the modern background society, e.g. terrorism, with the unconventional high-tech fantasy. Our leading actor Robert Downey Jr. deeply embodies the soul of the Iron Man in himself. We common people never lived this way :P || **A long form review originally posted in 2010:**

Marking the beginning of the latest Marvel franchise, _The Avengers_, is Jon Favreau's _Iron Man_.

I'm quite fond of Super Hero movies, I don't love them to the same extent that I do the slasher or psychological thriller genres, but they do hold a small place in my heart all to themselves. I'm pretty pumped for this whole ""Avengers"" thing to come to fruition, 'cause honestly it's all been great so far, starting with Iron Man, whom Robert Downey Jr. (_Natural Born Killers, Gothika, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Sherlock Holmes, Due Date_) portrays, and incredibly so.

It's important to set yourself a starting point. More specifically, what I mean is, a reason. Batman's parents were murdered, and his home was destroyedby crime; The Punisher's whole family was murdered in front of him and he big-time snapped; characters like the X-Men and the Fantastic 4 are defending themselves and end up having a penchant for world-saving. Those are all fine, and so long as you have one, I'm happy. But I really kind of like Tony Stark's reason for becoming Iron Man... He's a dick. That's why. He's a dick that supplies the world with the most lethal weapons in existence, and they take lives left, right and centre. Then, he's put through the world where they get used, and finally is told by the person who helped him escape that world, not to waste his life. He believes he is still alive for a reason, he decides that reason is to become a dick that is intent on privatising world peace. Which I think makes perfect sense.

That may have come across as sarcasm, but I was deadly serious. Tony Stark becomes Iron man, and that's why. It works fantastically. We then get to see all the incarnations of his suit, how difficult it was to make, what it runs on, the technology, everything. And I'm a huge fan of back story, which Iron Man delivers.

It's sort of the antithesis of DC's _Batman Begins_. Though they're both young adults that come from money with no family, a British butler (although Iron man's butler Jarvis was transformed into AI for the film [he was an actual person in the comics]), they have a board of directors take care of their family's billionaire business until they're ready to eventually take the reins, they both become ""____ Man"" and go about saving the innocent, not through superpowers but technology. I'm sure I could go on. But they're also incredibly different. Where Batman is a total bad ass, the gothic unknown defender of the night that uses fear as a weapon to protect his home town, and yet refuses to kill; Iron Man is a bright, shiny, loud attention grabber, who goes all international to fight crime, he wants the world to know he's Iron Man and his enemies are totally lame, so no wonder he has no qualms about killing! Batman's secret identity, Bruce Wayne, is an angsty tosser, that tries way to hard. But Tony Stark, is a witty, brilliant inventor, who has basically harnessed all of Batman's training, strength, weapons, vehicles and flight, improved them, and put them in to a single suit. So though I personally prefer Batman as a hero, I prefer Tony Stark as a character.

The interaction between Stark and Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (_Se7en, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Royal Tenenbaums, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_) was incredible. It just goes to show what good casting can achieve, even in an action flick, the dialogue is hilarious and clever. Is it possible for a Super Hero movie to be a bad Super Hero film but a great film? I guess it is.

The antagonists are lacking to say the least, and their dispatching leaves even more to be desired. Which is normally not too huge when you get the rest so perfect, unfortunately, it's a comic book film, about Super Heroes, and Super Villains. They fight one another over and over, in fact that's pretty much what the comics are about in their entirety, so it's quite a major short coming. That being said, it's really the only one that _Iron Man_ has. In a way though, they're a similar comparison to the latest Batman films again; Iron Monger and Whiplash are flashy, but disappointing, where The Joker, Two-Face, Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul are top notch as bad guys. Whereas Ironman's Obadiah Stane and Ivan Vanko were great characters, but Batman's The Joker is only seen in his villain persona, and Harvey Dent, Jonathan Crane and Henri Ducard are nothing more than vessels for their alter-egos.

All that aside, the film is just plain good, and you don't need to be a fan of Iron Man, Super Heroes or comics in general to enjoy _Iron Man_.

-Gimly || Iron Man did a lot more than just launch the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was the first comic book movie in a long time to integrate the fantastical nature of superheroes and supervillains into a real world setting with consequences. It also showed how great of a filmmaker Jon Favreau is and rebooted the career of Robert Downey Jr.

For all this, Iron Man is a fantastic movie, still one of the best MCU films. It's so much fun to watch. Yet it displays a lot of intelligence, exploring the internal dilemma of a man profiteering off war when faced with the harsh reality that he is part of a system that corrupts absolutely."

As a result we are spared such clichéd sights as the Training Montage, for instance, or the Romantic Interest.

The hero is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu teacher Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor), whose mantra is “There is no situation that you cannot turn to your advantage.” In keeping with this, Mamet weaves a script where there are no wasted movements; as in a Rube Goldberg machine, every disparate element – idealistic sensei, shallow Hollywood star, troubled police officer, traumatized female lawyer, long-suffering wife, crooked club owners, shady businessmen, etc., etc., etc. – is interconnected with the others and all serve the story just like all roads lead to Rome. Even something so apparently random as some dude performing sleight of hand in bar in exchange for drinks will eventually fall into place and fit in with rest as neatly as a key going into a lock.

Only the ending seems like it was taken straight out of a much inferior movie (think something like a Kickboxer or a Never Back Down), and represents somewhat of an anomaly among Mamet’s filmography which, mostly for better but sometimes for worse, is nothing if not consistent – consider 1988’s Things Change, whose deus ex machina not only had a better set-up but was much easier to swallow because the movie was, after all, a comedy. But here the fanciful climax feels tacked on, especially after the effort made by both the filmmaker and his expert cast to invest the story with a palpable sense of realism. To go out of his way like this, Mamet clearly cared a great deal about the main character – and so will most people who watch the movie, though not necessarily, at least in my case, at the expense of inner logic."

The few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled French people who do not like to see the French government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards (which they often are anyway).

I generally like Liam Neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already. In this movie he plays a real badass, I-kick-the-shit-out-of-anyone-standing-in-my-way, former CIA agent hunting down the despicable low-life that kidnapped his daughter. I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.

The movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth. Once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheep's fur and reveals the wolf (sabre-toothed) underneath.

This is really a textbook action/thriller movie.

Photography is great, though. || This is quite an enjoyable depiction of some multi-lingual Arabian Nights-style scenarios as we find ""Roy"" (Lee Pace) in an hospital in 1920s Los Angeles. He had previously been a movie stuntman but an accident has robbed him of the use of his legs and so with medical science being somewhat limited, he is pretty much bedridden. Also in the hospital is the young ""Alexandria"" (Catinca Untaru) who is recovering from breaking her arm and in need of some cheering up. With a vivid and varied imagination, he begins to regale his new friend with fantastic tales of bandits and slaves all trying to defeat the epitome of evil that is ""Odious"". Along the way, she becomes enthralled as the ""Black Bandit"" tries to avenge the killing of his ""Blue"" brother by working with the equally aggrieved ""Luigi"" (Robin Smith) who turns out to be quite nimble when it comes to getting things to blow up! Indeed, before too long we have quite a few folks determined to bring their nasty antagonist to book. There is method to his madness in telling these stories, though. She is charged with procuring some medicine for him that he can't get from the nurses. When we discover just what that is, then we begin to appreciate that ""Roy"" has a darker agenda of his own. The question might be, will his stories create a bond with the youngster that might divert him from that path? This is great fun, with loads of action packed into a two hours that really does fly by. The performance from Daniel Caltagirone as the baddie reminded me a little of the sergeant from the old ""Zorro"" television series - menacing but in an almost avuncular fashion, and with loads of swash and buckle, pyrotechnics and fantastic mystery it's just as easy for us to get sucked into his stories as it is for the young ""Alexandria"" - and that's a character that's played well by the young Miss Untaru - imbuing enthusiasm, a bit of awe, and latterly something altogether a little more poignant. The scoring is lively, the dialogue frequently quite funny and the portmanteau style of chaptered storytelling works well. It's for grown ups; you can appreciate that pretty much from the start and I really did like it."

<em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'</em> is a suitably entertaining production, if not an exceptional one; though it's not far off. I like the fresh new story and the fact that all four of the youngsters remain, but the change from dark, snowy settings to plain, summer-like conditions means the film does lose some spark. There's also much less intrigue with the villains.

Georgie Henley (Lucy), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Skandar Keynes (Edmund) are again enjoyable in their roles. Liam Neeson, just barely, reprises his role of Aslan - his inclusion does feel forced, as great a character as he is.

Away from those four, you have a number of new faces. Ben Barnes (Caspian), Peter Dinklage (Trumpkin), Warwick Davis (Nikabrik) and Eddie Izzard (Reepicheep) are my standouts. Barnes is solid, I liked watching Caspian. Dinklage is great, while Davis and Izzard are welcomed newbies. Like the first film, the casting here is done astutely.

They definitely should've shortened this though, the ending does drag a fair bit. There's also a couple of different moments that feel like the end, yet evidently aren't - there's certainly more than a few pacing issues.

With all that said, I still had a more than decent time watching. || One year after their return from ""Narnia"" the four Pevensie children are summoned back. They arrive to discover everything has been destroyed and the land divided - humankind and animals no longer co-exist - under the autocratic rule of the nasty king ""Miraz"" (Sergio Castelitto) who murdered the previous king and usurped the throne from the rightful successor Prince ""Caspian"" (Ben Barnes). A great supporting cast including Peter Dinklage, Warwick Davis and Pierfranceso Favino help the kids and the Prince do battle - alongside a rather deferential but feisty vocal contribution from Eddie Izzard as ""Reepicheep"", the chivalric mouse - to restore the proper order. It's not got as much going for it as the first film in the series; the story isn't quite so engaging - but again the dialogue, scenery and score all contribute to a thoroughly enjoyable family fantasy adventure that relies much more on the quality of the story than on extensive use of CGI."

Indiana Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.

So here it is, the fourth instalment of the Indiana Jones series is finally here, one of the most talked about, most anticipated, and most yearned for films is here to hopefully entertain the fans and maybe garner some new ones in the process?? Does it deliver? Well to me it most certainly does, as adventure yarns go, this is a ripper, and although the plot gets lost within the outlandish ideals, the film still emerges as one of the betert popcorn blockbusters of the year. All the chief ingredients that have made the franchise so beloved are crammed in by way of crowd pleasing necessity, and it damn well works, outrageous action sequences perk us up at frequent intervals, deftly self aware comic moments are many, and crucially, the film remains loyal to the heroic good against evil spirit of the franchise.

We begin in the Nevada Desert in 1957, and it's through this 50s setting that we come to accept the ageing of the main protagonist, he is after all a mere mortal, a man with a whip and a bit of guts. The 50s was a time of paranoia, spies and dubious cover ups were all the rage, this shines through from the outset here, and putting an aged Indiana Jones in this time frame is nothing short of genius. But enough of the politics, we as fans just want to be entertained, and we are well served here, spooky chambers, mysterious civilisations, tricksy maps, unfathomable codes, creepy crawlies, peril at every turn, and stuntery abound, oh yes it's all here. However, the purists will hate the use of CGI in this, and for sure it does grate during one over extended sequence, but just like it didn't stop Stephen Sommers' The Mummy being a riot, it doesn't harm this picture either, we are after all talking about a popcorn actioner here. Surely going into a film of this type one immediately suspends disbelief? I mean I'm personally going into the cinema to escape for a couple of hours, and Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is just what the doctor ordered, with a lollipop to follow for good behaviour.

The cast are a mixed bunch, Ford easily carries off the role as the older Indiana Jones, very aware and with tongue firmly in cheek, he surely has rammed all the pre-negative vibes down the throats of the doom mongers. Shia LaBeouf fits into the series with no problems at all, spunky and witty, he adds the young sparkle needed to off set the aged nature of our hero, and he gets a quite delightful entrance to boot. Ray Winstone is an odd casting choice because his character is very underwritten, if you are going to utilise the big Englishman then give him the reins to take, he's gruff and watchable but it remains a case of wasting talent. Karen Allen joyfully reappears as Marion, and the film takes a significant leap upwards once she arrives, however the character is reduced to playing fourth fiddle in the ensuring shenanigans, and as much as the interplay with Indy still sparkles, you can't help hankering for much more from our Marion. Cate Blanchet is sparky as Irina Spalko but although as our chief villain of the piece she's tough, sexy, and not to be messed with, it's a turn that is never quite fully formed. John Hurt does the best he can with what little the role calls for, whilst Jim Broadbent barely gets time to fill the considerable boots left by Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will divide fans and newcomers alike, but I honestly say without nostalgia rearing its head, that this film is a joy ride to be judged on its own merit. It's difficult to understand some of the venom aimed at this latest instalment, it's not like anything has really changed with the formula, Indiana Jones has always been about fun, nothing more and nothing less, just remember why you fell in love with the franchise in the first place and you will see the makers here have given the fans what they wanted. Perhaps the advent of time and the new technology available has a hindrance value for sure, but although Indy 4 obviously isn't quite the impacting franchise jolt that Bond got with ""Casino Royale"", it's sure as hell shown ""Die Hard 4"" how it should have be done. 8/10 || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

I'm always confused on when this movie is supposed to happen, and too many people get caught up in the involvement of Shia Lebouf to think too hard about it.

This movie catches a lot of flak for Shia and half a dozen other things, but  compared to the original 3 movies, the concepts of a crystal skull aren't any more weird.  While people forget that aspects of the first 3 artifacts are real, the crystal skulls are a real thing that is actively being investigated.  Because it's caught up in all the ""alien conspiracy"" communities I think the movie absorbed some of the ridicule of those people.

The story itself is well structured, Cate Blanchett and Karen Allen are welcome are awesome additions to the story, and despite the ""sci-fi"" element from an alien skull, the movie keeps to a archaeological theme by investigating an ancient temple site.

While I'm not going to re-watch this, please ignore the negative hype and give this a try if you like a good action adventure story. || The problem with this is that if it was watched in isolation it isn't a half-bad adventure movie. Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf keep the story moving along OK. Unfortunately, it will always be compared with the earlier prequels and it simply doesn't hold a candle to any of them. Karen Allen reprises her role from ""Raiders"" with some considerable joie-de-vivre but Ray Winstone and a ridiculously cast Cate Blanchett as the Ukrainian colonel just don't cut through as we race across the world to track down the origin of a mysterious crystal skull. The plot is almost irrelevant; this is just a vehicle for the star and a pretty charabanc one at that. Can think of a few good uses for the killer ants, though..."

To be fair, both films I'd seen in the same setting - alone, the middle of the night, in the aptly named ""Suicide Flats"", and what's more, I've since re-watched _The Strangers_ a couple of times and realised that both my fear, and my enjoyment, were perhaps a bit overstated on that first viewing. Even taking that into account though, and seeing it again almost a decade after that first time, I still honestly believe that _The Strangers_ is a good movie, with some pretty genuinely creepy elements.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || I know this movie gets hyped without end, and I think, that has mainly to do with Liv Tyler playing the lead. I remember seeing this, as it first came out, and even though I enjoyed it, it didn't really stick with me. Nothing overwhelming, but a nice watch. Liv Tyler does a fine job here, but for most of the time she is alone in the house, and the movie becomes quite repetitive after a while. Once we get to the killers, most people were so excited about the reason, they did all this. Because 'Kristen' was home! Seriously? Who would have thought? Isn't that the same reason, why 'Jason Voorhees' kills people all around 'Camp Crystal Lake'? Because they are there? But I get it. The point is, that the killers have no other motivation than just to attack random people. There is no desire for money or jewelery... just the pure lust to take lives. But that is a motivation, most serial killers have, and therefore it doesn't seem all that special. When the movie becomes bloody towards the end, I really loved it though. It is nice, to see a movie like this acted by someone, who is as well known as Liv Tyler, and also Scott Speedman was totally fine. ""The Strangers"" is a fine little home invasion movie, but most certainly it doesn't deserve this extreme hype."

… actually it’s a ranch house, but close enough.  Anyway, they start getting picked off by a mad slasher with the most promiscuous ones dying first. Sound familiar?

“All the Boys Love Mandy Lane” debuted at film festivals in 2006 but curiously wasn’t released to theaters until 2013. I’m surprised this was even released to theaters because it’s a low-budget indie slasher, nothing more. It cost $750,000, which is more than enough to make a competent film. The well-done “Another Kind” (2013), for instance, only cost $120,000. But “Mandy Lane” is just too all-around hackneyed and meh, which isn’t helped by the fact that half the characters are repellent (e.g. Jake, Marlin & Chloe).

Thankfully, the filmmaking is competent with some nice cinematography of central Texas and Amber Heard in an early role is a highlight. Plus there’s a surprise at the end, but it makes you question the person’s motives. If you reflect on the material, though, it all makes sense and shows that some thought was put into the script. Of course this doesn’t help the dull shallowness of most of the characters (who are SUPPOSED to be shallow, I get it).

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the heart of Texas (Austin & Bastrop) with other stuff done in Santa Clarita, CA.

Dubbed as a “re-quel”, _The Incredible Hulk_ was first released in 2008, and now, I’m here to review it in the line of Marvel films I’m getting through a the moment. 

I always like to think of films individually, but with the Marvel Cinematic Universe getting so big, that can be rather difficult to do. So though I may comment on films in relation to their sequels, remakes, prequels, spin-offs, parodies and the like, know that my final score out of ten is always based purely on the films merits, or lack thereof. 

It’s pretty crazy seeing Edward Norton (_American History X, Fight Club, Red Dragon, Kingdom of Heaven, Pride and Glory, Stone_) as a very scrawny Bruce Banner, considering that he turns into the giant, muscular Hulk. But to me it totally worked. As an interesting side-note, Norton co-wrote the script, which may or may not have contributed to his being ousted as Banner for any future films after the movie was released. Not because the script is particularly awful or anything, but because as a general rule production doesn’t like actors getting all up in ""dey grillz"" half way through. Although it’s not like Norton’s never done this sort of thing before.

Under-appreciated Tim Roth (_Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Planet of the Apes, Lie to Me, Rob Roy_) is also excellent (as far as I’m concerned) playing the role of Abomination/Emil Blonsky. Interesting side-note, no, he’s not related to Eli Roth, who’s also a friend and actor of Quentin Tarantino and his films.

Ultimately, _The Incredible Hulk_ is a fine film, but it just can’t stand up to the superior writing and character building of Thor, Iron Man or Iron Man 2. Liv Tyler (_The Strangers, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Armageddon_) is rather a non-event as supposed love interest Betty Ross. And William Hurt (_Robin Hood, A History of Violence, The Village, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Dark City_) as semi-antagonist General Thunderbolt Ross, is nothing but annoying (although it is pretty cool to see just how much they got him looking like the comic book character he is based on.

You would’ve thought that having a modern day Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story to run with, backing from the success of the franchise you’ve got supporting you, that it would be easy to write strong characters, unfortunately, it’s not the case. And while the action sequences are cool, and the fighting is possibly some of the best that Marvel’s come up with, it’s not enough to bring this film up to the standards of the other 3. The film lacks the flair I’m sure everyone would be expecting, and while it’s a perfectly good monster-movie movie, perhaps a completely separate Super Hero origin story would have been better than the overly-CGI-ridden quasi-sequel to 2003’s _The Hulk_ that we ended up with.

66%

_-Gimly_ || It's an improvement on the Ang Lee film only in the sense that the smashy smashy bits are more entertaining than the previous film's thinky thinky bits. But the fact that the entire film is just one long extended fight scene is disappointing to us who enjoy the darker, more emotional beats of the Hulk's story. I enjoy this movie quite a bit as a well put together piece of fluff entertainment, but I hold no delusions that even Marvel Studios couldn't get the definitive version of Hulk on screen. || Much more enjoyable than the 2003 film, which this 2008 release reboots. So that's a positive. As for a follow-up in the MCU, it's a little underwhelming if still passably good - at least to me.

<em>'The Incredible Hulk'</em> is closer to being forgettable than it is to being memorable, but that's not to say I didn't have a solid time watching. It's only really the ending that I felt dragged, yet even then it still has positive moments.

I liked Edward Norton's performance for the most part, particularly early on in South America. Tim Roth is good too, though a few of his scenes irritated me slightly - perhaps more to do with how the film uses him, rather than what Roth does himself. There are a few others, but those two are the most standout.

I did expect more, but there's enough there that I rate."

<em>'WALL·E'</em> is beautifully made, despite a relatively simple premise and no real cast to speak of. A big reason for its charm is the strong message and adorable lead characters - WALL·E (Ben Burtt) and EVE (Elissa Knight).

The run time of 98 minutes flies by, with a cool end credits coming at the conclusion. Its animation is utterly superb, while I also like the mix of real-life footage (featuring Fred Willard as Shelby Forthright) into things. Jeff Garlin and Sigourney Weaver work well in their minor roles.

Not at the top of my personal Disney animated productions, but just about inside the top ten up until this point. Lovely film."

He meets an attractive woman named Fox and discovers that his recently murdered father - whom Wesley never knew - belonged to the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins which takes its orders from Fate itself.

Though he enjoys his newfound abilities, he begins to suspect that there is more to the Fraternity than meets the eye.",Choose your destiny.,"Action, Thriller, Crime",110.0,2008-06-19,en,6.525,7245.0,7.0982,"James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann",Timur Bekmambetov,"mission of murder, secret base, secret organization, instinct, train crash, revenge, betrayal, fate, based on graphic novel, healing process, hidden powers, legacy, secret code, trainsurfing, weapons training, office worker, physical training, intense, assassins, extraordinary powers, vibrant, murder of father","I typically never write a review on a film that I've already seen more than once, because I insist on the review reflecting my first (and strongest) impression of the film. But after watching Wanted for what must be the 5th or 6th time now, I suddenly felt like writing something anyway, so here I go.

Let me begin by saying, this is one strange film. Strange in the sense that it's literally like a train wreck that you can't keep your eyes off because it's so fascinating to watch. And you almost feel sick with guilt and exhilaration because you're enjoying it so much. Violence never looked so gorgeous before... 

Wanted is about a guy named Wesley Gibson, who is such a hopeless, pathetic dweeb that even Google won't return any results when he types in his own name. He is ""rescued"" from his pitiful cubicle existence by a gorgeous woman named Fox, who recruits him into an organisation of assassins known as The Fraternity, supposedly because they believe he is the only person who can kill the man who killed his father. Little does he know just how drastically his life will actually change once he agrees to join them.

The casting of the film is spot-on. James McAvoy has already proved himself to be a versatile actor and he is very believable as a weak push-over, who finds confidence in the fact that group of trained assassins apparently believe in his abilities. He also makes his character likable and fun to watch, because he delivers it with a sense of humour and you can actually relate to him because his situation is so understandable. Basically, he's just another slave to the wage, looking for a way to break free. This way is initially offered to him by Angelina Jolie, and who could say no to a woman like that... Ms Jolie plays a role that seems like it could only have been written specifically for her. Who else could play a beautiful and deadly assassin who's charismatic and covered in tattoos? She could and would kill you in a heartbeat, and yet you just want to be near her. Morgan Freeman plays Sloan, the leader of the Fraternity, and, well... I hardly need to elaborate on this one, do I? He makes pretty much every film he's in worth watching, and that's all I need to say.

Now, I titled this review 'beautiful garbage'. That's not so much because the film itself is garbage, because it's not, but rather because the events portrayed in this film are so brutal and merciless that they could only come from a very dark and rotten place. The 'beautiful' is directed at the visual effects, because everything ranging from camera techniques to production design to action choreography is so beautifully done, so thrillingly eye-popping that it would almost make you forget that you're watching people get slaughtered, beat up and maimed. Tons of blood flow, brains are splattered against the wall and yet you can't take your eyes off that beautifully designed bullet. That awesome tattoo on Angelina Jolie's hand interlacing with the engravings on her gun. Those mind-blowing car chase scenes. That guy jumping through the glass out of a skyscraper just to finish his ""job""... This film is visual effects executed to perfection, elevating said perfection to a whole new level. 

It's all so pretty to watch that it would almost make you able to forgive the writers the overpowering lack of realism. Almost. 

The staggering amount of ideas and actions that are 98% of the time either inconsistent, improbable or flat-out impossible would in any other case surely put any screenwriter out of work. With a film like this, it's literally only the wrapper that makes the candy sweet. It just goes to show that sometimes, making something really, really pretty can make it worth watching, just so long as you're willing to suspend every inch of disbelief for the sake of watching pretty pictures. Nature, science, biology and every other form of technical factuality is being put to the test here, which is not to say it's basically just being thrown out the window... But hey, I can promise you you're going to get to see a guy get in a car the way you've never seen before. And a girl get in a train in a fashion that defies every rule of physics... It's all worth it for a totally cool, put-your-brain-in-stand-by-mode kind of action flick. 

Director Timur Bekmambetov has obviously tried his darnedest to make his mark in Hollywood with his first English spoken, big-budget effort, and may I say, he could've done a lot worse. Not to mention the fact that he has managed to recruit a few very big names to top the bill, this is definitely a Hollywood debut to be proud of. I can only hope he will continue to work with the same excellent crew in the future, because although only the sound department was nominated for an Oscar, camera and visual effects would have definitely deserved a nod from the Academy too.

In a nutshell, Wanted is an 110 minutes of gorgeous, eye-pleasing nonsense with great action and one very beautiful lady... I for one can't wait for the sequel.
_(July 2012)_ || He's the man alright.

Wanted is loosely based on the comic book miniseries of the same name by Mark Millar. It's directed by Timur Bekmambetov and stars James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Terence Stamp and Konstantin Khabensky. The storyline follows Wesley Gibson (McAvoy), a frustrated and downtrodden office worker who discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin when he is saved by Fox (Jolie) from being assassinated himself in a supermarket. Initially he is baffled and out of his depth, but upon meeting the secret ""Fraternity"" headed by Sloan (Freeman), Gibson starts to undergo training to fulfil his destiny as a ""Fraternity"" hit-man.

One of the better things about popcorn action movies is when there is a geek coming good and kicking ass. Be it super-heroes or average Joe's finding something extra, having the rise of the meek get tough at its core is normally a winner. So it is with Wanted, the US directorial debut of Night/Day Watch helmer, Timur Bekmambetov. It's not so much that McAvoy's anxiety riddled office worker gets to play guns, sports cars and hang with a lithe Angelina Jolie - it's that he, courtesy of a good source, gets to not care about the killing. The film may not be as dark as the source material, but the essence of it is there with corruption and violence at the core. The story, as bonkers as it is, is simplified into one that features ancient weavers receiving messages depicting targets to be wiped from the planet for the greater good of humanity. Enter the ""Fraternity"" in modern times, which in the name of good, goes out slotting said targets. Oh but it's not just a case of line someone up in a telescope and pull the trigger, this is more fun than that.

For action movies in this decade, Wanted has few peers. From the intense and brutal training regime that Gibson undertakes, to the number of explosive and inventive sequences that flit in and out of the piece, it delivers pulse raising cinema. There's outrageous car pursuits, car jumps with whirls and crash bangs, speeding trains resplendent with stunts, a train crash sequence that's as good as anything in popcorn world, and then there's the bullets. Curving bullets that either smack into each other or do untold damage to the forehead of some unknowing target. That the makers are not aiming for the PG-13 market is an obvious bonus, for it allows them to fully payoff on the fights and blood letting. Even those that come with funny and inventive gimmicks. Bekmambetov is having fun, the nature of the beast is a haven for his fast-cutting and slow-mo dalliances, while the noise that thunders out of the speakers pulls one further into the action.

McAvoy steps up to the action plate with great success, at times charming yet pathetic, at others totally scary, he revels in the chance to carry a movie of such adrenalin fuelled excess. Jolie too comes out with much credit, the role of Fox giving her the chance to shine, unlike Lara Croft, as a charismatic action girl. While Freeman does what Freeman does well, be straight and oddly classy. Not since John Woo's action berserker Face-Off 11 years previously has the action genre been this much fun and exciting. The pace may not be perfect, and some scenes will be just too ridiculous for some demanding critics (they of course realise the tongue in cheek/nudge in the ribs that's going on?), but regardless, Wanted has taken the action genre to another level. Lets hope it's not 11 years till we have to wait for the next bar raiser. 9/10"

Hancock had character at the start of the film, but that slowly faded away by the second half, that just sort of floundered until it ended.

It lacked the humor that comes with a lot of Will Smith's other outings, and it lacks the charisma that usually seeps out of Smith.

It just seemed to fail on every front. || **Despite being one of the great films of Will Smith's career, it is a weak and uninteresting film.**

I think almost everyone who has seen superhero movies, especially the bigger budget ones, has wondered how it's possible that those heroes are so destructive: in order to eliminate an enemy or a danger, they destroy half a city as collateral damage. This film works precisely on top of that: Hancock is a superhero who doesn't seem to want to be one, and who doesn't know how to deal with it. As a result, and despite being effective at what he does, he is quite destructive and unpopular until the day he gets an image manager.

Although Will Smith is one of those actors that I never really appreciated very much, I have to admit that he did a lot of good to bet on this film. The character is perfect for the actor, who seems to be as charismatic as he is grumpy, and Smith's effort turns out to be the big reason to see the film. Smith gives us a very well done job and manages to bear the effort and responsibility of the protagonist with great capacity. Charlize Theron also deserves a positive note for the work she left us in this film. Jason Bateman brings to life the most likeable and palatable character in the film, but he doesn't have the material to match his colleagues.

Unfortunately, beyond the work of Smith and his co-stars, the film doesn't really have much else to offer us. The script starts from a very interesting idea, but fails to flesh it out and develops it in a very inefficient way. The result ends up being a frankly uneven film, where a good beginning leads to a dull stagnation and, later, a highly predictable and tiring ending. On a technical level, we can highlight, on a positive note, the quality of the cinematography and CGI effects used, as well as the effective and properly used soundtrack. Everything else is simply boring and not worthy of particular mention. || I like this movie because it's different from your typical superhero character. He cracks me up to. They have some pretty cool fight scenes in this."

Get Smart is hilarious. Just good clean, hilarious fun. Steve Carrell is in his sweet spot with all kinds of physical comedy and side-splitting sarcasm. This movie feels every bit like a spy comedy starring Michael Scott from the Office, except this time with a much bigger budget than Threat Level Midnight. I don't know how the cast could keep a straight face with Steve Carrell's performance as outrageous and entertaining as it was. Anne Hathaway was an excellent partner reacting to Carrell's nonsense with many of her own clever moments. Having watched re-runs of the original TV show with my grandparents growing up, it was easy to see how the movie honored the show's spirit while increasing the budget, effects, and laughs. Director Peter Segal has a resume filled with goofy films and several of which involve espionage and law enforcement, making him the perfect director for a movie like this. Get Smart's clean humor allows the whole family to enjoy its entertaining plot and dorky lovable characters. Steve Carrell makes Get Smart a comedy I will recommend and rewatch again and again. || Kind of a weird type 007 like movie but really funny. Anne Hathaway is really hot in this movie too."

When it was announced that there was to be a modern reboot of St. Trinian’s, it was met with luke warm murmurings to say the least. Yet when it comes down to it, the old films from the 50s and 60s were hardly comedy gold anyway. Safe family fare and sometimes fun into the bargain, and with strong casts, they have never been seen as essential British comedies and untouchable by the modern era’s obsession with remakes and reimaging.

St. Trinian’s 2007 style is not an improvement on the oldies, but neither is it the stinker some critics in 2007 wanted us to believe. It has enough about it to be its own animal, it’s funny, sexy and never dull. This also benefits from strong comic casting, where the likes of Rupert Everett (having the time of his life in drag), Colin Firth and Russell Brand are pitched into the femme madness headed by Gemma Arterton and Tallulah Riley. The writers err on the side of caution as far as risqué material goes, but there’s some very strong gags played out and the grouping of the girls into the various cliques (Emos, Chavs etc) is a nifty bit of writing that is mined to good effect.

My eyes. I can't unsee it.

From what I could gather (and that's not because the plot is difficult - Christ, no - or because I wasn't really paying attention, it's because the film seemed to be not sinking in, not digesting in my brain. I think my brain was trying to reject it, like a foreign object) - an airy-fairy middle-aged bohemian tart (Meryl Streep, The Iron Lady) prances and dances around her primary-coloured villa on an unspecified Greek (I think) island. Her equally airy-fairy ""Barbie Princess"" daughter (Amanda Seyfried, Les Misérables) prances and dances around with her. That seems to be what they do. I mean, for a living, like. They're not on holiday. This is the summation of their lives. Idyllic and unrealistic prancery and dancery, around a villa apparently coloured in by over-enthusiastic first-graders. They have two friends each who escort them everywhere - even to the sh!tter perhaps, I dunno - who exist exclusively to orbit like satellites around this main pair. In fact, everybody in this movie exist purely to serve the life stories of Streep and Seyfried. It's that sort of film, where everybody on-screen is wondering, ""Oh! Will Streep eat a tangerine next? Or a satsuma? Will Seyfried brush her hair with a soft brush, or a slightly-softer-than-that brush? Oh, the agony!"" Anyway, the daughter's getting wed - the next day, I think - to some impossibly perfect young lad (to suit her impossibly perfect everything else), but, oh noes! She never knew who her dad was, because her mum was a dirty old stropper back in the eighties, and they've both been too busy prancing and dancing for two straight decades to even have brought it up, ever! So, who will give her away tomorrow? Oh noes!

Well she prances and dances her way to her mum's secret diary (with her two conjoined mates, obvs) and, equally ""obvs"", it's all in there. Ta-daa! Except, there are three possible ""daddies"" and of course, they are Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye) and Stellan Skarsgård (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest). So she invites all three to the wedding under the pretense of being her own mum and of course all three drop whatever they've been doing for twenty years and turbo their way, immediately, to this island, all arriving together, on the same boat, which also belongs to one of them. Hurrah. From there, much ""hilarity"" ensues as the airy-fairy daughter tries to suss which one's her dad while her airy-fairy tart mother spends the rest of the film - with HER conjoined mates, obvs - wondering whether to let Brosnan ""tap dat ass"" one more time.

**********

SPOILER ALERT (LIKE ANYONE GIVES A DRY, UNYIELDING BUMPLOP): They don't find out who the daddy is: the three pinhead blokes all agree that they now already love this silly airy-fairy daughter so much that they agree to be one-thirds daddy each. Then, out of the clear ****ing sky, the airy-fairy daughter tells her groom at the altar that the wedding's off, and they should just prance and dance around the world instead. Fantastic! And not to waste a wedding full of perfect ****ing strangers anyway, but Brosnan decides to marry Streep while they're there. Well of course. And Skarsgård hooks up with Julie ""Isn't she dead yet?"" Walters - one of Streep's conjoined mates - and Firth, who as it happens was a left-footer all along who was just experimenting with Streep back in the day, cops off with a waiter in traditional Greek island fashion. Hurrah for everything! Let's have another ABBA song, eh?

**********

Oh, the ABBA songs. I mean, there are musicals. Then, there are musical musicals. And then, way past any of that, there is Mamma Mia!. A quick Wiki-up shows me that, excluding reprises and a deleted scene, there are twenty songs performed in Mamma Mia!. So, say, four minutes per song, that's eighty minutes. Wiki (again) tells me that the film is 109 minutes in length, so let's knock off ten minutes-worth of credits, and you're looking at eighty minutes of singing in a 99 minute film. That sounds about right. A 19-minute story - a p!ss-poor one, at that - stretched over an hour-and-a-half by the soothing tunes of Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn and Anni-Frid. Looking at those numbers I'm now somewhat impressed that whilst watching this pile of pooey bum-leavings I didn't stand up, lose the plot, smash my house to rubble and wander off to live in the woods as a sasquatch. It was ceaseless. An ABBA song, three lines of dialogue (if you were lucky, which wasn't often), another ABBA song. Over and over. And... well, the songs were all sung in-camera by the actors. And whilst I wouldn't call any of them good singers, they could all at least hold a note (only just in Streep's case, but she managed to stumble over that line).

All except Pierce Brosnan.

Oh, Pierce. Pierce! Why didn't someone tell him? Did no one care enough? Is he THAT unlikeable? Why couldn't he hear it himself? I don't want to come across as either xenophobic or stereotypical when I suggest that he sounded like a drunken Irishman preparing to fight, but that IS what he sounded like. And who knows, maybe that's what was really happening with him at that time. He IS an Irishman, perhaps he needed to get good and liquored up before the singing - I know I would - and perhaps he was wondering whether or not to attack the first person on the set who dared laugh. Sounds perfectly plausible.

Anyway, the whole thing's a travesty, top-to-toe. Most closely resembled one of those straight-to-video Barbie movies, beloved of six-year-old girls and nobody else on the entire planet. If you ever have an opportunity to see it, DO NOT take that opportunity. SPURN that opportunity. Spurn as though your very life depended on it. That's all the advice I can give. Don't do what I did, and watch Mamma Mia!. Only madness lies that way. || Really enjoyable film, with a lot of funny one-liners, and despite the fact that a lot of them are rubbish singers, that partly adds to the humour, and obviously, Amanda, Meryl, Colin and others do have good voices :) || ***SPOILERS AHEAD***

_Mamma Mia!_ is an American-British romantic comedy musical directed by Phyllida Lloyd. The movie is loosely based on the original London musical also directed by Lloyd, and was the brain child of Judy Craymer who was convinced ABBA songs could be used in a theatrical production, especially after hearing the love ballad _The Winner Takes It All_. Craymer along with British playwright Catherine Johnson also worked on this film. Johnson being the original musical's scriptwriter wrote the movie's script, Craymer was an executive producer alongside Gary Goetzman as well as Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.

The film stars Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper, Amanda Seyfried, and Christine Baranski.

Set on the idyllic Greek island of Kalokairi it tells the story of Donna Sheridan (Streep) an independent manageress and owner of her own hotel. Donna has a 20 year-old daughter by the name of Sophie (Seyfried) who is getting married to Sky (Cooper). Upon finding Donna's old diary Sophie discovers that there were three men: Sam Carmichael (Brosnan), Harry Bright (Firth) and Bill Anderson (Skarsgård) and learns that one of them could be her father. She decides to invite all three of them to her wedding. 

Sophie later reveals this to her friends Ali (Rachel MacDowall) and Lisa (Ashley Lilley) who have agreed to be her bridesmaids. Donna has invited her old friends/bandmates Rosie (Walters) and Tanya (Baranski) to the wedding to help her out. She is however completely unaware of what Sophie has done and is taken by surprise when Sam, Harry and Bill arrive on the island. This causes Donna to have a mid-life crisis, and it is up to Rosie and Tanya to lift her spirits. While at the same time Sophie bonds with the three men, and discovers she has a trait from each of them. Things get complicated when all three men agree to give Sophie away, and realizing the mess she created she faints at her own bachelorette party.

The next day Sophie runs into Donna who is convinced that she wants the wedding called off. This causes Sophie to yell at Donna, and openly states she wants to avoid all the mistakes Donna has made in her life. At the same time Donna is pursued by Sam, the two realize they still love each other but are too busy for each other. Meanwhile, Tanya is courted by Sky's friend and best man Pepper (Philip Michael) despite the fact that he is old enough to be her son. Sophie then runs to Sky and admits what she did, angry and hurt Sky runs off. At the same time Sam tells Sophie that marriage is not always a happy thing.

Sophie then runs back to her mother and asks her to help her dress for the wedding, Donna is delighted and they mend their relationship. Sophie then learns that Donna was disowned by her mother when she got pregnant, she then proceeds to ask Donna to give her away. Donna happily agrees and as the two prepare to go to the chapel she finds herself accosted by Sam. Sam demands to know why Donna will not explain why she won't talk about their relationship. Donna then says she still loves him despite her better judgement and the fact that he broke her heart by being engaged.

Donna then proceeds to run into the chapel where the wedding finally begins. As the ceremony begins Donna realizes that she can't hide the fact that the men are there. She then introduces Sophie's dad, but then learns that Sophie invited all three of them. They then all decide to be a third of her father, Sophie surprised decides to call off the wedding. Prompting Sky to run away with her and sail the world. Sam meanwhile decides that the wedding should not go to waste, despite Donna's protest at bigamy. After revealing his divorce Sam pops the question, hesitant Donna accepts it. At the wedding reception Rosie falls in love with Bill, who at first rejects her advances but then ends up loving her too.

The movie closes with Donna and Sam alongside Bill and Harry bidding Sophie and Sky farewell as they sail away from Kalokairi. Donna, Tanya and Rosie then reprise _Dancing Queen_ during the end credits, and then the rest of the cast appears and they all sing the song _Waterloo_. The movie then finally ends with Sophie singing _Thank You For the Music_ during the end credits.

Told using several popular ABBA songs including_ Honey, Honey, Honey_, _Dancing Queen_ and the iconic titular song _Mamma Mia_ this movie soundtrack is responsible for making ABBA's music hit the charts again. Albeit some bad singing (cough)Pierce Brosnan(cough) the soundtrack is wonderful. The movie has some references to other films including _Dirty Dancing_ and _Grease._ Meryl Streep's performance of Donna Sheridan is an amazing example of her versatility especially when she sings the love ballad ""The Winner Takes It All."" ""S.O.S"" is an interesting scene Brosnan's voice is flat but judging by his body language he is enjoying himself.

If you ignore the bad singing, you will be able to enjoy this film. I highly recommend it and the soundtrack. However, due to royalties and disagreements with UNICEF UMG and Decca Records could not secure the rights to the song _Chiquitita_ which explains why it is not on the CD.

If you have not seen this movie, then what are you waiting for?! Stream it or buy it and do it before July 20 because that is when it's highly anticipated sequel hits theaters!

13022.0,Rogue,"When a group of tourists stumble into the remote Australian river territory of an enormous crocodile, the deadly creature traps them on a tiny mud island with the tide quickly rising and darkness descending. As the hungry predator closes in, they must fight for survival against all odds.",How fast can you swim?,"Action, Horror, Thriller",99.0,2007-11-08,en,6.345,713.0,2.8806,"Radha Mitchell, Michael Vartan, Sam Worthington, Caroline Brazier, Stephen Curry",Greg McLean,"crocodile, tourist, animal attack, based on true story, wildlife, travel, creature, survival horror, outback, crocodile attack, man against nature, animal horror","Never smile at a crocodile. Don't be taken in by his welcome grin.

Rogue is co-produced, written and directed by Greg Mclean (Wolf Creek). It stars Michael Vartan, Radha Mitchell, Sam Worthington & John Jarratt. The film is inspired by the true story of ""Sweetheart"", a giant Australian crocodile that terrorised boats in a 5 year period between 1974 & 1979. Plot sees travel journalist Pete McKell (Vartan) in the Northern Territory of Australia finishing off his latest feature. With time to kill he joins a river boat cruise led by spunky local lass Kate Ryan (Mitchell). So along with assorted other tourists, they set off up river. Where after a tricky encounter with a couple of local nuisances, one of the tourists spies a distress flare further up stream, then another, and another. As captain of the boat, Kate is duty bound to respond to aid anyone who may be in distress on the waters. However, this means straying into ""sacred waters"" and before they know it, they are in the middle of the hunting ground of a gigantic crocodile - who promptly attacks the boat and forces the group onto the nearest mini island, an island that is in tidal waters and the tide is coming in...

Upon viewing Rouge it would seem that it may be one of the most unfortunate horror releases of the time. It barely got a theatrical release outside of its own country (practically one week in selected cinemas in America & Europe), and it came out at a time when killer-croc movies were appearing almost every other month; Primeval, Black Water and Lake Placid 2 (good grief) all ""surfaced"" (hrr hrr hrr) during 2007 to take a ""chomp"" (ok I'll stop now) of the movie watching public. This following on from the sub-genre of aquatic reptile horror movies already being well served by Steve Miner's Lake Placid (1999) & Lewis Teague's Alligator (1980), both of which have huge fan bases. It's all relevant because Rogue happens to be the best of the bunch, a snappy (sorry, couldn't resist), scary, fun and slickly produced Aussie movie. It's sickening that reams of sub-standard horror remakes get wide distribution whilst something like this, that deserves the chance at least, can't. The Weinstein Bothers should be ashamed of themselves for the treatment of Mclean's film.

Straight away we should make clear that, as its certification suggests, Rouge is not particularly bloody. Those in need of sequence after sequence of a crocodile tearing humans limb from limb need not seek this film out. While it is in no way able to live with Lake Placid in terms of being ""intentionally"" humorous, thus comedy seekers should approach with caution, what Rogue does offer is a movie that's tightly structured and paced to precision. Packed with suspense, Mclean affords the characters some time to actually impact on the story. The first half hour is technically sublime, as we get to know the various folk on board the boat, we are treated to gorgeous cinematography from Will Gibson (location the estuaries of the Northern Territory), accompanied by one of the most pleasingly orchestral scores ever laid down for a creature feature (François Tetaz - with the nods to Jaws being just fine). All of this of course serves to offer up the calm before the inevitable storm, from where Mclean then follows the marker set by Jaws by not giving us full sight of the croc. It's the ultimate tease until the attacks start, but even then its mostly teasing suggestion, so the tension mounts as we couple it with our own imagination.

What unfolds from here is a series of set pieces as our stranded group try to avoid becoming crocodile lunch. Here normally a film of this ilk shows dumb people doing dumb things, but Mclean shows respect to the genre and its fans by having some of these folk do silly yet understandable things, thus the scares are elicited by way of believable reactions. And of course the situation brings out the best and worst from most of them since peril has a funny way of doing this to a human being. Also of note here is that Mclean doesn't make the croc a monster, this is merely a hungry animal protecting its territory. A quick piece of dialogue earlier in the story had pointed to hunters possibly being the ones who fired the distress flares, as croc goes about his snarly way, it doesn't hurt to remember this pertinent fact. The cast all give credible performances, notably the handsome hero in waiting Vartan, Mitchell (who was becoming something of a screen queen darling back then) & Jarratt, who shows us a different string to his acting bow than the one he played as loony Mick Taylor in Wolf Creek.

The movie has flaws, but they are few and far between. The croc on appearance will irk some people, so it's true that Mclean could have done better there, while one ""WTF"" turn of events loses impact as the director isn't as bold to follow through like he did in Wolf Creek, but they are forgivable irks. For as we find ourselves holding our breaths during the creepy and practically silent finale, that culminates in a fine ""B"" movie bit of outrageousness, we realise that above all else it's been the suspense and ominous foreboding that made this one damn effective thriller. Mclean appeared to be holding a grudge against his native country, his first two films back then were hardly enticing the tourists to explore the gorgeous lands of Australia! What ever his means or motivation, long may it continue if he keeps producing films like this. Lets hope that his future projects are not as ignored as this one was, because for sure there is a very good director here and it would be tragic should a talent be burned by how his movie was handled.

But really, it's a childhood classic that you love first because it is wonderful and touching, then later because it's nostalgic, and then later because it is a generational tradition.

In other words it stands the test of time like the Godfather and so many other pure classics."

When I was little there was a made-for-TV movie that looked like it was intended to start a series that never happened and all the kids on the block ate it up.

Unfortunately the made-for-TV movie was better.

This version suffers from the same failure that Beowulf did....it was just too much.

They toned it down a bit with the 3D, there were scenes that gave the viewer a break, albeit a short break.

The problem is that once the action hit, once the story started to move along the 3D was too much and too constant.

I remember vividly when they first arrived in Iceland....and that's about it.

Afterwards I just remember all the 3D being too much and too CGI and in the end, I forgot I was watching a movie. They bombarded the audience with too much and, yes, it looked cool, but does that even matter when, in the end, you are too distracted to remember you paid for a movie, and somewhere in there, there was a story with actors actually acting it out...but they were well hidden beneath the 3D effects and you really didn't get to see them.

Thank God movies learned how to tone it down and find a happy medium since. || What an ugly looking movie! It's all watchable, mind you.

Even for 2008, the special effects of <em>'Journey to the Center of the Earth'</em> are quite bad, they are more reminiscent of early 00s video game graphics. That whole initial sequence looks awful, admittedly the effects aren't actually as bad as that opening suggests but still looks unbefitting of a flick with a reported $60m budget!

What saves this film is that the adventure plot itself is solid and the cast do admirable jobs. Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem are a trio that made it work for me. I haven't got much more to say about this one, it is visually woeful but as a picture overall it didn't drag or anything for me personally so I narrowly view it positively.

Now to see what the sequel had to offer!"

A couple doing missionary work in China (Woody Harrelson & Emily Mortimer) takes the Trans-Siberian train from Beijing to Moscow, but their involvement with a dubious couple (Eduardo Noriega & Kate Mara) gets them entangled with a no-nonsense narcotics detective (Ben Kingsley).

A relative told me a story of his travels in Russia back when it was part of the USSR: He said the deeper he journeyed into the country the more it seemed like he was going back in time. At one point he happened to turn around in some kind of an installation and immediately got stopped by authorities and apprehended. He was taken to the proverbial dark room with a hanging light where he was interrogated for a couple hours. I asked what he thought was going to happen and he said he feared getting taken to a gulag in Siberia.

I bring this up because you’ll see these kinds of elements in ""Transsiberian"" (2008), a crime drama/suspense/thriller that has the tone & themes of “A Simple Plan” (1998), but mixed with a little “Runaway Train” (1985) and “Dr. Zhivago” (1965). While I still prefer “Runaway Train” I have no problem listing “Transsiberian” with these notable films, despite the fact that it’s an obscure flick that bombed at the box office (no doubt because it wasn’t released properly and didn’t reach enough theaters). 

“Transsiberian” works so well because it has the confidence to take its time and establish the characters, which are nicely fleshed-out. Roy (Harrelson), for instance, is an affable Christian who seems oblivious to the evil in the world and assumes the best in everybody. His wife, Jessie (Mortimer), by contrast, has a dark history, but was obviously attracted to Roy’s innocence. She sees her former-self in Abby (Mara), which links them. Meanwhile Carlos (Noriega) is the worldly bad boy who’s an expert at wooing women.

But this is just the set-up, the movie takes a thrilling turn in the last act, but it’s superior to the similar Hollywood turn in “A Simple Plan,” which I found unconvincing and a little eye-rolling.  

The film runs 1 hour and 51 minutes and was shot in Lithuania, Russian and China.

Watchmen is directed by Zack Snyder and adapted to screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse from the Alan Moore/David Gibbons graphic novel. It stars Patrick Wilson, Malin Ackerman, Billy Crudup, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Carla Gugino and Matt Frewer. Music is by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Larry Fong.

1985 and someone is killing all our superheroes. Time for the remaining super heroes to band together - but what they find as they fight the good fight is potential annihilation for everyone.

It was quite a battle getting Watchmen onto the screen, over twenty years of legal wrangling and controversies, it got to the point where fans of the source material doubted it would ever happen - and even if it did it was sure to be a monstrous failure. How pleasing to find that not only did it make it to the screen, but it is also a genre bending winner - well to some of us of course...

One has to take into context just how potent and original the graphic novel was back in 1986/7, we are dealing with very mature themes, superheroes with serious psychological baggage. Alan Moore lit the touch paper in the comic book kingdom that the rest have since followed to keep the torch burning well into the new millennium. Snyder has achieved top line results in getting both the feel and look of the source, even if some of Moore's cunning cynicism has been lost in translation.

Story is set right in the middle of nuclear paranoia and the fear of the Soviets in 85, the America we view is dank and depressing, noirish in vibe (aided by Rorschach's clobber and detective inclinations), it's a world on the road to nowhere. We are also at a time in the alternate world where superheroes are banned from operating, forcing The Watchmen to become vigilantes - that is if they can get along and shunt their psycho discord to one side. The back stories of the main protagonists are fully formed, and these are not jolly characters, so much so you worry the fate of mankind is doomed if these are who we rely on to save us.

There was in no way that Snyder would be able to produce a comic book filmic adaptation that would be as worshipped in that sphere, to rival that of the worship the novel has in its own. However, coming at it as someone who only sought out the source material after seeing the film, it shines bright for newcomers who are ironically seeking darker tints in superhero tales. Oh it has the requisite nifty twists (a clinical mystery to be unearthed), booming visuals, excellent effects work and smartly constructed action set-pieces, but narratively it's moody and calls for the utmost attention on dialogue passages (I have found it gets better on repeat viewings).

Snyder clearly cared about the project and that love is evident in the movie. It was never going to appease all and sundry, but at worst to hardcore Moore fans it's at least an honourable failure, to many others it's a smart and stylishly refreshing genre booster. 8/10 || If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

First of all, this review is based on the theatrical version of Watchmen. Usually, Director's Cuts or Ultimate Editions are not preferred over the original release. Few films benefit from them, and most are simply an extended cut with a bunch of deleted scenes. It's only fair and rational that a reviewer watches the version which the whole world saw at the theaters at the respective time. With that said, despite knowing the story of the source material, I never indeed read it. Having in mind that most of the ""hate"" that this Zack Snyder's movie received is from comic-book purists (basically, every book/comic/game/whatever-lover who defends that any cinematic adaptations of any of these sources MUST be 100% the same, with no modifications whatsoever), I'm certain an unbiased perspective is the way to go.

And overall, this is a good feature. Watchmen isn't just another CBM (comic-book movie). It doesn't just follow one hero vs. one villain. It's a whole world (in today's standards, it's really a cinematic universe) of ""superheroes"" meant to be explored in fine detail (hence the release of a TV show today... reviewing that later). It's an extremely complex world that needs to be thoroughly explained in order to deeply understand how it works, and what's everyone's role in it. This is the film's main problem: it struggles to juggle all of its different storylines and distinct characters. Even with 163min of runtime, it's impossible to squeeze in all of the necessary information.

So, as expected, Snyder and his team of screenwriters had to simplify, shorten, or even wholly dismiss some story elements that would only stretch the runtime to an unfathomable length. Some of the adaptations work brilliantly, but some fail to give a character its importance or offer no interest to a subplot. However, it's still easy to understand everything, and how the ending is going to unravel, which leads me to my second issue with the movie: its final act's heavy exposition.

Like I wrote above, there is a lot of information to deliver. What Snyder did very well was to tell most of it through flashbacks or captivating conversations, but in the final act, where everything was self-explanatory and in no need of more exposition, there is an excess of redundant dialogue that doesn't really add anything relevant. What the characters are saying is significant, yes, but we, as the audience, already know all of that way before the film's climax. It's ironic how they make a joke about villains telling their masterplan to the hero and how this villain isn't dumb enough to do it, but then proceed to carefully explain everything (that we know already) through exposition.

Sincerely, these are the major problems that I have with the movie. However, I love so much about everything else. From the appropriated and fun soundtracks to the beautiful production design, Zack Snyder and his crew really do a fantastic work technically. Snyder's style captures Watchmen's world perfectly. It's one of those films that carry a ""feel"" due to its stylish cinematography. I love how little CGI is actually applied (I'm obviously ignoring the big blue guy), and the abundance of practical effects and real sets that are used. The action sequences look spectacular, way better than a lot of blockbusters nowadays (10 years later!).

Despite the terrific technical achievements, my main compliment is actually connected to my number one problem. Even though the storylines are incredibly hard to balance, characters like Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) have extraordinarily captivating and entertaining stories. There might be a few missteps here and there, but Snyder made ONE movie from a material that's worth a whole TV show or at least two films. And he delivered a GOOD one! Probably a better job than 80% of the directors working today could ever achieve. Finally, the social commentary is still quite relevant for this new generation, and if the so-called ""source-material-purists"" didn't exist, this movie would be a lot more appreciated.

All in all, Watchmen is as good as it could be, having in mind it's just one film with already a long runtime. Its narrative was always going to be extremely difficult to tell in a solid yet compelling manner, and Zack Snyder does struggle with balancing all of the storylines and its characters. However, he and his phenomenal team still delivered a good flick. Technically sublime, with a distinct style, brilliant production design, and gorgeous cinematography. Characters like Rorschach and Nite Owl have amazing moments, filled with excellent action sequences, but also with emotionally powerful scenes. If it could be better? Maybe. If it could be split into two or three movies. As it stands, as one and only film, it's really impressive even with its flaws.

Rating: B || As humans, we are drawn to what inspires us, interests us, and tickles our fancy. Human opinion can be a fickle thing, especially when it comes to film, books, and music, due to this the message that is interwoven through these mediums are missed by all of us simply because we won't take the time to watch, read or listen to what is being said to us.

The message throughout Watchman and Tales of The Black Freighter in film and more importantly in graphic novel form is that we as humans try so hard to make the world a better place, but being pushed so far while trying to rid the world of evil we become the very thing we're fighting against, sometimes this a fact we do not see, or we do when it's too late. When Alan Moore wrote the story for the graphic novel, he did so at the height of this planet's greatest threat of nuclear annihilation; The Cold War, The U.S. and Russia at a stalemate over nuclear arms, and Russia's invasion of Afghanistan, had meant that at any moment millions of people on this planet could have met a brutal end.

As far as the story goes, this is a concept that has been warped, and manipulated into a alternate universe where in 1985 Richard Nixon has changed the constitution of the USA and made it allowable for him to serve more than 2 terms of Presidency, it's also a universe where in the times after WWII ordinary citizens decided that crime and corruption throughout America, and especially New York had gotten to levels beyond the control of authorities that they would suit up as masked vigilantes, and fight crime head on. By 1985 masked heroes are outlawed, and former ""heroes"" were forced to reveal themselves, or stay hidden, but give up their lifestyle.

The story of the most part is told through the eyes of one character Rorschach (Haley) as he investigates the murder of a fellow vigilante, The Comedian (Morgan). Rorschach is the only vigilante who has not given up the lifestyle, and is wanted by the F.B.I. Rorschach tries to re-engage the remaining ""heroes"" to help him find the murderer, and get to the heart of why he was murdered. The other ""heroes"" are Night Owl II (Wilson); an aging recluse who inherited a fortune from his father and used it to engage in vigilante activities, Silk Spectre II (Ackerman); daughter of an original Minutewoman (Cugino), Ozymandias (Goode), a self made millionaire who has modeled himself and his life on Alexander the Great, and Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), the only real superhero due an accident in a atomic chamber in a lab when he was a physicist.

The film follows pretty closely the themes and tone of the book, much more than any comic related movie before it, thanks mostly to the dedication of director Zack Snyder. The look and feel of the film to date it in 1985 was very well handled, and can certainly be called a period piece due to the level of exact detail through-out. Performances are in general pretty well done, and reflect the emotions of the characters in the book, as this is the Ultimate Cut, the extended scenes, plus the interwoven story of the comic book within a comic book; ""Tales of The Black Freighter"" make for a film that is worthy of its 215 minute length. Having said that they leave well and truly enough of the story in the theatrical cut where the message still shines through.

The credits for this film are the best I have ever seen, using the Bob Dylan song ""The Times They Are A-Changing"", and features snapshots of the highs and lows of the Minutemen and Watchmen from the 1940's through to the 1980's against the backdrop of important cultural and political icons and events.

This movie is easily one of my favourites of the modern age of film, because of the well delivered message, and the uncompromised approach to bring the graphic novel to life."

Lots of animated maps of planes going from Paris to New York, lots of talking heads and a few aerials of 1974 New York lose their lustre after ten minutes and though there is a sense of mischief from some of the contributors, it’s largely drowned out by the plotting that has all the complexities of an heist movie but none of the excitement.

43680.0,Heart of a Dog,"""Heart of a Dog"" is a Soviet film adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov’s iconic novella. Set in 1920s Moscow, it tells the satirical and darkly humorous story of a stray dog named Sharik, who is transformed into a human by Professor Preobrazhensky through a daring medical experiment. The resulting man, Poligraf Poligrafovich Sharikov, embodies the social and ideological tensions of early Soviet society. With its sharp critique of class struggle, human nature, and the perils of radical change, the film is celebrated for its faithful adaptation, brilliant performances, and rich allegorical depth.",,"Drama, Comedy, Science Fiction",136.0,1988-11-11,ru,7.877,166.0,1.1067,"Evgeniy Evstigneev, Boris Plotnikov, Vladimir Tolokonnikov, Nina Ruslanova, Olga Melikhova",Vladimir Bortko,"experiment, russian revolution (1917), wonder, animal transformation","The story centers on Professor Filipp Filippovich Preobrazhensky, a brilliant but arrogant surgeon, who believes he can improve humanity through scientific intervention. He performs an experimental operation, transplanting the pituitary gland and testicles of a recently deceased human alcoholic and criminal, Klim Chugunkin, into a stray dog named Sharik.

The experiment is initially a success, as Sharik transforms into a humanoid creature, named Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov. However, Sharikov embodies the worst aspects of his human donor: he is crude, aggressive, and opportunistic. He quickly becomes a disruptive force in Professor Preobrazhensky's life and the surrounding communal apartment.

Sharikov, fueled by his newfound human status and a rudimentary understanding of revolutionary rhetoric, becomes a member of the local housing committee, empowered by the zealous and equally inept Comrade Shvonder. He abuses his position, wreaking havoc and threatening the professor's comfortable lifestyle.

Professor Preobrazhensky, horrified by the monster he has created, realises the catastrophic consequences of his hubris. He ultimately reverses the experiment, transforming Sharikov back into a dog.

The film vividly portrays the chaos and uncertainty of post-revolutionary Russia. The old social order is crumbling, and new, often ill-prepared, individuals are thrust into positions of power. The housing committee and Sharikov's rise symbolize the dangers of unchecked authority and the erosion of traditional values.

Bulgakov's satire exposes the inherent flaws in human nature, regardless of social class or political ideology. Sharikov's transformation reveals the animalistic instincts that can lurk beneath the surface of human behaviour.

The story serves as a cautionary tale against the dangers of attempting to radically transform society through artificial means. The film demonstrates that forcibly altering human nature can have unforeseen and disastrous consequences.

The film suggests that tampering with the natural order can have unintended and destructive results. That you cannot create a ""new man"" by simply changing external factors.

1735.0,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,"Archaeologist Rick O'Connell travels to China, pitting him against an emperor from the 2,000-year-old Han dynasty who's returned from the dead to pursue a quest for world domination. This time, O'Connell enlists the help of his wife and son to quash the so-called 'Dragon Emperor' and his abuse of supernatural power.",A New Evil Awakens.,"Adventure, Action, Fantasy",112.0,2008-07-01,en,5.5,4558.0,5.4085,"Brendan Fraser, Maria Bello, John Hannah, Luke Ford, Isabella Leong Lok-Sze",Rob Cohen,"china, sword, pyramid, mummy, yeti, chinese emperor, tomb, great wall of china, terracotta army, 1940s, 3rd century bc","From dumb fun to... regular dumb.

It's hard to find a point where _Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_ wasn't hampered by itself. Or a point where it makes any sort of logical sense. Unfortunate that is was no good, lending credence to the need of a reboot, which we now have, but wish we didn't.

_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing. Avoid if possible._ || Not the same Mummy twice, nor thrice for that matter.

Well it's been pretty much universally panned has this third Brendan Fraser led instalment of the new age Mummy series. So lets not beat around the bush here, it's not very good, but it's hardly deserving of the 1/10 ratings it has been given by amateur on line reviewers.

The plot (for what it's worth) sees young Alex O'Connell, now amazingly a grown man in a short space of time, unearth evil old Chinese Emperor Han and his accursed Terracotta Army. Naturally some bonehead is going to bring him back from the dead, and naturally the now retired O'Connell's are forced back into their Mummy fighting ways. Can Rick, Evelyn and poor Jonathan save the day? Will Alex prove his credentials as the offspring of such daring-do parents? Will anybody care come the finale? 

Rachael Weisz has (wisely) bailed and into her shoes comes a woeful Maria Bello, with fluctuating accents and zero chemistry with her leading man, Bello has undone the promise shown in World Trade Center & A History Of Violence. Steer clear of action movies dear. Fraser looks bored and can barely muster the energy to deliver the now tired and stilted lines. He admitted once that The Mummy 2 was basically a cheeky remake of the first film, quite what he has to say about this one I await with much interest. John Hannah is merely a bystander and it's probably the easiest money he will ever earn, an utter waste it be. Luke Ford does OK as Alex and Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li (the Emperor) & the beautiful Isabella Leong make do with what the unimaginative script gives them to do.

What saves the film from being a bottom of the barrel feeder is the action quota. Even though the spectre of poor CGI hangs around every corner, the sequences come thick and fast and they at least keep the blood pumping, thus stopping the audience themselves from drifting into a centuries long sleep. There's some good gags too (you will yearn for more of Liam Cunningham), while the choreography for the fights involving the Asian stars is not to be sniffed at. Stephen Sommers left the directors chair for this one, handing over to Rob Cohen, which explains why the film is more concerned with action accelerate over substance. But Sommers, who gave us a genuine genre delight with the first film, has a writing credit and was on production duties for this effort. I trust he now feels saddened by what his franchise has now become. 4/10 || ***High adventure in China, albeit totally overdone***

In 1946 Rick & Evy (Brendan Fraser & Maria Bello) are bored in their middle age in England and so take an assignment to China where they meet Evelyn's brother (John Hannah) and their son (Luke Ford) who has discovered the tomb of a tyrannical ancient emperor (Jet Li). Unfortunately, there’s a secret plot to resurrect the mummified remains of the Emperor and all hell naturally breaks loose. Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong are also on hand.

""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008) is an overblown action/adventure horror/comedy popcorn blockbuster, just like the first two flicks. It's not as good as “The Mummy” (1999), yet it's better than the unabsorbing “The Mummy Returns” (2001). Yes, it's overdone like the second one, but the story is more compelling.

While it's regrettable that Rachel Weisz opted out of this third film in order to be with her one year-old son, Maria Bello is a solid replacement and actually looks better in tight pants (as she's curvier and therefore more physically appealing).

Of course the film’s preposterous in the tradition of the previous two and the Indiana Jones flicks. But let's give credit where credit is due: “Tomb of the Dragon Emperor” bends over backwards to entertain with tombs, priceless artifacts, mummies, Shanghai, the Great Wall, the Himalayas, yetis, Shangri-La, zombies, a three-headed dragon and martial arts.  

If you can get past the absence of Weisz and embrace Bello (which, let’s face it, isn’t that hard to do), this is easily the second best of the trilogy. Interestingly, Roger Ebert maintained that it was the best and he ain't no slouch when it comes to appraising pictures, whatever the genre. Yet my wife zeroed-in on the film’s flaw, which is the same as the previous flick: It tries too hard. It frantically throws in everything but the kitchen sink and is the lesser for it. (Yetis, seriously?)

The movie runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Buckinghamshire, England; Montréal, Québec; and China (Beijing, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Tianmo, Heng Dian, Dongguan & Terracotta Warriors Museum, Xi'an, Shaanxi).

There's precisely no opportunity here, so many of the locals really only subsist from hand to mouth on government handouts. ""Ray"" (Melissa Leo) has two young children; a hapless, gambling, husband and lives in a dilapidated motor home from which they hope to soon escape. The husband does a bunk though, and that leaves her in the lurch and struggling to pay the bills. At this point, serendipity takes a hand in her life with a chance meeting with ""Lila"" (Misty Upham). She's also a single parent who is also struggling to make ends meet. Initially, their meeting does not go well - certainly not for the bloodied ""Ray"" - but their communal needs quickly see them working together to help with some smuggling across the now frozen St. Lawrence River. What are they smuggling? People! That's also adding to the dangers of their illicit operations as the police and immigration authorities know what is going on, and are determined to clamp down. The women have goals in mind to improve their lives, but can their good fortune hold against the cold, the terrain and the authorities relentless pursuit? This is an interestingly bleak character study of families in communities which little hope. These women are trapped in a repetitious cycle that they never have enough money to escape, and here that relentlessness spreads to their offspring - especially the young ""T.J."" (Charlie McDermott) who is ill-equipped emotionally to adopt the role of ""man of the house"" whilst his mother is out trying to raise the cash to keep a leaky roof over their heads. There develops quite a poignant chemistry between the two women as their initial hostility becomes something more akin to an inter-dependency and auteur Courtney Hunt does imbue a sense of the hopelessness but also the aspirations of her well portrayed characters. Maybe not the cheeriest of films, but who'd have ever thought Pakistani folks would be entering the USA via Canada across a river of ice?"

""Cristina"" (Scarlett Johansson) tends to fly more by the seat of he pants - and both have come to the lively and vibrant city of Barcelona for an holiday. Almost immediately then encounter the typically mischievous painter ""Juan Antonio"" (Javier Bardem) who invites them for a weekend at his. Initially this story rather goes as we might expect, but the emergence of his ex-wife ""Maria Elena"" (Penêlope Cruz) and ""Doug"" (Chris Messina) who's the rather nice but dim boyfriend of ""Vicky"" now provides us with all the ingredients for a sexually tense maelstrom set amidst the temperamentally unsound worlds of art, wine and sunshine. I think this is Woody Allen's writing at it's best here. It's funny and poignant whilst at the same time light-hearted enough to allow the actors to develop the characters in a natural and engaging fashion. Bardem is great as the painter but it's Cruz who really shines here. Her portrayal of the highly-strung ""Maria Elena"" is at times embarrassing, then hilarious then - when she has a gun, well that's just downright dangerous (even if she couldn't hit a barn door with a shovel). It's a great looking film using the beautiful city and it's Gaudi architecture as a fitting backdrop for a drama that Christopher Evan Welch narrates (sparingly) in an almost sarcastic fashion. It packs plenty into ninety-odd minutes and is a strong example of an ensemble cast working well together."

My favourite kind is the one I grew up with which is the Looney Tunes cartoons. I can watch them over and over again, and I will always laugh. I also love dark British humour, slapstick, and wait for it.... American.

American humour (especially these days) gets derided, most often due to it being ""dumbed down"" so the collegiate set can understand it, often using toilet humour as its best punchline. I somewhat disagree, I say that the humour people use between themselves is what drives movies made by Judd Apatow & co.

Take Pineapple Express for example, this movie seems on some level to be fairly realistic. I use that term very loosely, because of course many things that happen in this film, could, and should never happen. Anyhow, the comedy, the dialogue, the fight sequences, and other interactions between the characters are the reasons I think make it feel this way.

The fight sequences aren't ones that I could say seem all that choreographed, of course there are ""X"" spots they need to hit, but for the most part I think it is done on the fly, or like much of the comedy, improvised.

Pineapple Express follows the story of a process server Dale Denton (Rogen), & his pot dealer Saul Silver (Franco), as they avoid henchmen (Robinson & Corrigan) of Ted Jones (Cole), Marijuana kingpin of L.A. after Dale witnesses a murder Ted commits. With a corrupt cop on the take (Perez) also on the hunt, staying alive for the buyer & supplier turned stoner buddies becomes an adventure of friendship as well as appreciation of the relationships built by people in this lifestyle.

The name Pineapple Express comes from the name of the variety of weed Saul introduces to Dale.

I enjoy this movie because of the old fashioned approach taken to deliver the laughs and the story, and the characters feel very relatable to almost anyone on some level. || Decent watch, probably won't watch it again, but can recommend.

I'll be upfront, while it's not really for me, I think most people will enjoy this movie, if for nothing else, then the idiot banter.

Franco's a good actor, but sometimes he and Seth put too much of themselves in the movie, and it gets worse when they're together on screen.  This basically looks like they just took what they do hanging out on a Friday sometimes and put it on screen in places, basically anytime the action dies down and they start to lean into the lull.

The first story that gets interrupted by the main plot, could easily have it's own movie, romantic comedy or drama: an older man, legitimately and legally dating a high school girl has a LOT of situations to it, and has amazing potential.  Once it gets interrupted by the ""on the lamb"" trope, I would have honestly thought it would disappear as it would in most movies, or at worst, she would show up looking for him or to get something from his place and get abducted.

The re-return to the original story line is almost funny enough itself in concept, but in actuality I just end up waiting to get back to the movie, and they do things like that throughout the entire movie.

It is conceivable when things are happening to the main characters that derail them, but when they're actively derailing themselves, then it just gets sad.  You start to question things that you shouldn't, and it's not even because they're high, as they directly have a conversation about how the weed is really bad for them, given everything that is happening.

I'm not a fan of drug humor, or abuse humor (usually), and everything that isn't that is so ridiculous that it's hard to like.

There are good jokes woven in here, but a lot of this is ""I wanted to make a movie with my  buddy while we act like idiots"", and as a fan of Kevin Smith, I respect that, but that should put you in the frame of mind that this isn't a top tier movie, and Kevin Smith writes better dialogue."

Also some love for Joan Allen making for a fine villain and never a bad thing with Ian McShane even in a supporting role. Nothing great but pretty much well within Paul W.S. Anderson's wheelhouse. **3.5/5**"

They're so clean.

Mirrors is the American remake of a little known Korean film called Into the Mirror. The plot has Kiefer Sutherland as a recovering alcoholic cop, who whilst on suspension is taken to working as a security guard at a large burnt out department store and starts to see terrifying images in the many mirrors about the place... 

You would think that Mirrors was a flop. The critics hated it and the horror hordes were very much divided on it, the latter of which is to be fair the norm for any big horror movie release. Yet it didn't flop, it did very well at the box offices of the world and has a decent 6.2 average on IMDb, which for a divisive horror film is well above average.

Mirrors overstays its welcome, there really was no need for it to run to just under two hours in length. While elsewhere there's some pretty poor dialogue, parts of the screenplay are pointlessly soap opera in nature, while some thinking will make you scratch your head in bewilderment at events outside of the brilliantly monolithic department store.

However, does Mirrors create a genuinely spooky atmosphere (the interiors of the store are creep fest nirvana), insert some shock moments to jolt you out your seat? Is it visually stylish, with sound work to match? And does Sutherland (and to a degree Paula Patton as his wife) overcome the trite parts of the script and give effective and committed performances? The answer to those questions is yes.

Does the ending cop out in any way? Insult the audience? No! It doesn't do that either.

It has flaws, but they are not insurmountable for the horror fan who's just looking for some good scares, atmospheric dread and some stylish touches from the director (Alexandre Aja). If you haven't seen it then give it a try, judge for yourself, you might be pleasantly surprised at what you find. 7.5/10"

The Pang Brothers remake their 2000 Asian film for the American audience with mixed results. Starring Nic Cage, film follows Cage's hit-man to Bangkok where he is to complete a number of hits. He tells us via narration that he has a set of rules that he follows so as to survive in the ""business"". He then promptly breaks his own codes and his life comes under threat.

That's pretty much it as regards plotting. The Pang's bring much visual style to the picture, and show themselves to be adept at action sequences, but it all feels so familiar. Action movies are rarely going to bring new stuff to the table, they often, as is the case here, are kinetic popcorn pictures missing some emotional depth to marry up with the carnage. Thus this is not a film to be sought out by any action junkies looking for something new to add to their collections. As it happens Cage is fine and broody, managing to blend hard ass machismo with vulnerable traits. He, and the filmic style make it above average, even if ultimately it's instantly forgettable afterwards. 6/10"

Jackson's powerful performance. He plays Abel Turner, a character so commanding and relentless that his presence carries the entire movie. Jackson's ability to make you both fear and understand Abel is what makes this film so gripping. The movie builds its suspense slowly, creating a tense and uneasy atmosphere that keeps you on edge throughout.

The plot tackles some heavy themes, particularly around race and power dynamics, which might feel a bit heavy-handed at times. While the racial aspect of the story may not sit well with everyone, it undeniably fuels the conflict and drives the tension between the characters. The film isn't subtle in how it approaches these themes, but that bluntness works in its favor, keeping the stakes high and the audience engaged.

The third act might divide viewers, but it ties the story together in a way that feels fitting for the characters, especially Abel. While some might argue it leans into thriller clichés, it also delivers closure that matches the relentless nature of the movie's lead. Overall, Lakeview Terrace is a solid watch if you're in the mood for a psychological thriller with strong performances and a story that isn't afraid to be provocative.

Murphy",Ed Harris,"small town, new mexico, ranch, cowboy, far west","We can't have our law officers beatin' people half to death for no reason.

Appaloosa is based on the 2005 novel of the same name written by Robert B. Parker. It's directed by Ed Harris, who also co-writes the story with Robert Knott. Harris also stars alongside Viggo Mortensen, Renée Zellweger, Jeremy Irons & Lance Henriksen. Music is by Jeff Beal and Dean Semler provides cinematography on location in Albuquerque, Austin and Santa Fe.

Appaloosa is in the grip of bully boy rancher Randall Bragg (Irons), who finally oversteps the mark when the latest Marshall and his deputies are killed in cold blood. The townsfolk decide enough is enough and hire no nonsense travelling lawmen Virgil Cole (Harris) and his sidekick Everett Hitch (Mortensen) to protect and serve the town. Ruling with a rod of iron, Cole & Hitch start to bring order to Appaloosa, but the arrival in town of pretty Allie French (Zellweger) causes quite a stir between the two men. Bad timing too since the guys are trying to get Bragg to his rightful execution.

In the modern era the Western has been the hardest genre for film makers to tackle. You can probably count on one hand the number of great or agreeable ones that have surfaced post Costner and Eastwood's efforts of 1990 and 1992 respectively. Enter Ed Harris, who undaunted by the long odds of getting a Western to be successful; and suffering worrying overtures from his backers at New Line Cinema, got Appaloosa made. Well made as it happens.

Since the story itself is etched like the Wyatt Earp legend, there's really no fresh perspective on offer here. In fact, anyone familiar with Edward Dmytryk's excellent Warlock from 1959 will feel some narrative déjà vu. But Appaloosa does have strong performances and lush landscapes to see it successfully home. Slotting in a good helping of action, romance and humour also goes some way to making Harris' movie a worthy modern day Oater. True, the cliche's are many, but Harris wasn't after revisionism, he wanted (and got) old fashioned Oater values. A film that follows those old beloved B movie Western conventions, but one that still retains a topical criminal thread.

The best reward in the film comes from spending time with Harris & Mortensen. Their characters are nicely drawn and not over cooked by the script. Cole & Hitch are devoted to each other, lots of straight love and respect exists between the two men. Their bond is believably brought to life by Harris & Mortensen, who formed a friendship when making A History Of Violence for David Cronenberg in 2005. Zellweger and Irons too are not without high merit value. She (stepping in when Diane Lane walked over delays), is pleasing and captivates in what is the critical glue role. While he is dandy dastardly supreme, a well spoken villain of much intelligence and crafty as a cat.

Appaloosa is a subtle film, both in story and as a technical production. Beal's score is unobtrusive, while Semler's photography manages to deliver that old fashioned feel that Harris was after (the low lighting for the interiors is particularly on the money) . Harris' direction is smooth and unhurried in pace, with the odd inspired bit thrown in for good measure (check out the up-tilt camera work during a train on a bridge sequence). While the production design can't be faulted. All that and you got the likes of Henriksen and Timothy Spall in the support cast too. A lovely film that is as tight as the friendship at its core. 7.5/10"

On the other hand, we have Dennis Hopper as a pimp named El Nino who says things like ""You stole daddy's car keys, but you can't handle the horsepower,"" so it's not a total loss.

We know that the Crow, like the Dude, must face a gang of nihilists; in this case a multi-ethnic gang whose members each identify with one of the Four Horsemen: Luc 'Death' Crash, War (Marcus Chong), Famine (Tito Ortiz), and Pestilence (Yuji Okumoto). 

None of them really do anything thematically tied to their noms de guerre, so I guess they just thought they sounded cool. By the way, in a group of characters with thematic names, sometimes one just doesn't fit the pattern (a trope known as Aerith and Bob); in this case that would be Lola (Reid), Luc's girlfriend.

Luc is the ""leader of a satanic cult"" whose ""motive"" is that his ""father [was] killed by an Indian."" This doesn't make much sense until we discover that Moses (Richard Cumba), the ""Indian"" who murdered Luc's father, is a priest of some religious denomination — Catholic in appearance but that allows its priests to marry and have children, and to which also belongs father Harold (Trejo), whose daughter Lilly (Emmanuelle Chriqui) is the girlfriend of Jimmy Cuervo (Furlong), who is on parole after serving a prison sentence for killing a rapist, who happened to be Moses’s son. It’s a small world, indeed.

War, Famine, Pestilence, and Lola help Luc escape from prison, and the five proceed to ritualistically murder Jimmy and Lilly; the rest, as they say, is history: Jimmy returns from the afterlife to exact revenge on his killers one by one, reserving for them such cruel and unusual punishments as death-by-bug zapper. 

Oddly enough, no one besides Jimmy seems interested in pursuing the escaped convict whose gang leaves a trail of blood wherever they go. Then again, this is a movie that uses the word “Aztec” to refer to a Native American tribe. 

All things considered, I’m tempted to believe that TC: WP's self-parody is intentional; for example, Luc offering his henchmen a banquet consisting of deviled ham, deviled eggs, and devil's cake “al flambeau”. I'm not saying it is to The Crow what Army of Darkness is to The Evil Dead but, incoherent or not, it's the only one apart from the original that’s even close to watchable. || So ridiculous that it's kinda watchable.

<em>'The Crow: Wicked Prayer'</em> is not a good movie. However, it commits so hard to what it wants to do that I was kinda locked on to just see where it would go next. It particularly goes off the rails towards the conclusion, especially with David Boreanaz's Luc. There are many, many issues with this 2005 release, but I honestly didn't hate viewing it.

I think what helps (relatively speaking) is that there are quite a few familiar faces on the cast, which definitely keeps you watching - or it does for me, at least. You have the aforementioned Boreanaz, as well as Tara Reid, Danny Trejo and Dennis Hopper. Emmanuelle Chriqui is in there too. The main face that I didn't know of was actually Edward Furlong, who plays the titular character.

Furlong's performance isn't, like the film in general, anything worth praising. Again though, he proper goes for it so his onscreen presence never annoyed me. Nothing about this really irritated me to be honest, it's just plainly obvious from pretty much the get-go that the flick isn't anything all that good so I guess my expectations were low.

I'd rather rewatch this than <em>'The Crow: City of Angels'</em>, so that's something. Eager to now see how this year's reboot does things."

Jerry and Rachel are two strangers thrust together by a series of scenarios put together by a mysterious female caller.

Intriguingly everything around them seems to be controlled by the female voice that guides them, but just why is the FBI so hot on their tail?, does Jerry's twin brother hold the key?.

Big Brother gets a reboot and delivers as fun a genre picture as was released in 2008. Yes it's total nonsense, but really the critics venting spleen on this one must have gone through a popcorn entertainment bypass prior to viewing it. Director D.J. Caruso continues his Hitckcockian leanings by following his surprisingly fun ""Disturbia"" with this ""North By Northwest"" type concept that meets a host of the genre staples, where the influences are very hard to miss. Yet as daft as it is, and it is folks, ""Eagle Eye"" knits well together to play out as a highly accomplished piece, the action is first rate, in fact on big screens the two main sequences explode with joyous action abandon. This isn't found wanting on the thriller front either, it's safe to say that no new ground is to be found as we get to the tick tock countdown finale, but Caruso, and writers John Glenn & Travis Wright, have spliced together a series of wholly interesting and thrilling strands. So much so that the finale is disappointingly unable to quite deliver on the promise of the prior build up.

Shia LaBeouf seemed destined to be a young actor who had to earn even the smallest bit of respect, where much like DiCaprio at the time, you felt LaBeouf was likely to get better notices later in his career. After being sidekicks to John McLaine, Indiana Jones, and erm, Optimus Prime, LaBeouf here earned his acting spurs and carries the film with a charm and credibility that the daftness of the piece doesn't quite deserve. Shia is helped enormously by a strong female lead, Michelle Monaghan has an impressive ability to sweat strength whilst channelling believable emotional turmoil, and her interplay with LaBeouf is the heartbeat of the picture. Of the rest, Michael Chiklis is a bit underused, but this is offset by Billy Bob Thornton continuing that knack of being one of the most watchable actors of his generation. Rosario Dawson is sadly weak in this and William Sadler is barely noticeable, conversely though a nod of approval goes to Anthony Mackie who shines in a crucial sequence towards the end.

That was a damn shame because ""Eagle Eye"" may well be a dumb and fun action/thriller picture, but it's not pro-porting to be anything else, and really film's with honest entertainment intent are to be treasured and used for why they are made for in the first place. ""Eagle Eye"" is made for those who want to shut off from the world for a couple of hours, and in doing so have an energised blast in the process. 7.5/10 || The most interesting part of the film is dropped not long after the film's act two reveal, and a film that seemed ""not great, but promising"", ended up losing its promise. 

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

This is an interesting mix of science fiction and science fact.  We could absolutely have technology like this and not know it because....why would anyone tell us that they have it?

The craziness of the action with naivety of the characters we follow make for a great spy movie with NO SPYING!  So it hits a personal note of satisfaction for me.

It really feels like all the good ""operator in my ear"" moments from the Matrix, with a good mystery plot thrown in."

Georgiana Cavendish, born Spencer, was one of the most interesting, remarkable and charismatic personalities in British society at the end of the 18th century. She made an enviable marriage, for the period, by marrying the 5th Duke of Devonshire, one of the richest and most powerful British peers. However, they had nothing in common: the duke was a man of few words and saw marriage as a means to an end: to have a legitimate male heir. Georgiana, on the other hand, was not content to be just a decorative figure or a child-bearer. Unhappy, she found herself so lonely that she decided to accept the sexual affair that her husband started with her best friend, Lady Foster, who moves in to their house and has adulterous children with him, in a humiliating ""ménage à trois"" which the Duchess supports in exchange for the friendship of Lady Foster, on whom she becomes emotionally dependent. To this day, the moral attitude of both women is debatable, and also the extent to which Lady Foster didn't seek, from the beginning, to replace Georgiana, whom she envied and befriended in equal measure.

For the rest, we know that the three elements of this love triangle were not faithful, keeping, each one for himself, other affairs and sexual engagements outside this arrangement. When the Duchess became pregnant by one of her lovers, the much younger Charles Gray, she was forced to travel to France, where she gave birth, maintaining for the rest of her life a close but discreet relationship with her adulterous daughter. Upon returning to London, Georgiana changed: by accepting her conjugal situation, she began to look for a series of escapes and distractions that would make her existence bearable: her presence at parties and balls made her a fashion icon, and her support for the Whig Party influenced the course of British politics at the time. The hapless Georgiana developed a ruinous gambling addiction, perhaps depression and even an eating disorder, factors that greatly contributed to her rapid decline in health. She died early, with many debts, many admirers and some literary works published.

All this is the short story of this intriguing historical figure. The film, directed by Saul Dibb and starring Keira Knightley, takes a very light approach to her life, and sometimes fails to be faithful to historical facts (warning), even though it delights us visually. In fact, the production values are high, and the highlight is clearly the detailed and well-made costumes, and the sets, many of them handpicked from the most luxurious palatial interiors, capable of instantly transporting us to the time. And context. Also, the cinematography and filming work were well done, as well as the soundtrack, signed by Rachel Portman, is very good, making good use of various pieces of baroque music. The biggest negative criticism I feel I have to make is the editing work, which makes us waste a lot of time on minor details, causing the film to take on an uneven pace. The sense of time passing was not done properly either: we never quite understand the passage of years, since the characters don't age and nothing changes.

As for the cast, I think it's fair to congratulate Keira Knightley's work. The actress already has a long history of period films and seems to have developed a certain predilection for this type of dramatic work, so I felt quite comfortable with the role and the character. The way she played opposite and related to Ralph Fiennes is very good, and the actor is excellent in the way he assumes the reserved, distant and sometimes rude ways of the duke, whom she makes an unpleasant and morally controversial figure. Hayley Atwell was also very good in the role of Lady Foster, although she was not able to give the character the moral nuances and ambiguity that the historical character deserved to have. The film also has good minor appearances from Charlotte Rampling and Simon McBurney. Dominic Cooper did what he could in the role of Charles Gray, but I couldn't help but think the actor was too old for the character, who was several years younger than the Duchess. || In theory, a more sophisticated period drama based on the true story of Georgiana (Keira Knightley), an aristocrat married off to a loveless marriage with the enormously wealthy and politically influential Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes). She is treated little better than a brood mare in fancy dress but has way to much independent spirit to settle for that and is soon having an affaire de coeur with Dominic Cooper ""Earl Grey"" (yes, he of the tea...). Meantime, the Duke has taken a mistress and so the film depicts how our multiple ménages-à-trois work out. It very much emphasises the (very) limited choices of women in 18th Century Britain - regardless of their status - but unfortunately, save for a few brief appearances by Charlotte Rampling - the characterisations were way too sterile for me. It is a great looking costume drama, though - some of the finest stately homes shown off to their best effect but in the end it was much more style than substance."

On the one hand I was really impressed with the acting (most notably from Anne Hathaway), on the other I just couldn't get myself to care. But that's really the director's doing; after all, it's his job to get me involved and to make me care about the story he's telling, and unfortunately, Jonathan Demme failed to do so with this film.

Something that throws you off right from the start is the incredibly shaky hand-held camera. There isn't a steady shot throughout the entire film. It actually gave me a headache during the first five minutes. This, in combination with the lack of proper story- and character build-up makes you feel like you're watching a home video of some stranger's wedding. And it's not particularly interesting… Strangely enough, during some parts of the film I felt like I was watching a Louis Theroux documentary, because that's exactly the way it was filmed. I expected a gangly Englishman with dark glasses to walk in at any moment and start asking questions. Actually, that might have done this film a world of good… Scenes go on way too long without there being a clear point to it, and I just have to wonder why Demme decided to go this way. I mean, he has made some really good films in the past, and I was strangely surprised to see he directed this. It looks and feels more a graduation project from some film student, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is when your name is Jonathan Demme. I even fast-forwarded some parts because the scenes were really dragging and I got bored. I actually felt like turning it off a few times, and that doesn't happen to me lot.

In the end though, I'm glad I stuck with it, because the second half of the film picks up the pace and finally introduces some real character drama.

Simply put, this film is about a drug addict who gets leave from rehab for a few days to attend her sister's wedding and pretty much ruins the whole thing. Anne Hathaway is very impressive as Kym, a self-centred, reckless addict, and she plays her role convincingly. So much so even, that she manages to make you feel NOT sympathetic towards her character at all. She is completely self-absorbed and unlikable, and even steals her sister Rachel's thunder when she (Rachel) announces to her family that she is pregnant, and Kym immediately turns the conversation around and makes it all about her again, and does so on many more occasions. I know that many people who are related to drug addicts will be able to relate to these typical symptoms, so in that sense, it was all very real. On her part, Rosemarie DeWitt, who plays Rachel, was equally impressive as she firmly stood her ground as the loyalty-torn older sister who only asks to be in the spotlight for one day of her life, without her troubled sister claiming all the attention. However, the part that mostly struck a nerve with me was that of their dad, played by Bill Irwin, who is, more than anyone, caught in loyalty limbo, not wanting to have to choose sides between his two daughters. He doesn't overact his inner conflict in any way, yet he garners more sympathy than anyone, because he makes his pain so understandable.

In fact, everything about Rachel getting married is all very human and relatable. The story (written by Jenny Lumet, daughter of Sidney!) is not one any of us have never heard before, but that's alright. We don't always need super complicated psycho-analysis with characters talking like they all studied Freud for the past twenty years. Sometimes, simple stories about human troubles are enough to carry a film. It may be somewhat predictable, with a quasi-happy ending, but it's still credible enough to leave you satisfied.

And yet, I don't feel this film deserves much more than a 6, maybe a 7. And the fault of this lies entirely with the direction. The shaky home video style I mentioned earlier might work for The Blair Witch project, but not for a slow-paced character drama. And the pacing was just horrible. Some scenes were completely unnecessary and could have easily been cut down or even left out completely and nobody would have noticed. In fact, that would have helped a lot. It's really a shame, because the story is decent and the acting is great, but this is not a great film and it never will be. I do think it's worth the watch, especially if you want to see Anne Hathaway in what is probably a career-defining role. But from the man who made Philadelphia, this is a bitter disappointment.

I still don't know how to feel about this, and it's been a decade since I first watched it.

And then there is the bias that will certainly seep through. I really hate the DNC in 2018...but in the '00's and still today, well, W. was to me what Nixon was to Hunter S. Thompson. There is literally no president I like less than W. So excuse the bias that may pop up here, I try to keep politics out of these in this insanely political age.

So, on one hand (and I have been ripping into Stone lately) this is a SOLID Oliver Stone film. Unlike Snowden and World Trade Center, it actually has what you expect from an Oliver Stone film. And I can't not like that.

Agree with Stone's politics or not...you go to see an Oliver Stone film because he can leave his mark on it...and this has that mark.

So you can sit down and watch it and have that clear ""I'm watching an Oliver Stone movie"" feeling, and that is always enjoyable when you can do that.

But then, it's been a decade since its release and that kind of mutes it. When it came out in 2008, W was still in office and just going to see it made you proud to be an American. Hardly any other country would allow someone to release a film critical of the CURRENT leader while he was still in office. It gave you a great ""this is what makes America great"" feeling, ""this is what puts us above the rest of the world. Thank you Oliver Stone.""

But, it's been a decade, so you don't get that feeling from watching it now. You don't feel compelled to buy your ticket, and then go back and see it again to celebrate the 1st Amendment.

And because of that, a decade later, it kind of makes you feel that it should have been released now instead of then.

A decade later you remember the people that were celebrating in the streets when he was finally out. You remember that sense of relief that NOT Bush was in office. You remember the Obama victory...you remember the St. Paul horror, and the sense that the DNC could have run a rotting corpse and won.

And then, after you remember all of that, you get the feeling that it would have made a better ending if Stone just waited a year to make the film.

But despite all of that, it was a fair film. It was balanced (unlike this review) and that's probably because of what my late father used to say, he hated W. as a president, but felt he'd like him as a person. Which, unfortunately, is an attitude you're regrettably not allowed to have today.

But that doesn't change the fact that you still feel like you are watching an Oliver Stone movie. It doesn't change the feeling of pride you got by going to see W. in the theaters when it was released. It doesn't change the fact that it is still a good movie...even if it's a better movie for the people that are old enough to remember it. || ""W."" is a film that delves into the presidency of George W. Bush, showcasing the historical significance of every individual who holds the highest office in the United States. The movie suggests that every president deserves a biography that captures their time in office, regardless of their successes or failures.

Josh Brolin delivers a standout performance as George W. Bush, despite initial skepticism about his casting in the role. He effectively embodies the essence of Bush, portraying him as a somewhat goofy and party-loving figure who may not have taken his political responsibilities seriously at first.

The film sheds light on Bush's journey to the presidency, depicting his struggles and personal growth leading up to the events before 9/11. It offers a captivating insight into Bush's term in office, particularly his decisions regarding going to war during his first term. Overall, ""W."" is a film that exceeds expectations and is worth watching for its portrayal of a complex political figure."

Trying to analytically determine whether events in the film 'really happened' or not, or taking anything in this film as a literal matter of reality, is completely and utterly fruitless, and I believe goes completely against what the movie stands for. The film is intentionally crafted to defy such an undeviating analysis. It all happened, within a film! It is very much about why we make anything, why our individuality is significant. What do we hope to accomplish by creating or feeling something? How can you make anything about life if you are at that very moment?

It's a feedback loop: everything is a synecdoche; part of a greater whole.

The reality of the film is fictional because the film is aware that itself is fiction. It suggests that in some sense, every work ever made, no matter how true to life, is inescapably fiction, and that fiction is in some ways even more true to life than reality itself. We all live in our own fictional worlds, and when we task others to create or give emotion to our world, it can create a mirrored chamber of tunnel vision, a feedback loop. Caden gets lost in the mirror chamber, and the entire being of the film itself is an extension of that mirror. A masterclass of existential meta-cinema. 

There are so many different subplots and aspects of this film that I could literally write a master’s thesis on it, but instead, I rather just chose to focus on the things most impactful to me in this little writeup. I could go on and on overanalyzing everything, but I think that would be counterintuitive towards the movie. This absolute masterpiece sparked lots of laughing, crying, and every emotion in between. It does what it is designed to do, force you into a metaphysical existential crisis. This is truly one of the most uniquely special films ever made, impactful in every single manner. One of the most principally powerful and important pieces of art EVER, I found myself sobbing even at parts that I didn’t even know what was going on. As the credits rolled I cried harder than I have in months, films like this are the reason I believe cinema to be the inherent soul of all artistic mediums, and the reason I find beauty in this chaotic existence. This film is going straight to my top 5 without a single fucking question or doubt in my mind. 

Rest in peace, PSH. Your work continues to greatly impact millions of people, even after death. You are dearly cherished and missed. 

And thank you Charlie Kaufman, for completely transcending the medium, and creating one of the single most important films in the history of cinema."

However, there is always a bigger fish in the pond looking to eat the smaller fish. In this movie, lowly criminals meets councillors, junkies, dead musicians, dirty accountants, nasty crime bosses and filthy rich russians. Sounds like another movie by Guy Ritchie, more or less, and it does indeed follow the same rhythm (and theme) as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

The movie opens with the narrator, Archy, who breaks down the plot for us in tiny, easy-to-digest bits, and thats definitely my least favorite bit in the movie, but sadly, needed. This plot is a twisted labyrinth, that constantly shifts from one person to the next. There are no real heroes here, just fish eaten by sharks, hunted by humans, killed by... you get the point.

RocknRolla has a huge cast, and some big names too. In smaller roles, you'll see names such as Tom Hardy (Handsome Bob), Jeremy Piven (Roman), Thandie Newton (Stella) and Idris Elba (Mumbles), and in the bigger, you find names like Gerard Butler (One Two), Mark Strong (Archy) and Tom Wilkinson (Lenny Cole). Most of them delivers quirky and fun characters, and some of them even gives us a bit to think about, like Tom Hardy's role, Handsome Bob, who is coming to terms with being gay.

The movie is fast-paced to begin with, but slows down a bit later on. It has the obligatory violent Guy Ritchie scenes that reminds us of the early movies of Quentin Tarantino, but in the end, it is all a bit hollow. This is a movie about greed, about screwing over those with money, or even, those without.

_Last words... looking for a bit of solid entertainment, a good plot (not too easy to get your head around, but not too hard to loose you either) and some nice solid actors (and actresses), this is definitely the movie you are looking for._ || I really enjoyed this. A great ensemble cast delivering a gangster thriller that pokes it's tongue out at just about everything/body whilst still retaining enough menace to keep it engaging. As ever with Ritchie films, it does run a bit to dialogue - and this one has an, at times, irritating narrative. Tom Wilkinson (""Lenny"") is quite good as the mob boss who facilitates - and takes a cut from - most big property transactions in London; and he makes a good living from it. A Russian oligarch arrives on the scene and engages Lenny, and his slimy but ruthless sidekick ""Archy"" (Mark Strong) to help his with a fairly mammoth development. At this stage it all starts to go a bit pear shaped and we slowly become aware that there is much more afoot. There are several fun subplots with Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy and Thandie Newton all having some skin in at least part of the game; and Toby Kebbell is cracking as his dead-loss, rockstar, coke-head son ""Johnny Quid"". The writing is taut and humorous, and the violence much more ""fantasy"" and implied - even kinky, on occasion, than gory. The whole thing is a thoroughly entertaining piece of cinema - complete with killer lobsters and the smallest of cameos from Hugh Grant!"

<em>'Changeling'</em> is a cracking release from 2008. Angelina Jolie gives a superb performance in the lead role, in a plot that is rather harrowing whilst also being actually incredibly infuriating - as in, the film does a great job at making the antagonists the antagonists.

The cast, spearheaded by Jolie, are excellent. No-one is on her level per se, but there are very good performances from the likes of John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan and Geoff Pierson; kid actor Eddie Alderson also impresses.

I will say that the story wraps up in a quicker manner than I thought it would, though the pacing of the 142 minute run time is in fact one of its positives - even at that length, I feel it could've drawn out the court trial stuff longer; though that may have hindered the pacing, so it's not really a noteworthy criticism of mine at all.

One worth recommending, no doubt!"

The Road is directed by John Hillcoat (The Proposition) and written by Joe Penhall (Enduring Love). Based on the 2006 novel of the same name by American author Cormac McCarthy (No Country For Old Men), the film stars Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee as a father and his son trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.

How do you sell such a sombre piece to the film loving public? I'm not sure I personally can, such is the whirly like emotions dominating my thoughts. OK, it's a grim and bleak film, of that there's no doubt. Director Hillcoat is not out to make a thrilling end of the world actioner. Staying faithful to McCarthy's novel, this is now a world where animal & plant life is practically extinct, where this particular part of America is lawless and populated by cannibal types. Humanity has long since left the arena. How we arrived at such desolation is not clear - intentionally so. We are now just witnessing the after effects of something world changing, the fall out personally involving us as we hit the road with man & boy.

Hillcoat and his cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe have painted a clinically dead world from which to tell the story. Scorched soil is home to threadbare trees, the skyline punctured by the wreckage of man's progress passed, storms come and go as if to taunt the characters. It's a living hell that begs the question on why would anyone want to survive in it? So here's the thing that finally hit me like a sledgehammer some five days after watching the film, it's not just the bleakness of the apocalypse that gnaws away at you, it's also the expertly portrayed study of parenting. So emotively played by Mortensen, with Smit-McPhee essaying incredible vulnerability, it sinks the heart the longer the movie goes on. All of which is leading up to the ending, where we get something absorbing, revealing and utterly smart.

Tough viewing for sure, but compelling and thought provoking throughout. 8/10 || _**Grey, maudlin post-apocalyptic drama with some horrific thrills**_

After a mass extinction event, a man & his son (Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee) walk from western Pennsylvania to the Southeast coast trying to survive a life-or-death situation in a world without laws as people prey on each other. Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce and Molly Parker show up for small parts.

Based on Cormac McCarthy’s final novel, ""The Road"" (2009) is similar to “Carriers,” released almost three months earlier. Unlike semi-goofy post-apocalyptic films like the original Mad Max trilogy, ""The Road"" and ""Carriers"" are deadly serious from beginning to end with no comic book nonsense. This works in their favor because both films give us a window into what life would be like after a worldwide crisis destroys conventional society.

Each film explores one's reaction to such a world-ending disaster: Do we forsake all sense of morality in an attempt to survive – lie, steal, forsake and murder – or do we hold on to our moral compass, come what may? Is life worth living if you must become an immoral, wicked savage to survive? Isn't it better to live with dignity at all costs – fight with nobility and die with dignity when and if we must?  

Some denounce both flicks on the grounds that they’re too downbeat and depressing, but wouldn't a lawless world be a very dire situation? In other words, the downbeat vibe reflects the reality of the story.

However, “Carriers” is the superior of the two by far. “The Road” is tediously one-dimensional and unrelentingly somber. Plus the dynamics of the father & son are boring with the annoying boy almost singlehandedly ruining the movie. They needed to find a girl or a woman to shake things up – anything to dispel the grey monotony. 

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot mostly in western Pennsylvania & West Virginia (the towering bridge), plus Oregon and Spirit Lake near Mount St. Helens, Washington (the log-jammed lake).

It's not an unreasonable allegation - this lad comes from a background that suggests little, if any, education and yet he is answering some tough questions that, theoretically, he should not know the answers too. It's during this (actually quite brutal) interrogation, which is interspersed with flashback and with each round of the television quiz, that we discover a little of the childhood and upbringing of this young man and about how he has amassed the knowledge to, legitimately, get the answers correct. It's a story about humanity and decency, this - and the ensemble cast, especially the street urchins, help to deliver an authentic glimpse at not just the poverty in which they lived, but of their sense of community and loyalty to each other as they grew up together. Now there's no point in pretending that the writing is great - it isn't. It's doesn't really allow for any in-depth character development. Somehow, though, Patel's sheer screen presence and optimism, coupled with the overall style of the film cover up for that more than adequately leaving us with a solidly entertaining, occasionally thought-provoking, rags-to-riches story that I suspect many people can readily identify with. It's a bit too long, and maybe the romantic elements could have been ditched, but all told it's still well worth watching. || Slumdog Millionaire is one of those movies that really sticks with you. It follows Jamal, a kid from the slums of Mumbai. Watching him go through so much and still come out with hope makes it pretty powerful.

The movie does a great job showing the reality of life for kids in poverty but doesn’t feel like it’s trying to preach. Director Danny Boyle keeps things moving with a fast pace, and the mix of tension, humor, and drama keeps you hooked. The visuals are great too, showing all sides of Mumbai, from the city to the harshness of life in the slums.

Overall, Slumdog Millionaire is a must-watch. It’s raw, emotional, and, at the end of the day, it’s a story about resilience and hope. Perfect for when you want a movie that hits hard but leaves you feeling uplifted."

It's upsetting for Bond fans that Eon productions ran away from the lively, fun formula that sustained the franchise for 40 years. What does it leave us with? Well - this type of Bond film unfortunately. Staggeringly bland and uninteresting.  If we removed the name Bond from the film we would have no idea that we were watching a Bond movie. 

It is depressing that they flushed 40 years of fun Bond films down the toilet to satiate people who dislike classic Bond adventures. They reached for a wider audience by going all generic action film to the detriment of the Bond legacy.

Who is this unsophisticated, short, blond man in the suit? Unfortunately, _he could be anyone_ - even you or I. Bond is now a lager chugging everyman. Ian Fleming would be furious.

No chance of Craig's Bond wearing  _a strap on plastic seagull hat_ as Connery did in the classic Goldfinger (1964) - they would not dare make the films that fun and entertaining anymore.

It's a shame what they did to the Bond films. || If we refused to do business with villains, we'd have almost no one to trade with!

Quantum of Solace is directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neil Purvis and Robert Wade, suggested from the stories written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Judi Dench, Giancarlo Giannini, Gemma Arteton & Jeffrey Wright. It is the 22nd film of the James Bond series.

Following on straight from Casino Royale, we find James Bond thirsting for revenge on those he believes responsible for Vesper Lynd's death.

Is Quantum Of Solace a great action film? Yes it surely is, is it however a great James Bond picture? Not quite, apparently, given the often venomous reaction to it from some Bond fan quarters. You wonder if Quantum Of Solace is a victim of Casino Royale's soaring success? A film that even surprised the many Daniel Craig haters. Were these internet warriors preying for a bad Bond film purely to further their argument that Craig should not be Bond? Did QOS give them smug satisfaction? Actually no it didn't, the box office and longevity of professional critiques proves this fact. Further viewings of QOS show it to be very astute in the Bond universe, where much of the charges of it not being fun enough etc just do not stick. As for not being Bondian enough? Opening car chase, a pursuit on foot that ends in a quite exhilarating rope dangle punch up, speedboat chaos, aeroplane peril with free-falling! Not Bond enough? Seriously? While it's also great to see Bond active on a motorcycle again.

The Casino Royale rebooted and re-suited offering was popular because it had an earthy make over, Daniel Craig's Bond is a fallible human being brimming with egotistical ruggedness. It's much of the same here in Quantum, where he is forced to go rouge, something that again has proved to be an itchy narrative thrust with sections of the Bond faithful. Yet as serious as he is, driven by pangs of annoyance, revenge and unanswered questions, Bond does have time to lay out a quip, there is some fun stuff their, honestly, Mother. Personally I enjoy the dark half of this Bond, ""I don't have any friends"", he wouldn't care"", and ""how many is that now?"", these are moments nearly as good as the interwoven opera blood bath and Bond drinking away his demons with 6 high velocity cocktails. Then there is Craig. Ah, Craig, Daniel Craig, again perfect in the tux and kicking arse with streetwise credibility, each scar on his nicely formed body a testament to this new rugged Bond of the people. That he rises above a relatively muddling script is testament to not only his acting ability, but also his new found acceptance in this most iconic of cinematic roles amongst the British institution that is James Bond.

The rest of the cast are a mixed bunch, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini are again merely making up the numbers, though the last gets to give Bond one of the film's darkest and cold inducing moments. Judi Dench of course does her usual solid M performance, swearing and growing the balls she hinted at previously, while Olga Kurylenko is very much a sparky Bond girl to savour; even if the sub-plot involving her almost feels like it was shoe-horned into the script as an added extra. Elsewhere there are problems. Casino Royale, had on the surface a weak villain, a man merely playing cards to pay off a more evil source, but he was effective. Sadly here in the Quantam universe the main villain is a hindrance to the picture. Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene does a good line in smarmy, but he's so weak the film nearly crumbles under the weight of his banality. The people at the house of Bond need to realise that little fish villains are only OK if we get the big daddy shark showing his/her face later in proceedings, for if this trend continues I fear the franchise could well lose the edge so well built up in Royale, and Gemma Arteton is pretty, but pretty ineffective. The locations are sumptuous, mind, and the sets are Bondian delights, with the title sequence certainly hitting the spot in spite of the quite dreadful Jack Black and Alcia Keys' theme song that accompanies the sequence. A homage to a former great Bond film sequence is respectful but a touch lazy, but QOS still overcomes its failings to be up above many action pictures of the last decade; this in spite of it being very slim line at an hour and 45 in length. Crucially, though, it pulses with Bond aggression and egotistical nous, just as Fleming wanted it. But this only comes out with further viewings...

Skyfall will be the next venture for Bond, regardless of quality we know that it will fail to appease every Bond fan on the planet. That's just the way it is with the series, so many want so many different things from their Bond. But I feel this is a good period for Bond, they do have the right man wearing the tux and as a character he is well tuned into the times, both politically and cinematically, it's now up to the makers to fuse the two and deliver a film to fully realise the rebooted franchise's potential and maybe, just maybe, win the dissenters' trust. 7/10 || Quantum of Solace had to follow Casino Royale which rebooted the Bond franchise with critics as well as with some of the public with a youthful, angry Bond.

Quantum of Solace starts 20 minutes after the events of Casino Royale with a fast edited but choppy car chase sequence. This is the first hint that Bond is following the Bourne films as co-editor Richard Pearson previously edited one of the Bourne films. This also highlights director's Marc Forster inexperience in making action films as many of the action sequences are hard to follow because of the way it has been edited.

The film was also hampered by the 2008 writer's strike. This meant that film went into production without a full working script which also meant that the director and even Daniel Craig allegedly wrote scenes for the film. It might explain the short running time.

The film unveils Quantum as a shady organisation with tentacles everywhere even in the heart of the British security services. The setting in Bolivia with disputes about water gives the film a political edge with a cynical look at corporations making dicey alliances with dictatorships to mutually exploit the people and plunder resources.

Forster gives the film some intriguing set pieces such the opera scene which is the meeting point for Quantum operatives which Bond infiltrates.

The short running time means the film is not overblown but with Craig at the helm it is kept lean and mean."

As the film opens, it is 1942 and the young Russian sailor Anatoly is forced by the Germans to shoot his captain Tikhon. Left for dead, Anatoly washes up on the shore of an island where a monastery is located. He spends the next three decades among the monks trying to atone for the killing of his friend and shipmate. Eventually, though he considers himself the lowest of the low, Anatoly is granted clairvoyance and the ability to work miracles. A steady stream of visitors comes to the island to seek his help.

But Anatoly is a certain kind of saint specific to the Russian tradition, the holy fool. He does things that make no sense to his fellow monks, to the point they think he's insane, but eventually everything he does is revealed to communicate some key spiritual point. Between ministering to the outsiders who visit him and dealing with his exasperated brethren, Anatoly gets no rest.

The film is beautiful in a way. The plot is engaging enough, and for audiences outside Russia (as well as many Russians who grew up under Communism) this is an informative presentation of the realities of Orthodox monastic life. The makeup effects are excellent -- Pyotr Mamonov doesn't look this decrepit in real-life, but on the screen he really is convincing as a starets who has spent decades in an unforgiving environment.

Nonetheless, I found <i>Ostrov</i> rather too heavy-handed, seeming at best sappy and at worst outright propaganda for a certain kind of contemporary Russian Orthodoxy that doesn't represent the faith entirely well. When one thinks of Russian Orthodoxy in cinema, one is tempted to draw comparisons with Andrei Tarkovsky, but even when Tarkovsky wasn't directly using Orthodox themes, he still communicated Christian truths more powerfully than anything in this film (think of the climax of Tarkovsky's <i>Stalker</i> or the ending of <i>Offret</i>). Thus, all in all, <i>Ostrov</i> is entertaining but not terribly deep. || Beautiful,bleak location. Excellent cinematography and direction highlights this story of guilt and redemption.

Smart little horror this, what it lacks in story originality it more than makes up for elsewhere.

Young lovers Seth (Paulo Costanzo) and Polly (Jill Wagner) find their attempts at a romantic camping trip usurped by their inadequacies in the great outdoors. But this soon becomes the very least of their problems, because they are car-jacked by escaped convict Dennis Farell (Shea Whigham) and his drug addict girlfriend Lacey Belisle (Rachel Kerbs). When they run over what they think is an animal of some sort, it signals the start of a terrifying ordeal that will see the group backed into the interior of a gas station and forced to fight for their lives.

What follows is a solid hour of suspense, terror, horrifying scenes and rich character dynamics. It’s a siege situation with the enemy some sort of porcupine – vegetable – human hybrid, and it’s relentless and clever. Director Toby Wilkins doesn’t once let the picture sag or suffer from filler, all scenes and character interactions are integral to the plotting. Mercifully free of characters doing the dumb things that are so inherent in this splinter (hrr hrr hrr) of horror, Wilkins’ film is consistently effective in what it wants to achieve. 

The effects are kept to a minimum and the only real complaint is that for every attack by the creature we are subjected to shakycam. If this is to hide the effects work we don’t know? And it’s always great to have a horror assailant be used sparingly on a visual level, but the shakycam becomes annoying and feels like a bit of a cheat in the final quarter. The small cast offer up some sterling performances, with Whigham standing out as the hateful villain, while Nelson Cragg’s photography strips the colours down to primal indie level and the film is better for it.

A pleasant surprise and recommended to horror fans after a quick and bloody siege horror that never disappoints. 7.5/10 || Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

While it may not sound like the most original concept, it definitely feels innovative.  Using isolation to add atmosphere to the movie allows the movie to really focus the terror of infection, as opposed to zombie movies where it's usually about flooding the world with zombie infection.

The movie has a great layered metaphor of Darwinism sliding from a might-makes-right attitude to having to be smart to survive.

The experience really felt full for them being trapped in a convenience store.  The cast did an excellent performance through the graduating series of events, and a rather strong story."
6972.0,Australia,"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscape, they experience the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces firsthand.",Welcome to Australia!,"Adventure, Romance, Drama",165.0,2008-11-18,en,6.592,2341.0,2.6055,"Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Essie Davis, David Wenham, Bryan Brown",Baz Luhrmann,"australia, missionary, world war ii, ranch, cattle drive, racist, prejudice, suspicion of adultery, australian outback, 1940s, 1930s, stampede, trampled to death","King George angry at them white fellas. King George say them white fella bad spirit. Must be taken from this land. 

Australia is directed by Baz Luhrmann and Luhrmann co-writes the screenplay with Stuart Beattie, Ronald Harwood, and Richard Flanagan. It stars Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, Bryan Brown and Brandon Walters.

It took a bit of a kicking from the pro critics upon release, where the consensus is that at a cost of $130 million this intended sprawling epic is an ambitious flop. For the record at the box office it practically made double its outlay, so certainly wasn't a financial flop.

It's a mixed bag for sure, a film of two differing halves. First half sends Kidman's English aristocrat to Northern Australia after she inherits the sprawling Faraway Downs Ranch. Here she finds herself in the middle of a dirty take over plot and reluctantly makes a working pact with Jackman's stock-man Drover. Seeds are sewn here for a bit of a screwball relationship, all while a cattle feud brews and the Aborigines at the ranch - particularly young Nulllah (Walters) - are in fear of racial tension. Pic then flip-flops into a love story, a war story (as the Japanese attack Darwin) and the bile strewn historical strand that features the ""stolen generations"" of half-white/half-Aboriginal children. 

With all this going on, as Lurhman nods to classic epics from classic era past, the vistas are stunning and the hard work of cattle ranching is given genuine credence (helps having the rugged Jackman leading the way). Set pieces are exciting, the Japanese aerial attacks realistic for dramatic worth, while the chemistry between the leads, a worthy child performance from Walters and a quality weasel villain turn from Wenham ensure performances don't harm the pic in that department. There's even the likes of Ben Mendelsohn and John Jarratt in secondary support slots. 

It isn't all it can be, and tonally it feels like there might have been some behind the scenes interference (three co-writers probably didn't help). Yet there are some genuine moments of fun and beauty here, mixed with some heart string tugs and reflection of an historical time that should never ne forgotten. Luhrman reached for ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and didn't quite make it, but it's honourable and has some damn fine craft for entertainment purpose. 7/10"

<em>'Bolt'</em> is all a joy to watch. On paper, the premise can look a bit ridiculous, don't get me wrong it is, but the film manages to not only make it entertaining but to also make it both amusing and heartwarming.

The opening scenes are superbly done, when the cat (dog?) gets let out the bag, so to speak, it does take a few moments to regain its footing but quickly turns into a lot of fun. It's got a pleasing adventure, heartfelt feelings and comedy to keep it fresh.

The cast are very good, too. John Travolta (Bolt) and Miley Cyrus (Penny) do very fine jobs in their respective roles, but it's actually Susie Essman who stands out most to me - she gives a super performance as Mittens. A few of the other voices do solid stuff, also.

Thoroughly enjoyed this. || My daughter wanted this movie. I had it for years before I ever watched it. It was actually a decent movie. I was surprised. || This starts off quite entertainingly with ""Penny"" and her super-hero dog ""Bolt"" having to thwart the evil plans of the dastardly ""Dr. Calico"". She's on her glorified scooter and he just on his four paws - but they are not daunted by the overwhelming forces arrayed against them as they try to get to the airport. Well, that's when we realise that this is a television show and there'll be another edition tomorrow. Or will there? ""Mindy"" from the network comes to tell the rather fastidious director that the demographic is a bit bored with formulaic television and so he's going to have to introduce some jeopardy or it's the can for all of them! The subsequent attempt to revamp the brand results in ""Bolt"" thinking his pal really has been kidnapped and ending up in a box full of polystyrene packing many, many miles away in NYC. Can he get back in time to save her from their evil nemesis? Well, en route he meets the street-smart ""Mittens"" and they have quite few adventures as he tries to get home. It's a perfectly watchable family adventure film, but like the television show it's based around, it's entirely derivative and formulaic. Plenty of set-piece action scenes before a conclusion that rather reinforces the unoriginality of it all. It's busy, colourful and the younger amongst us will probably quite enjoy it, but I reckon unless you're a grown up pet lover (dogs especially) you might struggle to remember this."

No fat free milk. No semi-skimmed froth encrusting the top layer. Lactose is included. Just whole Harvey Milk dairy, freshly pasteurised by superlative direction and sharp writing. Much like fine wine, Milk tastes exquisitely with age, consistently complementing current democratic strands of chaos. Highlighting the significance of a single vote in a referendum without glorifying the omnipotence of activism.

Harvey Milk, for all intents and purposes, was the first openly gay individual to be elected for public office in the shining state of California. Combatting initiatives such as Proposition 6, the banning of homosexuals to acquire careers in public schools. As a homosexual myself, who had been unfortunately suppressed into the “closet” due to fear of zero familial acceptance, Harvey Milk can only be described as an LGBT hero. The focus on political lobbying and general activism never dissipates, with Van Sant constantly presenting Penn as a voluptuous sculpture for gay rights. And, whilst it would’ve been supremely simple to resort to a melodramatic approach by documenting the several deaths and polygamous relationships in Milk’s life, Van Sant opted for a subversive aesthetic.

By combining archival footage of police raids and controlled protests with the core dramatisation, Van Sant effortlessly blended a documentarian style with a standard biographical narrative. In doing so he enabled Milk to remain human throughout, retaining an ever-important reminder of the work that he had lovingly committed to, not just for his own acceptance into the community, but for every LGBT representative.

Ingeniously, Black addressed Milk and Moscone’s assassinations from the offset, establishing a flashback narrative structure to illustrate Milk’s political career. From opening a store entitled Castro Camera to campaigning against Christian fundamentalists. Black’s audacious dialogue inserted a substantial amount of characterisation, often resorting to humour and sassy quips, whilst tackling the heavier subjects at hand. Further humanising Milk and his supporters. The representation of opposing conservatives were also well-developed, with Milk’s fellow supervisor White gaining the most traction in comparison to Briggs and Feinstein. Offering a clash of perspectives in the democratic environment, eventually building up to a subdued yet profound climax that unleashed an endless candlelight vigil lighting up the streets of San Francisco.

Van Sant’s astute direction, specifically the inclusion of multiple one take sequences of delicious dialogue, would not have been as effective if it wasn’t for one element. An aspect to which the entire biopic relied on. Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. Without a doubt, one of the greatest performances to ever grace our screens. Rarely do I take issue with heterosexual actors portraying homosexuality, and his unanimously acclaimed performance is a valid reason why. Very shortly after his presence was noticed, subverting his typical “hard as nails” gritty roles, I no longer saw Penn. Through sheer mannerism changes, he transformed. The whispering voice, the exaggerated hand motions and the gentle personality. Deserving of any and all awards that he received.

Hirsch was just as transformative portraying fellow supporter Jones, fully embodying gay culture into a singular character. Brolin and Luna also offering noteworthy performances. Franco on the other hand failed to replicate the same quality. His monotonous delivery felt reminiscent to ‘Pineapple Express’ or any other stoned comedy. Elfman’s score, whilst enabling a lighter tone throughout, occasionally overwhelmed the more emotional sequences. Some jarring jump cuts edited by Graham also further relinquished the effectiveness of Milk’s central character and the pace.

However, as a dramatisation of a leading figure in LGBT history, Van Sant delivered the goods. Yet, as a reminder for both heterosexuals and homosexuals alike for how archaic life was, Milk is absurdly powerful. As a “fellow degenerate”, I stand alongside everything that Harvey Milk represented, enabling the LGBT community to come “out of the closet”. || A brilliantly informed piece of history. I learnt more than I thought I would and enjoyed it even more. Enjoyed probably isn’t the word as it’s a disgrace that any of this had to happen but overall it’s an empowering film of right over wrong. 

I feel slightly more informed about LGBT history now than I did before the film, ready for LGBT history month (every February).  
The acting is really good and believable but I have to admit I found it difficult watching straight actors cast as gay men fighting for fair representation of gay people. 

This is a spotlight on a part of LGBT history that is rarely told outside LGBT circles so maybe Penn brought the message to a more mainstream audience.  My view of Sean Penn's acting ability has changed based on this movie. Penn is an enigma in his controversial views on masculinity and gender but this was brilliantly acted, executed and researched and I wasn’t expecting to say that when I loaded the video.

You've probably seen the scenario before, kids go feral for some reason and the grown-ups have to survive. What makes this version good is the realistic character reactions. I read other reviews saying at the first sign of danger you would stop looking for your kids and just run. I call BS, or maybe I call someone who has never had kids. A halfway decent parent would not ditch their kids and run away! I would sacrifice my life and the life of anyone around me to save my kids! In a heartbeat. So suggesting that it would be more realistic for a parent to instantly believe a moody teenager that their children are now monsters, with no proof, is just crazy talk. 

The tight plot very cleverly splits up the cast and only lets one character see what is really going on, creating doubt and misinformation, so no-one believes the poor teenager until it is too late, for most of the cast at least.

The tension builds consistently, and doesn't let up. There's enough gore and suspense to please more mature horror fans, but you have to go in expecting a slow build up. Also something weird was going on with the sound, I've read other reviews mention the same, so it wasn't just my copy. Turn the volume up, better yet wear headphones and let yourself get sucked in."

<em>'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas'</em> makes for good viewing for the majority, though that ending really is quite something - startling in fact, and that's even with me sensing it. The aforementioned is because, as well as the way the film builds in general, I'm pretty certain I watched this at high school; just not sure if it was snippets or the whole thing, the fence scenes are the only ones I vaguely recall seeing.

The low acting level of the youngsters did take me out a bit, no dislike to Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, obviously, but they aren't the best. Though they aren't helped by the dialogue for them, which doesn't feel natural at all. It's written in a way that is simply to tell the viewer about what's happening. The adult actors are great, though. Vera Farmiga stands out, though David Thewlis, Rupert Friend and David Hayman merit a mention too.

All in all, it's a good film - and one that is distressingly unforgettable thanks to that one moment."
14438.0,Fireproof,"A heroic fire captain values dedication and service to others above all else, but the most important partnership in his life, his marriage, is about to go up in smoke.",Never leave your partner behind.,"Drama, Romance",118.0,2008-09-26,en,7.672,798.0,4.6046,"Kirk Cameron, Erin Bethea, Ken Bevel, Stephen Dervan, Ric Young","Alex Kendrick, Alex Kendrick, Stephen Kendrick","fire, husband wife relationship, parent child relationship, faith, marriage, religious conversion, advice, dysfunctional marriage, religion, hospital, marital problem, firefighter, christian film, christian","I think Catherine Holt (Erin Bethea) sums up very well what’s wrong with her marriage to Caleb (Kirk Cameron): “You can’t expect me to work every day and get the groceries while you look at trash on the Internet dreaming about your boat.” 

She has a point, or rather two. According to her, Caleb “tuck[s] away a third of [his] salary saving for a boat we don’t need. [He has] $24,000 in savings when things in our house need fixing."" 

You can’t argue with that; having a boat is after all a single guy kind of thing to do. I don’t need to tell the movie this – what with it being a ""faith-based” drama –, but “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” In other words, ye cannot have a wife and a boat.

As for the “trash” that Caleb is so fond of – i.e., porn –, I could see a way to work that into a marriage, but then both parties would have to be on board, and that’s precisely the problem with this movie. 

To help him save his marriage, Caleb’s father John (Harris Malcom) presents him with “The Love Dare;” a 40-day program that goes something like this: “Day one: … For the next day resolve to say nothing negative to your spouse at all. If the temptation arises, choose not to say anything … Day two: … In addition to saying nothing negative to your spouse today, do at least one unexpected gesture as an act of kindness,” and so on and so forth (on the 16th day he has to pray for her; in the movie’s funniest line, Caleb confesses “I kind of skipped that one.” This obviously happens before he relents and accepts Jesus Christ into his heart). 

Catherine takes her husband’s newfound attentiveness with a grain of salt (her friends advise her that “He’s trying to butter you up for a divorce,” whatever that means). 

Caleb calls his father and complains that “None of this means anything to her,” and he’s right, but how could it be any other way? How can something she doesn’t even know is going on mean anything to her? 

Oddly, when John talks about his experience with the Love Dare, he speaks in plural – e.g., “There was a point when we had no hope either” –; unless he’s using the royal ‘We,’ he means himself and Caleb’s mother. Caleb, on the other hand, hides the whole thing from Catherine, which a) doesn’t seem like the best way to go about repairing your marriage and b) wouldn’t it work better if it were a two-sided effort? It’s not like she’s completely blameless, either. 

And now to give the Devil, or I guess Jesus, his due. Caleb is a firefighter, and he and his crew are called to the scene of a traffic accident. A woman is trapped inside the wrecked vehicle, which in turn is sitting on some tracks right on the path of an oncoming train. They are “currently unable to make contact with the train dispatcher,” so Caleb & Co. have no choice but to manfully push the car out of harm’s way.

This is all kinds of great. Not only does it put to shame many a newer, much more expensive film (is it an actual train? I’m not going to go out on a limb that it is, but if it’s CGI, then it’s the best damn CGI train I’ve ever seen), but it makes me care about the characters because I can believe they truly are firefighters putting their lives on the line – quite literally, in this case. 

Now, if only the movie had been about firefighting instead of a loveless marriage that avoids ending up in divorce thanks to a little ménage à dieu."

Shortly after Margaret Thatcher took power in Britain, he was incarcerated in Belfast’s Maze Prison where his stance against not just the UK but the predominately Unionist views of the population of Northern Ireland at the time were seeing him and his fellow inmates living in what can only be described as squalid (though much of that was self-afflicted) conditions that would not have looked out of place in some South American dictatorship. His protests were falling on deaf and disinterested ears and in the end, he concluded that the ultimate sacrifice was his only option. Not that that, in itself, would solve the problems - but in the hope that it would galvanise younger generations that he was prepared to starve himself to death. The writing provides for quite soaring dialogue that is angrily pithy and effective at illustrating just how divided this community was, but essentially it is the raw imagery that does almost almost all of the heavy lifting. Now the one thing it doesn’t try to do is offer us any sort of balance. Naturally, from his perspective, it is profoundly anti-British, but it does not really spend any time on the historical situation that bedevils this province, still. Much of the violence carried out in the prison was carried out by his fellow Irishmen - a section of the population every bit as convinced by their own beliefs as Sands was by his. It’s this one-sidedness that lets this down a little, especially as the photography towards the end almost sanctifies an actor who already has the eyes and visage to suit that purpose, but there can be no doubt as we watch his steady journey into emaciation that this was a principled man who endured much for his cause. It’s quite a grim watch that does little to inform on the still ongoing debate about Irish unity/Britishness but it is definitely worth watching."

The Punisher first appeared in the Spider-Man comic in February, 1974, and became a semi-regular foe/ally in that mag, but was more apt to appear in Daredevil in the 80s until the character got his own mini-series in 1986 and then his ongoing titles: The Punisher (1987), The Punisher War Journal (1988) and The Punisher War Zone (1992). The character was so popular at the time that he inspired a black & white magazine as well (1989).

The reason The Punisher was and continues to be so popular is because he's essentially an over-the-top version of ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Deathwish"": Frank Castle's family is killed by the mob while on a picnic in Central Park and so he declares war on all criminals wherein he becomes their judge, jury and executioner. Unlike Daredevil, a lawyer who utilizes the justice system, The Punisher just kills 'em all.

The first movie version was 1989's ""The Punisher"" with Dolph Lundgren, which was a disappointment. Lundgren was good, but the movie was too Grade B cartoony and it took too many liberties. Still, some consider it a cult flick. The 2004 movie with Thomas Jane curiously transferred the character from New York City to sunny Florida, specifically the Tampa area. There were other oddities that didn’t sit well, but Jane was good as the protagonist and there was enough good in the flick to marginally enjoy it.

This 2008 rendition, “Punisher: War Zone,” was originally intended to be a sequel to the 2004 movie with Thomas Jane, but delays in the production caused him to pull out. Lexi Alexander ultimately got the gig as director and she pitched the idea of doing the film “as a throwback to '80s era action films” with 6’4” Ray Stevenson taking over as The Punisher.

Jigsaw (Dominic West) makes for a memorable villain with Loony Bin Jim an entertaining wacko sidekick (Doug Hutchison). Wayne Knight plays Microchip and Julie Benz the wife of an undercover agent that Castle mistakenly kills on one of his missions. The towering Colin Salmon stands out as a police agent intent on tracking down The Punisher.

It was a good call to bring the story back to New York City and, honestly, this has to be one of the best-looking big city movies I’ve ever seen, no kidding. The cinematography/locations/lighting are exceptional. While the movie has the urban grittiness of Nolan’s Batman trilogy, it balances it out with amusing cartoonish-ness. There is some quality drama, like Castle’s anguish over killing a “good guy” and his dealings with the dead agent’s widow & daughter, but it’s not overlong and dull like in “Batman Begins” (2005) and “The Dark Knight” (2008). Unfortunately, the last act, while serviceable, could’ve been better.

At the end of the day, “Punisher: War Zone” edges out the 2004 movie as the best film version of the character. It’s more faithful to the comics and overall more entertaining even though it totally bombed at the box office.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes and was shot in Montreal, Quebec.

GRADE: B/B- || To be fair, Punisher: War Zone is the most accurate representation of the comic we've had to date. The gore, extreme violence, and borderline sadism is very much a part of the comic. Ray Stevenson is spot on as Frank Castle. Dominic West is not so good as Jigsaw but at least his gang is more competent than Travolta's.

Given that this came out in the same year as two other big comic book movies, there is one big thing that Punisher: War Zone contributes: proof that a female director can make an unforgivingly cruel but kick ass action flick, so I don't understand how more of them aren't being given the opportunity to do so."

""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008) is an intriguing, powerful and even moving modern sci-fi blockbuster. I particularly like the symbolism: Klaatu=Christ, GORT=YaHWeH, as well as the numerous biblical references: Noah's Ark, the death plague, human beings trying to put God in a box literally, the sacrificial nature of agape love, etc. In other words, the film tackles subjects of great depth that every human being can relate to whatever their belief system. This itself separates it from the usual idiotic blockbuster fare.

Now let me address some common criticisms (please see the film first before reading further due to **SPOILERS**): 

The kid is initially quite annoying but this is understandable as he's an archetype for what humankind is: an annoying, untrusting, simpleminded child-race. His sudden change into ""maturity"" represents how humanity needs to ""grow-up."" This helps make sense of the kid's repeated statements about killing Klaatu, which were magnified by the media's slander of Klaatu as a dangerous escaped convict. Klaatu's strange actions helped feed this negative mindset. As for the kid's dead father, the boy was only 9 years old and understood his father to be a soldier. Why wouldn't he have a mythical impression that he killed 'bad guys' for a living, likely with his bare hands? 

The judgment of mass human destruction was already set for the earth after hundreds of years of observation, including an Asian scout who lived with humans for 70 years. Klaatu was sent to activate the judgment UNLESS he observed some clear indication that the harsh judgment wasn't necessary yet. Klaatu didn't change the original plan UNTIL very late in the story, which is why he stated to Helen that he wasn't sure if he could overturn it. Although Klaatu was the primary agent, he wasn’t necessarily alone. Gort was there and he was only partially robotic, as well as Mr. Wu. There were probably hundreds/thousands of other aliens involved in one way or another.

The military attacks because their modus operandi is to defend the nation, which was augmented by the destructive nature of humanity in general. 

When Bate's character finally decides to send Helen out to talk with Klaatu she was the government’s proverbial last hope. All other governmental attempts to prevent the judgment failed abysmally up to this point, not to mention the judgment of mass destruction was ALREADY well into motion. Other national leaders were concerned with saving their own.

The biggest sphere was the central command orb. Klaatu didn't possess the power to stop the swarm himself; he had to get to the central orb to attempt to stop the mass destruction. Even then, he wasn't sure if he could do it. In fact, it cost him dearly.

The alien swarm only destroyed humanity and all human imprints (like the stadium, the the installation and the semi); I saw no evidence of the swarms destroying trees or animal life. The animal ark-orbs were obviously precautionary in nature; in other words, the aliens knew there would be collateral damage due to the nature of the swarms so they snatched away all manner of animal life as a precaution.

Klaatu made it quite clear what he was doing: saving the earth by destroying humanity and their intrinsic bent toward destruction. The way he put it was: If humanity lives the earth will die, but if humanity dies the earth will live.

The Aliens are powerful, but it's inaccurate to call them careless. They monitored the planet for centuries and their decision was carefully decided.

To write-off humanity's destructive bent as ""minor-league carelessness"" is shallow and un-enlightened, as well as wholly inaccurate.

The aliens' actions had nothing to do with ""might makes right"" but everything to do with saving a planet from the infection that would wholly destroy it (people) if they failed to act. Their celestial judgment was that the cancer HAD to be cut out and time was of the essence.

Really, the only ""detestable characters"" are the government as a whole, which is displayed as a cold machine. Helen (Jennifer Connelly) is a character of beauty, reverence and wisdom while the professor plays humanity's wise intercessor. Kathy Bates' character is unlikable because she represents the government and comes off as an arrogant machine-like biyatch. After she's completely humbled, however, she changes her tune. Meanwhile the kid is only 9 years old and lost both of his biological parents; cut him some slack. Besides, he also changes his tune and Klaatu takes on the role of his spiritual father. How can you NOT feel for Jacob when he falls on his face at his dad's grave? 

So none of the common gripes hold water. The insane bashing of the film is simply the result of an unjust critical feeding frenzy. If people would disregard the monkey-see-monkey-do panning and view the film with an open mind they might actually enjoy it and possibly discover something worthwhile.

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes.

That old adage about one man's terrorist being another's freedom fighter is well exemplified here with us left in no doubt by the director and writer of the merits of the Guevara cause. That writing isn't actually up to very much, nor is much of the acting but the documentary style of story-building and photography does work really well illustrating the extent of the poverty in which the subsistence population survived, hand to mouth and day to day. Benicio Del Toro takes the title role and when he reunites with Fidel Castro (Demián Bichir) and brother Raúl (Rodrigo Santoro) he is soon an integral part of the command and control structure of the communist insurgency that intends to remove the pro-US government. It's Castro's increasing alignment with the Soviet Union that earns the the chagrin of their nearest neighbours and much of the drama here sees all of them crawling through the jungle wary of all they meet while their increasing number of troops and weaponry, coupled with increasing dis-satisfaction amongst the government troops, gives them a chance of success. It's history, and the fact that there's a part two doesn't leave a lot of room for jeopardy, but Soderbergh doesn't shy away from the uncertainty and brutality of the conflict and the hostility of their island environment. The location photography does work well but it sacrifices the sound mix to achieve that - there is a lot of mumbling going on here. This characterisation presents us with a man of some vision who believed in the principles of communal ownership and universal education, and is worth a watch."

What's clear fairly quickly here is that his forces are smaller, much less well equipped and fighting a foe far more adept at his kind of warfare. This is much more of a documentary-style presentation from Steven Soderbergh and I found it really quite a dry chronology that portrayed Guevara as a sort of serial revolutionary. A man of principal, yes, but also one who increasingly became unwilling to consider that his might not be the only way to solve a problem. Also, his antagonist in Bolivia also knew well how to engender support from the ""campaniles"", many of whom had elected him in the first place. There appears to be much more speculation in this, too, and I found it struggled to maintain it's momentum as at times it bordered on the look of a spaghetti western. It illustrates well the gap between rich and poor, but here his philosophy is not so clearly defined - it's as if he always needs some sort of cause, regardless of his appreciation of what these people actually wanted or needed. The acting is really neither here nor there, and the dialogue suffers from audio issues when set amidst the dense jungle environment. I think this could easily have been condensed down and added to Part One. Interesting, but not great, and it doesn't really tell us very much about the man at all."
14359.0,Doubt,"In 1964 Bronx, two Catholic school nuns question the new priest's ambiguous relationship with a troubled African-American student.",There are no simple truths.,Drama,104.0,2008-12-12,en,7.194,1784.0,2.6616,"Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis, Alice Drummond",John Patrick Shanley,"sexual abuse, wine, janitor, singing, pedophile, gossip, compassion, tolerance, 1960s","Knee-deep in the throes of my first love, I was quite surprised to hear that my lady's favourite movie was 'Joe Versus the Volcano'. (I still haven't seen the film). It dawned on me, when I wanted to check out an American film which, to my knowledge, had a plethora of fine acting, that this was written and directed by the same guy who made that film much earlier. Being raised Christian and hearing in the press over the past few years about misdeeds, especially involving leaders of the Catholic church (represented in films as diverse as 'The Boys of St. Vincent' (John N. Smith, 1992) and 'In Bruges' (Martin McDonagh, 2008), I was especially intrigued by this, his work of more recent vintage.

The ambiguity at the core of the film (and hence the 'doubt') really acts in the movie's favour. The script and direction are both tense and flawless, and the beautiful New York locations chosen to illustrate The Bronx in 1964 help air the play out, and give it more cinematic scope. It features some of the finest work I have seen from Philip Seymour Hoffman (though my favourites will always be 'Happiness' and 'The Master'), Meryl Streep (my most-esteemed works of hers are 'The Deer Hunter' and 'The Devil Wears Prada') and Amy Adams (this is her finest performance IMHO) as well as a breakthrough role for Viola Davis, who steals every scene she's in. This easily holds up well even with Shanley's Oscar-winning screenplay for 'Moonstruck', and, though dark and depressing, is thoroughly recommended for those who can stomach its subject matter, and peer into that abyss without flinching, as these fine exemplars of 21st-century American cinema so easily do here.

That it didn't win any of its five Oscar nominations is almost as ghastly, to the cinephile, as the misdeeds insinuated here are to the community at large. Must have been a strong year for film, methinks. || There is wonderful scene in this film where ""Fr. Flynn"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) tries to explain, using feathers, just how wicked gossip can be. He is the victim of such nefarious chatter - but is he guilty? Well ""Sister Aloysius"" (Meryl Streep) believes so. She sees the father with a student on the street outside the school, then her colleague ""Sister James"" (Amy Adams) mentions that another, their first young black child ""Donald"" (Joseph Foster), looked a bit distressed after meeting with the priest in is vestry. She is determined to get to the truth and to be rid of this man. Streep is very convincing here. She portrays a woman who, based on the thinnest of actual evidence, relies on the certainty of her belief to level accusations against the man. Using that certainly, she confronts him imploring confession but is there anything to confess? Hoffman is also effective as a man that I initially had sympathies for - he was, after all, being victimised by his colleague with no evidence from the supposed victims and the first lad - ""London"" (Mike Roukis) was a distinctly untrustworthy boy. Viola Davis offers just the one principal scene as the affected boy's stoic mother, and that is a potent rationalisation of not just where she felt a young black kid sat on the ladder of society at the time, but also of where she felt the church sat on her own. She is a loving mother conflicted, and this is portrayed with intensity. I wasn't sold on the ending, either way it was unsatisfactory but this is still a well crafted and thought provoking assembly of strong acting talent and a solid story."

I fully acknowledge the talk about this film's potential impact on the world, namely for Hmong Americans (see: Bee Vang's <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/covid-19-era-s-anti-asian-racism-isn-t-new-ncna1258184"" rel=""nofollow"">op-ed</a>), and I'm not saying it's perfect one bit. I admittedly do have a difficult time separating film and real life, to me films are just fictional things but I get they can/do have real world implications.

Strictly as a film, it is entertaining. Clint Eastwood is remarkably good at being a super racist and super grumpy old man, who literally hates every single person he encounters across the opening portion of the film. His character's lines in this are nuts and his delivery with them is incredible - the look of utter disgust on Walt Kowalski's face when someone pisses him off in a new way is just amusing to watch. If not for his on point delivery, it wouldn't have worked.

Eastwood is the only actor in this worth talking about on a grander level, though I could've done without his ropey singing at the end, but I did enjoy the showings of the earlier mentioned Vang, Ahney Her and John Carroll Lynch - not that the latter does much, I just like the guy as an actor... all stems from <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">The Walking Dead</a>'</em>, he's in literally one episode back in 2015 and yet I always remember his character.

I'm not sold on the ending, Walt isn't exactly redeemed and it does reek of white saviour let's be real, but it didn't affect my enjoyment in film terms to be honest. || Clint Eastwood is a good director. I've seen ten of his films, one of them being “Play Misty for Me.” A film that I think is incredible. But like any director, Clint’s films can vary in quality. In the case of “Gran Torino,” it's a good film, but probably not one I'm going to rewatch very much. Clint Eastwood and Bee Vang put in great performances. Walt, played by Clint Eastwood, is a tough character to watch. His prejudices are the main reason for that. This is my view of the character, of course, so how you feel about him depends on your views. I think the ending of the film works. It's a decent end to Walt's character journey. || It's curious that the main English language awards largely ignored this, yet it won both a David and a César in Europe and is definately one of Clint Eastwood's more characterful efforts. He is the curmudgeonly ""Walt"" who has recently lost his wife, has an arms-length relationship with his son and looks disapprovingly as his neighbourhood ceases to be the home of ""Americans""! His prize possession is his Gran Tornino car and he doesn't take to kindly to Bee Vang's ""Thao"" (or ""Toad"") trying to pinch it. Quickly, though, he sees that this young man and his sister ""Sue"" (Ahney Her) are being bullied by their thuggish extended family - a gang of obnoxious would-be gangsters who drive the streets picking fights and taunting people. He decides to intervene and the rest of the story sees a bond develop between him and his new ""family"" based on a degree of mutual understanding, trust, and ""Toad"" becoming his slave for a fortnight by way of penance! We are given some clues along the way as to the grand designs of ""Walt"" as he sets up a denouement, after a brutal assault on ""Sue"", that will satisfy not just himself, but keep his neighbours safe too. It's not the most naturally written dialogue, indeed at times it's quite forced but the underlying premiss of bigotry and the attitudes of intolerance and bullying are well addressed. The characterisation of the distant and prejudiced ""Walt"" is delivered engagingly, and with some dark humour, by a star/director who has a point to make. There's also quite a gently potent effort from Christopher Carley as the local priest. He is trying to offer the perfunctory words of hope and comfort to this veteran and he perseveres despite the dog's abuse he receives from a man who no longer feels it necessary to commit to the niceties of society. Clearly, ""Walt"" cares little for what is left of his life nor for any of his sins to be forgiven. It's about grief, relevance, community and I think it works. Give it a go."
11499.0,Frost/Nixon,"For three years after being forced from office, Nixon remained silent. But in summer 1977, the steely, cunning former commander-in-chief agreed to sit for one all-inclusive interview to confront the questions of his time in office and the Watergate scandal that ended his presidency. Nixon surprised everyone in selecting Frost as his televised confessor, intending to easily outfox the breezy British showman and secure a place in the hearts and minds of Americans. Likewise, Frost's team harboured doubts about their boss's ability to hold his own. But as the cameras rolled, a charged battle of wits resulted.",400 million people were waiting for the truth.,"Drama, History",122.0,2008-10-15,en,7.279,1219.0,1.3744,"Michael Sheen, Frank Langella, Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Matthew Macfadyen",Ron Howard,"usa president, politics, 1970s, camera, lie, watergate scandal, scandal, richard nixon, reporter, writer","I watched this film without knowing almost anything about the actual events that are depicted in this film. What a surprise it was! The cast did an amazing job to reflect the actual characters in history while the director did a stellar job in representing it.

Would I watch it again? I don't think so. Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely! || I guess I'm giving it a 10 out of 10 for the acting, for the lighting, and for the attempt.

In other words this is a movie that you want to watch, a movie that will probably be enjoyed (unless you find movies like this boring, and, if you do, you've already made up your mind not to watch it).

However, it fails in the execution. Frost/Nixon should have been a struggle between minds, a chess game, and because of that it needed to have almost a paranoia to it. A tension that could be felt as one side attempted to take down the other.

It missed the opportunity there. Possibly because it was only an interview, possibly because the results of which didn't really matter, either way it missed the tension boat and the film ultimately suffers for it. What could have been All the President's Men turned into something well done, but ultimately forgettable for failure to really develop the mood to set the pace.

However, the acting was superb and the film certainly looks great. It is a pleasure to watch, it just never gets to the emotional level it needed to be brilliant and memorable. || Though it really only comes alive in the last half hour, this is still a powerful dramatisation of the setting up and execution of the interviews between the disgraced US President (Frank Langella) and the enthusiastic British talk show host (Michael Sheen). It was the latter who initiated a proposal with lawyer ""Swifty"" Lazar (Toby Jones) to suggest the president might like to tell his story. The Nixon camp considered Frost a bit of a manageable lightweight and decide that if he can raise the $600,000 cash, then why not? It takes a while to negotiate the terms, but by 1977 all is agreed and they sit down for the first in a series of two hour recordings. Despite a strong start, opinions seem to solidify around Frost being, indeed, a bit too weak to elicit anything newsworthy from his savvy political opponent. Luckily, Frost has the viscerally anti-Nixon James Reston (Sam Rockwell) in his camp and some serious research unearths things that are going to make it very difficult for Nixon to continue to try to remain as aloof and statesmanlike as he would like. It's Langella who really comes into his own as, believe it or not, he actually engenders a little sympathy towards the conclusion. That's all history so no jeopardy there, but I think the characterisation of the president was solid and engagingly delivered an image of a man who definitely believed in himself! Sheen is adequate, as is the weakly cast Matthew Macfadyen as producer John Birt and Kevin Bacon as Nixon's right hand man and borderline disciple Jack Brennan. The writing is occasionally potent here and as we are exposed to Ron Howard's version of events, it gradually becomes quite a compelling postulation to watch and opine about."
8055.0,The Reader,"The story of Michael Berg, a German lawyer who, as a teenager in the late 1950s, had an affair with an older woman, Hanna, who then disappeared only to resurface years later as one of the defendants in a war crimes trial stemming from her actions as a concentration camp guard late in the war.

In fairly short order, this fifteen year old boy becomes her lover; in return she gets him to read to her. He is soon infatuated and devastated when he turns up at her apartment one day to find her gone. Skip on thirty years or so and he - now Ralph Fiennes - takes over a retrospective of her story as we discover she was tried for being a particularly nasty Nazi prison camp guard and she is sentenced to life imprisonment. Throughout her internment, the two continued to correspond - he would send her tapes to aid in her learning to read... Stephen Daldry has created a delicate masterpiece here, I think. Winslet is very much on form as the story goes from a bit of sexual fantasy for the young man, through to a far darker, more horrific, second part. There is something unnervingly natural about Winslet's performance; from the playful and generous - though temperamental - lover for this naive young boy, then the odious and distinctly unrepentant, almost belligerent, woman at her trial. Despite that, somehow, Daldry manages to elicit just a grain of sympathy for her. Was she inherently bad or just inherently weak - or both? Did she crave for affection just as much as the young ""Michael"" did when they met? His story is one of emotional barren-ness growing up in a large family where his relationship with his father was distant and chilly and the young Kross really does shine in the role. There is plenty of sex at the beginning, but it's not gratuitous; it's exploratory - for both of them and that intimacy also adds richness to what is ultimately quite a sad tale that, though thought-provoking when it comes to the whole concept of forgiveness and reconciliation, did make me realise that so many people caught up in the Nazi machine were ill-educated and frightened. It's also worth noting the subtle role played by Bruno Ganz as his legal professor ""Rohl"". This is a character who proves to be a crucial conduit for the young man as he has to come to terms with what he thought she was, and what he now knows she became. The pace of this production is measured, the photography frequently intimate and lingering and the attention to the detail from the production designer also adds potency to this visceral and touching story that I really did find well worth a watch. || I didn't turn this movie off after the beautiful sex scenes only because two others were watching it with me. The mere fact that ""Germans"" were speaking English totally destroyed the whole ""suspend disbelief"" for me. This film is an awful rendition by Brits of an award-winning German book. Perhaps, only someone from the Nachgeborenen (to coin Bertolt Brecht's meaning of German post-Holocaust generations) should have made this film. The two stars are for Winslet and Kross. The rest sucks."

Twenty years past his glory days in the mid/late 80s, a wrestler (Mickey Rourke) struggles to make ends meet in New Jersey while wrestling on the weekends, taking illegal pain-meds, pursuing a dancer at the local strip club (Marisa Tomei) and trying to reestablish a relationship with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).

This is an engrossing, but gloomy drama about the grim reality of celebrities from practically any field who are long past their prime; it just happens to be a wrestler in this case. People mock how fake wrestling is, but those talented guys bend over backwards to entertain the audience with incredibly painful stunts. The film was shot in the winter in New Jersey and this augments the bleak pall.

On the female front, Marisa is absolutely stunning as Cassidy (aka Pam) and Wood is convincing as the embittered daughter. Their relationships with the protagonist are a mixture of sweet, agonizing and moving.

The soundtrack features several quality songs from the 80s: ""Bang Your Head,"" ""Round and Round,"" ""Balls to the Wall,"" ""Animal Magnetism,"" ""Dangerous,"" ""Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone),"" ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" and more.

The movie reminded me of 80’s metal star Jon Mikl Thor and the excellent documentary “I Am Thor” (2015) and, to a lesser extent, “Anvil: The Story of Anvil” (2008). While neither of these is as melancholic as “The Wrestler,” and “I Am Thor” is sometimes laugh-out-loud amusing, they both effectively show the grey reality of former real-life celebs well past their halcyon days.

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes.

GRADE: A- || Mickey Rourke is on top-form in this depiction of fading wrestling star ""Randy"". Once the talk of the tour, he has fallen on hard times. His body hasn't the strength or stamina it once had and after one fairly convincing pasting in the ring he decides it is time to hang up his loincloth. Whilst his professional life was full of glamour, testosterone and showbiz, his retirement is much less so. Still needing to work, he takes a job in a supermarket and all so he can eek out a living and hopefully establish a relationship with his long estranged daughter ""Stephanie"" (Evan Rachel Wood). When we are in the ring, this is an action-packed and entertaining film that illustrates well just how brief these folks' moment's in the sun can be, at how fickle the audiences can be and at just how little a dilapidated body (and soul) can be left with when injury and age impose themselves. I was much less interested in the slightly contrived, and predictable, familial melodrama into which this sinks in the middle, though. I found myself really disinterested in his love life - with the unconvinced ""Cassidy"" (Marisa Tomei), or in his attempts to repair his torrid relationship with ""Stephanie"". Luckily, that is but an intermission before the grand denouement that sees him in the ultimate grudge match against his equally aged foe ""the Ayatollah"" (Ernest Miller). The script is lively and frequently quite witty, the direction of the fight scenes captures well the physical endurance required by these athletes, but it also shows us that their job is to entertain us - not to actually kill each other! Rourke flips from the wrestler to the tortured father well here, and the film is well worth a watch. || What a film. It’s raw, heartfelt, and unexpectedly tender. Mickey Rourke's character, all battered pride and broken dreams, is a reflection of our own struggles, clinging to past glory while life keeps kicking him in the ribs. The themes of faded stardom, loneliness, and defiance really hit home. It’s not flashy, but it’s utterly gripping. Quietly devastating. I loved it."

Henson, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng",David Fincher,"new york city, navy, funeral, diary, tea, travel, hospital, historical fiction, period drama, magic realism, based on short story, fictional biography, reverse aging, introspective, serene, intense","One of Fincher's masterworks--though I like others better. He's definitely one of the only people alive who could have succeeded with this very intriguing story.

There are moments--when Benjamin's coming into his own, both with Tilda Swinton's character and with Cate Blanchett's--that are amongst the finest and most invigorating I have ever seen in cinema. I'm curious how I'll find it when I rewatch it in a few years. I have the impression that as I come to terms with age and gather more wisdom in my own skin, this story will only grow in my heart and appreciation--for both the highs and the lows. That is a spectacular magic trick for a movie to do--and Fincher's downright full of them. || This movie is in my top 10 movie list in life. It is a cinema achievement that may never be outdone by 'anyone'. Considering that this masterpiece was shot digitally in 2007, it is miles above any CG effort since.

For those of you that haven't seen it: ""SEE IT"". Besides a great story (with one flaw), this film makes illusion and simulation become reality. 

The one flaw: I have great respect for David Fincher, and I am going to go out on a limb and say that he must have been aware of this discrepancy, but went ahead with the story-line as written anyway. ( I hope that's the case).
Benjamin Button was born ""old"", and regressed backwards to die an infant. The flaw in the story-line (and it's a big one), is that as he regresses to youth, he begins to have dementia (Alzheimer's symptoms), along with all of the arthritic pains and problems an old man gets as he ages. At the end, before he dies he loses his memory completely.

Logically, since he was born an old man, those illnesses should have evolved from birth, and improved as he regressed in age. Strangely in the film, he is born with severe arthritis, and can't even walk until he is 7. Why then would he again experience these same symptoms as a child on the way to his death bed (or crib)? He should be in perfect health as a child, and regress to a ""fetus"", and then disappear.  

Other than that major flaw, this movie is a 10. Unfortunately because of the illogical way he dies, I had to give it a 9 out of 10 stars.

One other issue with the plot: If we were to take this movie scenario and try to place it in the real world, Benjamin would have to have been born a ""full sized"", old man, and then after 70 or 80 years, he would have begun to shrink. Since the idea of a woman giving birth to a full sized man is physically impossible, our Benjamin had to be born old and ""tiny"". This of course is another contradiction in the plot, since Benjamin is small ""twice in his life"". We can't dwell on this flaw at all, because if we did we would never get passed it. To enjoy this movie, we must put all the facts and logistics of this scenario aside, and when we do, this movie takes us on a journey unlike any other ever filmed.

RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Bryan Singer, ""Valkyrie"" is a World War II crime thriller based on the true story of the last German plot to assassinate Hitler in the Summer of 1944, although it wasn't a crime, of course, but rather an act of heroism.

Tom Cruise resembles the protagonist, Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, but he lacks his height. Despite this, Cruise is solid in the role and the story works up some quality suspense. Even though we know the plot will fail, you can't help but root for the dissenters' success. Almost 5000 Germans were subsequently executed on grounds of treason for the failed attempt, although not all of them were connected to this specific conspiracy.

The film is both entertaining and educational. It shows that there were thousands of Germans who were willing to risk all to get that lunatic out of office. And they almost succeeded. ""Valkyrie"" is reminiscent of 1976's ""The Eagle has Landed"" in some ways so, if you liked that one, you'll probably appreciate ""Valkyrie."" I like the '76 film a little better.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 1 minute and was shot in Germany, Czech Republic and California. WRITERS: Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander.

GRADE: B || Tom Cruise sports an eye-patch as he takes on the role of Nazi war hero Claus von Stauffenberg. Badly injured he returns to Germany where he is quickly appointed to staff rank with regular access to an appreciative Führer (David Bamber). His arrival co-insides with the increasingly stark realisation from many politicians and officers alike that their hopes of winning the war were dwindling and that something is going to have to be done about removing their neurotic Chancellor and instituting a new national order that might be able to negotiate some sort of peace. Of course, some of the High Command were still fiercely loyal so it was a bit of an eggshell treading operation for von Stauffenberg and his allies as they are not sure whom to trust whilst they put a daring plan into action that could result in a coup treasonable in anyone’s book if they fail. Relying on a fair-to-middling selection of mainly British actors, Bryan Singer does ok with his star here, but the film does really lack jeopardy as it rather trundles out of the traps and gurgles it’s way along before finally enlivening for the last twenty minutes or so. Cruise’s legendary charisma deserts him here and frankly, he hasn’t really the gravitas to carry this off convincingly - and that goes for Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and (fleetingly) Kenneth Branagh too as this whole production struggles to really capture the complexities and dangers faced by these conspirators - the braver ones and the skin-savers. The actual intricacies of their “Valkyrie” operation itself are superficially glossed over and, given we all know what really happened, the film offers us little compelling to get our teeth into. Disappointing, I’d say. Sorry."

I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent ""Snow Angels"" (2007), the potent ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) or the masterpiece ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989), but ""Revolutionary Road"" fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my core criterion for evaluating any flick. In quality and theme, it’s reminiscent of “Joe Versus the Volcano” (1990).

Like “Joe,” it’s a slyly offbeat drama despite being about American conventionality. The best parts involve Michael Shannon as John, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their suburban paradise are crazy (big surprise). But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really crazy. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war ""paradise,"" and rebelled, for better or worse.

Some important questions are raised: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is there more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?

""Revolutionary Road"" has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.

Some have suggested that the film is one POSSIBLE outcome if Jack had survived the end of “Titanic” and married Rose: The once spirited, carefree Jack settles into the robotic grind to pay the bills while Kate is left frustrated at home in suburbia. Regrettably, it’s overall mediocre due to the unengrossing characters and their story, which of course links to the theme its espousing. 

Yet it does have flashes of greatness and it makes you reflect on its points. In some ways, the same message is addressed in ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon,"" to a lesser degree): rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams. The difference is that ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon"") accomplished this with absorbing stories whereas ""Revolutionary Road"" doesn't. Generally speaking, that is. Yet it's still worth catching if its themes trip your trigger.

The film runs almost 2 hours and was shot in Connecticut & New York City.

GRADE: C+ || Can you change your life for love? What’s the border between craziness and frustration? Are we really living our lives? This fantastic movie won 20 awards and 73 nominations. It’s an incredible story and let’s discover why.

The movie is set in Connecticut during the mid-1950 and inspired by the book “Revolutionary Road” written by Richard Yates. It’s a story of love, marriages, families and abortion, ambitions and frustrations, of dreamers and conformists. It’s the daily tale of all of us, on the road of our lives. Looking for an often unachievable and unknown happiness.
 
You will ask yourself “what’s the purpose of this life”? It is just about having a good job, a great house, a wife, children? Or there is something more? Like the love for yourself, for your talents, your passions, your desires and dreams. But to find the right answer requires painful choices to be made, and this where this masterpiece guide us.

Frank and April Wheeler are the protagonists and to give them voice and action, we have two of the most talented and incredible actors in Hollywood: Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, directed by Sam Mendes, in one of his most successful films. It’s not a movie for everyone. It’s very sophisticated, well-crafted, a masterpiece, in my opinion. 

You can read my full analysis for free at this url: https://bit.ly/2HxJTJq || This is a fairly unremarkable family drama that sees ""April"" (Kate Winslet) staying at home with their two children whilst husband ""Frank"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes to work in his office each day - and has the occasional fling with his secretary. ""April"" is probably best described as a frustrated actress and her last stage performance went down a bit like a lead balloon which caused the latest in this couple's fiery rows. She decides that they need a profound change, and so suggests that they decamp to Paris. She will get a job and he can spend his time, reading, writing - generally lolling about looking after the kids. They announce this plan to the world, but no sooner than they they do, their lives become even more unsettled and a maelstrom of turmoil, resentment and loathing starts to emerge - one that clearly illustrates that all is not well, psychologically with ""April. The story really only comes alive when Michael Shannon takes centre screen. His performance as the emotionally charged ""John"" delivers well as the man who has an insightful ability to call a spade a spade - regardless of whom he hurts with his typically near the mark observations. It's all a bit long, slow and there's a great deal of dialogue that doesn't seem to advance the story nor the characters especially. Indeed at times this is really just a series of a good looking and stylishly photographed mid-life crises that is set in 1950s America, but could easily be anywhere else. A few familiar faces pepper the undercast, and the intimate scenes with DiCaprio and Winslet are effective at times, but I found this a little too much like a soap for me. Worth a watch - I'm not certain what the revolutionary element was, though."

13813.0,Defiance,"Based on a true story, during World War II, four Jewish brothers escape their Nazi-occupied homeland of West Belarus in Poland and join the Soviet partisans to combat the Nazis. The brothers begin the rescue of roughly 1,200 Jews still trapped in the ghettos of Poland.",Freedom begins with an act of defiance,"Action, Drama, History, War",137.0,2008-12-31,en,6.845,1780.0,2.8223,"Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell, Alexa Davalos, Allan Corduner","Clayton Frohman, Edward Zwick, Edward Zwick","sibling relationship, fight, brother, world war ii, forest, camp, partisan","**_Survival in the woods during WW2_**

As Nazi forces sweep through Eastern Europe in 1941 the Bielski brothers (Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell) seek refuge in the deep forests on the border of Poland and Belorussia (Belarus). More and more desperate Jews join their ranks for common protection and to oppose the occupying Germans. How can they all survive in the woods during the next four years of war?

Released in 2008-2009, ""Defiance"" is a drama/war film that has a lot going for it: a story based on actual events, good actors, authentic locations (filmed in Lithuania, a mere 100 miles or so from the actual sites), effective cinematography and a quality score. I personally love survival-type films and ""Defiance"" fills the bill, although it's not great like, say, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992).

The filmmakers throw in all kinds of dynamic things to maintain the viewer's attention: Numerous gun battles, an airstrike and a tank, which are all faithful Hollywood-isms. It would've been better to simply focus on the characters and their gritty survival story. How about a deeper examination of individuals reduced to basic necessities? What about a study of people stripped of all civilized influences, struggling with the animalistic side of their psyche, as depicted in the excellent ""Sands of the Kalahari"" (1965)? How about the immaterial yet palpable bond of love which unites and gives life even in the worst possible conditions? There's some of this, of course, but I wanted it to go deeper, like in ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965).

One thought-provoking scene concerns a man seeking to join the ever-growing group in the woods wherein he is asked what he does in order to determine how best to utilize his skills. He ponders it a moment and replies that he's ""an intellectual."" There's of course little use for an intellectual in such a forest community. The region was largely agrarian and so the peasant-types were skilled in at least one practical area as farmers, craftsmen or laborers. But what use was an ""intellectual""?

How many of us are intellectuals and would largely be useless in such a scenario? We'd learn new skills real quick, huh? So the picture works on a what-if level: How long will our present society endure as it is before many of us are forced to live primitively in the sticks? If that happens, I hope you're more than just ""an intellectual.""

""Defiance"" is worthwhile if the survival-in-the-woods plot piques your interest. It's superior to the similar ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003), but IMHO not quite as good as ""Hornet's Nest"" (1970) and ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" although it's not far off.

The movie runs 2 hours, 17 minutes.

GRADE: B/B- || Historically incorrect, Jewish propaganda. Jewish guerilla were not war heros and did not fight Nazi. Instead, they collaborated with Russian underground, stole properties from the villagers and farms for their needs and reselling for Russians. During these robberies they committed unspeakable crimes, leaving them with no chances to survive. They were no heroes to tell stories about, they were war criminals. || Two Jewish brothers - ""Tuvia"" (Daniel Craig) and ""Zus"" (Liev Schreiber) are leading a ramshackle group of escapees from the Nazis into the depths of the Belorussian forest. With little food and weapons, their imperative is to try and build some sort of shelter to see them through the harsh winter whilst trying to find allies to help them survive. This is no mean feat, with hundreds of mouths to feed, and it sorely tests the faith of many and the resilience of their commander who is increasingly at odds with his more pro-active brother. It's ""Zus"" who finally decides to leave and join the approaching Red Army battalion and that leaves ""Tuvia"" and another brother ""Asael"" (Jamie Bell) with quite a challenge as sickness and starvation loom. This isn't a particularly well written drama, nor is Craig really that great either. What works here is the sense of desperation that Edward Zwick manage to present us with. The dense forest, the snow, the wind, the darkness and the wolves. The drudgery of these ordinary people reduced to living little better than animals facing a relentless foe that is bent on an irrational plan of slaughter. Tomas Arana does quite well, if sparingly, as the Soviet commander who is suspicious of his Jewish (traditionally non-combatant) cohort and who is also, clearly, a man who probably ought not to be trusted too far. Just to lighten the mood, the under-used Bell gets a little bit of love interest for when the meagre fires die down of a cold evening. In an environment where it really is live or die, the story touches on issues of collaboration and shows us another hugely effective method employed by their enemy to subdue - and keep subdued - a population ill-equipped to survive hand-to-mouth. It is too long - half an hour could come out without savaging the plot, but it's still worth a watch. Just keep a blanket nearby."

My Bloody Valentine is directed by Patrick Lussier and collectively written by Zane Smith, Todd Farmer and John Beaird. It stars Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Kevin Tighe and Tom Atkins. Music is by Michael Wandmacher and cinematography by Brian Pearson
 
A remake of George Mihalker’s 1981 slasher, the 2009 version was released in a blaze of 3D frenzy, where it absolutely coined it in at the World’s box offices. It’s not hard to see why, for no matter how much we may moan about remakes and the general languid nature of slashers turned out just for coin, there’s a big market out there for them. As it happens this isn’t half bad, oh it’s all very familiar, there’s another Michael Myers clone stalking the residents of some American town and offing them in gruesome ways. Here the perp is The Miner, dressed up in his work clothes, armed with a pickaxe, face covered by a gas mask that in turn makes him creepy looking and gives him Darth Vader breathing exercises to do. 
 
The mystery element is that this new series of murders are being re-enacted from crimes ten years previously, so is the old killer back from the dead, or is there a copycat at large? Enter troubled teenagers, townsfolk acting suspiciously and mucho blood and screaming sitting in tandem together. There’s the requisite amount of nudity, including one of the longest nude scenes ever, while Lussier shows a good knack for blending humour with the terror. The 3D is of a high standard, and the sound mix is incredible, this really is one to give your sub-woofer a work out. It pans out as expected, but it manages to eek out good suspense for its finale and having Atkins and Tighe in the movie is a reassuring presence.
 
The original was no great film anyway, and although this is better, it’s still just a bunch of acting props being killed in different ways. But it is effective and above all else it’s fun. 7/10 || ***Quite good, as slashers go***

The heir of a mine (Jensen Ackles) in a remote town in Pennsylvania returns ten years after a Valentine’s Day massacre that took the lives of 22 people. When a psycho slayer dressed as a miner with a pickaxe also shows up the sheriff (Kerr Smith) naturally suspects the heir, who happens to be the ex-beau of his wife (Jaime King). 

""My Bloody Valentine"" (2009) is a remake of the 1981 slasher but is different enough to view as a sort-of sequel. It includes most of the vital elements for an effective flick of this genre.

The basic formula was well established by ""Halloween"" (1978) and the first two ""Friday the 13th"" flicks (1980-1981): A crazy masked killer and a group of youths in a specific environment, whether a town, camp, forest, college, resort, building, etc. In this case it's a mining town, shot in Kittanning and Bethel, PA, and points nearby along the Allegheny River. So the film gets a big plus for filming somewhere other than friggin’ British Columbia! (Not that there's anything wrong with BC, of course, but enough is enough).

Beautiful women is a must for these types of films and ""My Bloody Valentine"" delivers superbly with Jaime King (Sarah), Megan Boone (Megan) and Betsy Rue (Irene), the latter in an extended nude scene, which I think is unnecessary, but some will obviously appreciate it.

Most importantly, the story is engrossing and keeps you guessing as to the identity of the killer till the very end. Compared to the original movie, it’s more compelling and all-around more entertaining.

The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes.

13177.0,Battle in Seattle,"Thousands of activists arrive in Seattle, Washington in masses to protest the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 (World Trade Organization). Although it began as a peaceful protest with a goal of stopping the WTO talks, it escalated into a full-scale riot and eventually, a State of Emergency that pitted protesters against the Seattle Police Department and the National Guard.","Six lives, six battles, one city.","Action, Drama",99.0,2007-09-07,en,6.314,247.0,0.7799,"Martin Henderson, Michelle Rodriguez, Woody Harrelson, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Carpenter","Stuart Townsend, Stuart Townsend","seattle, washington, protest, based on true story, world trade organisation, 1990s","**It has some points of merit, but lacks neutrality.**

I was too young in 1999 to remember this World Trade Organization meeting. However, I am fully aware that this type of summit is usually a rallying point for demonstrators in favor of a thousand ideals: rebels without a cause, anarchists, socialists, communists, environmentalists, conspiracy theorists...

I don't really know what happened, but there is no doubt that these protests were violent and, to a certain extent, they managed to achieve their objectives, severely disrupting the summit and the life of the city, and becoming a juicier and more relevant matter than the summit itself. In the following summits, there was more care. I could make a series of considerations around the real usefulness of the WTO, or even if there aren't other ways to encourage a greater trade flow and greater ease in commercial exchanges between countries, making it possible to end this, apparently questionable, organization. But one thing I learned in my life: the owners of money usually win these wars, even if they lose some battles along the way.

The film is very competently directed by Stuart Townsend. The director does not hide that his heart and admiration are with the protesters in the streets, and the film is not neutral about that. Thus, we witness the glorification of peaceful protests, the demonization of authorities (even though the police are portrayed as men who only do their job) and even the exposure of many of those who, under the cover of protests, broke and burned things just because it seemed a good idea. Personally, I would have preferred a more neutral approach, because if the idea was to demonize the economy and the WTO, it should have been better contextualized.

The cast has some well-known names, and Martin Henderson turns out to be one of the actors who deserve our applause. He's done a good job, he's in excellent shape, and he's used the material he's been given very well to give personality and depth to his character. I also really liked the performance of Charlize Theron, in the role of her wife. Ray Liotta is very good in the role of a mayor who is overtaken by events. The rest of the cast, however, I felt didn't stand out, and didn't do much more than they really had to.

The film has an extraordinary cinematic beauty, as it manages to recreate very well what was experienced on the streets during those days in December 1999. The way in which everything was recreated is pleasantly aesthetic without losing any kind of credibility or realism. The sets (streets) and costumes also help a lot and the cinematography makes good use of gas fumes and light and shadow effects, in addition to a series of moving camera shots, which transport us to the middle of the action."

I'm a sucker for time travel flicks, and for a very low budget Spanish import, it was fairly entertaining, but check out the much better ""Predestination"" instead if you haven't seen it.  || Timecrimes (2007), titled initially Los cronocrímenes, is one of the best time-travel movies available. Written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, it was made in Spain and performed in Spanish. Reading English subtitles will not distract, however, as much of the movie is visual, and the pacing is not slow but methodical. 

The story revolves around Hector and starts at his house, which he recently moved into. He sees something in the woods behind his house and goes to investigate. He is stabbed, and while running away from the mysterious masked figure, he enters a secret lab in the neighboring field. While hiding from the masked figure, he is transported back in time one hour and makes some amazing discoveries about himself. What must he do, and what is he willing to do, to restore the life he had before his accidental time-traveling adventure?

The story illustrates the complexities of time-travel and what having multiple ""you""-beings in existence at once can lead to. Very entertaining and a definite ""much watch."" || Before I say a word about the movie itself, let me advise you that if you haven’t already seen the preview for this movie, do yourself a favor and Don’t Watch It! Never have I known a preview to give so much away, and it it is particularly heinous in this case as it is a time travel movie, with plot shifts that should be experienced in real time, so to speak. I would have been some old mad if I had watched the preview first.

But on to the movie itself. This is a Spanish language movie with subtitles, but that didn’t detract from my enjoyment of it. It is nicely set up and cleverly done. At one point I guessed right about a little plot twist I saw coming, but there was much more I didn’t predict, which brings us back to how glad I am I didn’t watch that preview. I expect this was a low budget film and there aren’t many characters in it, so don’t expect a glitzy production with awesome special effects. It just tells the story.

Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is the prequel to the previous two Underworld films. It tells the story about what led to the werewolf/vampire feud, with bloody energetic results.

In core essence this is Braveheart/Spartacus, only in CGI laden horror/action form. Michael Sheen buffs up into Karl Urban, who as Lucian (bad ass Lycan) leads his species to a bloody revolt, and Kate Beckinsale has made way narratively for Rhona Mitra, who sexes things up. The action is pulse raising and the Gothic designs and atmospherics are first rate, while the battle royale finale is fit to crown any genre film of its type. 

Problems are evident, though. The constant flow of CGI blood becomes irritating after a while, and Bill Nighy (in spite of being a franchise regular) is still looking miscast! But it has proved to be a series with hairy legs and fangs that refuses to die, a popcorn munchers dream. So enjoy the spectacle and the screenplay homages, and I'll have a bag of tortilla chips and a choc ice please. 6.5/10 || No idea why the rating for this flick is hovering just above 50""%.  As far as prequels go this one is brilliant.  The first movie left a lot of gaps in the story, where did Lucian come from, what started the war, how did he get to be the lover of the King's daughter in the first place.  While there is a lot of epic battles with the gore that goes with, this movie is easily the best movie in the franchise, which is minor heresy on my part since Kate Beckinsale is the quintessential vampire in my book.  Rhona Mitra throws down hard as the rebellious daughter of the King, and her haughtiness and disdain are completely believable to the point we think that Lucian's love for her is unrequited.  I can't go into it any more without spoiling the movie but if Evolution let you down a bit, Rise of the Lycans will restore you faith in the franchise."

An affable mall officer in New Jersey (Kevin James) takes his job seriously while taking care of his daughter and pursuing a cute kiosk attendant (Jayma Mays). When the mall is taken over by a gang of organized thugs, can Paul Blart rise to the challenge?

Whether or not you’ll like “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (2009) will depend on if you appreciate Kevin James and his goofy, unprofane brand of humor, as depicted in The King of Queens, “Zookeeper” (2011) and “True Memoirs of an International Assassin” (2016). While it’s not as good as “Zookeeper,” it’s not far off. After the first 25 minutes or so you’ll find yourself engrossed in Paul’s life; you understand him and like him. You feel for the man as he gazes longingly at a receipt with the handwritten name of his romantic interest. And you’ll root for him and laugh when a serious threat engulfs the mall.

Keir O'Donnell plays Paul’s greenhorn partner, Veck. He’s reminiscent of a young Tim Roth. In other news, Mays has the cutest wide-eyed face.

The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes and was shot entirely in Massachusetts (Burlington, Braintree, Peabody, West Roxbury and Bedford).

After her mother dies in a tragedy, a teen girl (Emily Browning) is sent to a mental hospital. Upon returning to her father’s mansion on the coast of Maine, she reunites with her older sister (Arielle Kebbel) and tries to get along with her dad’s new girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks), her mother’s former nurse, who appears to be taking over. David Strathairn plays the father, a successful author.

“The Uninvited” (2009) is a mystery/horror that combines elements of “The Sixth Sense” (1999), “Half Light” (2006) and “The Ring” (2002), although it’s a little more subdued than the latter. If you like the haunting tone of those movies and the spectacular locations of the latter two, you’ll appreciate it. Browning with her ultra-cute face was 20 during filming, but looks 14. Meanwhile Banks is effective as the biyatch gold-digger and Strathairn is convincing as the clueless father.

The story plays out in a too-predicable manner. If you saw the trailer beforehand it basically tells you everything you need to know. But not really: The last 15 minutes pulls the rug out with some surprising revelations. I heard there was a twist before viewing and went over various possibilities in my mind while watching, but the movie fooled me. Great job on this front. Not everything is as it appears. I’d say more, but I don’t want to spoil it.

My relatively high rating is due to the lingering power of the film's message on individual perception. It's potent and applicable stuff, expertly executed.

The film doesn’t overstay its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 27 minutes. It wasn’t shot in the Northeast, however, but obviously British Columbia (Bowen Island). It’s an American remake of the Korean film “A Tale of Two Sisters” (2003).

GRADE: B+/A- || We survive by remembering. But sometimes we survive by forgetting. 

The Uninvited is directed by The Guard Brothers and written by Craig Rosenberg, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard. It stars Emily Browning, Elizabeth Banks, Arielle Kebbel and David Strathairn. Music is by Christopher Young and cinematography by Daniel Landin.

A remake of Korean film ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", plot finds Anna (Browning) released from a psychiatric institution, she was placed in there following a suicide attempt when her terminally mother died in a boathouse fire. Once home she begins to encounter bad dreams and supernatural visions...

It was yet another American remake of an Asian horror film, at a time when doing so was in vogue, unfortunately this is one of the weakest of the bunch. Not exactly terrible, it's just so unoriginal and devoid of any suspense or chiiling atmosphere. In fact it feels more like a murder mystery piece but with a couple of spook scenes inserted into the narrative. Pic is predominantly saved by the finale, where the story unravels with some genuine surprises. Cast are all fine in perfs, even if Strathairn is utterly wasted in his under written role. 5/10 || Okay psychological thriller featuring a fine performance by Emily Browning. This is one I saw back in '09 and pretty much feel the same way I did back then. Nothing great but worth checking out I suppose. **3.0/5**"

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.

I definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore). Ones so well-written would truly be 'comic book movies' worth watching for me. || Quite dark, but entertaining and very well done. One of the few american animated movies I liked. || Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

I really wish more movies would follow this simple and great movie structure.  Instead of a typical 3-act structure (not that it isn't technically there), the story is much closer to that of a video game.

You have a standard introductory act, but the rest of the movie is split into video game-esque ""levels"" that develop and unlock as Coraline makes new discoveries and completes different sections of the ""map"" / house.

There is a lot of messaging here as well, mostly concerning relationships between children and parents and how to navigate those in regard to real life events, but everything is ""do not tell"" levels of subtle so it's not in your face at all.

The Beldam itself is a magnificent creation of a ""thing that bumps in the night"" style of monster.  While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.

The movie also reminds me a lot of ""The Wizard of Oz"" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies."

Three individuals with mind powers in Hong Kong (Chris Evans, Dakota Fanning & Camilla Belle) vie with agents of a shadowy government agency called the Division over a mysterious suitcase. The super powers include pushers, who can push thoughts into other’s minds; movers, who have the power of telekinesis; watchers, who are seers; sniffers, who can find others; shadowers, who can block watchers and sniffers; screamers, who can attack through shrieks; and more. Djimon Hounsou plays the head agent of the Division. 

“Push” (2009) is a thriller that combines the style and themes of “Lucy” (2014) with the surreal take on a major Asian city of “Lost in Translation” (2003). Imagine the abilities of Professor X, Jean Grey and Magneto of the “X-Men” flicks, but without the costumes and superhero trappings, and you’d have a good idea of “Push.” The setting of Hong Kong is a highlight, but it focuses mostly on the working class underbelly rather than the posh areas of Tokyo seen in “Lost in Translation.”

The style is hip and kinetic, like “Lucy” and “Eye of the Beholder” (1998), and the film does a good job of keeping the complicated elements understandable to the viewer. There’s also a quality score/soundtrack. Yet it’s the least of all these pics mentioned. The story’s just not as engrossing, but it’s not too far off either. The Division is suggestive of MK Ultra on steroids.

BETTER THAN LA DOLCE VITA DON'T @ ME || Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

I don't know if it's that Adam Sandler is playing a dying character, or that Seth Rogan is miserable, that the idea of being a professional comedian is especially appealing, or that they just did a fine job mixing a serious situation with a lot of comedy while mixing in some showcase of humanity, particularly human values.

There are a couple of really good ""finding self"" tropes in this.  It's good to see ""behind the curtain"" of comedy.  The cast is excellent, and not because he strayed from his typical Happy Madison group, but just that they clearly know what it is to be those people and were able to give excellent deliveries.

Anytime you're dealing with a ""character is dying"" trope, it has to be handled a very particular way, and usually that is overly serious (""The Fault in Our Stars""), but adding humor allows the story to be more palatable (""Stranger Than Fiction""), but it requires extreme balance to not trivialize the death of the character (""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium""), and without being fantastic, this does an very good job of finding that balance, just with more ""dick and fart"" jokes.

After watching the trailers, I got the wrong idea that this film was going to be more serious. The previews gave me the false impression that this remake was going to go deeper into Jason's background story or maybe even offer extremely gory murders, when in reality, it is exactly the opposite. I'm not one of those horror lovers who want to know everything related to the villains, their origins and such, but in this case, it would have been acceptable to throw in some flashbacks regarding Jason Voorhees' past. Unfortunately, this remake wastes all the opportunities to make this interesting and instead, it offers an exaggerated and ineffective amount of comedy situations that are badly placed and ruin the possibility of creating a genuine horror feeling. Comedy situations in slasher films are no surprise, but in this remake, the attempted comedy is badly placed and seems like it was forced by the producers to make the film more marketable. I will give an example: after a really tense and dramatic persecution, the film cuts to a scene involving a horny stereotyped hillbilly lusting over a mannequin, while Jason silently walking up to him from behind, with the obvious intention of slashing him. How can they mix cheap humor and tension in one scene? The results obviously cannot be good. It was a murder scene, but instead of causing uneasiness, tension or shock, everyone at the movie theater was laughing at the guy talking about how he lost his virginity to a mannequin. The worst part is that the so-called humor is extremely 15-years-ago and even back then, it wouldn't have been funny.

The gore is very unsatisfying also. Nowadays, slasher films usually offer creative and really brutal murders and even if the plot is not so good, you can always at least settle for that. When I found out that Marcus Nispel was directing this, I thought it was good news, because he directed ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" remake, which is a fine example of a movie that may not be as good as the original, but at least it offers something more serious, gory and overall fulfilling. Naturally, since Marcus Nispel also directed 'Friday the 13th' remake, I expected something in the same vein as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake. Sadly, that was a very inaccurate assumption. In this film, the gore is completely unsatisfactory and in some cases, the murders are even funny. The entire movie theater burst into a maniacal laughter during some of the murders and I must say that in those cases, I had to agree with them.

Another thing that bothered me about this film, is the fact that they could have showed a little bit more about the character of Mrs. Voorhees. Unfortunately, she only appears during the first seconds of the film and they cut her scenes with the opening credits, which is a disgrace. The confrontation between Mrs. Voorhees and the counselor girl is perhaps one of the finest points of the entire 'Friday the 13th' series, and it should have been remade in an equally tense way. Cutting the scene with the opening credits is, in my opinion, a self-sabotage. I think it's safe to say that many fans of the original film were eager to learn some more about Jason's beloved mother and see her more time on the screen. But no... apparently, they didn't even take advantage of that opportunity to make this movie more interesting. True, we see a little bit about Jason's environment, since the characters get to take a tour inside his house and it was a good idea to show his bedroom and evidence the fact that once upon a time, the killing machine was an innocent boy with a normal life. However, that doesn't make up for the lack of space that Mrs. Voorhees had on the story.

'Friday the 13th' turned out to be a teen comedy with lousy humor and some badly placed murders from the beginning until the end. Watch it if you're curious, but unless you're a silly teenager who thinks everything is funny, don't expect anything even remotely good, because you'll be devastated. || ***Scarier and with a more dangerous Jason, but not as fun***

I became a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series after seeing ""Part V: A New Beginning"" (1985) on TV in the late 90s and have subsequently digested all of the films in the series. This '09 reboot takes elements of the first four films, drops all campy elements seen in Part III (and V, VI, IX & X) and provides better scares with a more dangerous Jason, who runs, shoots arrows, uses traps and schemes. In the original series Jason was comparable to an unstoppable zombie-like force, particularly as the series progressed where Jason became more & more infernal and monstrous. Here he's more human, which makes sense since it's early in the timeline and Jason hasn't yet morphed into the hellish zombie he became in later segments.

The appeal of the series for is not the gore or kills but rather the plot of a group of youths gathering in the wilderness; the inclusion of a psycho killer on the loose adds a necessary element of threat & suspense, and Jason's a quality nemesis/monster. Simply put, ""Friday the 13th"" is an entertaining series with creepy elements, but I never found the flicks all that scary, not even the first two films, which are the most serious in tone, along with IV, VII, VIII and XI. Of course there are jump-scares galore, but that's not what I'm talking about. With the third installment, campiness was added, which made several of the installments even less scary. The good thing about this '09 reboot is that it throws out the campy aspects and opts for a more serious approach. In addition, it has a couple of sequences that produce actual frights, something I never experienced with the rest of the series, as well as scenes with genuine suspense, like when Jason chases the three protagonists through the tunnels, etc.

Speaking of the three protagonists, the cast is filled with youthful no-names, but the three main protagonists, a brother & sister and a brunette who takes a liking to the brother, are good and likable. It's always nice to have some people you can root for. Really, there are only two characters who are unlikable, a creepy redneck hick (and his ""hot"" mannequin, lol) and the arrogant alpha-male whose father owns the vacation house.

I found one aspect of the film highly unusual and unique. I'm referring to the 24-minute prologue before the opening credits. This has to be one of the longest prologues in film history. I have to give credit to the filmmakers for being creative and trying something different.

This reboot also just plain LOOKS better than all those older films; I'm referring mostly to the creepy woods at night. This is to be expected, of course, with the advancements in filming technology since 1980, not to mention the bigger budget.

The series is known for its excellent assortment of women in every entry, but this one's not quite as good as most of the films in the franchise. There's the excellent Amanda (America Olivo) in the first act and also Whitney (Amanda Righetti) and Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) as the two female protagonists. They're solid, but not in the same league as Pam in Part V, Agent Marcus in Part IX and Heather in Part XI (FvJ). I suppose it's all a matter of taste though. 

The film was shot in the heart of Texas, mainly in regions relatively near Austin.

FINAL WORD: My biggest criteria for judging the worth of a film is whether or not it pulls me in and makes me forget about the passing of time. This '09 reboot succeeds in this respect. Although nothing can replace the initial 1980 film and its immediate sequel, this reboot should be given credit for generating a few genuine scares, which I rarely if ever experienced with the rest of the series; not to mention providing a worthy trio of protagonists, as well as scenes with genuine momentum. 

Other than these factors, the reboot is just more of the same, but it's at least as good as the better sequels, although it's not as fun as several of them because it shoots for serious horror. This is good, but the first half is more effective than the second. And it fails to approach the greatness of the '09 remake of ""The Last House on the Left,"" a veritable masterpiece that transcends the usual one-dimensional nature of most slasher flicks, not that I would expect (or necessarily want) that for ""Friday the 13th."" 

I have the ""Killer Cut"" that runs 105 minutes, while the theatrical version runs 97 minutes. Needless to say, this is a heavy R-rated picture.

GRADE: B || **The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2009.**

_Friday the 13th_, originally released in 1980 began one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Now, 31 years later, the newest incarnation of _Friday the 13th_ has just been released on Special Edition DVD. It seems unlikely that the director of the first film Sean S. Cunningham (who is also the producer of the 2009 version) could ever have seen just where the monster he had helped to create would go. So now, with the series being given one of those oh-so-popular of late ""reboots"", it's important to take a look at what Jason Voorhees has been up to, what has changed, and just as importantly, what hasn't.

The film loosely follows the progression of the first four _Friday the 13th_ films, the opening credit sequence has mother dearest Pamela Voorhees on June 13, 1980 confronting one of the Camp Crystal Lake counsellors , she is promptly decapitated with a machete, as per the original story. This is a powerful intro to the rest of the movie, as a reboot, you have to show Mrs. Voorhees at some point in time, but it can't take up too many of those valuable 90 minutes. At this point the film begins to deviate from the original, we get some of Harry Manfredini's musical score (Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma) but this time round Jason is very much alive, sees his mother beheaded and picks up his iconic machete and some very bad habits from here on in. After the credits there is a new bunch of kids, looking to score some pot, have a little pre-marital sex, get wasted, go places they're not allowed, and just generally set themselves up to die. But something is missing... that would be... Oh yes, the cast! Only a single member of the ""media-hyped"" actors portrays a character in this group, so we already know that these guys are going nowhere. Only after their demise are we given the ""_FRIDAY THE 13TH_"" movie title, and the film begins. Unfortunately, by the time this happens, we have already been through a good set of characters, and it feels like watching a sequel after you're 23 minutes in.

The new group of rowdy teenagers have much the same plans in store as the last, but they are much less believable characters when compared to the ones we had just minutes ago. They are somewhat saved by the performances of Travis Van Winkle (from _Accepted_) as Trent, the ""rich asshole"" of the movie, and Aaron Yoo as Chewie, the lovable little stoner. Jared Padalecki's character Clay (a reboot of Rob from _Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter_) is wholly out of place, maybe it's his _Supernatural_ fame or maybe it's his deliberate intention to not have a good time. Either way the protagonist of the entire film really doesn't seem like he belongs in the movie at all. Sort of a down point when you think about it.

While the film didn't seem to have plot holes per se, it very much seems as though they tried to fit the creation of the film in before it was due to be released on Friday, February 13th. Now don't get me wrong, I love novelty and a good theatrical gimmick as much as anyone can, but know what I care about even more? The end product (especially when it comes to _Friday the 13th_)! The time could have been much better spent on filling in all the little bits where the movie just seemed to be missing something. You're not quite sure what it is, but that's their job to figure out.

The hype over the film's sexual content seems to have been grossly over-exaggerated. Supposedly Michael Bay walked out of the first screening due to the sex scenes. After having watched the film, I find this very difficult to believe. Although the sex does seem to have been thrown in for the Hell of it (isn't it always), there really isn't all that much. But, after all of the problems the film goes through, they get the most important thing right, Jason. With culturally recognised hockey mask and machete in tow, Mr. Voorhees does his thing, and he does it well. Whilst this particular incarnation of Jason is wholly more believable than any of the others, Derek Mears makes it work, he's not a supernatural boogieman-esque killing machine, he's a hunter, he's a natural, he's almost the anti-hero. Upon first hearing that Kane Hodder was yet again not to be playing the role of Jason Voorhees, I think a little part of me died inside. But I submit, Derek Mears has given the best representation of Jason I think we've ever seen.

The 2009 reboot of _Friday the 13th_ is the type of movie that you can watch, and when it's finished, want to go right back to the beginning and watch it all over again, you're just not sure why...

After a good commercial success, the production of a second film ""Pink Panther"" was foreseeable, in an eventual attempt to resurrect the franchise that was successful thirty years ago, thanks to the talent of Peter Sellers. Despite the chorus of negative reviews, the film went ahead, but was unable to learn from the predecessor's weaknesses and weaknesses. All the salvific qualities that I observed in the previous film are still very present here, but the problems and the less positive points became even more evident.

Steve Martin continues, for me, to be one of the strengths of the film. It may displease a lot of people, but I think the actor was competent and did what was asked of him well. However, it seems to me undeniable that the material he was given to work with was weak, and the jokes designed for the character are not very interesting and do not deviate from the usual clichés of cheap and easy-going American comedies. Jean Reno and Emily Mortimer are still here, and both actors received more attention, more screen time and more relevance in this film. The two, each in their own way, play key roles in the plot and continue to do so to the best of their ability. The addition of John Cleese was really a bonus, as I felt several times that there was good working chemistry between him and Martin. The film also has good performances by Alfred Molina, Lily Tomlin, a decent (although not so good) performance by Andy Garcia, a cameo by Jeremy Irons and an unknown but sexy Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who was chosen, I think, precisely because she's beautiful.

If the level of the cast has improved, and almost everyone seems to give a reasonably decent performance, the same cannot be said for the script, a ream of paper that has not been able to give them something truly good to shine. In fact, the script is the biggest problem with the film itself: the story told is too unrealistic, too far-fetched to be logical. Starting with the simple idea of a ""dream team"" of international detectives, full of egos and vanities, but condemned to work together to solve a series of crimes, different from each other, although apparently committed by the same man! It doesn't make sense, just like stolen items, precious pieces of art or history, but impossible to generate real interest in a thief (unless the idea was to ask for a ransom on the return of the stolen object). And then there are some details that are simply not acceptable: the fact that Clouseau doesn't seem to have the slightest idea who the Pope is, for example...

Technically, the film is very similar to its predecessor: the cinematography and film work reasonably well, and Paris is a beautiful, cinematic city. Again, the opening credits are very well executed, and Mancini's melody is well-used. However, the film has almost no soundtrack beyond that, and what it does have isn't particularly good or well-used. The editing seems clumsy and the pacing of the film is awkward, inharmonious, wasting time on silly things and rushing into scenes that deserved a few more minutes. The effects aren't great, and the movie, as a whole, looks cheaper and less professional than its immediate predecessor."

Two brothers, David & Peter, kidnap Tracey, the daughter of local tough guy gangster Arnie, they hold her to ransom for the sum of £100,000. What they hadn't bargained into the equation is that Tracey is one tough feisty lady, and that a turn of events will lead them to something far more scary than big bad gangster Arnie.

This is the second feature from director Paul Andrew Williams, and bearing in mind that his debut effort was the highly lauded gritty drama London To Brighton, it's no surprise to find that some folk are a little bemused as to the genre splicing nature of The Cottage. The Cottage is far more in keeping with Christopher Smith's 2006 horror comedy, Severance, and certainly it wouldn't be out of place as a double bill with that criminally undervalued picture.

Very much a film of two halves, this picture is likely to prove a very divisive piece, and it will (has) only find an audience based on word of mouth alone. You will be hard pressed to find any sort of press marketing that will prepare you for the type of genre fusion film you are getting. Already, based on the comments written on this site thus far, you can see that some people were confused (or annoyed) by the tonal shift for the second half of the film. The first half sees poles apart brothers, David & Peter, swapping comedy dialogue as they whisk through a number of exchanges and circumstances with the marvellously volatile Tracey. While the second part of the picture hits you over the head with a quick switch to horror formula that has catering fulfilment for the gore junkies amongst us.

And this is where the problem lies with many, why didn't the film stay as a kidnap farce? Why didn't it set its stall out to be a horror film from the off? There is no denying that the films' high points come with the horror moments, but the film is first and foremost a comedy, from the first reel to the cheeky end of credits sequence it is what it is. As deliciously sick as the gore shift is, The Cottage never once takes its tongue out of its bloody cheek. It's obvious that Paul Andrew Williams is having fun here, and he is clearly hoping his audience will as well. View it as an all encompassing comedy/horror/thriller in that order and you wont go far wrong.

Andy Serkis plays David, the tough brother of the two, with Serkis doing a wonderful line in both visual and vocal comedy. This benefits Reece Shearsmith as Peter, a character so far under the thumb he can barely be seen. Shearsmith feeds off of Serkis to seal the comedy deal for this odd brotherly couple. British tabloid fave Jennifer Ellison plays Tracey, literally swearing for England to have the audience divided as to if they want her to survive or not! But it's a gutsy show from her and one hopes she ventures into this territory a bit more often. There is nothing new or fresh here, and this wont win any awards; even in its homeland of England, but it is FUN and it shows a director intent on making films from different genres. 8/10"

Supposedly grounded in truth, The Haunting in Connecticut is a decent little spooker, yet still a pic that has all the pitfalls of other notable films of its ilk. Plot for what it's worth has a family move into a new home, only to find that it has ghosts and ghoulies residing within. But why?

There's good strength in the family dynamic at work here, the eldest son has cancer and is undergoing treatment. Thus he becomes the conduit for the strange happenings, and this as his parents fight impending grief and personal worries. The scares toddle along effectively, atmosphere via camera work and sound effects is perfectly efficient, and the story has enough mystery about it to carry you through to the end.

Unfortunately there's a lot of daft stuff as well, I mean who in their right mind would sleep in a basement room and not force open an adjoining door to see what is in there? It's these ridiculous leaps of faith required that if you are not willing? Then they kill the movie for you. The ending also takes some believing, such is the rampant stench of Hollywood of it all.

Well performed in the main (Virginia Madsen solid as a rock/Elias Koteas shining in spite of being under used), this deserves to be rated above average. But ultimately it rings hollow at times and quickly runs out of scares in the last third. 6/10"

Ah yes, the good old disaster movie, a genre of film that continues unabated through the decades, this in spite of critical indifference. But the paying public still keep turning up in droves, even in this new technological age. Where once was models being destroyed, and paintings forming elegant backdrops, now is whizz bangery that costs a fortune. Still great fun, though, which is why something like Knowing exists and has many fans. 

It's a splendid piece of sci-fi hokum pulsing with supernatural overtones, a gentle creeper unravelling the mystery in layers until the final countdown begins. The science is obviously dubious (it's a movie folks) and the air of pessimism that hovers consistently over proceedings (not only is the world in trouble, but all the protags have miserable issues as well), may be too much for some. However, Cage is as committed as ever, Proyas yet again proves himself a beautiful visualist, while the scenes of carnage are truly harrowing and unforgettable.

A disillusioned professor in the Boston area (Nicolas Cage) acquires a document that has successfully predicted tragedies for the last fifty years, but new ones as well (!). Rose Byrne plays the daughter of the seer.

“Knowing” (2009) is a quality drama/mystery with elements of disaster/sci-fi and even a little horror. It’s along the lines of wonder-inducing flicks like “The Mothman Prophecies” (2002), “Contact” (1997), “The Forgotten” (2004), “The X-Files: Fight the Future” (1998), “Signs” (2002), “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (2008) and “War of the Worlds” (2005). If you favor the style and themes of those movies you’ll probably like this one.

The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute and was shot in Victoria, Australia, with establishing shots of the Boston/Cambridge area.

Of course, the Lisbeth character is the real hero here. A rough childhood and beyond have molded her into a tough lady indeed, mentally, physically and emotionally. Oddly enough, she is the only character who seems to show any growth by the end of the film, perhaps partly due to her having so much room to grow emotionally."

Not just because it ended a little abruptly, but mostly because I so thoroughly enjoyed this film, that I was seriously disappointed when it was over. It's like that book that's so compelling that you just want to inhale every word, but dread to actually finish.

Sunshine Cleaning is about two sisters, who, driven by dire financial straits, decide to start ""a biohazard removal/crime scene clean-up service"", cleaning up the houses of people who died gruesome deaths. The premise is fairly simple, but executed in a very lovely, heart-warming way, half tragedy – half comedy. Because of course, this film is not only about cleaning up other people's mess, but also about cleaning up some of their own baggage along the way, especially when the sisters are confronted with the memory of a death akin to what is now their daily business. Somewhere in between all this they have to deal with their eccentric father, the elder sister's peculiar son, love, loss, failure and a glimmer of hope. Reading this back now I realise this actually sounds really cheesy and sentimental, but I would have hated it if it was. Trust me.

Amy Adams plays Rose, the eldest of the two, and Emily Blunt plays Norah, the rebellious younger sister. Rarely have I seen such great chemistry and energy between a leading pair. These two women make it seem like they've been working together for years, and physically they're a perfect match too, they actually look they could be sisters. Rose is obviously the mature, sensible one, whereas Norah just kind of takes things as they come, not worrying and not taking responsibility for her life. Though they seem to be bound not so much by kinship, but rather by a mutual fate and childhood hardship that has left its mark on both of them, although they deal with it very differently. Rose tries desperately to build a better life for herself and her son, but rarely finds any luck on her path. Norah just wings it and refuses to grow up.

Both Amy Adams and Emily Blunt prove to have great star quality and talent, and I think I can now officially call myself a fan of both. They are raw and real, one is sweet and the other is sour, without overacting anything. Alan Arkin is great as their dad. Eccentric, bitter yet loving, idealistic and seemingly in a mild state of denial. He plays pretty much the same character as in that other (great!) film of Sunshine Cleaning's producers, Little Miss Sunshine, where he also played the grumpy granddad. This type of role seems to be custom-made for him. Another great part is played by professional chameleon Clifton Collins, Jr. He plays Winston, the owner of a cleaning supplies shop, and he turns out to be that small shimmer of good luck that Rose so desperately needs. Actually, everyone in this film is so perfectly cast that it almost seems like this is a real family, in a real situation. It just doesn't feel contrived in any way, despite the lack of originality and obvious pitfalls where the story could have easily crashed and burned into a wasteland of melodrama and false sentiment. But like I mentioned earlier, this doesn't happen at any point. Usually when a film is on the borderline of becoming a total cliché, and yet works out successfully, it is because of one or maybe two factors. However, with Sunshine Cleaning, it's all of them. Cast, screenplay, dialogue, direction, camera work, production, just everything is wonderful. I'm actually running out of superlatives to describe this film.

I'm inclined to give this film 10 stars, however there is just one small thing that kind of failed in my opinion and that's the ending. Nothing wrong with it story-wise, it just ended so abruptly that it feels like they literally ran out of tape. It actually kind of threw me off. But... oh, what the heck, this film deserves 10 stars, easily.

In conclusion, Sunshine Cleaning is just a beautifully crafted story about falling (hard) and getting back up on your feet again. It has a real indie-feel to it, it's basically just a pretty little art house gem. Funny thing – while I'm writing this, 4 Non Blondes' ""What's Up"" is playing in the background, and it feels strangely appropriate to the feeling of this film. So if you want to know what to expect of Sunshine Cleaning, listen to that song, it really captures the essence of the story. 

I can't think of much more to say to sell this film, all I can do is strongly recommend Sunshine Cleaning to pretty much anyone and everyone. It's wonderful.

Following a calamitous European tour, Lips and Robb, now in their fifties, set off to record their 13th album in one last attempt to fulfill their boyhood dreams.","At fourteen, they made a pact to rock together forever.

This is a documentary chronicling the Toronto metal band Anvil, focusing on the friendship and aspirations of the two main band members, singer/guitarist Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner.

The band formed in the late 70s as Lips, but changed their name to Anvil upon obtaining a record deal in 1981. The mid-80s were a good time for the young band and they were expected to go on to great success, but it was not to be. Guitarist Dave Allison left the band in 1989 followed by bassist Ian Dickson in 1993. But Steve & Robb soldiered on with new members, releasing album after album up to the present (16 studio albums altogether, as of this writing). When the film was shot, Ivan Hurd was the second guitarist with Glenn ""Glenn Five"" Gyorffy on bass. Both are featured in the movie while original members Allison and Dickson are featured in the deleted scenes on the DVD (their scenes shouldn't have been cut IMHO).

This is a great inspirational documentary whether you like Anvil and metal/hard rock or not. I really like the band, but never heard their stuff until 2009 when I rented the 1988 movie Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers,"" which features two songs from Anvil's 1987 album STRENGTH OF STEEL, the catchy ""Straight Between the Eyes"" and ""Wild Eyes."" One critic claimed that their 1982 album METAL ON METAL was their best-selling recording, but that's simply not true, STRENGTH OF STEEL was; and, although it's maligned by some fans, it's easily one of their top albums and not ""too commercial,"" as some erroneously contend (check out songs like ""Concrete Jungle,"" ""Paper General,"" ""Kiss of Death"" and the aforementioned ""Straight Between the Eyes"").

Anvil were just as good in their own unique way as any of the so-called Big Four, Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer and Megadeth. If you don't believe me, check out their top albums, like WORTH THE WEIGHT. (The album being recorded in the movie, THIS IS THIRTEEN, is actually NOT one of their better recordings, song-wise, nor is the follow-up JUGGERNAUT OF JUSTICE, although each have their points of interest). So why didn't Anvil AT LEAST attain the success of the secondary bands of the Big Four (i.e. Megadeth and Slayer)? Cheap production of their 80's albums may be one reason, although the production wasn't THAT bad for the era and certainly listenable; it was superior, for instance, to the production of albums by the contemporary Venom. Perhaps their location had something to do with their inability to reach the next level, but then how did Rush (another Toronto-based band) become so successful? (Then again, Rush switched from prog metal/rock to pop rock in the 80s). Bad management is likely another possibility. The reason is probably a combination of factors, including the band's sense of humor, Lips' outrageous antics and their sometimes goofy or juvenile lyrics (e.g. ""Straight Between the Eyes"").

In any case, this is a great documentary on the travails of trying to make it in a struggling rock/metal band. Their European tour shows that the lifestyle is difficult and takes dedication, to say the least: They miss trains, arrive late at a club in Prague because they were lost, play before small non-crowds, don't get paid and are offered goulash as a substitute. At a festival in Transylvania with a 10,000-seat capacity only 174 people show up. While there are certainly some high points on their tour it's mostly terrible. Steve, ever the optimist, responds, ""Everything on the tour went drastically wrong. But at least there was a tour for it to go wrong on.""

I know of a local struggling metal band, by the way, that's currently touring Europe and I'm sure they're facing the exact same kinds of challenges.

Anvil's family members are loyal, but think maybe they should throw in the towel. Yet Steve & Robb march forward in faith. A famous producer decides to produce their next album THIS IS THIRTEEN (2007), but it's going to cost thousands of dollars. Where are they going to get the money? And how are they going to release the album without a record contract? A Japanese promoter shows interest in having them play at a festival, but will more than a handful of fans show up?

Then you have Steve and Robb's great friendship, which is seriously tested at times, like during the stress of recording their new album in England: Tempers flare, one quits in frustration and the other apologizes. Will they stay together?

""Anvil: The Story of Anvil"" is an entertaining lesson on faith in one's calling, perseverance, friendship, teamwork, glory/humility and the nature of true success.

The film doesn't wear out its welcome at 80 minutes.

It's 1987 and James Brennan is home for the summer after earning himself a degree in Renaissance Studies. Which unsurprisingly isn't any use to him when trying to gain employment in this part of Pittsburg. Which is now a problem since his planned trip to Europe has fell by the wayside due to his father's enforced unemployment. So thus he finds himself working at Adventureland, a rusting time warp amusement park where only odd balls and idiots appear to frequent. But here James will make friends, learn life lessons and maybe just find true love?. 

Be under no illusions, Adventureland is no teen sex comedy reliant on crude jokes and cringe slap-stick moments to get its humour. Which as it's brought to us by the director of Superbad may come as something of a surprise. Greg Mottola is the said director, who here has crafted an ode to his own teenage strife's concerning first jobs and first loves. Though not really offering anything new as such, I mean the old ""summer I came of age"" film is hardly new is it? Mottola has however managed to blend youthful spirits with a serious kink and nicely cloak it in a bittersweet 80s haze. 

Some parts are clearly aimed at the guffaw teen viewers, awkward erections and friends who punch you in the testicles - tee hee hee, Adventureland feels, and is, a subtle film made by someone who clearly lived it. The care and thought that Mottola has put into it benefits the cast as much as it does the viewers. Jesse Eisenberg (James) is a splendid bit of casting, almost poetically slow, he nicely plays it to have the upcoming tribulations totally believable. Enter Kristen Stewart as Em, pretty and smartly essaying a girl, soon to be woman, trying to make sense in her off kilter world. Her scenes with both Eisenberg and the buff Ryan Reynolds, in a role that takes some skill to get as right as he does, are the highlights of the piece. While Martin Starr is the other performance of note as the pipe smoking intellectual, Joel. 

What youngsters that I know who have seen the film have had less than favourable reactions to it. This can probably be put down to two things. One is that the expectation of another Superbad-a-like comedy has not been met. Two is that, you know what folks? Mottola hasn't made this for kids, he's made it for those who were once kids themselves in a decade not so very long ago... 8/10"
