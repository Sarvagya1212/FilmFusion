It Happened on Fifth Avenue is directed by Roy Del Ruth and the screenplay adapted by Everett Freeman & Vick Knight from a story by Herbert Clyde Lewis & Frederick Stephani. It stars Don DeFore, Ann Harding, Charles Ruggles, Victor Moore, Gale Storm, Grant Mitchell and Alan Hale Jr.

Aloysious T. McKeever (Moore) is a hobo gentleman who squats in empty mansions while their rich owners are away for the holiday seasons. This Christmas in New York he's having one of his stays at the home of Michael O'Connor (Ruggles), the second richest man in the world. But where once it was just him and his dog, McKeever opens up his adopted home to Jim Bullock (DeFore), an ex Army veteran who has fell on hard times. This sets the wheels in motion for old friends to also find their way to the mansion, so too does O'Connor's daughter, Trudy (Storm), who in all the confusion falls in love with Jim. But that's not all, this opens the way for Michael O'Connor to be coerced into posing as a hobo in his own home! Which in turn gets extra complicated when Mary O'Connor (Harding), Trudy's mother and Michael's divorced wife, also rocks up to be part of the homeless furniture. It's a nutty Christmas for sure, but Christmas is a time of miracles after all.

The back story to the film sees it as the first release from ""B"" movie studio Allied Artists. The story was first optioned by Liberty Films as a project for ""Frank Capra"", who instead chose to make ""It's a Wonderful Life"". It's no surprise that Liberty thought it a good project for Capra because the story is very Capraesque, but as it turned out, Del Ruth acquired the story and made the film for A A. Though receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Original Story (It lost out to ""Valentine Davies"" for ""Miracle on 34th Street""), Del Ruth's film has remained largely unknown in the pantheon of the Christmas movie. Obviously not helped by the success of Capra's film over the years, thus it has become the film that Capra left to make his holiday classic. Pic was further hindered by getting a release at Easter! Some what strange given that the film climaxes at Xmas and thematically ties in with the season of good will. After a run on the TV schedules in the 50s had ceased, the film practically disappeared from the public conscious, but a cult fan base existed and the advent of the internet kept the film alive and up for discourse on forums. Thankfully in 2008 Warner Home Video saw fit to give the film a scrub up DVD release, so now the film can rightly find a new and deserving audience.

Everything in the film is telegraphed, this is a message movie at the holiday time and where it's going to is exactly where many other similar movies eventually end up. It's a testament to Del Ruth and his professional cast that we the audience are happy to be taken for a ride down this well sign posted road. Though not containing the overtly dark aspects of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Fifth Avenue"" does contain a sad edge from which to launch onwards to the warmth that most Xmas movie viewers seek. Themes concerning the homeless (ex-servicemen no less), selfish wealth and broken hearts all feature prominently in the narrative, that these will flourish into happiness, life lessons learned and second chances is classic holiday season fervour. But the edginess has made its point and we still come away knowing that not everybody is well off around the Xmas period, so lets spare a thought indeed eh...

Some minor itches do exist, though. The film is overlong at almost two hours and DeFore doesn't really cut it as an heroic ex army guy - come - romantic lead. However, with the likes of Moore, Harding and the brilliant Ruggles around him, not to mention Storm's classical beauty, DeFore's inadequacies barely make a ripple in the story. There's even some nice musical numbers to take in - with ""That's What Christmas Means To Me"" the undoubted highlight. In short the film is fit to be on the same list as ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""The Bishop's Wife"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"". So if you like those film's then you really should get much from this delightful little piece. Seek out and enjoy. 8/10"

Now, I'm not a prolific watcher of the rom-com genre and honestly I've probably only seen a few of them throughout my entire life to this point. I bring this up because it seems like most of the criticisms people have of this film deal with the idea that it's not all that original and the only thing it did differently was add in foul language. I, on the other hand, really enjoyed this film for what it is. I think this is primarily because I'm still pretty inexperienced with the rom-com genre, but I also think it's because there's nothing really ""wrong"" with this film. Does it lean more on romance than comedy? Sure, but I actually appreciated that choice. Is the story about as surface level as it gets? Yes, but I also think that the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher largely makes up for that flaw. I knew, along with everyone else who has seen this film, how it was going to end the entire time, but I was still interested in how it would get to that point, and I can't say that I was dissatisfied when the credits rolled. 

In the end, No Strings Attached is a perfectly fine romantic comedy. It's not going to blow your socks off, but you'll get your fix off of it."

In 1875, a squire in England and his adopted son (Robert Stephens & Robert Powell) find a possible means of acquiring immortality by trapping the spirit of death, aka the mythological ‚Äòasphyx‚Äô or what we would call the Grim Reaper. Unfortunately, when people play God unforeseen negative things tend to happen.

""The Asphyx"" (1972) is thinking man‚Äôs Brit horror in the vein of ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" (1958), ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" (1967) and ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed ""(1969), as well as the soon-to-come  ‚ÄúThe Creeping Flesh‚Äù(1973). It‚Äôs the most obscure of these films because it‚Äôs arguably the least of ‚Äôem, but it does feature one of the most imaginative concepts.

The special effects concerning the captured asphyx are effective and hold up.

Jane Lapotaire as Christina is a unique choice for the lead female. Fiona Walker is also on hand.

Look closely at Robert Powell and you might remember him in the iconic role of ‚ÄúJesus of Nazareth‚Äù from 1977.

The movie runs 1 hour, 23 minutes, but there is a longer U. S. version with about 12 extra minutes, which is inferior because it includes grainy footage from an SD print. The shorter version is the one to go with because the extra material bogs it down IMHO. The flick was shot at Shepperton Studios, just southwest of London.

GRADE: B- || ""Sir Hugo"" (Robert Stephens) is a much respected scientist in Victorian Britain fascinated by motion pictures. Whilst filming his friends punting on the river; they have a calamitous accident and die. What shows up on his photography afterwards intrigues him - it seems as though a mysterious form is taking over their dead bodies. Could this be the ""The Asphyx"" of ancient Greek myth? He and his son (Robert Powell) decide to try and investigate further with the aim of capturing one in the hope of potentially achieving immortality. It's well put together, the story and script are solid and the lead performances with Jane Lapotaire as ""Christina"" are quite entertaining to watch. I found it a wee bit long, but give it a go."

I know I'll just catch this in dvd. But since there's nothing to do and it's my birthday and Mayi will treat me, okay!

The animation was great. I really liked the animation. The story was alright too. But the pacing of the story was slow that I was close to snoozing off. I felt like there were some scenes in the movie that should've been cut off. || 'Rango' is typically one of those movies that can't quite be categorized into this or that little genre of comedy. Obviously, it's an animated film. Is it a kiddie movie? Well‚Ä¶ kind of. Allow me to elaborate. The film starts off absolutely hilariously, with an accident, half a road kill and a journey through the desert turned into a maniacal chase as soon as a hungry hawk gets wind of Rango's presence. After meeting a lovely lizard named Beans, he ends up in the small town of Dirt. Where, after a good deal of bluff and dumb luck, he is appointed sheriff. So far, no harm, no foul, just good comedy. In fact, nearly-wetting-my-pants-laughing-out-loud-comedy.

However, at this point is where it all turns just a little bit haywire. No real damage done, just a small sense of cluelessness as we go along. The story continues as though Gore Verbinski and John Logan were just trying to think of as many weird situations as they possibly could whilst forcibly trying to mash it up into one, cohesive storyline. Truth be told, seems like they were trying just a little bit too hard. It actually gets even a little bit boring here and there, where the pacing kind of sinks in up to the point where it all comes together and starts to make sense again. (Mind you ‚Äì this could also be due to the fact that I was watching the extended version, not the theatrical one, but still.) But fear not, no real quality is lost, as 'Rango' provides some of the most excellent and funny characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. They also rounded up a perfect voice-cast, with Johnny Depp who doesn't sound anything like Jack Sparrow, but still adds the same kind of awkward quirkiness to his character. Alfred Molina's part is small but vital, and I'll bet you've never heard an armadillo with a perfect Mexican twang before‚Ä¶ Bill Nighy is awesome as Rattlesnake Jake, and you can even hear a little bit of Davy Jones coming through sometimes. One of the best parts however, is done by Ray Winstone as Bad Bill. Who would expect some Wild West bad guy to have a cockney accent? Brilliant.

Another thing I must mention is the superb animation. Without a doubt the best I've ever seen from a non-Pixar production. Heck, even if it was Pixar it would have been their absolute best so far, and that's saying something. The animation parallels ‚Äì or, dare I say, even surpasses ‚Äì Finding Nemo. That's right; I said it, so sue me. Yep, Industrial Lights & Magic made a fan out of me.

Now, back to the original question ‚Äì is it a kiddie movie? Yes and no. Some parts are totally hilarious and will have your youngsters rolling over the floor with laughter. Other parts will sail right over their little heads as they are very much grown-up humour with references to classic films and jokes they simply won't get. (Is it just me or did I catch a tiny reference to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in the beginning?) Another factor is that some of the humour is a little grim and quite mature for small children, with some of the creatures smoking, swearing and even getting shot and/or killed. Now, personally I don't know any children who would be upset by any of this, they see things that are much worse on a daily basis on the Disney channel. But then again, I'm not American, and it is my understanding that some American parents are hugely bothered by some of the elements in this movie. So I would recommend that you simply watch it first and then decide if you would like your children to see it. But honestly, I would try not to be too sensitive about it, it doesn't get scary anywhere and none of language or behaviour is really that bad. 

All in all, 'Rango' is definitely a fun ride, and one of the few animated movies that will entertain as many adults as it will children.
_(July 2011)_ || **An enjoyable film that gives us, perhaps, more than we could have hoped for.**

This film surprised by not coming from any of the major animation studios and, even so, having a lot of quality and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Film. I didn't see it at the time, I just saw it now, but I can say that I was reasonably pleased. The film pays an honorable tribute to the old western movies with a narrative set in the present day, but in a small village in the Nevada desert, where the water has disappeared, causing fear to all the residents, who still live and behave as they did in the old days.

Of course, the characters are anthropomorphic animals, and the protagonist is an unnamed chameleon (mistakenly called lizard by everyone) who, already in the city, adopts the name of Rango, eventually being promoted sheriff. As such, he will have to deal with bandits, protect the already scarce water supplies and find out what happened to these supply. Overall, the story is quite satisfying and has its merits. The film is neither too childish nor overly tiring for adults, I felt there was enough material to appeal to a wide range of age groups.

Directed by Gore Verbinsky, the film has a very pleasant pace, despite being a little longer than most animated films, which almost never exceed 90 minutes. In addition to really beautiful and well-executed cinematography, with good lighting and good use of color, the film has the best digital animation, clearly evident in the details of the buildings, the characters and the environment in which they move. The issue of water, and its importance, was not wrongly thought either, and it seems increasingly relevant in the times we live in‚Ä¶ you don't have to live in the desert to feel the lack of drinking water. The soundtrack also deserves a special mention for its relevance and quality, with melodies that alternate between epic, western and Latin-Mexican.

Finally, a note of appreciation for the quality of the voice actors and the work they did together: Johnny Depp works very well with his voice in the main character, and he still plays another character, in another vocal timbre. Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Bill Nighy, Ned Beatty and Alfred Molina are all in great shape here."

In this movie I think he is very good as the silent, deadly killer for hire. It is a straightforward killer/action/thriller. The story is nothing new but it is a well working story which is nicely executed.

The story is, as I wrote above, not very original. Killer for hire finds out that his next target is his mentor and friend. As the professional he is he executes the job anyway but later discoverers that not all is as is should be. Time for revenge. A simple, straightforward and well working story.

Things are complicated a bit by Bishop taking his friend‚Äôs son under his wings. Of course he wants to walk in his fathers footsteps. He is inexperienced but also undisciplined. Something that, not surprisingly, is causing problems.

I do like that Bishop stays a no bullshit hardass killer throughout the entire movie. No whining or silly emotional outbreaks or breakdowns. I also like the unemotional, silent and deadly impression of a professional assassin the he radiates.

There are quite a few fairly well done action scenes in the movie ranging from silent assassinations to the obligatory blow things up scenes. The parts where Bishop and Steves goes after the big bad guy is quite well done with some quite cool stunts without being over the top.

The ending was probably the only thing in the movie that was a bit unexpected. Unexpected in a good way that is. I quite liked the little surprise there.

Overall I as well as my son liked this movie quite a lot. I hope that Mechanic: Resurrection is as good as this one. || The Mechanic is unable to fix its mechanically mundane plot. ‚ÄúAmat Victoria Curran - Victory Loves Preparation‚Äù. Foreshadowing words engraved on the glossy barrel of Sutherland‚Äôs powerful pistol. Euphemism aside, West presents a remake of the Bronson-led action thriller that coincidentally features no vehicle mendings. That‚Äôs because, for those of you who aren‚Äôt subjugated to criminal organisations (hopefully all of you...), ‚Äúmechanic‚Äù is slang for hitman. Despite Statham being bald and able to glue a fake tattoo of a barcode on that shiny cranium for a ‚Äúpropa laugh!‚Äù, unfortunately West was unable to title the feature ‚ÄúHitman‚Äù. And so, he grabbed a wrench and proceeded into remake territory.

For what it‚Äôs worth, this is one of his more moderately tolerable features from the past decade. ‚ÄúMechanic‚Äù Arthur Bishop is assigned the task of assassinating his mentor, subsequently taking his troubled son into training as a well-intentioned gesture. Naturally, Statham is slaying men in his wake with any object his eyes glisten towards, most notably a suitcase handle in this one. It‚Äôs clumsily edited, instantly forgettable and rarely hones in on the ‚Äúmaking hits look like accidents‚Äù speciality. Expositional narration throughout, one or two plot twists that uphold no kinetic energy whatsoever and an incredible waste of Sutherland. Not to mention another ‚Äúmechanic‚Äù having a weakness to young boys and small dogs. The two just don‚Äôt relate.

Interestingly, the film works when it‚Äôs divulging into the life of McKenna‚Äôs self-tortured son Steve, portrayed by the enigmatic, under-appreciated and consistent Foster. A reckless individual succumbed to illegal substances and a sleazy lifestyle to suppress his negligent upbringing. Undergoing cathartic vengeance in a bid to soothe the soul. His internal suffering forces his character to be the human component in what is otherwise a mechanical action thriller, packed full of explosions and rapid gunfire. It‚Äôs a battle of professionalism between the experienced Arthur and the inexperienced Steve, making for a surprisingly well-executed duel of wits.

The actual assassinations themselves were simple, although somewhat unimaginative, yet realistic. A few questionable moments, including a dumbfounded man glancing over at the tiniest of nuts (calm your mind...) that fell out of a grating, but nothing too outlandish. The utilisation of Schubert‚Äôs legendary piece Trio No. 2 in E-flat Major was revelatory, I must confess.

Having said that, The Mechanic is your standard Statham affair. Powered by a sensational supporting performance but weighed down by a mundane plot. Functional if immediately forgettable."

There is a chemistry between the two stars and some beautiful outdoor photography.

John is a very gifted teen (Alex Pettyfer) who keeps having to move from town to town with his guardian (Timothy Olyphant) because they‚Äôre actually alien fugitives on the run from malevolent extraterrestrials called Mogs. They start over in southwestern Ohio and John insists on going to high school where he meets a special girl (Dianna Agron). Callan McAuliffe is on hand as a notorious geek at school while Teresa Palmer plays a mystery woman whose identity is revealed in the last act.

‚ÄúI Am Number Four‚Äù (2011) was based on the book by Pittacus Lore (aka James Frey & Jobie Hughes). I never heard of the flick until stumbling upon it on streaming. It turns out that this was a fairly big production, costing $60 million and being produced by Michael Bay. 

Directed by D.J. Caruso, the film starts out too busy, like it‚Äôs in a rush, not to mention there‚Äôs zero subtlety about the nature of the protagonists and their extraterrestrial-oriented dilemma. But the flick soon finds its footing once the setting switches to Ohio and John goes to school. This, of course, brings to mind ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù (2008), but ‚ÄúI Am Number Four‚Äù is way more ballsy. Yes, it‚Äôs comic booky, but who cares? It delivers the goods as sci-fi drama/action.

The creativity turned my head on a few occasions and when Teresa Palmer shows up in the final act, it‚Äôs all the better. Then there‚Äôs the cute dog with a revelation. Unfortunately, there was never a sequel even though the ending lays the groundwork. While the movie made $55 million domestically and $150 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment. The fools.      

The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in southwestern Pennsylvania as follows: Monaca (Sam‚Äôs house), Murrysville (high school), Beaver & Beaver Falls (the falls, etc.), McKeesport (house party & police car scenes), Vandergrift (street light explodes), Harmony (cemetery scene) and Pittsburgh. The opening was shot in Islamorada, Florida, with a scene or two done in Santa Clarita, California.

I don't go out of my way to watch movies about actual, historical battles, because I know that real people died (or were physically or mentally crippled); sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, mothers and fathers . . . even children.  The prospect of of reliving those tragic (even if heroic) deaths is too painful for me.  

And yet, give me an alien invasion and I'm ""all up in that"".  
I find the fantasy of war exciting, and yet I have to be aware of how such films glorify violence; glorify war.  I'm conflicted, enjoying this guilty pleasure.   

I'm a little surprised by the low rating.  
Have there been too many movies of this sort? a burnout by the viewing public?  A burnout - when it comes to war?  Another sign that we might be a war-weary nation / world?

As for me, I don't watch a lot of flicks, so I'm not ""burnt out"" when it comes to military action films.  So, this was not ""same-o, same-o"" for me.  

I thought the script was impressively tight.  That applies to character development as well; quick snap-shot profiles; a glance, a nod and you had pretty much all you needed to know about this or that character.  

I'm not a fan of the ""shaky-cam"", but I thought it was well employed in some of the battle scenes.  I've never been in such a situation, but I think the camera gave us that sense of heart-pounding, out of control terror that being shot at and bombed can produce; often no knowing even where the fire is coming from as you hunker down and question your very soul.  

Yes, this is a familiar theme - seasoned tough old lifer in charge of a bunch of kids - typical of many such films (Heartbreak Ridge comes to mind; many more).  

I wonder, also, if there is more of a connection with military vets; something the civilian population can never really get (no offense; just fact; I served but never got shot at)? 
From my experience, I thought the military portrayal was pretty spot on (military gear, tactics, fallibility, rank, age differences, rancor, ""I got your 6"", sense of duty and dedication to mission; never give up, never surrender).  

Predictable formula script?  sure, in some ways, but I found plenty of surprises as well.  
Maybe if I watched this sort of film all the time, I'd be as cynical as many here.

I really enjoyed this film (gave it 8/10; probably would have given it 7 1/2, but it deserves better than what I see others giving it).  

Recent revelations from sources such Bigelow and Elizondo, have all but confirmed that we are being visited by aliens.  And, who knows, maybe they will decide to harvest our water before we contaminate it any further, as we creep and crawl closer and closer to our own nuclear annihilation. || Click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/kdUtKcM4rJA

_Battle: Los Angeles_ is a 2011 film that Wikipedia describes as a ‚Äúmilitary science fiction apocalyptic action film‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of genres mashed into one movie, but boy do they pull it off. So what‚Äôs this all about then? Here‚Äôs the official description:

_The Earth is attacked by unknown forces. As people everywhere watch the world's great cities fall, Los Angeles becomes the last stand for mankind in a battle no one expected. It's up to a Marine staff sergeant and his new platoon to draw a line in the sand as they take on an enemy unlike any they've ever encountered before._

I originally saw this in a theatre when it came out, and just like back then, this second viewing was a real good time. What I think makes this so good is that while this is basically a sci-fi movie about an alien invasion, what makes it stand out from the crowd is that it's put together like a war movie. Much like _Monsters: Dark Continent_ and _Dog Soldiers_ this is a soldier movie with aliens, not an alien movie with soldiers. This is quite a big difference. 

There are some familiar faces in this, there's Aaron Eckhart, Michelle Rodriguez, Michael Pena, and a very young Joey King. Everyone is in good form, but this isn't a star power movie, its a blow your hair back action film.

The story itself is pretty simple. Their first mission is to get to a police station and rescue some civilians. On the way there its full of urban warfare like you‚Äôve seen on many videos from overseas in YouTube videos, but this time it‚Äôs in America amongst a very familiar looking urban environment. The focus then shifts to a search and destroy mission and it all winds up to an action packed finale. Adding to the chaos all along the way was the film-makers choice to not give you a super clear look at the enemy. It adds another level of tension to it all.

This is a great turn off your brain type movie that cracks along at a good pace and has lots to entertain you all the way through. || **Battle: Los Angeles is a grounded and well-done invasion movie that tells its story with a realism unique to the genre.**

Battle: Los Angeles is excellent! I am baffled by the low Rotten Tomatoes score and bad reviews. Battle: Los Angeles tells a gritty and realistic story of what it might actually look like if otherworldly extraterrestrials invaded. There aren‚Äôt any larger-than-life characters like in Independence Day - just courageous soldiers fighting to save the lives of everyone they hold dear. The realism makes this movie feel like Black Hawk Down with aliens. Even with this film being over a decade old, the clever use of CGI doesn‚Äôt feel overly dated and looks better than many films today. Aaron Eckhart leads these heroic marines with a strong, authentic, powerful performance anchoring the rest of the cast and the movie. Battle: Los Angeles has its flaws, but this war/sci-fi blend is done in a way, unlike any other invasion film. Don‚Äôt get caught up in the reviews. If you enjoy alien movies and invasion films, give this movie a shot."

No attempt to graft a larger narrative (indeed, a narrative at all) on the picture, no lengthy introductions of the cast of scientists, archaeologists, and filmmakers with whom you'll spend the next hour and a half. The credits are quick and unadorned, and over them, the unique and unmistakable voice of director Werner Herzog intones, in his inimitable manner, the discovery of Chauvet Cave of southern France.

The story is straightforward: a group exploring the area came across the cave, which had been long closed off from a rockslide. They cleared away the rocks and entered, finding the most astonishing collection of cave paintings known to man, more than twice the age of any other and perfectly preserved.

The French government protects the cave in earnest, lest it be damaged, and dangerously high levels of radon and carbon dioxide would kill any who visit too long. Were it not for the renown of documentarian and filmmaker Herzog, the French government would likely never have let a film crew into the cave.

What a sorrow that would have been! This film, particularly in its 3D exhibition, is an astounding, moving experience that is wholly unique and an incredible watch for anyone. It's utterly astonishing to view these beautiful, sophisticated paintings, made over 32,000 years ago, to see the contours and the ecstatic play of light and shadow over the curves of the rocks. I've long been ambivalent about the uses of 3D cinematography, but I have seen two films this year alone that have convinced me utterly that though it's not often handled well, it can be an invaluable tool in the hands of a talented filmmaker who uses it purposefully (the other, by the way, is Martin Scorsese's rapturous Hugo).

This film is truly an experience, one unlike any other I've seen. The beauty, the history, the humanness of the cave paintings, their incredibly artistry, is unmistakable and undeniable. A scientist in the film talks about how, after being in the cave, he began to dream of the lions, horses, and other beasts depicted on the walls. Seeing these paintings in this incredible environment, realizing that this may very well have been the birth of art...it is unimaginably moving.

This is where the magic of cinema comes into play. For how does one apply critical thought to a film such as this? There's little narration, as the experience of viewing the cave (particularly in 3D) conveys far more than mere words could express. Herzog, whose dulcet German tones always seem to contain an infinite depth of grief, wisely keeps the chatter to a minimum, only cropping up for an explanation of what we are seeing, as well as to offer cryptic musings on the meanings of it all. It has no narrative drive, no sense of story to tell. Its cinematography can occasionally veer into the problematic (namely, heavy doses of graininess due to shooting in the dark); the first third of the film is shot with a nonprofessional handheld camera, as it was the first time in which they entered the cave. Is it instead to be judged on the merits of its subject? I suppose so, for rarely will you find a subject as compelling and wonderful as this. And within this cave, Herzog has found things even rarer: a spirituality that is palpable, a common human need for expression, and a voice unfettered by time and space."

However, the script is interesting and keeps you hooked on not knowing what's going on until the end. || This artistic masterpiece is unfortunately undervalued. Unfortunately, Warner Bros. Entertainment does not know its worth, and due to their lack of interest in it, it has become obscure. This artistic masterpiece must be revived again. Warner Bros. Entertainment must do this, just as 20th Century Fox did when it released two improved releases of the Titanic movie in 2003 and 2012. Who would believe that a movie released in 1997 is now available in 4K quality and 3D technology?! Warner Bros. Entertainment must re-release the movie trailer in 4K quality as a first step to correct its course, and launch a new strong marketing campaign for the Red Riding Hood movie, just as it launched a strong marketing campaign for the Barbie movie that does not deserve it. They should do this for the movie that deserves it, not the opposite. Essentially, the reason for the lack of fame of the Red Riding Hood movie was the failure of Warner Bros. Entertainment in its marketing campaign for the movie, as it was a very weak campaign, in addition to its excessive pursuit of the PG-13 age rating instead of accepting its R-rating, which led to changing the ending for the PG-13 rated cut. The reason was not the movie itself or the director Catherine Hardwicke. In fact, Catherine Hardwicke directed the movie in an unimaginable way, especially in the unrated original cut of the movie known as the Alternate Cut. The existence of a rated cut without additional terms such as (Alternate Cut) does not necessarily mean that it is the original cut. In fact, the original cut is the one that was not modified to fit the PG-13 age rating. The original cut is the one that was released as is without modifications. The original cut is the one that the MPAA did unrate, so you always find the word Unrated next to it. The original cut is the Alternate Cut, and it was not named Director's Cut because Warner Bros. Entertainment changed the ending of the PG-13 rated cut to fit the PG-13 age rating. Therefore, it is no longer possible to name the original cut as Director's Cut, as this title does not include the change in the ending. Therefore, they had to name the original cut as the Alternate Cut to include the change in the ending. As you know, production companies do not like the R-rating because it narrows the audience range, which reduces revenues. Therefore, Warner Bros. Entertainment pressured Catherine Hardwicke to modify the movie to be released with a PG-13 age rating instead of an R-rating. This explains why the ending was changed in the rated cut compared to the unrated original cut. In my opinion, both cuts are successful artistic masterpieces, but the original cut is more artistically successful, and I loved it more. My rating for the rated cut (modified) is 9/10, and my rating for the unrated original cut (Alternate Cut) is 10/10. It is the best and greatest of all time in presenting the story of Red Riding Hood, and no movie surpasses it in presenting this story. Thank you, Catherine Hardwicke, for this artistic masterpiece."

The film follows a man who is made to go through an 8-minute window repeatedly to locate the person responsible for a train bombing. As the loop repeats, the plot thickens. It's a pretty good film which keeps you at the edge of the seat and reveals to you in stages as to what is going on. The cast has done a good job portraying their roles. It's a Sci-Fi that deserves one watch at least (but you might do two to get it) || Brilliant concept. Great execution. A sci-fi classic.

Another in a longish line of high-concept mainstream movies. In many of those movies it's fashionable to have a confusing story which people will interpret as being brilliant/genius and which has an in-built ""repeat"" viewing factor due to the baffling nature of the story which has just been told. Think movies like ""Inception"".

""Source code"" is a far superior film to ""Inception"" but will probably lack the kudos of the latter. Briefly, the story concerns a commuter (""Colter Stevens"", played by Jake Gyllenhaal) on a train who has an identity crisis. Before he can resolve it, he dies with all the other passengers in a massive explosion. Afterwards (!), the man awakes in a weird chamber where he is questioned by military (or some such) personnel about who caused the explosion. Don't worry, this is not a 'spoiler'...it's established very early on in the movie that this is what has happened.

Of course, you get questions along the lines of ""Which reality is real?"". Going with the sci-fi explanation (involving secret military experiments) you have a plausibility to the scenario which is very nicely unambitious and may in fact have some science (perhaps speculative) to it...involving information retained in the brain post-death...some 8 minutes...which gives rise to another gimmick of the movie...the character reliving those 8 minutes in order to solve the mystery of the train explosion. The latter part of the scenario may be hard to rationalise as remotely plausible, but I just ran with the premise...perhaps it might have been a more plausible story if the movie didn't go down that path...a more 'realistic' science fiction, perhaps.

This is a great story which seems to have no loose ends to it, at least on one level...the film makers provide you with clues as to what is happening and you aren't left high and dry like similarly themed movies can do.

P.S. on reflection, the part of the movie dealing with 'reliving' the 8 minutes of memory in the way that they did, did strike me as being a loose-end/plot-hole...but you just enjoy the ride at the time.

Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber and Blondie are the 5 main characters in the film. As much as I like Baby Doll and her costume, I really liked Sweet Pea. Something in her was so familiar. She's the big sister who will do anything for her younger sister. That's me. 

I like the action scenes. Baby Doll was so sexy. I liked this movie. || Wow‚Ä¶ Here I was, thinking I was going to get to see an awesome comic- like film about a group of girls kickin' a whole lotta butt surrounded by mind-bending fantasy scenery.

Technically, I was right‚Ä¶ But only technically. Sucker Punch is like Chinese food. You can eat three plates and it will still leave you feeling hungry. It's a great deal of empty calories, is basically what I'm saying. Substance? Nah.

Let me just get right into it. What's wrong with Sucker Punch is the screenplay. Not the actors, not the director, just the story. This story revolves around a group of five girls in an institution for the mentally insane, in a fantastical, steampunk-wannabe 1940's (my best guess) setting. They are treated horribly and their lives are miserable, and to cope with it all, the main protagonist Babydoll, escapes into her fantasies and in this trance-like state, devises a plan for them all to escape. 

The concept is not bad. It might have even been really exciting, had it not been executed so laughably unrealistic. And by 'unrealistic', I don't mean the fantasies themselves. I'm referring to the fact that these fantasies were so obviously not dreamed up by an actual teenage girl, but rather they look like the perfect fulfillment of the wet wishes of a horny teenage boy. It is very likely that a teenage girl WOULD dream of being able to wield a samurai sword and beat up every monster, dragon and every other kind of bastard who crosses her path. She WOULD dream of coming out of every battle completely unscathed and with every hair on her pretty head still perfectly in place. She would NOT, however, be doing all of this scantily clad in sexy lingerie wearing fishnet stockings and high heels‚Ä¶ I am a girl, with very vivid imagination. Trust me on this one. It was, in one word, ridiculous.

Another thing that really bothered me was the way these characters were worked out. As obviously miserable as their personal predicaments were, I could not relate to a single one of them. They were all completely 2- dimensional and just flat-out uninteresting. I didn't care about what happened to a single one of them. I don't believe all of the blame for this falls on the actresses (although theirs weren't exactly Oscar winning performances...), again, I chalk it up to poor screen writing. The only one who was able to make her character slightly more than moderately interesting, was not even one of 'the girls', it was Dr. Vera Gorski, played by Carla Gugino. At least she was interesting to watch, and she was even somewhat of a scene-stealer, taking much thunder away from the girls simply because she (both the actress and the character) had the biggest personality. All the others, I felt were mostly just going through the motions, because they had zero character development and no interesting dialogue to work with. And that's bad when you're talking about the characters that are supposed to carry the story. A pleasant (and much needed surprise) came in the form of Scott Glenn, who only appears in the fantasy segments as several different versions of a wise man. That was a nice touch. 

However, the one thing that really stood out for me as the true axis of failure that sums up Sucker Punch, was the feeling of total confusion that was present from the beginning and never cleared up. I'm not saying I didn't 'get it', I'm saying it was a hot, incoherent mess. And I usually don't mind being thrown back and forth and to and fro throughout a film, I don't mind playing guessing games and wondering what it will all lead to. I DO mind when the roller-coaster ride is over and all I feel is queasy. Some people have suggested that this is a really deep and complex film, but honestly, I think they're just reading too much into it. The stupid thing is, for the most part it was completely predictable, and STILL it lacked structure and decent storytelling. That may seem like a paradox, but there's an easy way to explain it. In the words of the great Roger Ebert: ""Now that's bad filmmaking."" 

The only element in Sucker Punch that was somewhat redeeming, were the visual effects. I must say, it was all very gorgeous and eye-pleasing. Also, the soundtrack was excellent, filled with very well performed covers of well-known songs and some perfectly chosen originals. Emily Browning, who plays Babydoll (and also sings a few songs on the soundtrack), was a good choice for the lead role, but I must say, in all honesty, that was mostly because she was visually very appealing as the main protagonist. More simply put ‚Äì she was very pretty. Still, I'm not sure that's enough to carry a film. 

All in all, I'm left feeling ‚Äì Zack Snyder‚Ä¶ Dude. What were you thinking. You can do so much better than this. I guess I just finally have to come to terms with the fact that everybody's human and is bound to make one big mistake at least once in their lives. Zack‚Ä¶ this is yours.

Sucker Punch sucks.
_(November 2013)_ || Snyder pushing buttons for polarising results.

Off the bat I have to say I'm over thirty years older than what some pro critics have claimed is the demographic for this one. Sucker Punch, as reviews etc attest, is not for everyone, it has been called any number of things in derogative fashion, which since I enjoyed the film a lot means I'm a misogynist fetishist gamer, which to the best of my knowledge is not true. Lest I'm in the closet and now in middle age about to unleash traits and feelings previously untapped. Which if the latter is true you would have to say well done Zack Snyder, for that's serious film making...

Sucker Punch is loud, full of visual orgasms, musically adroit, exciting, clever and very sexy. Snyder has made no secret of his fetish leanings when making this piece, but it hardy constitutes a dark seedy mind at work. It can easily be argued that the film is very much pro women, the story itself - in amongst the explosive thunder of the fantastical action - is tender and beautiful, complete with emotional kickers. Perhaps it's in the eye of the beholder? But I see a strong female led action movie, with shifting fantasy realms, and cunningly it calls for deeper ponder come the finale.

Love it or hate it, Snyder has pushed buttons with this exercise. Better that than another cash cow sequel or another remake, re-imaging or rebirth. 7/10"

Quite similar theme when it comes to the sporting events, but there's a wide gap on how it was played and by whom.

From the director of 'All about Steve'. Firstly, it was a sport film and then romance attached to it in the required opening slot. So pretty inspiring to focus on something in our life to reach the heights. There's no shortcuts, it's always a hard work. In the film, that concept was funnily told. Encountering a new world, and discovering new things. It includes friendship, love and dedication in what one believes in.

Great cast, except the love interest of Felicity Jones. He wasn't bad, but the chemistry did not work, even in the short span of their romance in the tale. Anyway, the romance parts were too clich√©, but neglectable as it has little value. Because there are other reasons to like the film. The stunts are not extraordinary, just simple and realistic. The film will work for most of the people if they're not expecting too much. This is not some chick flick, a better film than that.

The team behind ""Saw"" and ""Dead Silence"" bring us ""Insidious"", one of the finest exponents of the haunted house movie in the modern era.

Much has been made of the shift in the last third, where the film brings in Astral Projection as its reasoning for the pant soiling previously unleashed. Undeniably the film runs away with itself, goes too far and the last 15 minutes are a chaotic mess of bold ideas and inadequate staging. However, it's interesting to note how often the haunted house movie in recent times gets accused of not bringing something new to the table, something thrown at the wonderful ""Woman in Black"" that followed ""Insidious""down the pipe. Here the makers offer up something different, true, it hasn't worked in the way they or the hardened genre fans would have liked, but personally I found on second viewing it is forgivable. It's like riding your favourite Big Dipper, you enjoy the spins and upside down scream moments, but just tolerate the flat standard drive stretches of track while your heart tries to steady its beat.

When ""Insidious"" is hitting its heights it's utterly thrilling and unnerving, paced to perfection, it builds from whispered voices on a baby monitor to entities invading the home of the poor Lambert family. The mystery element is strong, just what do they want? Why is son Dalton in a coma but the medical boffins have no idea why? How come the entities have followed the Lambert's even when they move house? The latter of which is refreshing to see in the screenplay, it's a logical move but so often it's not done in other horror movies. The jumps are nicely placed throughout and a number of scenes are so freaky they get under your skin and stay there for some time - seriously, I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" again without my blood being chilled. The use of photographs and mirrors bring the goose flesh to the skin, while Lin Shaye's arrival as the paranormal physic, and the subsequent use of a gas mask, keep things ticking on the freaky deaky scale (though once the gas mask scene hits it's where the pic slightly falls away).

It borrows ideas and takes its tonal cues from other horror movies, definitely, and the second half doesn't live up to the promise of the first; hell I'll even concede that a certain entity is badly designed, but it does have something new to offer the formula, it's also well performed by the cast, that itself is a rarity. It hasn't resonated with all, but it was a monster hit at the box office, making nearly $85 million in profit. The market for a good haunted house spooker is always open, so Insidious, in spite of its second half irks, sits in the top draw with the best of them. 8/10"

Seeing an urban landscape filled with armed robbers, corrupt cops, abused prostitutes and even a pedophile Santa, the Hobo goes about bringing justice to the city the best way he knows how - with a 20-gauge shotgun.

Hobo with a Shotgun is directed by Jason Eisener and written by John Davies. It stars Rutger Hauer, Brian Downey, Gregory Smith, Molly Dunsworth, Robb Wells and Nick Bateman. Music is by Alexander Rosborough and cinematography by Karim Hussain.

A homeless hobo (Hauer) hitches a freight train lift into Hope Town and finds a city imploding with corruption, violence, drugs and sexual deviance. Initially trying to keep out of the way and get on with his meagre existence, the hobo finally cracks and decides he can no longer sit back and watch such lawlessness. Helping himself to a shotgun from the local pawn shop, hobo goes on a one man killing crusade.

Born out of a trailer that accompanied the original full release of Rodriguez/Tarrantino's Grindhouse venture, Hobo with a Shotgun is horror exploitation made with abundant glee. Blending Death Wish like vigilantism with 70s and 80s styled schlock, Jason Eisener has crafted an utterly tasteless, yet wonderfully entertaining piece of cinema. Violence is broad and completely bloody, as heads are exploded, bodies punctured and characters killed in a series of increasingly strange ways, while the characters that inhabit Hope Town are downright nasty and equally as weird. From bully boy Tom Cruise homage brother bastards Ivan & Slick, to a paedophile Santa Claus, and on to The Plague -two metal suited fetish killers sent to take out the hobo - it's welcome to bizarreville for sure.

It's all driven by a great turn from Hauer, who manages to play it with raw and subtle emotion, even as the rage takes control of him and he deals death as surely as he delivers a memorable line. Around him are a bunch of no mark actors, but this works in the films' favour, the material doesn't need star wattage to drive the motors, besides which, you will undoubtedly come out of the film remembering the characters these actors have played rather than the actors in the garbs. 

Shot in suitably lurid Technicolor by Hussain and featuring an on the money score by Rosborough, all the elements for a Grindhouse feature fall into place. This basically does what the title suggests it will, yes it may at times veer towards crassness, and what social comment depth intended gets lost as Eisener gets carried away with the carnage. But under examination this is a whole bunch of fun that's made for adults who remember the movies from a past decade that this homages and parodies with devilish aplomb. 8/10"

Just some action movie in which 13 guys kill by hundreds ... || Takashi Miike excels at creating true horror from the internal darkness of humanity and this is clearly evident in his brutal depiction of the villain of this movie, Lord Naritsugu. Through this characterization he establishes a strong motivation for us to stick around and witness the epic 45 minute battle at the film's climax in our hope to see Naritsugu brought to justice. Period Japan is depicted in a fashion that appears competent and authentic and the climactic battle is satisfyingly crunchy and visceral. The story is simple and direct and Miike's deft hand spends the first half setting up a truly despicable, hate-able villain and the titular assassins and their heroic leader, Shinzaemon, then the second half delivering a very satisfying come-uppance in a relentless fury of action, blood and mud. Well worth watching if you like this sort of thing! || Very much in the spirit of Kurosawa, Takashi Miike has assembled a strong cast to depict some fairly epic struggles for power in the 19th century Japanese shogunate. It's the brother of the Shogun who seems to be the source of the trouble. Having mercilessly murdered a family - against the instructions of his sibling - he has earned the enmity of veteran Samurai ""Shinzaemon"" (K√¥ji Yakusho) but with a significant political appointment in Edo looming, it would appear he is untouchable. It's the journey ""Naritsugu"" (Gor√¥ Inagaki) must make through the densely forested countryside that might offer an opportunity for revenge, but he has the equally lethal Samurai ""Hanbei"" (Masachika Ichimura) orgainisng his large escort. With but a dozen men and the intrepid under ""Koyata"" (Y√ªsuke Iseya) to guide them along less trodden paths, this disparate baker's dozen must try to anticipate the path their nemesis will take and then strive to reduce the odds against them. These men are too honourable to resort to underhand guerrilla tactics so each battle must be fought openly and with the pride of their code. The last hour or so of this offers us as compelling a series of combat scenes, mixed with plenty of lithe action and even a little black humour, as you're ever lively to see. The energy and gymnastics on display is compelling to watch, the filth, mud and grime that coats their bodies add authenticity and the low-key soundtrack all build to an action-packed and by no means predictable conclusion. If you can watch on a big screen then this, like most films of this genre, really does come alive and Miike manages to avoid the repetition trap so easy to fall into with films like this. If you've seen and enjoyed the 1963 Kud√¥ version, then this remake won't disappoint you."

Saoirse Ronan is really, really good.

I also really enjoyed the soundtrack. The Chemical Brothers style fit perfectly with the pace and theme of the movie and got me bumpin' on more than a single occasion.

Overall, I give this movie an 8/10. I'm super interested to see what Seth Lochhead does next. || Hanna-Barbera More Like.

Hanna is directed by Joe Wright and written by David Farr and Seth Lochhead. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Eric Banna, Tom Hollander, Olivia Williams, Jason Flemyng and Cate Blanchett. Music is by The Chemical Brothers and cinematography by Alwin H. Kuchler.

Hanna Heller (Ronan) is a 16 year old highly trained assassin on the run from the CIA...

Heralded by some British critics as original and thrilling, Joe Wright's Hanna is neither. It's a gimmick movie dressed up as cool for the kids fodder that is both boring and cheesy. Taking the gimmick aside, that of a 16 year old crack assassin girl slotting all who come in her way, it starts off promisingly enough as we meet Hanna and her father Erik (Banna) out in the wilderness. There's training, a believable bond (both Ronan and Banna don't disgrace themselves) and the wintry landscape bites hard as we wonder what is in store.

Then the film shifts to Hanna being on the run, where the back story guff is just, well, guff, and the pace crawls to a standstill. Blanchett's (badly miscast) CIA operative is in pursuit, with that back story guff tattooed on her forehead, and it tries to gain momentum for the inevitable showdown between the big bad bitch and the little china doll killer. The Chemical Brothers drip their brand of techno beats over it, which is OK if you like that sort of thing. How cool?!

In the middle passages Hanna rides along with a Hippy family, with Flemyng also badly miscast, and there's some cack-handed attempt at humanising poor Hanna as she comes alive in the big old world. It's derivative in premise, boring in execution and designed to make teenagers think they are watching a masterpiece for their generation.

The amusement park finale is well staged, location photography is pleasing enough in that hip-euro way, and Banna and Ronan work hard to keep it from total damnation. But for much of the near two hour run time it's a butt numbing bore that has ideas far above its station. Joe Wright should stick to making Keira Knightley look good. 4/10 || SAIRSE RONAN IS THE ONLY PERSON TO PLAY THIS COMPLEX LONELY YET POWERFUL CHARACTER.

The story is pretty weak, requiring quite a suspension of disbelief, as is the case with the majority of the Scream sequels. The introduction of new family members of Sidney Prescott felt a little out of place, with no mention of an aunt in the previous films. But all that aside, this movie delivers on what I have been wanting throughout the entire franchise: blood, gore, and brutality. The majority of slasher films have poor plots, but that is not why you are there, you want uncensored horror. With Scream 4, the blood is cranked to a hundred, with crime scenes left with the walls repainted, intestines falling out of victims, and slits that ooze with blood with every heartbeat. Not only are the kills brutal, but our Ghostface is too. His phone calls have a tremendous amount of anger, with some lines being incredibly messed up. Overall, it was a real treat to watch. In addition, the meta-commentary worked pretty well for me unlike the previous films; I do not know if it is just a product of the times, as I was only a child when the first trilogy was released, so quite a bit of references could have flown over my head.

Much like previous films, the new characters did not do much for me. They lacked any interesting details and were merely there to be meat sacks for our killer's knife to enter, and enter they did. Hayden Panettiere was a standout, who I especially enjoyed though. Emma Roberts was okay; she never really seemed convincing in the role she was attempting to play. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox are badasses once again; I will never get sick of seeing them kick Ghostface‚Äôs ass while attempting to avoid death. I have been pretty critical of David Arquette throughout the series, but in Scream 4, he did a great job and really added a lot to the movie.

Wes Craven did an excellent job with the direction of this film. Where Scream 3 felt generic and uninspired, Scream 4 felt like a real passion project for him, with an infusion of new ideas to keep the series fresh. It was easily my favorite directorial performance since the original.

Overall, I really enjoyed Scream 4 and think it is the first film to actually rival the original. With a slightly tighter story, this film could have easily been the best in the series.

Arriving, eventually, on foot and very late we proceed to enjoy a brief speech from her mother ""Gaby"" (Charlotte Rampling) who declares that she has no time for marriage at all - a state of affairs largely arrived at due to some fairly irreconcilable differences with ex-husband ""John"" (Kiefer Sutherland). That does rather set the scene for an at times extremely potent look at just how depression sets in, takes hold and rules ruthlessly the lives of those it touches. This is most certainly not a joyous piece of cinema, but it most certainly an honest one - and both Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as her new mother-in-law ""Claire"" deliver strongly and quite compellingly as we begin to appreciate the rather prophetic nature of the opening few scenes. Conflict is never far away, tempers flare - especially when ""Justine"" speaks her mind to best man and employer ""Jack"" (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) and it's really only in the second part of the film - dedicated to ""Claire"" that a sort of calm befalls the proceedings, aided by the presence of the young ""Leo"" (a stabilising effort from Cameron Spurr!). Be prepared for a slow burn, nothing happens quickly - though it does happen quite powerfully - and I think this may well prove to be Dunst at her very best.

Pretty fucking good considering it hasn‚Äôt even been released in America yet, where like, every movie ever makes most of its money. As you may have guessed, yes, I did finally get around to seeing le Thor, hence the delay in my review of The Incredible Hulk. But know what? Fuck you man! I just watched fucking Thor!!

So in case you couldn‚Äôt guess, I was rather damn impressed with it all. Why? Well boys and girls, strap your tolerance boots on, this one could get long.

The Computer Graphics were some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen. Now I‚Äôm not one to believe that CGI is the sort of thing that could make or break a film, but having it be this fantastic goes quite a ways to helping out. I also was unfortunate in my having to watch it in 3D, and yet it was worth it. This is a pretty big statement from me. I despise 3D‚Ä¶ I even walked out of the cinema not feeling nauseous. A tad headache-y sure, but that was it. So congrats Thor.

The comic relief was powerful. In that ‚Äúfunny but not silly‚Äù kind of way. I mean, it‚Äôs all a bit silly, but it would have been so easy to fall into the cheesy trap with this film. The writing team and director Kenneth Branagh (The Boat that Rocked, Sleuth, Hamlet) did a fantastic job of keeping the audience engaged  and not descending too far into shameless, lame, self-parody.

The characters of the film were written almost as strongly as they were in Iron Man 1 & 2, not quite, but they did have quite a number more to work through, so they couldn‚Äôt work with everyone as well as they did with Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. They also managed to totally pull off an American movie with romance and comedy, in a way that totally avoided those awful American Romantic Comedies (my least favourite genre in the history of ever).

There‚Äôs this whole thing where Thor comes from another world. Which was after all really the only way you could bring a God into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has been so grounded in reality. And I‚Äôll tell you, Asgard (Thor‚Äôs home planet) was fucking great. They pulled off this crazy similarities in appearance between family members on Asgard, despite the fact that none of the actors are related. You may disagree with me on inspection of posters and whatnot, but after seeing the movie, you‚Äôll get what I mean. Also the actors they got to play the younger Loki and Thor were eerily believable. Like, to an actually kind of scary point. I wonder if any of it was fake‚Ä¶ The Frost Giant homeworld of Jotunheim is also visually stunning.

The sound effects were very confronting. I couldn‚Äôt really figure out if I though this was a good or a bad thing‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll be interesting to rewatch on DVD, and see if it was only so crazy because of the speakers in the theatre. Thor may have lacked the wholeness as a film felt by Iron Man 1 & 2, or The Incredible Hulk, but it was perfect as a lead up to The Avengers, which, now that it‚Äôs all set in stone, is really kind of needed. With Thor more than the other heroes it‚Äôs the most important, because there was really no way to humanise that sort of character, he‚Äôs just so outlandish that you really need an entire film just to ground him in this world they‚Äôre developing.

But all of the things I‚Äôve had to say about the film were basically leading up to this one big thing; the cast! The cast was incredible, not only did they manage to snag a total of THREE of my favourite underrated actors ever, one of them just so happened to my favourite actor in the whole wide world, Ray Stevenson!

We have Australian (fuck yes Australia!) Chris Hemsworth (Home and Away [Hey! We all have to start somewhere, right?], A Perfect Getaway, Ca$h, Cabin in the Woods) playing Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan, V For Vendetta) playing Thor‚Äôs love interest; Jane Foster (lots of people have started having a problem with Natalie Portman nowadays, but I still love her), Anthony Hopkins (The Rite, The Wolfman, Beowulf, Red Dragon, Hannibal, The Silence of the Lambs [Yes, this is the same guy who played Hannibal Lecter. I fucking know, right!?] Bram Stroker‚Äôs Dracula) as Thor‚Äôs father; Odin, Stellan Skarsgard (King Arthur, Exorcist: The Beginning, Beowulf & Grendel, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Angels & Demons) as Dr. Erik Selvig; Jane Foster‚Äôs mentor, Ray Stevenson (Rome, King Arthur, Outpost, Punisher: War Zone, The Book of Eli) as Thor‚Äôs friend, and member of the Warriors Three (above); Volstagg, Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T., The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, 28 Weeks Later, The Hurt Locker, The Town) as Hawkeye; the S.H.I.E.L.D. sharpshooter, and Samuel L. Jackson (The Exorcist III, Jurassic Park, Jackie Brown, Shaft, Pulp Fiction, the Star Wars prequel trilogy, S.W.A.T., Snakes on a Plane, 1408,  Cleaner, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds) as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director; General Nick Fury‚Ä¶ And those are just the actors I already adore.

I‚Äôve now also grown quite attached to Tom Hiddleston (Wallander) who plays Loki, Thor‚Äôs brother, and the main antagonist, as well as Joshua Dallas (Doctor Who and The Descent Part II) who plays another of the Warriors Three (above), and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah‚Äôs Infinite Playlist and Defendor) who plays D‚Äôarcy Lewis; Jane Foster‚Äôs friend and colleague.

As I always like to say, I watched this film in a theatre (Belcompton, shit, uh, Belconnen, Hoyts to be specific). I really think this film has lasting value, but it‚Äôs important to note that I almost always feel a film is enhanced when watched on the big screen, especially with Action films, effects films, epic films and franchise films. Thor happens to be all of those things. I was especially excited waiting for the post-credits scene to come up in that huge cinema. So please take into consideration that I reviewed this on the silver screen, if you happen to be watching it on DVD or BluRay or some such. Because you better of not fucking downloaded it!!  Damn scum‚Ä¶

-Gimly || I was surprised to see Kenneth Branagh directing a big budget comic book film, but as the film continued to explore a Shakespearean tale between two brothers feuding, the relationship with their father, and a coming of age love story, I realized this is exactly the kind of movie Kenneth Branagh would make.

I really enjoyed Thor. It was funny, exciting, and different from the usual superhero ilk. And it definitely got the MCU back on track after the dismal Iron Man 2."

This is the story of how he rose in the ranks, making countless of enemies along the way. This is also the story of how they tried to kill him, but failed.

I've never heard of Danny Greene, but the movie paints a nice realistic picture of the 1970s. This is not a pleasant world, but one where everyone is trying to get their piece of the cake. Danny himself is a hard one to figure out, is he good, is he bad? The one moment he helps out a friend in need, the next... he is killing people. I kinda like the fact that he is a person with both sides to him, allowing us to make up our own mind about him. Life is never as simple as most movies would like us to think it is.

The movie itself is a little messy, and I had expected a bit more from the cast, but of course, this is a movie based on actual events and characters, and of course that means that they can't change too much. In minor roles we find Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken, both excellent actors that tend to make quirky and interesting characters, but not so much here.

I haven't even seen parts 1 and 2. I've seen part 3 (Tokyo Drift) which I think was a waste of time. I've seen part 4 just because everyone's watching it and surprisingly I liked it. I was even surprised to find out that Bryan O'Conner (Paul Walker) was a policeman. Haha!

So here I am, watching the fifth installment. Justine wanted to watch it badly and since I have nothing to do, I decided to accompany her. She was on leave the whole week and she just got back from Palawan. So before watching the movie, the 2 of us had dinner at Jack's Loft. I told her that we should buy tickets first but because we were lazy we forgot about it. When it was an hour before the movie, we were surprised. Sold out. Well, nearly sold out. There were like less than 10 seats. So we still went in line and luckily got seats even if the seats were bad and we were seated separately from each other. 

I liked this movie. Although it was very unrealistic. (Hello? Where's the government of Rio?) I like how The Rock was there. I like him. I don't like Vin Diesl. I don't understand a word coming out of his mouth. Jordana was still pretty but she's not as pretty in this film. She's too thin. But all in all I liked it. || **Fast Five brings the action, beloved old characters, exciting new ones, and a whole lot of fun to the Fast franchise and the heist genre.**

Fast 4 and Fast 5 are the best of the Fast & Furious franchise. Fast 4 redeemed the series after the failure of Tokyo Drift by bringing back Vin Diesel and the cast and family of the first film. Then Fast 5 expands and adds to the crew with fan-favorite characters from across the series, including Han (Kang), Roman (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gadot), and more. The Toretto family plans a massive heist to buy their freedom but hot on their tale is Dwayne Johnson‚Äôs Hobbs, a perfect foil to Diesel‚Äôs Toretto. The face-off between these characters is epic! Fast Five‚Äôs bonkers action is a little more grounded than later entries, but it‚Äôs still outrageous fun. It feels kind of like The Italian Job, directed by Michael Bay. Fast Five launched the Fast Franchise into another decade of insane stunts and stories with great characters and commitment to embracing its cheesy awesomeness. || Picking up hot on the heels of the last film, the newly escaped ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel), his ex-FBI pal ""O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) and ""Mia"" (Jordan Brewster) have to keep skipping one step ahead of the pursuing law led by ""Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) and, whilst cornered in Rio, they must assemble everyone with driving skills so as to thwart the ambitions of drug lord ""Reyes"" (Joaquim de Almeida) whom they have seriously hacked off. This effort sacrifices a little of the pace and speed of the other films and tries to focus on a slightly stronger story with some better characterisations - that does mean that it can be a bit on the slow side at times and maybe we get just one thoughtful pose from Diesel too many, but as we head towards a fairly predictable denouement this easily (for my money, anyway) tops the list of F&F films before clearly teeing us up for number 6. I think it's closer in quality and standard to the first film - and still has plenty of burnt rubber and lively stunts to keep it watchable."

Ok lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think ""Indiana Jones"", ""National Treasures"" like adventures (hell even ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.

There's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the sexy vicious teasers they are.

Production is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Pen√©lope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10"

In addition to the beauty of the city, especially in the opening sequence, the script revisits the history and importance of the French city, as a meeting point for artists and writers.

The film begins very well, introducing us to an American engaged couple who came to Paris on their father's business trip. From the start they seem a bit strange: she is quite frivolous and seems to feel that she is doing him a huge favor by marrying him, and it is perfectly obvious that her parents do not approve of the match; in turn, the young man is an aspiring writer who has grown tired of making Hollywood screenplays and wants to dedicate himself to writing and stay in Paris, ideas seen with disdain by the bride. However, everything will change when, after a disagreement, he walks back to the hotel and ends up having a meeting with a series of famous artists and writers from Paris in the 1920s: Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, Bu√±uel, Gertrude Stein and others. That is, the film starts from a basic romantic comedy situation and creates a story where time travel ends up happening in a way that seems like the character is just dreaming, or in an illusion.

Owen Wilson was impeccable in the lead role and gives us one of his best serious performances, which is no small feat. He is credible and convincing. Equally pleasant and sympathetic is Marion Cotillard, who gave life to the ‚Äúsoul mate‚Äù of Wilson's character, a dreamer and idealist who would rather live on a page of the past. In addition to being smart and sensitive, she is beautiful and attractive. Kathy Bates, Tom Hiddleston, Alisson Pill, Corey Stoll and Marcial Di Fonzo have given life to a series of artists and writers, each of whom played their part with aplomb and care. Rachel McAdams is good at her tiresome and irritating character.

Technically, the film is flawless. The cinematography is exquisite, has ideal light and color, sharpness and depth. The city scenes are magnificent, and it's very easy to see the movie and want it all to be real. The sets are very good, and the same can be said for the choice of filming locations, made with care and method. Comedy is very present in the film and has elements with a certain quality, being in the dialogues and puns that it thrives. The entire film has a very good rhythm, which does not tire the audience or allow us to lose sight of it. Finally, a word of appreciation for the jazz soundtrack."

Taking a lot of things borrowed from 2001, it doesn't even come close to have such a deep an interesting meaning. || Terrence Malick's <i>The Tree of Life</i> is an attempt to inject some cosmic wonder into the most mundane American story.

In the 1950s, two parents bring up three boys in an American white middle-class, small-town existence. The mother (Jessica Chastain) radiates love and warmth, while the father (Brad Pitt) feels the obligation to be cold and distant in order to prepare his sons for the cruel world that awaits them. As we are informed at the beginning of the film, sometime during this mid-century upbringing, one of the boys would eventually die. We are also shown flashfowards to the present day, when the eldest son Jack, now a successful architect working in New York City, reflects on the death of his brother decades ago. There is very little conventional spoken dialogue in this family drama. The story is told through voiceovers on top of a rich series of images, these monologues representing the inner thoughts, doubts and fears of the characters.

But Malick adds something on top of this, one of the most controversial turns in Hollywood filmmaking in recent years. Early on we are treated to a depiction of the creation of the universe and of life on Earth, from the initial clouds of gas right after the Big Bang to small nebulae, then big galaxies like our own Milky Way, the Earth as an inchoate ball of lava, life arising in tidepools, and then into the era of the dinosaurs. These special effects were created by Douglas Trumbull, best known for the cosmic visuals of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. The titles of the film quote from the Book of Job: ""Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth, when the morning stars sang together?""

I get what Malick is trying to do here, that is, to show that the trials and tribulations of an individual human life are part of some vast unknown plan. Nonetheless, while I can understand this on an intellectual level, the film does not seem to reconcile the two layers into a single coherent plot. The film is indeed a visual feast on a first viewing (a high-definition release watched on a projector is nearly as stunning as <i>2001</i>), but the <i>The Tree of Life</i> is much harder to sit through on a repeat viewing when one knows that it doesn't quite hang together. Furthermore, as thought-provoking as the story of the boys' 1950s upbringing is, the last part with its scenes of petty delinquency goes on forever and should have been cut. Finally, the ending which I won't spoil here is a total trope, not at all a fresh take on the meaning of life.

At a time when Hollywood is widely regarded as stagnant, I can appreciate a director like Malick who seeks to do something unexpected, but I find <i>The Tree of Life</i> to be rather a noble failure. || **Visually grandiose and made with true technical and artistic mastery, it is a film with difficult and indigestible themes, which will scare the audience with its slowness and tiring atmosphere.**

There are films that are made for some audiences and not for most people, the general public. This film is one of them: being what it is, it doesn't even try to capture our sympathy or attention. The film did very well on the festivals circuit and even won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, in addition to being acclaimed by critics and intellectuals. However, it was not understood by almost anyone but them, it seems extremely cryptic in its message and script, and it was not able to please the mass audience: the proof is in the fact that it received three Oscar nominations without, however, winning any, and not even have been considered by the Globes or BAFTA.

The film revolves around a middle-class Texan family between the present and the 1950s, and focuses particularly on the figure of Jack, the couple's son. The film shows how he lives his childhood, the unequal relationship he has with his parents (a more tolerant and good mother, and a more authoritarian and disillusioned father) and the way both, each in their own way, they try to prepare and educate him. In between, we observe the way they react to the death of one of the youngest members of the family. The film seeks to relate all this to the search for a meaning for human life, showing us images of the planet's history, and others that refer us to various spiritual and metaphysical meanings. We even got access to the characters' prayers and thoughts.

All of this is very beautiful and interesting, and I even liked the characters because they are believable, genuine, well-built, with a rich psychology and manage to capture the audience's sympathy. The problem is that this audience may not even be able to handle the first half hour of film! When cinema deals with philosophical and spiritual themes, it tends to make very meditative and slow films, which drag on and seem heavier than would be desirable. And this movie didn't even try to get away from that and make something minimally palatable. And as if that wasn't enough, director Terrence Malick decides to use a non-linear narrative that confuses us even more!

Overall, the cast did a very good job, within what was asked of him: Brad Pitt is a strong actor, who draws fans to the cinema by himself. He seems quite mature and aged in some scenes, but I think the character demanded that from him, as if visually conveying how old and world-weary the character felt. Sean Penn is just as good at what he does, even if the actor doesn't seem aware of what he's actually doing! Young Hunter McCracken, at this point, managed to untangle himself just as well and with more of a sense of direction and focus. Jessica Chastain, for her part, is stunning, and the visual beauty and costumes were particularly sympathetic to her.

On a technical level, the film really deserves to be named as one of the most significant of the year 2011, given its visual and aesthetic quality. The cinematography is some of the best and most beautifully executed I've seen in a long time, and that's all the more remarkable considering that director Malick tried to restrict the use of CGI and adopt other more conventional visuals to achieve the same results. We saw something similar in scenes from ‚ÄúThe Fountain‚Äù, a film that came to my mind several times while watching this film, either because of the elaborate visuals or the spiritual and metaphysical theme. I also liked the sets, costumes and props, which were able to accurately recreate the atmosphere of the American middle class of the 1950s. The music and sound effects also do a very good job."

And just in case anyone is in any doubt about this, the keen of noir eye will notice the film showing at the theatre next to the Riverview Hotel is Nightmare Alley, the brilliant Tyrone Power noir pic from 1947.

On the style front the production is top draw, Carranza's photography is both beautiful and ghostly, creating a brooding atmosphere befitting the plot machinations. The look is supplemented considerably by Tahouri's edgy pulse like musical score, while the Art Deco design of the Riverview is a splendid accompaniment to dark deeds unfolding.

As a story we are served up standard fare, the insertion of twisters and linear jumps not really lifting it out of its predictable trajectory. Which is a shame, because performances are solid and Merkin obviously has love for noir as a film making style. The resolution is expected but handled well enough to pay off the patient, but as a whole Across the Hall just about rises above average, but really this is more down to style than substance. 6/10"

Attack the Block is written and directed by Joe Cornish. It stars Jodie Whittaker, John Boyega, Alex Esmail, Jumayn Hunter, Luke Treadaway and Nick Frost. Music is by Basement Jaxx and Steven Price and cinematography by Tom Townend.

When a South London tower block comes under attack from aliens, a young gang of lads and the nurse they just mugged have to band together to fight back.
In Britain we was wondering just when Joe Cornish was going to turn his hand to directing a feature film, here for his debut he tackled a sci-fiction action comedy with a wry bit of social commentary thrown in for good measure ‚Äì it was worth the wait.

With one Edgar Wright hovering about in the producers lounge and Nick Frost on hand as a reassuringly adult comedic presence, it could be argued that Attack the Block has joined the Wright/Pegg production line. Yet when you break it down this does in fact homage a myriad of siege invasion films, but still it becomes very much its own animal.

Cornish dangerously structures his film by introducing us to a young gang of kids who think nothing of mugging a single defenceless woman ‚Äì with a knife. With the group spouting their turf speak (some none British views may struggle initially with the dialogue), they are not a bunch of youngsters one can easily get on side with. In fact to dislike them in an instant is wholly justifiable and understandable, so much so that once the aliens arrive it‚Äôs a human reaction to root for them to rid us of these troublesome youths. So yes, dangerous by Cornish, yet astute as it happens.

As the pic progresses and we spend time with the gang, we start to understand their way of life, their part in a tough society. It‚Äôs during this key phase that Cornish brings in another structure, that of the victim and the perpetrators having to band together to fight an enemy, surely he isn‚Äôt going to make heroes out of this gang of youthful miscreants? So once this scene is set, and the aliens start to unleash toothsome hell on this part of South London, it‚Äôs battle royale time. The blood and jokes seamlessly flow together, the score booms and other characters are introduced, some either for a lighter angle ‚Äì others to annoy us and maybe be set up for alien gnasher fodder?

The aliens themselves are a splendid creation, a new addition to an overstocked market. One of the youngsters calls them gorilla wolf things, that‚Äôs about right, they be jet black with spiky hair and bio luminescent jaws and claws, they move on all fours. And then it‚Äôs the last part of Cornish‚Äôs clever structure plan, for as we are given a reason why the aliens are after this particular group, so does characters transformations offer a prudent point. There is hope unbound, not just for people in movie, but for societies fractured by the way of the life afforded them. While the lesson here of people taking responsibility for their actions, to right their wrongs, is written loud and proud.

Smart and fresh performances  across the board, led by the wonderful Whittaker and a star making turn from Boyega, close out the deal. Attack the Block is a genre spilcer of a picture that brings something new to the table it sits at.

We see, by way of flashback, that Thomas and Daniel's relationship was strained ‚Äì and according to the former had been so ""since his mother died."" Daniel went to Europe without his father's blessing (""We agreed that if l let you take me to the airport, you wouldn't lecture me about how l'm ruining my life""); additionally, Daniel had earlier broken the news to Thomas that he wasn't going to finish his doctorate (""Margaret Mead didn't become a great cultural anthropologist by staying in school"").

Daniel is played by Emilio Est√©vez, who happens to be Sheen's real-life son; unfortunately, he also was 48 years old ‚Äì and looked it ‚Äì when the movie was released, thus making his character more 'midlife crisis' than 'teenage angst.'

I can believe 69-year-old (at the time) Sheen playing a 60-year-old man, but Est√©vez can't help coming off like a pathetic victim of arrested development, even if he's also aiming for nine years younger ‚Äì which would make him about 40; regardless of whether Margaret Mead did or did not become ""a great cultural anthropologist by staying in school,"" the fact remains that by age 35 she'd already published Coming of Age in Samoa and Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies, two influential works in her chosen field.

Daniel, conversely, not only hasn't even finished a doctorate, but didn't finish, for that matter, the Camino the Santiago either ‚Äì he barely even started it, in point of fact; he died ""only one day into the trek."" All things considered, Daniel was kind of a screw-up; in that sense, Est√©vez should have gotten his brother Charlie to play him instead. || A thin but poignant plot takes us on a beautiful journey through Northern Spain. Along the way, Tom (Martin Sheen) is joined by three unwanted other travellers as he completes his dead son's journey along the Camino Way. Along the journey, they learn more about each other and share their stories. The film could have gone deeper into these stories but this would have taken the focus away from the main story of Tom's personal mission.
James Nesbitt plays an annoying Irish writer, Jack but Tom, originally planning a solo journey, is equally annoyed by his new Dutch and Canadian companions. All are plausible people one might expect to find on such a journey. The soundtrack is amazing but the real stars are the landscapes and locations showcased with brilliant cinematography.

‚ÄúKung Fu Panda 2‚Äù is really more of the same. Same characters, same plot, same jokes. It‚Äôs extremely predictable with literally no surprises, giving the characters little depth. What we are presented with here is essentially a paint-by-numbers family film. If you‚Äôre okay with that, then more power to you.

The Furious Five were slapping Shen‚Äôs army of diabolical wolves left, right and centre. Master Shifu prodding his stick conveniently during the climactic battle. And a plethora of other anthropomorphic beasts harnessing the power of said martial art. This very much felt like an animated martial arts feature, one aspect the original was sorely missing. However, despite DreamWorks‚Äô best efforts in continuing Po‚Äôs search in becoming the Dragon Warrior, its quality offers no improvements. Unable to surpass the boundaries of family-friendly humour that reduces the visual splendour and narrative heft to progress the story onto the next level.

Po, having realised who his parents truly are (not a goose...), must save China with the Furious Five from the malicious peacock Shen and his fascination with metallic weapons. DreamWorks constantly pump out family orientated animations with powerful morals every year. This sequel illustrating the ability to manipulate our past childhoods to shape the person we want to be. For Po, this meant ignoring the familial scars that Shen caused, producing his prepubescent abandonment. A notable moral that many should abide by, but unfortunately is weighed down by excessive comedy that diminished a vast amount of beautiful moments. Aside from the tantalising scene when Po finally discovered what happened to his parents, conveyed through mesmerising hand-drawn animated flashbacks, all other heartfelt examples were brutalised by Po‚Äôs apparent requirement to exercise his bumbling personality. Black‚Äôs prolific voice doesn‚Äôt help matters, with a lack of sincerity to his vocal performance, but the frantic pacing and rushed sequences made for a frustrating central narrative.

That‚Äôs not to say this sequel is poor, in fact it‚Äôs just as consistent as its predecessor. Rather infuriating is all given the tender bamboo seeds that were lovingly planted, unable to grow into ferocious stalks. The humour, as overwhelming as it is, does provide characterisation to these animals. Po in particular. Making it hugely accessible for all members of all families to watch and enjoy.

The action sequences were splendid and vibrantly colourful, with some ingenious editing that made one chase scene resemble ‚ÄòPac-Man‚Äô. The oriental aesthetics and environments built a beautifully inclusive world for the characters to roam in. The antagonist, Shen, was far more memorable and sinister in comparison to...ummm...I forgot his name. The snow leopard? We‚Äôll go with that. Mostly due to Oldman‚Äôs vocal work that has a larger range than the entirety of his filmography (and that‚Äôs saying something!). The red and black lighting was, at times, excessive in depicting ‚Äúevil‚Äù and surprisingly dark. No, not thematically. It was literally difficult to see anything!

Aside from that, Kung Fu Panda 2 slaps. And punches. And kicks. But also tumbles repetitively due to Po‚Äôs constant buffoonery. It does however set the third film up nicely, so guess I‚Äôll have to give that a go..."

Given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of Wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. That was before I had seen it...

Being a pretty big X-Men fan myself, I was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. However, I was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. I suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. But rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. First Class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first X-Men, featuring a young Erik Lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. What follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. I won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why Magneto is so resentful of ""normal"" people. This event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why First Class is such a success: this film is all about character. Whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, First Class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become Professor X and Magneto. This concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. I take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. Literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is Xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. 

Another real strength of FC is its cast. Everybody in this film is right where they should be. Kevin Bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that‚Ä¶), James McAvoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young Charles Xavier would. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) Mystique. All other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. However, I feel that most credit is due to Michael Fassbender, an actor I am now ashamed to say I had never even heard of before. The way he portrays the 30-something Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto is stunning. His entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony Erik has had to endure throughout his life. It makes you sympathize with Magneto and understand why he is the way he is. Whereas the ""old"" Magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised Homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to Ian McKellen intended here), Michael Fassbender does something I thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives Magneto a soul.

In case I might have given the impression that X-Men: First Class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. There are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. And before I forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which I know you will enjoy‚Ä¶ 

Finally, a small note on parental guidance: I was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. Like I said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. X-Men: First Class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying Nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. Personally, I would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. 

With all that said, I would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't X-Men fans. It doesn't happen very often that I can't find a single flaw in a film, but I guess this is just one of those rare cases. Great directing, great acting, great everything. Period.

Am sorry.**

Generally, I don't really like films that are too apologetic, that is, films that use cinema to advocate and defend causes, political ideas, social movements. It's OK to be part of the plot of a movie, but to make a movie for defense/publicity of these ideas is another very different thing. When I started to see this movie, I was scared to find just another movie defending the gay lobby, and its social and political flags.

Well, now that I'm done, I'm relieved that my fears didn't go beyond that. The film has a fairly regular script, which seeks to tell an interesting story, focused on how a man begins a very passionate relationship with a charming Frenchwoman he has just met. He was very depressed because of the recent death of his father, and while the film tells us how the couple evolves in their new relationship, it also tells us how was, lately, the relationship between him and his father who, shortly after widowing, decides to tell his son that he is sick and is going to die of cancer and, moreover, that despite having been married, he has been a homosexual all his life, suffering at the cost of that secret and having a secret boyfriend.

The strong point of the film is not only the dramatic story told (I never felt it was a comedy, as some say, despite having few funny moments in between), but also the original way in which it is told to us, with flashbacks and in a very visual way, using photographs and a very visual and interesting narrative style. There are certain moments when I felt that the narrator (the son) was actually presenting slides to the audience, which is us. And with that, I felt that Mike Mills, the director, took a calculated risk, and it turned out very well. Unfortunately, I felt that the homosexual subplot is not as credible. I simply cannot conceive how such a sick and elderly man would be in a loving relationship with someone who is almost his son's age. It's not a situation I can believe in‚Ä¶ not because it's a gay relationship‚Ä¶ but because of the age difference and health situation.

In addition to the good story and the elegant way in which it is told, the film brings us a luxurious cast of great actors, with an evident highlight for the veteran Christopher Plummer, who gives us a moving and extremely worthy portrait of that father. By his side, and equally impactful and powerful, Ewan McGregor, in one of the strongest works I remember seeing him do. And this is not an understatement, as we know that McGregor is a great actor, and he has already proved to us what he can do on other occasions. Melanie Laurent, fresh out of ""Inglorious Bast‚Ä¶ds‚Äù, has another excellent work here, although her character is not as remarkable and interesting as the two male leads. Goran Visnjic, unfortunately, has the most thankless role. I felt like he's really the most in the movie.

Technically, the film is discreet, but effective, and bets a lot on interesting and well-crafted cinematography, with visuals that we can appreciate as the film unfolds. The editing is good, the pace is pleasant, and the sets and costumes are within what we could have expected to find. The soundtrack doesn't stand out or stand out."

You don't miss anything if you skip Super 8. || I kind of liked the making-a-movie-within-the-movie aspect of _Super 8_ a lot more than the chief plot with the monster and the train and the badman government and the blah blah blah. Which isn't ideal, but saying that obviously means I liked something about it.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn‚Äôt quite work as a whole._ || And I just knew then that I was there, that I existed.

Super 8 is written and directed by J. J. Abrams. It stars Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard and Riley Griffiths. Music is scored by Michael Giacchino and cinematography by Larry Fong. The film tells the story of a group of young teenagers in Lillian, Ohio, 1979, who are filming their own Super 8 zombie movie when a train derails and crashes, releasing an unknown being into their midst. As the town is threatened and mysteries start to mount up, the youngsters must come to terms with not only that, but also growing up mentally and physically.

It's feels nigh on impossible to come across a review for Super 8 that doesn't contain the name Spielberg. With the film overtly Spiebergian in themes and production, and the bearded maestro of the film geek masses on producer duties here, his name hangs over Abrams' movie like a watchful father figure. If that bothers Abrams, or indeed if it detracts from the quality of his movie? Then that's up for debate by those not enamoured with Spielberg's movies of the late 70s and early 80s. But to my mind it's a blessing, a triumph of sorts to be mentioned in the same breath as the beard and those wonderful movies of his. Part homage, part nostalgia harking, Super 8 is still one great, sweet and affecting J.J. Abrams movie.

Abrams himself is on record as saying that Super 8 is born out of two movie ideas he had, this while also being drawn from his own recollections in childhood, and the two movie idea shows. It's very much a two part picture in structure, part Stand by Me coming of ager, part Goonie like monster hunt. Nothing wrong with that, mind. However, with that comes some form of irritation to those who venture in expecting a big ole alien attack movie. Oh for sure he exists, and he is big and mean, although he has just cause, but the creature is not the centre piece of the movie. It's the human characters that form the basis of Super 8, be it the kids adjusting to their changing emotions and hormones, or the single parent fathers coming to terms with absence of love and grief, Super 8 is brimming with human heart. Yet never is it schmaltzy.

PRODUCTION VALUE!

Aided by Fong's warm metallic hued photography and Giacchino's beautiful heart tugging score (both energised in Blu-ray), Super 8 always carries a magical mysticism to it. The warm glow of nostalgia cloaks the proceedings, never cloying, always smile inducing, offering comfort as the narrative deals out observations about the need to let go while playing out as a deft, if unsubtle, meditation on grief and growing pains. The cast do wonders for their director, Fanning and Courtney are exemplary, so much raw emotion and energy, it's unfussy and believable acting. Griffith's, too, is wonderful as the booming voiced wannabe director, a tender nod of the head to the many young amateur directors out there; of which Abrams was once one himself. While Eldard and Chandler as the two fathers are most affecting, the pangs of juggling single parenting with loss are deeply portrayed.

Of the director himself? He crafts it with care and precision, a knowing of the pulse beat of the thematics to drive it forward. His attention to period details are admirable, from the dialogue sparks involving Walkman's and Soviet paranoia, to the items located within the bedrooms and houses of our young protagonists, he is a man who knows his late 70s and early 80s onions. Spielberg was far from finished as a film maker of note at the time of Super 8's release, but it did feel then that the torch was deftly being passed sideways. After the excellence of Star Trek he followed up with this most delightful of movies, where Abrams showed in his work a love of cinema that's wholly infectious. 9/10"

Green Lantern does an efficient job for someone like me who was after a colourful bit of noisy entertainment. No expectation levels are set other than to not be insulted, so by and large this does a job. This falls more in line with a comic book adaptation that has no desire to set up a broody and conflicted hero, no hidden agendas or metaphors in the villain ranks, so yes! It's got a little campy flavouring to it. Which is fine if that is what you ordered.

The effects work is very effective, though the sequences involving one of the villains, Parallax, are hindered by it being quite simply a very silly looking being. The story has some credible complexities about it, but the writers strain to keep it simple enough for a younger audience - which is both a blessing and a curse since it becomes uneven and corny whilst still retaining a watchable fun factor. The acting is only fine, but again this is because the script is never sure when to give emotional heft to the characters, or when to add some dramatic vulnerability.

It's a safe superhero film, a creamy desert to satisfy the sweet palate, maybe one that is flavoured with Chartreuse? In other words it fills a gap for a while and is then quickly vanished from the memory. 6/10

Footnote: extended cut recommended as a preference since it puts more flesh on the human bones. || It's an whole twenty year old, this - and I still like it. OK, perhaps it is Ryan Reynolds wandering about in his tiny whities, and he is most certainly at his most easy on the eye for just shy of two hours. He is ""Hal"" a pretty flaky test pilot who manages to cost his employer - mainly the equally gorgeous ""Carol"" (Blake Lively) a lucrative government contract. Meantime, this shapeless baddie to end all baddies - who feeds on fear - has escaped from his remote prison at the far end of the universe, and the eponymous ""Corps"" must mobilise to defeat him. One of their best falls foul of this menace and his ring - the symbol of the power of the Order - passes to the unlikely ""Hal"". What now ensues involves our Ryan in spray on leather clothing and wearing goggles that wouldn't conceal his identity from a blind person in some fun adventures as he learns all about willpower, discipline and the power of green! Meantime, there are some shenanigans going on with ""Hector"" (Peter Sarsgaard), the hapless son of the powerful ""Sen. Hammond"" (Tim Robbins) that sees ""Hal"" and ""Carol"" with just a little more on their plates than they need. The special effects are fine; Mark Strong hams up perfectly as ""Sinestro"" and the wise guys in the impractically long capes add a bit of fun too. No, it's not ""Star Wars"" and the script is pretty diabolical, but, still - what's not to like...? || <em>'Green Lantern'</em> is indeed a rotten movie.

Given it was impossible not to, I already knew the reputation that this film holds - from on/off chat down the years, as well as seeing Ryan Reynolds himself making jokes at this 2011 flick's expense. I can now fully see why, at the beginning I was wondering if it could be as bad as its rep and, boy, it sure is!

Reynolds' performance is pretty poor, this evidently came out in the era of romcom Ryan Reynolds rather than <em>'Deadpool'</em> era Ryan Reynolds; ironically, if this had come out post-Wade Wilson I think it, even with all other elements the same, would've managed to have made itself work. Or perhaps that's too big a call on my part.

Blake Lively is actually alright as Carol Ferris (glad her and Reynolds got something from this experience!), while Mark Strong plays a typical Mark Strong role so naturally is OK. Peter Sarsgaard (great in 2005's <em>'Flightplan'</em>, fwiw) is disappointing as an admittedly lame character. Angela Bassett and Tim Robbins are wasted, elsewhere Taika Waititi appears almost unrecognizably (he hid his accent well!).

Kinda surprised (but obviously very pleased) that this didn't kill the eventual possibility of Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool. Thankfully for him, it's evidently merely a belatedly humorous blemish on his record."

Here, Diaz finds a meaty, funny role and gives it her all.

Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a gold-digging teacher leaving her middle school after a year to marry Mark (Nat Faxon). She is dumped, and realizes the only way to score a rich guy is through ginormous breasts. She returns to teach at the middle school, determined to score the ten grand needed to get her boob job, and another rich guy in the form of long-term substitute teacher Scott (Justin Timberlake), who is eyeing goody-goody teaching vet Amy (a hysterical Lucy Punch). Elizabeth is also deflecting the passes of the nice guy gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel), and begins a campaign of dishonesty in order to reach her goals.

While the script does go off the rails once in a while, Elizabeth thankfully doesn't lose her crudeness due to any life lessons learned throughout the story. She's not a lot of fun to be around, treating her coworkers and students with equal disdain, but the viewer somehow finds themselves riding this out just to see what she is going to do next. Diaz wouldn't have been my first choice for this (Melissa McCarthy would have nailed this), but she surprised me with how funny she was in an unglamourous role. The supporting cast are hot and cold, I didn't get a lot of chemistry with Diaz from either Segel or Timberlake, but the most fun was watching Elizabeth square off against Amy. Lucy Punch never takes a false step in her performance, and watching Elizabeth blithely deal with her is fantastic. The supporting student actors are also good, Elizabeth's withering honesty about their lives is almost refreshing in this day and age.

Jake Kasdan directs with his usual confidence, getting laughs in almost every scene. The screenplay spins its wheels in the midsection. Once we set up that Elizabeth is a bad teacher, we sit through a lot of unnecessary scenes that feel the need to drive the point home again and again (the Christmas dinner at one student's home).

All in all, ""Bad Teacher"" is a pleasant surprise, and it's too bad Diaz couldn't give us more Elizabeth Halsey thanks to a closing scene that could have generated a funny sequel. A brief television series emerged from this but way too much was changed to make it successful. A definite (* * * 1/2) out of five stars.

And I was lost, bored and checking my watch before the fourth minute. So I shall attempt to review a movie I have only just seen but about which I know almost nothing, and about which I care considerably less than that. The following will be far less a coherent review than a disjointed mess. Well, fine. Seems perfectly apt.

So, years ago, the old Autobot leader Sentinel Prime crashed into the moon along with some teleporter doowacky - made up of hundreds of ""pillars"" - that only he can control. The Decepticons swiped almost all the pillars but left Sentinel there. On a routine military... um... I'm not sure; Jolly Boy's Outing? Optimus Prime gets into a fracas with Decepticon Shockwave and finds a couple of these pillars. He then throws a strop 'cos the humans knew about this bit of Cybertron kit but never told him, but now they're more than happy to, I suppose. Um. So Optimus rocks up to the moon and finds Sentinel Prime and revives him. Turns out this is what the Decepticons wanted; only Optimus could revive him and only Sentinel can work the teleporter doowacky (the ""Bridge""). So now they're after Sentinel. But OH NOES, Sentinel has decided that the Autobots are fighting a lost cause, so he's throwing in with the Decepticons anyway. Cue lots of deeply confusing and tedious ""Tranny-Slapping"" as I have just dubbed the Transformer skirmishes as Megatron, Sentinel and the baddies try to use the Bridge to... um, pull their faraway home of Cybertron to Earth? Or turn Earth into Cybertron? Or something.

Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky* (Shia LaBeouf, even more punchable than usual, which by his standards is quite something) is not just a useless nerd this time around, he's also a whingeing **** who wants a) international acclaim and credit (other than the medal awarded him by the president of course!) for his part in saving the world twice even though nobody knows that that's what he's done, and b) a 40-hour job. Anything really; Trolley-dolly at Asda/Walmart will be fine. Despite all this he seems to have effortlessly brushed off Megan Fox and continued to punch way, way above his weight with his new squeeze, Rosie DoubleBarrelled-Surname: English, impossibly attractive, permanently dressed for all occasions - work, play, sleep, dragging her ****hole across the carpet like a worm-ridden doggie - like a $200-an-hour prostitute, and, incredibly, at least 40% stupider even than Ms. Fox, who as we know is marginally less alert and responsive than a squeezed tube of Anusol. How does Sam fit in to the so-called ""plot""? Who knows. Double-Barrelled's smarmy, supercar-distributing walking hard-on of a boss turns out to be a Decepticon bitch (Deceptibitch?), and... oh, Christ knows. Alls I DO know is that this time around, Frances McDormand and John Malkovich have joined John Turturro in shilling for dollars like a ****-flashing strumpet. ""Me so shaaaameless."" ""Me overact LONG time!"" ""Me so shaaaameless."" Sucky-f*cky, five million dollar?

From the very first second to the very last, the whole thing is needlessly convoluted, comically unfeasible - even within its own logic, such as that is - and most crucially, lifeforce-sappingly dull. Just like the other two movies, and of course just like the Transformers themselves. At one point, maybe two-thirds in (or maybe seven weeks in, who knows?), the angsty, poignant strains of a generic rock ballad signalled the arrival of a ""sad"" scene. On-screen, people crouched and clasped their heads in anguish, weeping and hugging in amongst considerable swathes of burning scenery and unspecifiable wreckage. I'm not sure why this bit was to be considered sad or poignant; perhaps the entire cast simultaneously realised they were in a Transformers movie.

Awful, awful. As bad as anything Bay has ever shat out during his spiteful, cynical, moviegoer-hating and barely-disguised subterfuge as a ""film director"". || Having exhausted the more terrestrial locations for the secret, all-powerful, gadget over which the ""Autobots"" and ""Decepticons"" will squabble relentlessly, this time we move to a lunar environment where there is supposed to be a long-buried ""Cybertron"" ship that could just tip the balance of power should it fall into the wrong hands. To be fair to this iteration, the tiniest bit of effort has been spent on a plot this time. We create a good, old-fashioned, cold war style scenario with the Russians and the Americans, and there is also a little bit of Apollo 11 conspiracy to liven it up as just about everyone battles it out for the technology buried amidst the barren landscape. We've also got a new baddie-in-chief in the form of ""Shockwave"" and he continues to make sure that ""Sam"" (Shia LaBeouf) still cannot shake off his legacy with the robots still bent on mutual destruction. The usual stalwarts make up the numbers. The John Turturro ""Simmons"" character is starting to wain a bit now, Josh Duhamel is starting to lose some of his glitter and though mercifully we are now shot of Megan Fox, we find she is substituted by an even less charismatic Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley as 'Carly"". Plenty of action and pyrotechnics, same old, same old... I expect there will be another one along soon. || <em>'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'</em> is an absolute drag. The ending felt like it took hours to complete, then to make it worse (what am I chatting, more like better) it just ends on a dime without any true reaction to the mass brawl that had ensued. Bit abrupt, I thought.

A lot of what I can say about this could be taken from my review of the preceding <em>'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'</em>, just a little bit more definitive and debilitating. I'm all for full action only, I literally love <em>'Fast & Furious'</em>, but even I need some characters to connect with so I can forge a desire to watch 'em - no-one here gives me that.

The cast, if only on paper, is more interesting to look at, mind you. I wasn't expecting to see John Malkovich and Frances McDormand appear, the former's part fits fairly well in fairness but the latter is incredibly wasted with a rubbish character. Tyrese Gibson (eventually) features more, something I did actually wish for in the 2009 predecessor.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has a slightly better character to portray, at least when compared to what Megan Fox had to work with. Elsewhere, Ken Jeong is genuinely good in this - in fact, I'd say he is responsible for any pleasant reactions that I got during this movie, funny guy.

There isn't a lot of comedy in fantasy movies, and there isn't a lot of fantasy in comedies, typically, so I'm sure they thought they were corning a rather unique market.  Honestly though, it's like they had someone write a really great Dungeons and Dragon movie, and then tried to ruin it with humor page by page.  There is a 9/10 star movie hidden in this, if they would do a (slightly) more serious story.

Danny McBride and James Franco basically do what they normally do, but in jerkins: I'm pretty sure they don't even really have accents compared to everyone else.  Franco has a fluttery tone that Zoey Deschanel mirrors, but she is just a living macguffin with two solid jokes.  There is a parody of this where they just replace her with a sex doll and pause when she's supposed to have lines.

Natalie Portman is about 10 times the actor than everyone else in this movie, and I don't know what got her to slum it in this other than it was a unique opportunity to be a bad ass D&D style woman character.  I honestly would have liked to see a movie franchise based on her character.  She makes a great straight man to the band of idiots, given to much more subtle humor, but she plays off of the others' dirt humor really well.  And don't get me wrong, she is a legitimately funny actor.

The overall story is a bit formulaic for an RPG adventure, but it is filled with great characters and villains, and I legitimately think I'll turn this movie into a campaign adventure somehow.  Lazar is actually a really well crafted villain with a decent support structure of henchmen and resources, despite having a rather basic end goal.

Ma-Tee-Tee, as over dramatic as he is, may be one of my favorite villains.  He's a leader, he apparently crafted an entire society to his choosing, and either gained or created his power, and what's more he actually created a system (though unfair) that allows a chance for actual warriors to fight their way to freedom.

There is a lot to love about this movie, and then there is all the stuff they added for attention seeking comedy."

RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Frank Coraci, ""Zookeeper"" is a dramedy/fantasy/romance starring Kevin James as a (you guessed it) zookeeper in Boston who enlists the aid of the zoo‚Äôs animals in his attempt to win the affections of model Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) or, maybe, fellow zoo-worker Kate (Rosario Dawson).

This amusing and heartwarming movie succeeds where ‚ÄúDoctor Dolittle‚Äù (1998) barely gets by. It‚Äôs also more relevant to adults in light of the romantic shenanigans, albeit still family friendly. Everything hinges on whether or not the movie can pull off the animals as (talking) characters while keeping you invested in the drama. And it does, incredibly. I actually found myself caring about one of the animals in particular. As always, James makes for a likable every-guy protagonist. And Dawson is winsome.    

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot in Franklin Park Zoo & Boston, Massachusetts, as well as Central Park, Manhattan (for the bike race). WRITERS: Jay Scherick, David Ronn, Kevin James, etc.

GRADE: B+/A- || Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Kevin James and Rosario Dawson give a good carry, though they have an excellent range of supporting characters and then Adam Sandler as the voice of most of the animals.

While I would prefer him to lose his mind about the animals talking to him, we instead get a ""Do Little"" approach where Leslie Bibb and Rosario Dawson fight over a middle aged fat guy without big money.

With a certain suspension of disbelief in place, you can really turn your brain off and enjoy this, and the zoo setting add some fun, if ridiculous situations. || A shallow, mediocre film that can't be saved by its fleeting moments of humor.

Zookeeper is about a low-confidence man who is looking for love and manages to keep messing things up.  You'll be able to guess the plot within just a few minutes.  ...and you'll be right, because it's incredibly predictable.

The flick is filled with crass/lowbrow humor and physical comedy that mostly falls flat, but it does have the occasional bright spot that is genuinely funny.  Still, it's overshadowed by many more moments where it's just trying too hard, the gag is too stupid, the character is too cringey, and so on.  There are multiple characters that are outright annoying and the longer you watch and the more you encounter these characters the more the entire experience just ends up feeling like a chore.

It doesn't offer much for adults, and there is enough lewd humor, cursing, and religious slurs in it that I wouldn't offer it to children either.  This one's going in the rejects pile."

This is really a great example of multi-threaded stories, obviously inspired by (hell, they even mention it) ""Strangers on a Train"", this is actually a fine idiot's version of that.  Imagine a braid, but one of the strands careens off and crashes into another strand and then it completes anyways, it should look like an Escher sketch: that's this movie.

It's fun.  You get 3 quality actors to be some of the worst people you could write (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, and Colin Ferrell), and, not that first 3 were funny, have 3 quality comedic actors (Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikas, and Charlie Day) play 3 of the most flawed, average people you could write in respective situations of explosive seriousness in which they will ultimately be humiliated.

I think that's a pretty good formula, and they got a sequel out of it, so I feel pretty secure in that opinion.

In all respects, if this was just written with a more serious atmosphere, it could be powerful.  I'm not saying taking the ""dick and fart"" jokes out of it would make it more enjoyable, but it would certainly make it more powerful.

However, it is far from other titles like ""Toy Story"" or ""The Incredibles"". || I like <em>'Cars 2'</em>.

It doesn't deserve to be held in the same bracket as 2006's <em>'Cars'</em>, but that doesn't mean there's not a good time to be had with it. The premise mixes motorsport with espionage, admittedly they don't execute it incredibly but it's still satisfactory to see unfold.

One slight negative is that they give Mater more screen time than Lightning McQueen, which is a mistake. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater is enjoyable, just not front and center as the lead. They could've done a similar plot that has Owen Wilson and McQueen at the forefront. Elsewhere, Michael Caine (Finn) is always a joy to listen to; even if his character isn't anything special.

The racing stuff is cool, with the World Grand Prix. The parts of the story involving strictly that are definitely more entertaining than the spy stuff, especially as we get to see a few different countries via animation - which come out nicely.

All in all, a weaker film than the first for sure but it's still pretty solid for a Disney animated sequel. || **A film more adult than would be desirable, where Pixar insists on giving the stage to funnyless secondary characters.**

The ‚ÄúCars‚Äù franchise was one of the great successes that Pixar masterfully capitalized on, both for commercial purposes and to cement its top status in the field of digital animation. I remember that these three films were accompanied by such incisive (not to say abusive) merchandising that it seemed that the films were being foisted on us. That explains why I preferred not to see them at the time.

If the first film seemed quite regular to me (very good from a technical point of view, but with flaws in the script), this sequel managed to at least maintain the technical level and visual quality. The film has excellent cinematography and graphic work, as is the hallmark of the studio. Realism is excellent, although I felt that it is not as impactful and grandiose as in the first film in the franchise. I also felt that the car races, which were the strong suit of the first film due to their emotion and speed, lost much of their emotion here and sounded much more monotonous. The voice actors continue to do a very good job. Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy secure the most notable efforts, but are closely followed by Michael Caine (with an unmistakable voice), Emily Mortimer and John Turturro.

Where this film really failed was in the conception of the script and the story. I understand the reason why they decided to make Mater the main character: both Disney and Pixar have done this recurrently whenever a secondary character appears in the films that seem to stand out. And as in other cases, the result of the decision was extremely disappointing. Mater is not funny, more ridiculous than funny, and McQueen, who is in the shadows this time, is just another pretentious, obnoxious, arrogant driver. Dialogues don't always work well, and some jokes don't either, although most do. I also have certain reservations about the division of the film's action into two subplots (Mater's and the rivalry between McQueen and Francesco), I believe that this made the film much more adult than would be desirable."

Still continuing on their search for the remaining horcruxes, they must use all of their skills and intrepidity before ""Voldemort"" finally returns to wreak havoc on their (and our) world. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are very much comfortable in the parts now and that shows - their confidence and assuredness adds bundles to the cracking script and well paced direction from David Yates. Not just the three stars, but others we have seen for many of the series come into their own - Dame Maggie Smith (""Prof. McGonagall"") gets some wand action, as does Julie Walters with a cracking duel with Helena Bonham-Carter's ""Bellatrix Lestrange""; the magical effects are superb and the multiple threads all tie together well. Did it need to be two films? I suspect that the audience probably benefited from this in two instalments, but a director's cut of the whole thing in one fell swoop could make for an epic piece of cinema.

I've never been much of a Ryan Gosling fan (probably why it took me five years to get around to watching _Drive_). I am a fan of virtually every other cast member in the movie, but I didn't know any of them were in it before I started watching it. _Drive_ wasn't enough to bring me around on to the Ryan Gosling train, but I'll tell you who it definitely did put me on to: Director Nicolas Winding Refn.

The direction is truly king here in _Drive_. There are a couple of stylistic choices that didn't work for me, like the repetitive vocal-heavy montages, and I was not at all enamoured by Gosling's character (he seemed like kind of a dick). But overall I was impressed, and will definitely be on the look out for Refn's work in future.

Not only did _Drive_ feature some grandly intense bursts of ultra-violence, it also gave me my first jump scare to make me actually jump in... God... Years. At least.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || Fate? Unknown... 

Drive is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and adapted to screenplay by Hossein Amini from the novel of the same name written by James Sallis. It stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.

Driver (Gosling) has a day job, he's a Hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her little boy Benicio (Kaden Leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.

Real human being, and a real hero.

They cheered at Cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast & The Furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.

Yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands, with Refn, Sigel, Gosling and co, calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.

Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.

Gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes, Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, Brooks is Colm Meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss, the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court, but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.

From the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story.

This movie is pretty much perfection for the genre. Entertaining A to Z story with high-end Hollywood professional movie making throughout. || **This is a long form review initially published in 2011:**

Though it ran at over two hours, I did feel that it had plenty of room to go further than it did. I honestly felt like Red Skull could have had a film all to himself, and actually kind of suffered for making him as intriguing as he was.

Chris Evans was an interesting choice as the titular role of Captain America, given that he's already played American sweetheart Marvel Super Hero ""The Human Torch"" in _Fantastic 4_ and _Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer_. He didn't Oh-My-Gosh blow me away type-thing or what have you, but he was pretty great.

So far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I'd slot Captain America clean in the middle. I liked _Iron Man_ and _Thor_ more, but _Iron Man 2_ and _The Incredible Hulk_ less. Marvel Studios stated that the movie they wanted to make was set in the 40's, even though the rest of Marvel Cinematic is modern-day. This was 100% the right move to make, why? Not because of the setting, aesthetics or direction, but because it's fuckin' smart. How do you have the world appreciate an Uncle-Sam loving upper-middle class white male military blindly-loyal patriot? You make him fight the God damn Nazis, that's how.

It may seem strange, but I actually enjoyed the opening of _Captain America_ the most, which he spends a a meek, asthmatic Steve Rogers, yet to undergo the Deus Ex Machina Super Serum. It really showed the best of Evans acting ability, as well as the writing of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely whom together wrote _You Kill Me_ and The _The Chronicles of Narnia_ Trilogy.

I watched it in 3D, which was more bearable than usual. As the films of MCU progress, each of them becomes more and more a prequel to _The Avengers_, _Captain America_ being the most to date. Despite its almost-entire lack of _Avenger_ cameos, this more than previous films felt like a prequel for what's to come, which is not strictly speaking a good thing.

I had plenty of minor issues with _Captain America_, and though their was quite a number of them, all were minor, and ultimately, the only part of me that regrets watching it was the part that keeps thinking ""My fucking God, I have to wait a YEAR before _Avengers_ comes out?!""

-Gimly || PLOT

Steve Rogers, a scrawny young man, wants to enlist in the US Army and go overseas to fight in WWII. But his size and health means his attempts at enlistment always end the same way -- a 4F rating. Until a scientist sees him and recruits him to try out for a special training program to create a super soldier.

WHAT I LIKED

The Marvel universe sticks pretty close to classic script with him being given a serum that jacks his body into super muscle mode. He's already brave and smart, so it would seem like a no-brainer to send him overseas? But the guy in charge of his training doesn't want him, he's just one man, so Rogers ends up doing public relations back home. And he is quite shocked that the men overseas don't react as positively when they see him as the crowds back home. I really enjoyed the way they handle the first battle scene for him, basically him figuring things out as he goes, a far cry from his battle-hardened approaches later.

I even liked his interactions with Agent Carter. I had thought it would be more subtle than it was, and I hoped we'd see a bit more of her operating on her own (after all, they gave her character a whole series on TV!), but she was second fiddle to the hero.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE

The challenge with a lot of American movies of the war is that it is as if they are the only actors in the war, no allies, just them, and that level of nationalistic narrowmindedness is a bit grating. That may be a small gripe when the show is called CAPTAIN AMERICA, not CAPTAIN OF WORKING WITH ALLIES, but still, it's annoying. I also was disappointed there wasn't a lot more on Red Skull. His history, his abilities, other pursuits, all of it was left basically unreferenced. Sure, some of it shows up elsewhere in the Marvel universe, but a bit more crosswalk would have been nice. I felt he really wasn't that well-fleshed out as the uber villain he could have been.

Crazy, Stupid, Love had me conflicted. So here are my likes and dislikes since its hard to untangle my feelings for a cohesive review:

> **Pros:**
> - The relationship between Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling's characters is a unique take on friendship not generally seen in movies, with the characters challenging each other to move beyond their current circumstances and grow.
> - There were some surprising plot twists I didn't see coming that kept a longer rom-com more engaging and interesting than expected.
> - Cal's love and yearning for his family, no matter the hurt and heartbreak they caused, was truly endearing.
> - Steve Carrell is always a pro, a true gem of a human being.
> 
> **Cons:**
> I should have expected it, but the movie's trivialization of sexual relationships was frustrating. Women were treated poorly and disrespected. It is hard to ""root"" for characters that are that self-centered and arrogant.
> - I was annoyed with the inconsistency of how the film treated characters' failures and indiscretions. Julianne Moore's character was very unlikable because her character stood on the moral high ground over Steve Carrell's despite cheating on him.
> - The movie is classified as a rom-com, and while it has some funny moments, it's hard to consider it entirely comedic. It grapples with serious subject matter that keeps it from being as lighthearted as the word ""comedy"" would imply.

Crazy, Stupid, Love has a higher rating from me because of the fun friendship between Carrell and Gosling, the ultimate focus on commitment at the end, and Steve Carrell just being in the movie. It has a different feel than many other films in the genre, which is appreciated. Ultimately, Crazy Stupid Love boasts some great elements and a charming resolution, but the road to get there has some speed bumps. || Love this movie. This was just like my break up except the babysitter. Really hilarious though. Very entertaining!"

I won't say it is an overrated film, but it simply did not work for me. The same director who had made 'Calvary' directed this one as well with Brendon Gleeson in the lead, but that was an earlier project to this one. I loved that film, not this one, though I consider it an average, because I did not find it bad. The theme was very familiar, and too much wasted scenes with the slow narration spoiled my mood. There's no clear perspective of the storytelling, just it concentrated on a small town cop and his single life, and rarely he fights the crime.

When an FBI agent comes looking for some international drug dealers, a cop in a small Irish town braced to assist the American officer. Though he never cared to involve in it. He follows his usual lifestyle, enjoying every moment of his life. After a woman comes asking to find his cop husband gone missing, he now gets into the action. How serious he makes progress in the case and its result is the rest of the film to disclose.

It's not as funny as I anticipated. But watchable film for its quality narration. The actors were just okay. The characters were really weak, particularly the villains. They occasionally appear and gone for forever, and then there comes the final battle. Did not sync well between them and the cop, especially what they were fighting for, other than they are. Especially the FBI agent played by Don Cheadle casting was worthless. For a fine theme like this, the plot should have developed with at least a couple of twists and maybe a grand action sequence. It does not matter though, at least engaging plot needed, but failed on that part. Sorry to say that I'm not in favour of it to suggest it to anybody, though you might it better than me.

_5/10_ || I couldn't help but wonder just how much acting Brendan Gleeson was actually doing here! He really does look like he's enjoying himself as the irreverent Garda officer ""Boyle"" whose sleepy Irish community finds itself embroiled in an FBI investigation led by ""Everett"" (Don Cheadle) into a smuggling racket that could involve $500m worth of cocaine. It's fair to say that ""Boyle"" does things very much his own way, doesn't really care about any hierarchies and the arrival of his by-the-book American counterpart is just a pain in the neck. Quite quickly, we are on the trail of the gang and though their developing relationship does take a fairly predictable path, their dialogue is peppered with some pithy and sarcastic humour and the detective work shows up, quite cleverly, the differences and effectiveness of their methods of policing. All along we know who there baddies are, and Mark Strong and Liam Cunningham deliver quite well as they assume that the local yokel will prove no trouble to their nefarious industry. The end is a little disappointing, but generally the whole thing moves along quickly and entertainingly with their culture clashing personalities well presented by Gleeson and Cheadle avoiding the worst excesses of stereotyping."

A lawyer in northwest Massachusetts (Sean Bridgers) likes to hunt near his rural homestead in his spare time. After finding a feral female living in the woods (Pollyanna McIntosh), he imprisons her in his underground shed. How will the rest of the family react? Angela Bettis plays the housewife.

""The Woman"" (2011) is a quirky backwoods drama with amusing bits mixed with some thrills and gory horror. It‚Äôs a sequel to ‚ÄúThe Offspring‚Äù from two years earlier, but I‚Äôve never seen it (and it‚Äôs not necessary to do so in order to understand this one). A second sequel came out in 2019 called ‚ÄúDarlin‚Äô,‚Äù directed by McIntosh (the wild lass).

The set-up is good and the production is professionally made, plus the flick‚Äôs witty and the statuesque Pollyanna has a certain appeal in a ferocious way. It‚Äôs a slow-burn about a dysfunctional family and a seemingly genial man being a misogynistic sadist who can‚Äôt handle a strong woman.

That‚Äôs all good but, unfortunately, the climax is too over-the-top (in the manner of Tarantino) and leaves a bad taste; for me anyway. There‚Äôs a hint of humor so you can‚Äôt take the proceedings too seriously, but with themes of slavery, cannibalism, torture, domestic violence, rape, incest and murder, the flick just doesn‚Äôt know when to stop. ‚ÄúCat People‚Äù dealt with some of these way back in 1982 and was significantly more effective and entertaining.

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and was shot in northwest Massachusetts with the school sequences done in Montague.

I grew up watching The Smurfs, the CG Smurf animation is actually pretty good, but there is something about how they're personalized that rubs me the wrong way.  Either the delivery is just different enough from the cartoon, or there is something about the Smurfs being in a modern world that I entirely disapprove of, or both.

This reminds me a lot of ""Yogi Bear"" where in a movie, the title character(s) should be the main focus and the most enjoyable characters.  It might have actually worked against them to put Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays in this.  I don't think they ""upstaged"" the little blue creatures, but they were, by far, the best parts of this movie, and their story was strong enough it could have been a movie to its own...in fact, I'm sure if I looked hard enough, I could find a ""work is hard, I'm about to get fired, and we're about to have a baby"" movie.

For something as unique as the Smurfs, the movie puts a lot of money into it not being anything special.  They could have saved a lot of money by making it a ""girl running from her angry boyfriend"" movie.  They also have NPH specifically degrading the Smurfs for their general positivity in the same manner as the villain: this makes the audience villainize the lead protagonist in this movie, as the Smurfs are relegated to little than hostages in the human movie.

Now, it's not to say that there isn't a certain level of charm to the Smurfs, but it's definitely not the Smurfs I remember, and having such a goofy villain is really all that saves the movie, and even then they go too far with some of the situations he is in. || Overall a cute and nice movie that mostly lives by the interaction of The Smurfs and their arch-rival Gargamel.

A group of Smurfs are transported to New York, because, where else would a magical portal lead, right? :-D
Along with Gargamel and his cat Azrael.

From there, the movie basically consists of two storylines: The Smurfs' tries to get back home while fighting Gargamel and Azrael, and the personal challenges of Patrick and Grace Winslow, the other human protagonists, as they try to keep Patrick's job and plan for their upcoming baby.

And this is also where the quality and rating, to me personally, is split:
The Smurfs all have a fitting and fun personality. Smurfette is really kind and cute, Gutsy is absolutely fun, Papa is a great...Papa and Clumsy learns that, despite his clumsiness, he's a great person.
It's silly, fun and Hank Azaria does a really great job as Gargamel. Seeing him trying to fit in with New York is even more silly and fun than the Smurfs doing the same.

And then, on the other side, are the Winslow's and their story about an exhausting, typical crushing capitalist job with a horrible boss.
It's...mostly boring, more stressful than fun.
And while the interaction and development between them and the Smurfs is nice, one thing is quite clear: These humans were not really needed. The main story would've totally worked completely without them, just with the Smurfs and Gargamel in New York with background actors.

The actors aren't bad, but their story...doesn't matter.

Still, I recommend the movie, because Clumsy is fun, Smurfette is friendly and cute, and Gargamel does a great job at being a fun and silly antagonist.

Katy Perry does a great job at voicing Smurfette."

I like Timberlake (Dylan) as an actor, but this is one of his weaker showings in my opinion. He doesn't give a negative performance and doesn't lower the quality of the film, I just felt this wasn't one of his best.

Kunis (Jamie) is terrific, as usual it seems. Her performance is very enjoyable, she portrays the personality of her character nicely. She definitely keeps things moving, even if Timberlake's role gets more depth.

Woody Harrelson is amusing as Tommy, while Richard Jenkins gives the film a touching side with his role as Mr. Harper. Overall, I reckon this gets most of what it aims to right. I'd say you should give it a view."

This is not a character to be dominated though, and after a nervous start he begins to learn - how to get out of this trap and how to avenge himself on those who are keeping his brethren locked up. It's a solid story, well told, with quite a lot packed into this shorter and well crafted depiction of humankind's intolerance and ignorance of these adaptable and intuitive creatures. It's not long before ""Caesar"" is exhibiting cohesive thoughts and leadership skills so you would not be betting against him achieving his goals... It's a bit cheesy at the beginning, this, but once it's got into gear it moves along quickly and offers us quite a bit of food for thought - about our science, our attitudes and our pharmaceutical industries too."

The movie is a cycle of disappointing cycles, mirroring far too close to the mental hardships of teen-hood.

A must to be seen. || I just watched The Help, almost immediately after finishing the book. Now, when comparing The Film to The Book it was based on (generally speaking), one major rule of thumb almost always applies: The Book is better. The Help is no exception.

Accordingly, with the novel still so fresh in the back of my mind, separating my mind from the book in order to enjoy the film was an almost impossible task. No matter how hard you try, you just can't quit comparing the two, nitpicking every detail and being frustrated with everything they changed. Nevertheless, I was still able to enjoy the film for what it was, though I am glad that I possessed full knowledge of the actual story.

The Help tells the story of black domestic servants in 1960's Jackson, Mississippi. It focuses on white Miss Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan, and her efforts to give a voice to black maids by writing their stories from their perspective and thus giving them an opportunity to be heard for the first time in their lives. Among the black women, Aibileen and Minny are the two key characters.

So let's just get the ""bad"" stuff out of the way. One of the elements in the novel that I enjoyed the most was the incredibly delicate bond of trust and understanding that builds up (over an extensive period of time) between Aibileen and Skeeter. It really does take Skeeter a long time before she finally wins Aibileen over and convinces her to share her deepest feelings with a white woman. In the film, this process felt rather rushed, like Aibileen just woke up the next morning and decided to do it. What bothers me about this is not just the fact that (oh, clich√©) it was ""better"" in the book, but mostly because the film forgets to underline WHY it took so long. Not only is it much more clearly explained in writing that these black women face an incredible danger in divulging their true feelings about the white women they work for, the film also fails to capture the palpable tension and sense of urgency of the book. These women aren't just risking their jobs, they are risking their lives, AND the lives of their loved ones. They're in danger just for being seen talking to a white lady. I found this to be a rather big flaw of the film.

The film also lacks a lot of the character development I was hoping for. Quite a few character changes were made, so that in the film they all just kind of appear out of nowhere, and more or less seem to go about their business without ‚Äì again ‚Äì the big ""why"" of it all. One of the most underexposed characters was a woman named Celia Foote, who is a poor white trash girl who married way out of her league ‚Äì and because of it, has to face the constant disgrace and condescension from the other stuck-up, ""sophisticated"" white ladies. Celia is just the sweetest, loveliest person in the entire story, and her relationship with her maid Minny is heart warming. The fact that they barely included this in the film is a real shame.

OK ‚Äì if I keep comparing the film to the book, this review will never reach its end. Obviously, there is a lot more I could (and certainly want to) say, but it's not really relevant to the effectiveness of this review. So, moving on.

At least they got the actors right! Each and every one of them was cast spot-on to their character. Emma Stone is wonderful as Skeeter ‚Äìcapturing her youthful daring and naivet√© perfectly. There's also something about her voice and attitude that make it clear that this girl is different from her snooty bridge club peers. Viola Davis is the perfect Aibileen ‚Äì all I kept thinking was, damn, she should have gotten that Oscar. Her performance is very moving and heartfelt. Octavia Spencer did actually win an Oscar for her role as Minny, and it was well deserved. She is exactly as I imagined Minny to be ‚Äì sassy, smart-mouthed and with an attitude that could render any white woman speechless, even if it means losing her job a dozen times. Celia Foote is played by Jessica Chastain, and I fear I'm at risk of doubling over in superlatives to describe how perfect she was, so I'll just leave it at this.

The Evil Witch in this story is Hilly Holbrook, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. I'm not sure how big of a compliment it is to say that she is very good at playing a snide, cunning racist ‚Äì so let's just say she is a very good actress. Another actress worth mentioning is Allison Janney, who plays the role of Skeeter's mother. Though she is not quite like I imagined her the way she was in the book (there we go again...), I always enjoy her performances very much and this one's no exception. Oh, and Sissy Spacek plays Hilly's mother, and she is a delight to watch. I got the feeling that the director extended her role to a little more than what it was in the book, just to give her more screen time. I don't blame him.

Overall, the film is properly paced and reasonably well-constructed, though some creative liberties are taken here and there considering the timeline. In comparison to the book, it is a little disappointing, but I can't think of a single book-to-film adaptation where this wasn't the case.

I still rate The Help 8 out of 10, because I think it is an important story to be told and the performances are stellar, but if you have a little more patience, I strongly recommend reading the book instead.
_(March 2013)_ || Great watch, probably won't watch again, and can recommend.

To be fair, you should watch this prepared for what it is: 
a racial suffrage movie.

That means that it is filled with racism and unfair strife, and stupid jerks of the elite class that are under the impression that they can still buy and sell people because they do.

This is a fantastic movie, but it is a heavy, serious story, and the humor in it barely makes it more palatable in that regard.

The cast is filled with great actresses who give excellent performances, the script is well written, and the production value is great.

It isn't going to provide a level of escapism from worldly problems, but I don't have to like a movie to recognize its greatness."

This is probably my favorite ""body swap"" trope movie.  It's Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman for crying out loud.  If you've ever liked anything they've ever done (aside from ""Green Lantern"") then you'll probably like this.  Seeing them do ""impressions"" of each other is a bonus.

As far as ""body swapping"" goes, I think this is the only non-parent child, non-male female swap that I've seen, which is probably what makes it a lot of fun: there's no socio-political debate sitting in the background on single vs married, but all the fun of ""now I have to deal with THIS"".  Maybe there are some issues of how redeemable the characters are in their flaw sets, but it's built into the premise.

With Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde backing up the leads, everyone gives a stellar performance.  The production value is clearly there, though I think most of it went into locations and cast budgets: this isn't an action-car-chase movie, it's a ""body swap"" dirt humor rom com.

The writing does skew dirty in the humor, but if you have an open mind, then the humor ends up being in the surprise of dealing with each others lives unprepared.  Despite the juvenile basis of guys trying to do whatever they want, the movie is surprisingly touching and about togetherness."

Hee, no surprise to find great division among horror fanatics, whatever the film or franchise, hot debate - even furious anger - can be found. FD5 has unsurprisingly garnered mixed reactions, but even allowing for the fact that as an idea it's a series that can't get better, part 5 is a considerable step up from the very poor part 4. It also boasts a neat trick of the tail, where some ingenuity is used to bring the series full circle, with a glint in the eye and a bloody tongue in the cheek.

Once again the opening and closing credit sequences are superb, doffing its cap to what is undoubtedly a very popular horror franchise. The disaster that underpins the formula is one of the best to be staged, a mighty bridge collapse that terrifies and thrills in equal measure. Then of course it's same old same old, which you would think anyone venturing into watch would expect anyway. Acting is as usual mixed, but the deaths are up to the ingenious standard set throughout all the other films, and then a narrative twist at the finale arrives to seal the deal for a rollicking good time. We even get a welcome return of Tony Todd - Bonus! If it proves to be the final Final Destination then it's a fitting closure, because there is thought here. Anyone taking on another will have to come up with a whole new idea to appease the horror hordes.

Enough Now. 7.5/10 || ***One of the best of the franchise, if not THE best***

The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second a highway pile-up, in the third a rollercoaster mishap, in the fourth a racetrack calamity. In this fifth and most recent film (2011) it‚Äôs a spectacular bridge collapse and it‚Äôs probably the best opening tragedy of the franchise.

All of the movies in the series tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.

""Final Destination 5"" features Nicholas D'Agosto as the main protagonist with Emma Bell as his blonde girlfriend. Tom Cruise lookalike, Miles Fisher, is also on hand while Ellen Wroe plays the gymnast. Meanwhile Tony Todd returns as the creepy coroner who seems to know more about the situation than he should.

While it‚Äôs true that you know exactly how this film will play out if you've seen the first four installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the females. For one, this movie has a superb score and soundtrack, at least on par with the previous installment. Aside from featuring the most thrilling opening tragedy, there are several creative death scenes involving a gymnast accident, an Asian spa, eye surgery, a factory mishap and a restaurant altercation. This entry also throws in a unique twist that I‚Äôm not going to give away (but if you‚Äôve seen the trailer you already know what it is). There‚Äôs an additional surprise at the end, which nicely wraps up the five-movie franchise.

The film runs 92 minutes and, like the first three films, was shot in the Vancouver area (the fourth film was shot in the East).

GRADE: B+ || Part 5 has a lot more interesting ways to have people killed. There getting wiser and smarter with every killing."

How I‚Äôve missed great horror. American studios have, by and large, ignored producing truly great horror over mindless pablum like Final Destination 6, or Saw 23, or Nostalgic Horror Film Remake 117. Slashers, gore-fests, dead teenager movies and all the other imagination-barren dreck neglect that incredible power a great horror film can wield over its viewer: namely, that it‚Äôs the only genre that can truly encompass every emotion, running the audience through the gamut so thoroughly that they‚Äôre exhausted and fully satisfied at the end.

Don‚Äôt Be Afraid of the Dark is a great horror film. I‚Äôd also rank it up there with the great fantasy films; dark fantasy, to be sure, as dark as it gets, but fantasy all the same. It‚Äôs a faery tale, with the a-e spelling, replete with faeries, an evil stepmother, a princess and a castle.

Oh, and what a castle it is: the film takes place in the dark, dusty confines of the gloriously decaying Blackwood Manor, a house into which reasonable people would never dream of entering, much less owning. Luckily for us, this faery tale is populated by and large with unreasonable people, for reasonable people have no place in faery tales.

Little Sally Hirst is sent to live with her father in Blackwood Manor, as her mother doesn‚Äôt want her anymore. Her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his live-in girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) are working on restoring the mansion to its former glory, it having been empty for the last hundred years. But Sally‚Äôs arrival awakens‚Ä¶things.

Lurking things.

Hungry things.

Little do Sally, Alex and Kim know the dark history of what happened to old Emerson Blackwood, and the secrets that the bolted-shut fireplace holds, or what has been unleashed at Blackwood Manor.

The tropes of the faery tales are both apparent and subverted here. Sally (Bailee Madison) is a withdrawn, sullen child, wise beyond her years and smart enough to know she‚Äôs been abandoned. Alex is a father who loves his daughter, but doesn‚Äôt know how to be a parent to her. Kim is a de facto stepmother who didn‚Äôt ask for this child but does her best to provide Sally with warmth and love, particularly in lieu of Alex. Terrors are visited upon the girl, but only she knows they‚Äôre real; after all, what parents truly believe there are monsters under their child‚Äôs bed? Parents know that the monsters aren‚Äôt real, even if they are. Children know the monsters are real, and no collection of assurances, no matter how lovingly given, offer enough protection.

Bailee Madison is the focus of the film, and she gives a terrific performace. She‚Äôs a real little girl, not a falsely-spun Hollywood version of one. She is reckless, irresponsible, smart, sullen, and terrified. Katie Holmes shines as the stepmother who tries her hardest. Guy Pearce fares well, though he has the most thankless role as the Parent Who Doesn‚Äôt Believe.

One of the great strengths of the film is how it uses that frustrating disbelief as one of its pillars. The creatures are eventually seen, in ever more apparent lighting, and what that removes from their eeriness it adds to their threat; we know, as does Sally, that these monsters are real, and without help, harm will come. It‚Äôs an growing, inexorable conclusion that is terrifying in its mounting inevitability.

The entirety of the film is masterfully crafted: the acting is uniformly excellent, the atmosphere is thick and foreboding, the cinematography lush and gorgeous, the art direction is darkly enchanting and the sound design (particularly of the creatures) is terrifying. Even after the creatures have been revealed, their terror doesn‚Äôt diminish, and I credit that not only to the sure hand of first-time director Troy Nixey but also the impeccable sound design.

Nixey, a former comic book artist, was hand-picked by producer and cowriter Guillermo del Toro after seeing Nixey‚Äôs short film ‚ÄúLatchkey‚Äôs Lament.‚Äù It was a perfect choice. Del Toro worked for decades on remaking this film, based on an ABC movie of the week from the 1970s starring Kim Darby. He said the film terrified him so much that it was the impetus for him to go into horror filmmaking. And del Toro‚Äôs signature touches are all around, from the youthful heroine to the incorporation of faery tales to the trademark art design. None of that should dilute the appreciation for Nixey‚Äôs work, however; it‚Äôs so rare to find a director who takes time to build atmosphere and ratchet up tension to the breaking point rather than telegraph every scare and pull the trigger too soon.

The film is rated R, for there is no other rating to accommodate it. The filmmakers were attempting for a PG-13 film, which they thought they could accomplish without overt gore, language, or sex. When they submitted it for rating, the MPAA gave it an R for intensity, saying it was non-negotiable for ‚Äúpervasive scariness.‚Äù Upon being asked what they could do to get a more commercially-viable PG-13, the MPAA responded ‚ÄúWhy ruin a perfectly scary movie?‚Äù

Don‚Äôt Be Afraid of the Dark has what is so lacking in horror films today: imagination. Dark, terrifying, magnificent imagination. The kind that makes you glad you‚Äôre able to sit there, in a darkened theater, and let it devour you whole. || Well, aside from a bit of a ""Neighbours"" reunion between Guy Pearce and Alan Dale, there's not really much to say about this film. Pearce is ""Alex"" who, with girlfriend ""Kim"" (Katie Holmes), has set up home in a stately pile where his daughter ""Sally"" (Bailee Madison) discovers an hitherto long sealed up cellar. Like most brats her age, she cannot leave well alone - despite warnings from the wary ""Harris"" (Jack Thompson) - a relative of the previous owner who disappeared under mysterious circumstances - and so soon she is reaping the rewards for her meddling. What now ensues reminded me of a well known Christmas film where you mustn't feed or water the baddies... Only this one comes with a load of frenetic screaming and hysteria that actually - especially the bath scene - had me praying for a quick, child-free, resolution to all of our problems. Guillermo del Toro may have written the screenplay, but in the hands of director Troy Nixey we are presented with a rather derivative storyline that isn't greatly served by a lacklustre Pearce and by the always over-rated Holmes whose acting career up a certain Creek really ought to have ended there. It's neither scary nor remotely original and the closing scenes elicited a far more menacing prospect than anything we see earlier. Might there be a sequel?? Sorry - one to watch and swiftly forget."

The movie feels very forced.  A buddy adventure, like the first two movies made sense, but a ""reconnection through adversity"" trope feels tired and it seems to take a lot, to include new buddy teams and cross competition just to get them to a point where their buddy adventure high jinks can start and we get some nostalgia for the previous movies.

The Neil Patrick Harris bit feels super problematic, though it is HIM doing it so I guess it is okay.

It's a ""Harold and Kumar"" adventure in a movie about moving away from ""Harold and Kumar adventures"" towards something  about responsibilities and putting family first. || **It has quality, it has several interesting points to observe, but it has a stupid humor that is completely lost by the message it conveys about drugs and sex.**

I saw this movie on television by mere chance, just now, and I confess that I didn't like it. It is in fact a light film, it has some good scenes and moments, it even has several quality points as I will discriminate, but if we think about it, its style of humor, based almost entirely on jokes about sex, use of all kinds of drugs and such, spoils everything. I know there are people who like these easy laugh comedies, but I'm far from being one of them.

Kal Penn and John Cho give life to the main characters, who they already know very well because it is the third film in this franchise (which I haven't seen and, after this, I won't see it). The film also introduces us to Danny Trejo, Paula Garc√©s, Richard Riehle and Danneel Ackles, to name just a few supporting actors in this film. The actors are doing what they can with the material at hand, I think that's one of the redeeming values of this film, but there's not much they can do when the material is intentionally bad and still makes money.

On a technical level, what I liked the most were the stop-motion animations that appear in a given situation in which the protagonists are stoned. It was a quality asset, and using it was creative and original, even though the film isn't worth our time and money. The settings are also good, especially Cho's house, overloaded with decorations and Christmas lights to the point of being cheesy, thus evidencing the lack of taste of its owner, a drug addict of Korean descent who simply gets rich. The soundtrack also deserves a positive note, if only for its work with the classic songs of the season.

As you can see, the film had the potential to be very interesting and was only lost by its lewd humor, the vile, absolutely despicable jokes, and the film's total obsession with sex and drugs. What was the target audience for this crap? Drug addicts and sex maniacs? A bunch of teenagers without any brains to think? Let's be honest: on the one hand, the film conveys the idea that Harold and Kumar (the junkies on duty, that is, the main characters) are totally irresponsible, immature and unworthy of being considered for a serious matter. This is a positive message because indeed drug users and sex addicts are despicable, irresponsible, unworthy of being considered mature or trustworthy. And I emphasize: marijuana, whatever the name you want to give it, is a drug and its consumption is addictive and leads to crime and death. It's an addiction like any other. However, on the other hand, and despite the fact that the film gives us this positive message, it also makes an apology for consumption! What do we see? People who have fun and laugh when they're high, even if they do stupid things! But drugs are like alcohol and all other addictions: at that moment it seems like a good idea, but in exchange for these moments, we sell our soul."

Besides, nowadays it seems like many mainstream physicists are seriously promoting the ideas around multiple universes or perhaps even an infinite number of alternate universes, perhaps science is catching up with the fiction. (Though I still think a planet popping into our galaxy so close to us would cause cataclysmic tides and whatnot.) . In any case, I recently bought and downloaded a digital version of it to watch it again.

But Another Earth isn‚Äôt about physics or science or what would become of humanity if a twin earth and moon suddenly showed up in our sky. It is about a heart-stopping event that cause a planet full of people to stop what they are doing and look up and wonder. Is that earth different than ours? Am I up there, and if so, is that version exactly like me or have they made different decisions that affect who they have become? Could I have made different decisions, or was this version of me locked into what I decided and thought? And in the case of our lead character, Rhoda, it leads her to a path to seek forgiveness and try to make up for a tragic mistake she made a couple of years earlier, actually on the day the second earth appeared.

So I will say no more about the plot, let alone the surprising little twist deep in the movie. You really feel for these characters. They seem real and you care about them. Kumamoto Pallana steals the scenes he is involved with. Because of the internal turmoil and the questions Rhoda is asking herself, even ordinary interactions with other characters feel imbued with deeper meaning. As a side note, it was written by the woman who plays Rhoda. 

Try not to watch it when you are tired, but do try to watch it."

As far as I remember, this was the first Pedro Almod√≥var film I saw, and it was up to my expectations. I heard that he was a very visual director, that he wasn't afraid to show ugly things as they are, with realism and authenticity, and that he sometimes brought us complicated, ambitious stories. This movie is all of those. Honestly, even though it's not a kind of cinema that I particularly like (and I don't think I'm the only one who sometimes feels uncomfortable when realism and rawness are taken to the limit), I liked what I saw. However, there are several flaws, mainly in the story told. I'll talk about that later.

To make this film, Almod√≥var called a very competent cast of Spanish actors, and it is really necessary for us to recognize that Spanish cinema is going through a very good phase, with a lot of quality and very talented people. Although we are used to seeing him making American films, Antonio Banderas is Spanish, and it's great to see him here, speaking in his mother tongue. He knows how to give his character a darkly restrained, cold, calculating and slightly psychotic look. Elena Anaya also leaves us with a very satisfactory work, even considering that she doesn't have the material and time for more. Jan Cornet and Marisa Paredes, in a frankly secondary position, provide adequate support to their colleagues.

On a technical level, the film also has some interesting points. Filmed mostly in the Galician region, a short distance from Portugal, it is not a tourist postcard, we are barely able to recognize the locations (I didn't). But this is secondary! The locations are good and well used, the sets are very good (especially the operating room, with all the medical apparatus and a very modern look) and the cinematography is really remarkable. Cleverly edited, it's well paced and time passes without we're noticing.

The screenplay is inspired by written material, but has been so overhauled by the director that it doesn't have much connection with the original source. It's something new, even if we can understand or guess where the inspiration for some details came from. We follow the saga of a surgeon, specializing in plastic and reconstructive surgery, to create synthetic skin that he can apply to burned or injured people. Of course, this stems from trauma ‚Äì he lost his wife in a burning car, and more recently lost a daughter, who committed suicide. What happens is that, at a certain point, he starts to make increasingly morally questionable experiments, going so far as to kidnap a person. I don't want to say too much, the film has many twists and turns that make the script more complicated than usual, but I won't be being honest if I don't say that there are many details and twists that have no logic at all. They simply do not make sense, starting with the creation of synthetic skin: the reconstruction of a burned face is a medical problem that is still far from being solved, but everyone knows that the skin is a human organ that regenerates itself, under the conditions and right time. It may never be the same as it was. And I can't see how all of this is connected with any hypothetical sex change (I won't say more, watch the film... but knowing that it's a very grotesque story, so get the kids and grandparents out of the room). || After losing his wife in a fire, accomplished surgeon ""Ledgard"" (Antonio Banderas) has been working for many years on a type of skin that can resists burns! After about a dozen of them, he might be on the cusp of a breakthrough - but just how has he managed to develop this groundbreaking fabric? We, watching, are not the only people suspicious and as his fellow scientists become more openly sceptical, we begin to discover a little more of just what he's been doing for all of these years and that's the kind of plot twist that really does make you cross your legs! This is another of those stories from Almod√≥var that is really quite disturbing - but not in any kind of hysterical fashion; it's an almost perfect paced and increasingly menacing story that is gradually back-filled to powerful effect by an on-form Banderas who juggles obsession and neurosis compellingly. There's not a great slew of dialogue, just enough to keep the thing enthralling and I really did enjoy the last fifteen minutes. Not for the squeamish, I'd say - but a great watch."

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || I quite liked this film, more than I liked Captain America: The First Avenger that we watched a couple of days ago. It has gotten some rather disappointing ratings. I obviously disagree.

I found the film to be pretty much what I hoped for. I read some reviews on IMDb stating that Conan only said about 40 words, that he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù enough, that the fight scenes where chopped up and that you didn‚Äôt get to see much of the fighting.

In reality the first statement is a blatant lie and the others simply not true. The film is much bloodier than Schwarzenegger‚Äôs version and sometimes in a quite ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù way. I do not know what people really expected from this film but for me it was pretty much what I hoped for. Although the Schwarzenegger films are somewhat out-dated I was still afraid that I would miss good old Schwarzy but I really didn‚Äôt (that much at least).

There is not much of a story to be honest, although Simon still yearns over his on/off girlfriend Carli, who by coincidence is also holidaying at the same resort. And Will is still trying to lose his virginity while still coming across as a cynical public schoolboy with morals.

And that's essentially it. There's plenty of jokes and pratfalls to be had, as you might expect with 4 lads getting drunk in a Greek resort; but I didn't find it as funny or the writing as good as the TV series. For one thing their respective parents only had a couple of minutes screen-time here, and I think without them as an extra foil to the angst-ridden teenagers the film just didn't quite work, and felt rather stretched and repetitive as it just focuses on the four and how they interact with the locals and other holidaymakers.

Kevin Smith breaks away from his comedic roots to direct and write this religious/political/bigot baiter that lurches from Hostel type madness into a siege of the damned. Starring Melissa Leo, Michael Parks, John Goodman, Michael Angarano, Kerry Bishe and Nicholas Braun, story finds Parks heading up a Christian cult that lures horny youngsters to their place of worship on the promise of sex with an older woman. Of course once the lads get there it‚Äôs not long before the truth of the lure is revealed and we are treated to hate spiel by sermon and some unpleasantness from the production code edition of the torture porn play book. 

Red State is an infuriating movie in many ways, but it is never dull and it always remains challenging, even if some of Smith‚Äôs sermonising agendas lack cohesion entering the final third of the piece. In fact there are three tonal shifts that don‚Äôt make an altogether appetising whole, Smith straining to bridge the gap between satire and horror ‚Äì cum ‚Äì thriller.

Needless to say, when one of these films comes along, it's only a matter of time before it crosses my path.

Director Soderbergh is intelligent enough to really make this material work, going at it from every conceivable angle (and many inconceivable ones!) yet still giving it coherence in a decent runtime (not a Bay-esque three hours) and there's enough star power to keep one's attention. The best kind of review for these sort of films is that it leaves you thinking twice before you have an affair, or even throw out your Kleenex, and that's specifically what Soderbergh's work here does. || Even if Contagion has a decent star line up for a disease epidemic movie such as Matt Damon, Jude Law and Laurence Fishburne but the film itself actually felt really flat and I thought it was very disappointing to be honest.

Matt Damon plays one of the better main characters who is trying to keep his daughter safe from the infection but I think this subplot was very underdeveloped and they could have expanded on this more to give it more of a thrilling story to really show the world going to Hell.

If you're just into romantic comedies, this might work for you, and it's not a bad movie, but it's not a very strong movie.  It's a ""two guys are going to fight over a guy"" trope that tries to stand out by the guy who isn't obvious being a ""dream celebrity"".

The chemistry between that actors isn't great, and the scenarios are very contrived.  While it a fun movie, it feels like acting when good acting feels very natural.

In a world where we have so many options, it's just hard to tell anyone to prioritize this one. || Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend if you like horror / sharks.

I imagine for someone who doesn't care about sharks, this might actually be a little boring.  They're used really well for a horror mechanic, there is almost a Rob Zombie vibe to this one.

The weirdest part of ""sharks in a lake"" is how the sharks are surviving, or if we believe the movie discussion that it's a ""salt water lake"".  There are lakes of weirder stuff, so a lake of salt water is reasonable, but it is very clear when you are in salt water versus fresh water.

It is honestly the biggest problem with the movie: the rest makes a lot of sense so it doesn't play with your suspension of disbelief.  The story is well structured, and the actors mostly do a good job.

Overall, it's just not the best movie though.  I personally don't mind forces of nature as adversity / antagonists, I liked ""Crawl"", but it has to done with a good delivery.

I don't feel like I care about the characters or the sharks all that much.

It feels like there should be options to just stay out of the water, which is what makes ""sharks in the ocean"" scary, its harder to get away.

In the end its a good watch that feels like it should be a great watch, but that could just be critical thinking defeating my movie experience."

The story is interesting enough and is well driven and directed. Hill does a good job, mostly because nobody had seen him doing a serious role before. || Sporting Economics

I have no affinity to Baseball as a sport, I'm British you see. I tried to get in to it when British cable networks began showing it, but it never grabbed me. My only contribution to any conversation about the sport is that I support The Cleveland Indians because of the film Major League, a film that continues to make me laugh to this day.

I was intrigued by Moneyball, synopsis tantalisingly offering up a sports success story based on an improbable blend of maths (something I hate with a passion), guile and perceived misfits as a team. Sure enough, after viewing Moneyball it has landed joyously onto a personal favourites list.

Unsurprisingly, when digging into the actual facts of the Oakland Athletics 2002 season at the core of the story, I found truths stretched, some character portrayals toyed with, and omissions to round out a better story. But crucially, the key element here is the moulding of a team for what in Baseball parlance is financial peanuts. This makes their 20 game wining run as being an outstanding achievement.

The mathematical aspects of the story are easily explained via the interactions of General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his economics right hand man Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Baseball operations behind the scenes are given fascinating clarity via the tremendous screenplay (Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin). And ultimately the blend of on field action, family relationships and team assembling flows beautifully as one.

In turn punch the air brilliant with heart tugging worth, and brainy into the bargain, Moneyball most certainly a film non Baseball fans can watch and maybe love for bringing something new to the sports movie table. 9/10 || BORING watch, won't watch again, and do not recommend unless you're both a baseball and a statistics or financial business fan.

With Jonah Hill, Chris Pratt, Brad Pitt, and Philip Seymore Hoffman, I thought it would at least be interesting if not entertaining.

As the movie begins and it is clearly about Baseball, I at least hoped it would be done in a fun entertaining way.  I guess Jonah Hill got tired of being stereo-typed as ""fun"".

I know 1 guy that would probably get great pleasure out of this movie as a fan of baseball statistics, and if I didn't know about that 1 guy, I wouldn't have any clue why this movie was made.

I can't express this enough: this movie is about cold hard numbers and how they can be manipulated to impact real people in the world of baseball."

No problems here.  While as might be expected, R. Downey Jr. comes across largely central, it is still a good mix and IMHO the best scenes in the movie involve the generated Hulk character.

With that kind of successful melding of characters, Hollywood-scale egos and even computer generated characters; you have to give it up to the writers and director to make this the successful film that it is. || **A long format review from 2012**

My new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;

1. The Avengers
2. Iron Man
3. Thor
4. Captain America
5. Iron Man 2
6. The Incredible Hulk

I had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it‚Äôs American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us‚Ä¶ So worth it.

I think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. 

In terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau‚Äôs Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I‚Äôve ever seen.

The only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor‚Äôs return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn‚Äôt a Thor movie, so we don‚Äôt need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year‚Äôs Thor 2, it is very possible we‚Äôll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki‚Äôs army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won‚Äôt spoil it by telling you who they‚Äôre supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn‚Äôt really drive the story at all.

I feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.

The Avengers doesn‚Äôt get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn‚Äôt get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!

-Gimly || After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abysmal second instalment of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.

The special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some ‚Äúdepth‚Äù to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.

I‚Äôve always liked Robert Downey Jr‚Äôs portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he‚Äôs supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the ‚Äúpuny god‚Äù scene (if you haven‚Äôt seen the film yet you‚Äôll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).

I have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I‚Äôm Scandinavian so‚Ä¶

Anyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much."

George Smiley (Gary Oldman), having been fired from the Circus, has now been rehired (secretly) to find the mole. He assembles his small team and begins to look into the matters. The possibilities are plenty, Percy (Toby Jones), Esterhase (David Dencik), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds) and Bill Haydon (Colin Firth). His old friend, Control (John Hurt), even suspected George himself of being the mole.

This movie is directed by a personal favorite of mine, Tomas Alfredson, who also created the vampire movie, _Let the Right One In_ (Lad den rette komme ind), as well as the amazing, _Four Shades of Brown_ (fire nuancer af brun). He is a master of creating a dark and mysterious atmosphere, and does exactly that in this movie. The pace is slow, the music is scarce and the colours are old and faded, perfect for a spy movie such as this.

Watching this movie is like watching a puzzle being carefully put together in front of you. It takes time to get it just right, and you have to look carefully at all the pieces. Good things takes time, and this movie understands that. The viewer has to watch carefully, because it constantly goes from the present and into the past. People who have died, are resurrected in the memories of the past, to help us construct the final image.

_Last words... this movie will not appeal to everyone, it requires the viewer to be active, watch carefully, and to appreciate the slow narrative. I will gladly admit that I have tried watching this movie three times before I finally succeeded in watching all of it. I am not normally a fan of these sort of movies, but I can always appreciate spectacular acting, and the craftmanship of a truly great director, and so, this movie becomes so much more than just a spy movie. It becomes a movie about people living on the edge of a war, trying to survive, trying to find the one threat that might break down the wall and destroy the british empire._ || Great cast, nice cinematography and a fascinating plot.

<em>'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'</em> is very much a slow burn but it's worth it at the end, even if I wouldn't describe the premise as unpredictable - it isn't predictable per se, I just can't say I was majorly surprised at what occurs that's all.

It's not as complicated as the film suggests I feel, that's not a criticism but I'm just saying if I wrote down what I thought was going to happen at the start and checked it at the end, I'd be mostly right - at least with an outline. That's not me being big headed, I just feel it throws a lot of false curve balls to go around the houses a tad. The only part, to be honest, I didn't fully get while watching was the Polyakov bits.

All the cast give excellent performances, with Gary Oldman (Smiley) and Colin Firth (Haydon) standing out most. You've also got Tom Hardy (Tarr), Mark Strong (Prideaux), Benedict Cumberbatch (Guillam), Stephen Graham (Westerby) and Toby Jones (Alleline) all there too. You can't really go wrong with a list like that.

The onscreen talent carry events, but this is still a film that keeps you watching and paying attention - just not to a deep, deep level. With everything said, I still enjoyed this. You should definitely give it a view. || **Despite a great cast and good script material, the film is tiring, stagnant, a bit gray and boring to watch.**

This film is a remake of an older film from 1973 (I haven't seen it yet, but I intend to), both of which are film adaptations of a spy novel that was written by John Le Carr√©e. Being the original story known for its quality and this film being an elaborate super production and with a cast full of established names, I was expecting a great film‚Ä¶ but the truth is that I felt disappointed in that expectation. The movie is not as interesting and good as I would have liked.

In fact, the film has a lot of well-known actors, with the strongest and most impactful performance given to us by an experienced Gary Oldman. The actor regained his native English accent and was able to masterfully adapt to the character, fully deserving the Oscar nomination for Best Actor he received that year. Besides him, Toby Jones and Colin Firth were also in great shape in this film, but Benedict Cumberbatch, John Hurt and Tom Hardy are not far behind them.

The story is relatively simple: in the midst of Cold War intrigue, MI6 tried to help a Soviet officer defect in Budapest. This officer knew the identity of a double agent, undercover in the British services. However, the operation goes very badly and it becomes evident to the leaders of MI6 that there really are one or more traitors, very well placed within the secret service. To find out who they are, they call in George Smiley, a retired agent with a lot of experience.

On a technical level, I can't help but appreciate the dark cinematography and the way it tries to recreate the dirty, foggy and somewhat paranoid atmosphere of Cold War London, in addition to the atmosphere of British houses of that time and all the effort of the set and costumes. The film is effective in its effort to transport us to the time and context, and manages to place itself in a pleasantly paranoid environment, where everyone is suspicious of everyone else. It's not an action movie and, therefore, the effects are few and discreet, functional.

Despite strong performances from the cast and excellent source material and well-written script, the film has two main issues: atmosphere and pacing. Tomas Alfredson deliberately slowed the film, and that makes the film tiresome and boring, if you add the lack of movement, the endless dialogue, the way each action and movement takes as long as possible in front of the camera. Also, one has to be very attentive to the names of the various characters, and their role in the film, or we will never understand the plot while watching the film."

Other than that, the movie is really fun but the story is nothing new and the ending is not even working. || The story isn't particularly new, but the writing and the actors do a REALLY convincing job of making you believe in the characters struggles. Don't expect the movie to deliver on the many promises it makes though, they cut the last 10 minutes of film too early. That's my biggest gripe with it and why I wouldn't give this a higher rating. || Warrior was the most exciting, detailed and emotional movie I saw. It had action, drama & descent cast.

It dwelve into the backstory for each character:
Brendan resented his father for being an abusive alcoholic, and made a life for himself and his family. He cares for his family too much to let them lose their home, and so he goes back to MMA sport to win a few money. But circumstances had gave Brendan the oppertunity to win big at the Sparta tournament. Once there, mhe comes face to face with his brother.
Tommy is another side of the coin; he has so much anger in him; he blames his father for the past and blames his brother for abandoning him and their dying mother. But he made a new family in the Marine Corp, for which he enlisted, particuraly one marine who called brother, who was killed in a friendly fire. Tommy then desserted his regiment and decided to enter the Sparta tournament to win a prize money as a promise to his friend's family (this shows that he does have a kinder side, even for a biref moment). He turns to his father to train him, but still resenting him for the past. But near the end, he sees his father relapsed and drunk (as drunk as he was in the past) and seeing how sad it all looks, Tommy realised he wasted all that anger over a broken down drunk and (may implied) forgave him (which was a sweet moment).
Paddy is the father to Brendan and Tommy, but he lost them both (and his wife) when he was an abusive alcoholic. He regretted his actions and went sober. He tries yet fails to reconcile with both sons for the past. While Brendan had fogiven him (but don't trust him), Tommy still held that anger. Eventually, Paddy became heartbroken that Tommy will never forgive him and so he relapsed and got drunk. This inadvertantly changed Tommy's perspective his of father. In the end, Paddy looked on with pride as his sons reconciled.

I really liked the ending of the film, where the two brothers, Tommy and Brendan, went face-to-face. And right near the end, it was really emotional, when the brothers finally let go of the past.

This film was really amazing. It was just terrific!"

A super slice of sub-urban horror crafted by Ben Wheatley, Kill List blends a number of classic British films but still remains very much its own beast. And what a beast it is. Part hit-man thriller and part Wicker Man pagan horror, plot spins hit-man for hire Jay (Neil Maskell) out of his troubled domestic funk, into a world of pain and misery. Taking on a job, he, along with his partner Gal (Michael Smiley), is given a list of names for them to track and terminate. The people and the places they confront are the darkest kind, which brings out Jay's black heart as well. All this while lurking around the edges of the frame is something mysterious, something that will bring Jay to his destiny.

There is a rawness to Kill List that strikes hard, a sort of real life documentary feel that marries up with the black material to chill the bones. It's proud of its grimness, even what humour exists within just feels like damaged goods. The sound and camera work gleefully add to the unsettling atmosphere, tactics which help alleviate the feeling that we are once again watching a formulaic British thriller with ideas above its station. But then the curve ball arrives and hits you on the head, bringing dizzy spells and some delirium. Which builds to a finale that will either leave you breathless or angry, but either way Kill List will not be ignored. 

Impressively performed by the cast, mounted with skill by Wheatley, this is a dark hearted British treasure that hopefully in time will be afforded the praise it deserves. 8/10 || A bit tough to understand on the first watch, yet gripping and a compelling portrayal of inner demons.

But seriously, are the British the only film-makers who can make a decent crime/thriller film?? || Rubbi... Wait, people love this?

Before I started my review, I decided to take a quick look at the Letterboxd reviews. I always play a minigame in my head by attempting to guess the average rating, for example for the last film I watched - <em>'Jack the Giant Slayer'</em> - I called it spot on at 2.4. This I genuinely predicted less than 2.0... it's at 3.5! To tell you I was flabbergasted would be an understatement.

There have been films in the past when my thoughts are the opposite (both positively and negatively) to the majority elsewhere, but I think this one takes the crown as the most polarizing so far. I just didn't like this 2011 release at all, there's one good piece of violence involving a hammer and a head (not like that, ichthyologists) but otherwise I found it all super underwhelming.

I hadn't heard of <em>'Kill List'</em> prior to watching it, I only decided to do so as I noticed it had Neil Maskell in it and I loved his performance a decade ago in television's <em>'Utopia'</em> - which is of similar ilk to this actually, just as violent but miles, miles greater. Those behind/alongside Maskell didn't get my approval either, with only the aforementioned violence keeping my attention.

I could sense a promising concept in there (which I guess many others actually did see, evidently), though this honestly didn't do anything for me all the way through. I sit here flummoxed reading other reviews, even the Wikipedia 'reception' section is all-out gushing about it too. Did Prime Video play me the wrong movie?!

Just noticed that this has the same director as 2016's <em>'Free Fire'</em> (which I rated 6/10), which is a good example of what I mentioned earlier in regards to my thoughts sometimes being a noticeable difference to the majority (fairly uncommon, fwiw). Maybe I just don't like Ben Wheatley movies?"

It‚Äôs quite a salutary lesson in the toxiticy of anxiety and it‚Äôs effects on not just the person who is sick, but on those intimates who must deal with the behavioural inconsistencies emanating from one they love who cannot control their actions. There is also a palpable sense of desperation on display here, and that‚Äôs at times really quite intense whilst all the time we are never quite sure just what might be happening with those storm clouds overhead.

Real Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.

Set in the near future, robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11-year-old son he has never known, they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....

We can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clich√©s that dominate Real Steel, but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's very much perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate, the human heartbeat pleasingly steady, while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are still young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does, lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative, events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience, while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality. But it does uplift the spirit and getting to the end is easy since it's so much berserker fun. Yes it's the robot Atom, the people's champion, yes it's David vS Goliath and yes! It's Balboa vS Creed. Nothing wrong with that really.

The cast don't really have to offer up much beyond being adequate within the context of the material, though a muscular Jackman finds good paternal chemistry with young Goyo. In fact Goyo is pleasingly not annoying, always a bonus is that. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences - even when cribbing from Balboa. The near future look is terrific as well, with Fiore's colour photography very appealing. Coining in over $290 million at the worldwide box office (over ¬£180 million in profit), Real Steel found the family audience it was looking for, proving once again that there is a market for simple and effective popcorn carnage. It's not high art or intelligently scripted, but was anyone seriously thinking that was going to be the case here? If you want brains with this premise then seek out Twilight Zone episode ""Steel"", starring the excellent Lee Marvin, otherwise just sit back and enjoy the ride and let the botty bots and human interest raise the pulse and gladden the heart respectively. 7/10

Home format release is a sparkling print, extras are annoyingly short but the blooper reel is fun, we get a stunt deconstruction, and we learn about the influence a certain Mr. Spielberg had on the production. || I wonder if this was originally written to be a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots movie, but when they couldn't get the rights they just decided to make it anyway. In either case, it's not very good. Amazing that you could take a movie about anthropomorphic **robots** and manage to still make it into a cliche sports film.

The Thing is directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and adapted to screenplay by Eric Heisserer. It's based on the novel ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell and is a prequel to ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" from 1982. It stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Ulrich Thomsen, Eric Christian Olsen and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Michel Abramowicz.

Antartica, 1982, and scientist Kate Lloyd is requested to investigate something strange at a Norwegian base station. By accident the Norwegians have discovered what appears to be an alien craft frozen beneath the ice. Their thoughts prove to be correct and they are rightly celebrating a magnificent discovery, particularly as there appears to also be a frozen being in the ice. But it's not long before everyone at the base begins to regret unearthing the being...

No serious John Carpenter fan wanted this film, it wasn't needed or required. His 1982 film is an awesome slice of sci-fi horror, a remake itself of a very good film, ""The Thing from Another World"" (Howard Hawks 1951), Carpenter flipped the scenario around from Hawks' movie to great effect. Paranoia and creeping dread blended with amazing beasties to make for what many feel is one of the ultimate sci-fi horror movies going. So why remake it then? Well, we are told by Heijningen Jr and his team that this is a prequel to Carpenter's movie, asking the big questions such as just what happened at the Norwegian base station before Kurt Russell's manly mob got there? Making this a sort of filling in the blanks session. Not a bad idea at all is that, something good to work from, even if we know from the beginning of Carpenter's movie just how many Norwegian's survived!

Now the problem here is that it may be a prequel, and attention to detail in scenes linking both films together is rather ace, but it's devoid of freshness, the makers pretty much following the exact same formula of Carpenter's film. Cue a group of scientist types getting spooked by something ghastly stalking them, cue one by one them getting offed in grizzly ways by an assimilating menace and cue paranoia and suspicion. They even put in the test sequence from 82, only with a metal slant instead of blood, while the creatures are the same only bigger in body horror terms and budget. Instead of Kurt Russell's mighty machismo, we get Winstead's spunky lady (she's the one without the face fuzz here), but it's the same old same old routine, only for the ""Scott Pilgrim"" crowd. When all is said and done, this is pretty much a remake of a far far better film.

Yet for all that is annoying and unadventurous about it, it's still a bunch of fun, the director is capable in having us wonder what is around the corner, utilising the cramped interiors for maximum fret. The various creatures born out of the Thing itself are monstrous, especially the two headed one which we see horrifically birthed, and even though the CGI is there, with some of it poor, much of it is blended with practical work and the human actors to stop it from being ""all"" about the effects. It's also nice to report that there is undeniably love and respect for the 82 cut. Leading cast performances are efficient, but Winstead is just too young and looks out of place, she does not, however, fail for lack of effort to make her thinly written part work. Bonus is the Norwegian actors adding some intense character dynamics to the plotting. Beltrami's score nods appreciatively to Morricone's original, and on Blu-ray Abramowicz's steely coloured photography really pings out of the screen.

In an alternative universe where there is no John Carpenter film, this would be a well regarded entry into the creature feature stable. With enough shocks and squirmy screams delivered for the genre eager crowd. But unless you are someone who hasn't seen Carpenter's superior movie, then this will feel like a shallow imitation, just like, ironically enough, one of The Thing's assimilated humans. A generous 7/10 from me because I did have fun watching in the privacy of my own home with the lights off. Other Carpenter fans, though, are most likely to start rating from my 7 and work backwards I feel... || **_More of the same with a female protagonist, but well done_**

An American paleontologist (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited by a doctor and his assistant (Ulrich Thomsen and Eric Christian Olsen) to travel to a Norwegian base in Antarctica to examine a colossal craft buried under the ice and a nearby frozen specimen. They bring the latter into the base; big mistake. 

‚ÄúThe Thing‚Äù (2011) is a prequel to the Kurt Russell movie from 29 years prior. The ending fittingly paves the way for the 1982 film, which featured an all-male cast. This one attempts to ‚Äúfix‚Äù that arguable issue with the inclusion of Winstead and another female character, but I wouldn‚Äôt look for romantic complications because this flick runs 6 minutes shorter than the ‚Äô82 film and so only has time to focus on the life-or-death challenges of the remote station.  

It's basically a re-do, just with a female protagonist √† la ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù & ‚ÄúAliens.‚Äù The laughable torso jaws return, but this shows faithfulness and consistency. The ‚Äô82 film is revered by devotees so this movie was never going to measure up in their eyes. However, it‚Äôs pretty much on par and I appreciate the presence of Winstead, plus it does do something different in the last act that I‚Äôm not going to give away. 

The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot at Pinewood Toronto Studios near the shore in Port Lands, as well as nearby Stouffville and the Canadian Forces Base in Trenton, the latter of which is a 2-hour drive east of Toronto. Exteriors were shot in British Columbia.

Abhorrence. Resentment. Vehemence. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was supposedly both apex predator and pure scavenger, a creature with vastly powerful jaws that vanquished the innocence of flora and fauna. Considine‚Äôs directorial debut depicts the uncompromising wake of destructive behaviour. The hollow remains of melancholic shells, optimistic perspectives absorbed by choleric tendencies of begrudged souls. The bitterness of tainted realities corrupting the individuals who follow faith. Samaritans. The helpful aiding the helpless. A religious follower, Hannah, working at a charity shop, offering solace to a detestable man, Joseph.

A racist. An antisocial behaviourist. A wounded individual, dejected from life, extending revulsion upon the masses. Drunkenly murdering his pooch. Whilst the early demise of his wife acts as a catalyst for his abhorrent tolerance, Considine delicately infers various strands that trigger his enragement. Bipolar disorder. Schizophrenia. Other psychological diagnostics as a result of his vehement solidarity. Never addressing these, only inferring, the visual snaps within Mullan‚Äôs guttural performance provide hints to his character‚Äôs psychosis.

This is a man who has nothing left to live for. A disorderly soul who numbingly drowns his sorrows with booze. Resented by family and society. So when Hannah graciously opens her arms to his wounded personality, his temperament is momentarily suspended. The warm embrace of a higher being. The touch of God. Whilst not viscerally displaying signs of tranquility, verbally slating faith and stating ‚ÄúGod Still thinks he‚Äôs God‚Äù, his first encounter of benevolence alters his behaviour. He repeatedly returns to the charity shop that she works at. A chance for redemption. But Joseph isn‚Äôt the only injured soul.

Hannah resides in an abusive relationship. Slapped. Punched. Urinated on. Sexually assaulted. Her voice suppressed by the overwhelming power of man, only relying on religion to guide her morality. Colman may play the victim role in this unflinching drama, but her character comparatively challenged Joseph‚Äôs personality. See, they both are the same. Like the eponymous extinct creature, they destroy. Both the surrounding metaphysical environment, and themselves. Testing the boundaries of their capabilities and thresholds for personal resentment. ‚ÄúAn animal can only take so much punishment and humiliation before it snaps‚Äù. A resonant line that boisterously sums up the entirety of living nature itself.

Considine, for the hour and a half runtime, produces an unrelenting drama that will drain your emotionality. When the credits roll, you will feel nothing. And that‚Äôs the point. Through all the anger-induced destruction and tonal annihilation, the only remnants that remain are nothing. Just the void of two similar individuals seeking redemption from their wounded realities. Colman electrifies with her balance of fragility and yearn for happiness. The instant switch from tranquil to tempered was unparalleled. Pain and fear hiding beneath her false exterior. It was sensational. Mullan complementing her physical instability by giving a resounding central performance. Terrifyingly exceptional. Marsan also, as the abusive husband, horrifying audiences with an incredibly realistic portrayal.

Irrefutably, without a doubt, one of the most difficult watches of the decade. And whilst certain elements could‚Äôve been removed or refined, the soundtrack failed to enhance the drama and the conclusion needed more time to simmer, Considine has undoubtedly crafted an encapsulating drama riddled in brutality and self-destruction. There is no message. No theme. Just the portrayal of hurt. Hatred incarnate. Two opposing personalities, tainting each other to produce an equilibrium of natural predatory nihilism. || ""Joseph"" (Peter Mullen) has just buried his dog in his garden on a council estate where many of his fellow residents are like him - angry, violent and full of despair. After being beaten up on the street, he takes refuge in a nearby charity shop where he befriends the lady who works there. ""Hannah"" (Olivia Colman) is a woman of deep Christian faith who sees good in everyone and when he begins to visit regularly, the two begin to bond a little. What he doesn't know, but we do, is that she is married to ""James"" (Eddie Marsan) and he's a nasty piece of work. His discovery of this quite shocking news brings both of them to fairly startling realisations that lead both to differing forms of quite drastic action. Mullen isn't exactly versatile, he usually plays the hard man - and he plays that role well here, but he also allows his character to be tempered by Colman who's persona takes a parabola in the opposite direction. Paddy Considine largely lets the two of them get on with it with only the occasional intervention from the rather unconvincing, it has to be said, Marsan to break up the duopoly. The dialogue is ripe and authentic, and the whole thing is structured so as to present the middle of their story. We know what has happened, what is happening but not what's next...? It packs quite punch, this, and wasn't what I was expecting. Give it a go - you won't be disappointed."

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || **How do you define a parenting failure!**

The film was based on the book of the same name, directed by a Scottish director. A psychological thriller, one of those what some people feel uncomfortable watching it. The film holds a suspense from the past event, it is not going to be revealed until the final quarter. Till then makes us to keep guessing it. Followed by the pieces of flashback, the story of a mother who struggled to raise his first born, a boy named Kevin was told.

It takes us to show how happy she was before. Once she got pregnant, everything changed in her life forever. She failed to understand her son. Ever since he was a baby, he had given her a lot of trouble. When he reaches his teenage, it becomes even more complication to her to handle him and events around him. But a big blow is what shocks the entire neighbourhood and her life turns a hell.

Shot within a month. Tilda Swinton's one of the best, maybe the best of all the bests. She should have been nominated for the Oscars. I think that's one of the greatest snub ever. The supporting cast was amazing too, including John C. Reilly in a small part and particularly those Kevins from different ages. The overall tone was great, the atmosphere was created perfectly to the kind of story it dealt.

I should have watched it earlier, but you know the type of film we look for and moods, all some times influence to miss a film narrowly. Anyway, it was on my watch list and I am finally going to scratch that off. It was a good film, but there's nothing special. The theme was strong, and seems like straight out of a real event, particularly these things are common in the United States. So if you are an American or familiar with the American culture, it will interest you.

This is not as inspiring film, but kind of factual film like parenting failure. The end was disturbing, yet there's nothing bold revelation in the narration. Definitely an interesting take, though blaming parents, especially the mother was kind of disappointing, as well as depressing. That's why the tale was commenced since pregnant till the final twist. Actually, it was the editing tricks that make the film to have a twist. Otherwise, it is a straightforward story. Not bad for viewing once. It was slow and too long, if you think you can manage that, then you could try it.

_6/10_ || I enjoyed this, although I felt that it had potential to be really special. The direction was overall solid, with great audio and visuals beats that are present throughout the entire film. It creates subtle and eerie tension that continues to grow until the sinister climax of the film. Tilda Swinton was great and was really the only performance that stood out. John C. Reilly was such a weird choice, I do not really see him as a dramatic actor, and it kind of showed here. Ezra Miller was fine, though I thought they were a bit exaggerated. The pacing was pretty slow, I felt there was too much build up to the finale and not all of it was warranted. Two hours felt too long in my opinion. Overall, this is still a solid film with tremendous direction that is single handedly saved by Tilda Swinton.

I must really like this story, given I rated and similarly enjoyed the 1993 version from Stephen Herek and Disney - I even put this one above that one! This 2011 version starts off so strongly, I love the opening few scenes... humour and editing was right up my street.

Now, it admittedly doesn't quite keep such a high footing throughout, but all in all I certainly found entertainment with this. For the '93 release I was split on the cast, but for this flick I had a good time watching everyone onscreen. I didn't think Matthew Macfadyen would work in this sorta role but he performs astutely.

Ray Stevenson and Luke Evans join Macfadyen in portraying the titular trio, again to positive effect. The famous D'Artagnan is performed by Logan Lerman here and I was impressed - a top performance from someone I hadn't seen much of before, aside from in <em>'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief'</em>.

As for the rest of the cast, Mads Mikkelsen, Milla Jovovich and Orlando Bloom spearhead the rest well. I will say that Freddie Fox and his character's part of the story didn't interest me as much but Fox is fine. Christoph Waltz is involved alongside Fox and is very forgettable... quite  a frustrating use of Waltz's (incredibly high) talents, now I think about it. Elsewhere, James Corden is iffy... and I usually like Corden as an actor.

I haven't looked at the average rating as of typing this sentence, but I presume it'll be rather low. It is sometimes easy to spot films that won't have scored well online.

And a well-sized johnson (as proven on numorous ocassions here) but other than that he's fairly mediocre. || Shame is nothing short of a masterpiece: every shot tells a story.

SYNOPSIS: (from Google)
Successful and handsome New Yorker Brandon (Michael Fassbender) seems to live an ordinary life, but he hides a terrible secret behind his mask of normalcy: Brandon is a sex addict. His constant need for gratification numbs him to just about everything else. But, when Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's needy sister, unexpectedly blows into town, crashes at his apartment and invades his privacy, Brandon is finally forced to confront his addiction head-on. 

REVIEW:

I'm certain Shame will always be my personal favorite McQueen film. McQueen tells a story with the camera and with the voice. 

McQueen brought on Sean Bobbitt as cinematographer for this amazing project and Bobbitt does not disappoint. Together they craft some of the most revealing and beautiful scenes in recent cinema. The lighting for this movie (also headed by Bobbitt), aids in the visual storytelling.

Abi Morgan and McQueen's script really shines, bringing Brandon's addiction further into the light. 

Harry Escott's haunting score will never leave your brain after you see this film. Escott's use of both classical and original pieces bring the film together.

Michael Fassbender gives a stunning performance as Brandon, one moment he's casually strolling about, the next he's acting on his most basic impulses, and the next he's yelling at his sister. Carey Mulligan gave a great supporting role next to Fassbender as well. Both are given several scenes to shine.

The film uses its NC-17 rating to its fullest extent, yet none of the sex feels sensationalized. It's all very real and most of the time almost disturbing to watch. McQueen delivers the entire story very artistically, including the sex scenes, which many directors could have messed up. This makes the film as a whole flow better. The movie portrays sex addiction (and addiction in general) in a very real way, while everyone is different we all feel shame after we've gotten our fix, and sometimes we'll do anything to get that fix."

A good sex / romance based humor from the feminine perspective, almost like ""Bad Moms"" without kids, but one single lady.

To set a low bar of expectations, imagine most of the comedians you don't want to picture having sex, and Chris Pratt in a fat suit, and that's most of the dirty humor in the movie.  It's surprisingly charming with Anna Faris and Chris Evans (Captain America, but really, Johnny Storm) helping each other with their conspiracies, and instead better there lives.

Yes, its the cheesy crap that rom-coms get made fun of for doing (even in this movie, I think), but it does it pretty well, it's funny, and deals with a concept that looks like an extension of the sequence in ""Just My Luck"" where she has to hunt down and kiss some dancers.

It's a stupid concept but it's fun and maybe I just like Anna Faris, but she carries the movie and when something is done well, I typically enjoy it. || I tend to be an easy grader for romantic comedies. As long as the script isn‚Äôt too dull or insult my intelligence, with witty dialogue and good chemistry between the lead characters, I will overlook minor silliness or predictability in the name of entertainment. Let‚Äôs face it, most genre films are predictable to some extent, since they stay within the genre.

Of course, I know Anna Faris from her later starring role in the excellent long-running comedy series Mom. Her performance here is quirky enough to keep it interesting, but sweet at times so that I rooted for her. This is not groundbreaking stuff here, or top ten quality filmmaking, but I enjoyed it enough to stick with it, and that is what counts with rom-coms."

Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a very good performance as the titular character and his co-stars are all solid, but I just found the way that the story is told to be lacklustre. There aren't, at least for me, any memorable scenes and I wasn't invested in the plot at any point really. It's semi-watchable, but goes on for too long to be passably so.

It does, as noted, have a neat cast list, with Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts and Judi Dench, among others, involved behind DiCaprio. I think they all give their best, with any issues I have with this 2011 release being away from them. Two duds in a row to start the 2010s from Mr. Eastwood; in my humble opinion, of course. || My only real complaint about Leonardo DiCaprio is that he looks like, well, Leonardo DiCaprio and that is a shame given that given that he doesn't play Lenardo DiCaprio, he plays whoever the script says he is and we all think he's the greatest thing since sliced bread because of that.

Except in J. Edgar where, for the first real time, DiCaprio doesn't look like DiCaprio, he looks a lot like the cross-dressing fascist he's portraying.

And being Leo, he acts like him too.

THANK YOU. For once the studio didn't bank on his face and it paid out.

So we not only get to see Leo acting the part, but for the first time we get to really see him looking the part too and the last time he did that was in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" And on top of it all we have Clint Eastwood directing and, honestly, not a fan of him as an actor, love him as a director.

Given his politics I walked in thinking Right Wing Love Story...I walked out with ""honest depiction"" and that helps a lot.

Not only does that help, but the scandal around Hoover's sexuality was done appropriately, that is to say it didn't take center stage, J. Edgar did...and, as I said, you were watching J. Edgar and not Leo doing his best to be the man while having to still look like himself.

it's just a win all around...except it could have benefited for time. Trim it down a bit. I know he's hugely important to history and Eastwood is a great director with a great cast but...it got a bit long in the tooth at places and that hurt the flow of the film."

Initially the pic is on safe footings.

Sadly it never materialises into the top line suspense thriller the makers clearly were aiming for.

As the narrative spins into a muddled mess, Brandt is forced to rely on a couple of livewire sequences to save the day; cue interrogation machismo and some car crash chaseville, but it's never enough to save the day.

Mediocre story, bad planned action scenes, tons of Fx, poorly developed characters and tons of stereotypes. || Everyone talks about how _Immortals_ is a _300_ ripoff, and don't get me wrong, it absolutely is, but I haven't yet seen anyone talk about how it's also a bit of a _God of War_ ripoff.

I'm actually quite fond of historically-set mythology films, but I don't believe the problem with _Immortals_ isn't the setting or the genre, it's the motivation behind its being made the way it was. The _300_ movie exists to be an adaptation of the _300_ comic book, the _Immortals_ movie exists because the _300_ movie made money. (Don't get me wrong, I know that the real motivation behind both these, and of any other studio film, is money. But someone involved somewhere has to want more from their movie than that. And _Immortals_ doesn't give me the vibe that anyone did).

I can handle _Immortals_ doing what _300_ does. Hell, if enough people rip an idea off over a long enough period of time, in movies, we call that a genre. My issue is that it **only** exists to do what _300_ did, yet it does **all** of it so much worse. There are maybe two fights in _Immortals_ that last for longer than 30 seconds, even with all that slow-mo stretching the runtime, and neither are filmed as well as the ones in _300_. It's nowhere near as fun, it's not superior in any technical category, it's harder to tell what the fuck is going on. Even the acting, which is NOT _300's_ strong suit, is worse here than it is there. There were maybe flashes where you could glimpse a cohesive idea that desired to form, but it never even got close.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || Immortals is like stepping into a Greek mythology fever dream where everyone looks like they just walked out of a tanning booth, but hey, it works for the aesthetic. The movie is a visual powerhouse, with Tarsem Singh crafting a bold, surreal take on mythology that feels more like a painting in motion than your average action flick. The fight scenes are undeniably the highlight, stylized, brutal, and dripping with energy. Henry Cavill shines as Theseus, delivering a performance that feels grounded amidst the chaos, while Mickey Rourke's Hyperion brings an intimidating presence, even if his character lacks complexity.

Where Immortals stumbles is in its story, which feels more like a vehicle for the visuals than an engaging narrative. The characters are serviceable, but most lack depth, leaving you wanting more from the emotional stakes. That said, if you‚Äôre here for striking visuals, intense action, and a unique twist on Greek mythology, it‚Äôs still a fun ride. Think of it as a movie you watch for the spectacle--not for the substance. Worth watching if you‚Äôre in the mood for a stylized, no-strings-attached mythological adventure."

8 out of 10 stars || **An elegant and moving film about family, family values ‚Äã‚Äãand how they change and adapt to new times.**

Overall, I liked this movie. Skillfully directed by Alexander Payne, the film tackles several issues around a Hawaiian family in apparent disintegration: while his wife is in a coma due to an accident, and the doctors are deciding what to do, the protagonist has to take responsibility for the education and guidance of his two daughters, each troubled in her own way, and to decide what to do with a huge portion of still virgin land that her family owns on one of the Hawaiian islands, and which is all that remains of an inheritance that dates back to the times of the last Hawaiian kings.

Although the film is sometimes considered a very light comedy, I didn't see anything comical or funny here, and I prefer to think of this film as a family film, that is, whose focal point is the family and the way the family works. Being myself from an aristocratic family (albeit without fortune or privileges), I understand very well the relevance of family past, ancestors and the weight of an inheritance, especially being as old as the one in this film. And personally, I can see myself in the way Matt King, the main character, decides to deal with this, right at the end of the movie. He made the same decision I would have made.

George Clooney is the lead actor, and he's in excellent shape, he did a really good job, and he was really believable and authentic in the way he played his character. I liked the way he approaches the problems, and also the very positive collaboration that was established between him and the young Shailene Woodley. She proved to be very competent in the way she gave life to the couple's eldest daughter, an angry and troubled teenager who has problems with drugs and alcohol, and who, however, seems to have a very valid reason for all the revolt. Amara Miller also does an interesting, albeit more discreet, job. There are, however, actors who don't do so well: Patricia Hastie is never convincing, Beau Bridges has almost no relevance in the film and Nick Krause is simply annoying and always seems to be left, in the plot and in the scene.

Technically, it is a fairly regular film, which bets little on effects or visual artifices and prefers to give the actors more space to shine, taking advantage of the good quality of the script and direction. Thus, the emphasis is entirely on the good quality of the cinematography, which wonderfully uses the landscapes of the Hawaiian Islands, fully honoring the archipelago and its great scenic beauty. We have excellent plans that highlight the bright blue sea and the intense green of the forests, as well as good perspectives on urban life, cities or traffic. The colors and lighting were well-crafted and the film never feels lukewarm or too still thanks to a good editing job and a pleasant pacing. The soundtrack is also excellent and makes a very interesting use of some Hawaiian melodies, calm and harmonious."

While Duff's portrayal alongside Chad Michael Murray brought a modern twist to the classic tale of Cinderella, subsequent installments in the franchise have failed to live up to the same standard.

The franchise seems to be struggling to recapture the magic of the original film, instead resorting to unnecessary side stories and deviations from the core Cinderella narrative. It appears that attempts to replicate the success of the Walt Disney and Roger and Hammerstein versions have fallen short, leading to a sense of fatigue and irrelevance surrounding the franchise.

Despite the star power of Selena Gomez in ""Another Cinderella Story,"" the film failed to reach the heights set by Hilary Duff's portrayal. Similarly, Lucy Hale's ""A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song"" was criticized for its lackluster execution and departure from the essence of the Cinderella story.

""Sofia Carson's ""A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits"" attempted to capitalize on dance elements reminiscent of ""Grease,"" but ultimately fell flat, marking a low point in the franchise. Laura Marano's ""A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish"" was deemed the weakest link in the series, solidifying the downward trend in quality.

As the franchise continues with new installments, the lackluster reception of recent films has dampened enthusiasm for further entries in the series. Viewers may find it challenging to engage with future releases given the disappointing trajectory of the franchise."

I confess that I didn't really know what I was going to find when I started watching this movie. I wasn't expecting much, even though I was aware that it was a film about the September 11 attacks, and that it had some actors that I respect, and I like to see. Perhaps on purpose, the film begins in a heavy and slow way, and it is not very easy to go beyond the initial half hour.

However, the film improves a lot as we get to know the main character, a boy whose father died in the attacks and who is trying to deal with this loss in the best way possible. Whatever the age or situation, the loss of a parent is always dramatic. Believe me, dear reader, who is following me so patiently in these lines, I have been feeling it in my skin during the last few months, since I lost my beloved mother recently, and I believe that this personal circumstance had an influence on the way I ended up seeing myself in the boy, and in the emotional and moving way he tries to deal with grief and absence. He believes his father left him one last ""treasure hunt"" around a mysterious key, and he struggles to see meaning in his father's death, and in finding the key. It sounds childish, but allow me to be honest, I confess that I too, in the silence of my suffering and pain, felt and still feel the need to find some reason, some order in the midst of random chaos. Perhaps we, human beings, cannot accept that the people we love so much... simply die. And maybe we're right in not accepting just that...

By that, I mean that the horrible tragedy that happened in New York made sense in itself? No... evil is meaningless, but it doesn't need to make sense. What I refuse to think is that all those people died in vain. I believe that the American people, and all of us as a Western society, find meaning in everything that has happened, and we see those people as victims of unspeakable cruelty, which poignantly reminds us how vulnerable we are to the mind of a madman, vile and determined enough. I believe that each family member who lost someone there found a very personal meaning in their loss, and I hope this helped in the task of dealing with what happened.

Despite being very young, I liked the work developed by Thomas Horn. He did everything well, and he gives his character a naivety that is never childish or lacking in sense and intelligence, quite the opposite. Tom Hanks is, as is almost always the case, impeccable and gives the boy's father an aura of familiarity and sympathy of his own, which the actor knows how to use very well. Likewise, the charismatic and professional Sandra Bullock did a very interesting job in the role of the mother. Despite being nominated for an Oscar, I think Max Von Sydow has done much better and more complete work. Even so, I liked the way he was able to express himself and communicate without using a single word. Zoe Caldwell also did a good job, albeit in a much more restrained register than the others. On the other hand, I thought that John Goodman, Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are all very underused.

The film covers several places in New York, and it is not necessary to have visited the iconic city to recognize them very easily, and appreciate the friendly way in which the film takes advantage of them and gives them shine and beauty. The cinematography helped a lot at this point, with a very well worked light, color and brightness, and a good post-editing of the images."

A solid and entertaining voice cast - especially Bill Nighy and James McAvoy as our intrepid delivery boys deliver an entertainingly paced script well, with some enjoyably crafted animation and a suitably jolly score from Harry Gregson-Williams. It's fun, this - and offers plenty for younger and older alike."

**Pros**: strong performance from the star. Technically excellent.

**Cons**: Seems to me that the ending was premature but perhaps intentionally so - for a sequel? Character development is largely weak but there are a lot of characters and already a long movie so I suspect a lot was left on the cutting room floor.

Despite some weakness, still a compelling movie worth a watch if not up to all of the hype. || Stories about revolution can be quite good.  But stories about why a revolution is needed are invariably great.  The Hunger Games is such a story.

The movie (for the most part), closely follows the book, and does a good job of it.  It also sets up the next book/movie beautifully, even better than the book itself does.

The premise, of course, is borrowed from Ancient Rome, when gladiators and/or criminals an/or people whom the emperor wanted killed were forced to fight each other to the death in a public arena for the entertainment of the general populace.  And just as decadent as Rome was back then (only rescued from itself by the rise in prominence of The Christian sect), so the ""Capitol"" is now portrayed in the film/book---and the film portrayed the affluent decadence of the Capitol quite well.

In this particular instance the ""tributes"" were chosen at random from among children aged 12 through 18, and it was meant as retribution and reminder of the ""crimes"" the 12 colonies committed by reveling against the authority and rule of the Capitol 74 years ago.  At the public ""reaping"", when a boy and a girl were chosen to become the sacrificial tributes at teach of the 12 colonies, the Decree of Punishment was read and the colonies were reminded that this punishment was established to demonstrate how weak the colonies were in comparison with the Capitol, in that the Capitol could take the most prized possessions of the colonies (namely, their children), and the colonists themselves could do nothing about it.  And to really rub it in, the colonists themselves were forced to watch the tournament proceedings.

I have to say, the punishment is deviously clever from the point of view of the Capitol.  It certainly keeps the Colonies divided in spirit (they were already segregated physically, with no communication between them allowed by the Capitol), for in cheering for their own children they are therefore cheering for the defeat---and therefore death---of the other colonies' children.  It also keeps colonists divided within each colony, for there can only be one champion, which means that in wishing their children not to be chosen at the reaping, each colonist is thereby wishing that someone else's children be chosen.  Furthermore, in celebrating that their children were not chosen, they are also, incidentally, celebrating that some other person's children will likely die.  And for the families of the chosen children, in supporting their own family member during the tournament, they are incidentally supporting the death of the other family's child.  And it keeps the population of the colonies low, which the Capitol would want to promote (less chance for another insurrection if the population is low): for the youngest are taken, before they are married, and those who survive the yearly reapings will think twice about having children of their own and having them go through this traumatic process year after year during their most vulnerable adolescent years.  And furthermore, the Capitol encourages the colonists' tacit endorsement by rewarding the winner's Colony with extra food that year (hence ""The 'Hunger' Games"").  But it is all manipulation, in the end.

In fact, by the end of the Games, right before being killed himself, one of the most avid killers among the children realizes just how much it all is the Capitol's manipulation, how pointless it all is to those who participate, and how, in the end, he didn't really have a chance---that he was destined to die from the beginning---and that killing or being killed is all that not only the Capitol, but also his Colony, want from him.  An eye-opening realization for someone who up to this point had been quite eager to kill his fellow children.

Given the vicious circumstances which were thrust upon these children---none of which is their fault---the question naturally arises: how should a child bound under the moral law behave?  Should he try to win, by killing the other children?  Should they try to win at all?  Should they let themselves be killed, in order that another might live?

Of course, the obvious moral choice would be for none of the children to participate in this horrendous form of reality television: if they do not fight each other the show is not interesting, and eventually it is discontinued.  The children would likely still be executed, along with many of their own family members in reprisal from the Capitol.  If one thinks in terms of consequences only (utilitarianism), then this would be the wrong approach: after all, they would say ""it is better that one person survives than that they---and all their families---die"".  But such thinking is quite repugnant, however logical it is.  Consequentialism is missing a big piece of the moral landscape, namely that we ought not to become evil ourselves in our fight against evil.  Yes, the consequences of ""civil disobedience"" as could morally be practiced in this scenario are more dire in terms of the quantity of damage made.  But they are much more preferable in terms of the quality of damage made.  By fully participating in the carnage (and inflicting some yourself) you become complicit in the very evil which oppresses you.  Similarly, your family, and even your colonies (and all colonies, for that matter) become part of the system, and in some tacit way endorse it---for they all want their children to live, and tacitly support the other colonists' children's death.  Furthermore, what kind of person does one become after killing 23 children by brutal means at a very young age (when the impressions of life still shape us in a powerful manner)?  What kind of society does one help create when one has inwardly become a psychotic monster?  What kind of society abides criminal monsters in its midst?

But, some will claim, it is unrealistic to expect each and every child to be morally minded, especially when some children (from two different colonies which are highly favored by the Capitol) actually volunteered for the ""honor"" to represent their colonies at the tournament.  What is the correct moral response when civil disobedience is not an option (no opportunity) and some, if not most of the other children are out to kill you, whether by pleasure or need to survive?

It seems to me there are two possible moral responses.  one of them is the route of self-defense, whereby one does not intentionally kill or go out of one's way to engage the enemy, but tries to flee as a first alternative, BUT where one DOES defend oneself against the attacks of others, and inflicts only as much harm as is necessary to stop the aggressor, AND only if absolutely necessary one uses lethal force.  In the end, very likely, the Capitol would force matters to a resolution, either by forcing ""aggressors"" and ""defensors"" into a particular area (very good television), or by artificially creating natural/artificial disasters which killed whomever they disliked most.  But, again, this would be the Capitol's doing: an evil force acting evilly which one cannot stop.  One would have been preserved from sinking to doing/becoming evil.

The other moral route, the more perfect route, would be the route of Jesus: to willfully become the sacrificial lamb for the sake of spiritual (and therefore) moral change.  The martyrs of the Church have for ages followed this route, to the spiritual benefit of the whole Church, and the cultural benefit of all humanity.  The spiritual benefit is quite and readily seen through the Communion of Saints, whereby these martyr's love renews and creates the Church anew, greatly adding to the spiritual gifts of which the rest of us partake---gifts which slowly transform us for the better, over years and generations.  And it is this transformation which over the centuries affects culture.  Gradually better people live their lives out in gradually better communities.  And Love wins out at the end of time.  After all, very few societies nowadays would consider it acceptable to inflict the tortures which were inflicted to prisoners (especially Christians) in the ancient days of Rome: we are all repulsed by the Capitol's Decree of Punishment.  If we only partook more of those graces which Christ offers through His Church!

One particular odd feature of the book (and the film) is the avoidance of any mention of God or religion whatsoever.  Not even empty phrases deriving from religion appear (""My Gosh"", ""God willing"", Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.).  Why is that, especially when the subject matter so clearly lends itself to a religious treatment?  Why is that, when the least historically educated among us would have heard the stories of the Christians ushered into the Colosseum to be executed/sacrificed?  The closest religious reference is when Katniss Everdeen improvises a type of tribute around a fallen friend and ally in the game by creating a bed of flowers for her: the very earliest expressions of the religious impulse, as some Anthropologists would tell us.  Why has the author scrubbed her book from religion at all?  Is she so antagonistic to religion that she will not abide it in her book, even when it seems quite apt?  If so, the bed of flowers tell us that the most primitive of religious impulses remain with her still.  Or is the author trying to appeal to everyone, thus removing religion from the surface of her story so as to not alienate people of different religion than the one she chose to portray, while at the same time infusing her work with religious themes at the substrate level, where they are more powerful?  Or is her point that the despotic Capitol destroyed all hope quite successfully, even the Hope of God?  Given the richness of the religious themes I see in this book/movie below the surface, I am very much inclined to believe that the last of these options is the correct one.  But I may be seeing what I want to see, simply because I like the story.

Now, turning to the more artistic features of the movie: The most impressive performance was done by the actor who played President Snow.  His facial expressions were insuperable and spoke tons in the few lines he delivered throughout the film.  His performance was astoundingly good, his face delivering contempt, skepticism, and hatred (sometimes all at once) along with the ""weight of office"" while speaking seemingly innocuous lines, or even while congratulating the winners (there were two winners from District 12, thanks to the cleverness of Katniss Everdeen in turning the television show against its organizers!) of the 74th Hunger Games.  He single-handedly set up the next movie installment.

But the casting of Peeta is all wrong.  From the book it is clear that Peeta is not handsome at all, that Peeta is the boring guy who never had a chance when it came to women, and who doesn't have a chance when it comes to Katniss Everdeen who clearly has feelings for another guy.  Which makes it all the more poignant that he is desperately in love with her, and is willing to give up his life for her.  In the movie he is played by a movie-star-handsome actor who clearly would have trouble keeping women away from him, and who would therefore be quite self-centered and clueless, rather than the thoughtful man he is in the book. || I had not really bothered to put this movie on my to-watch shelf since I felt it was not really my cup of tea but when my wife and oldest son wondered why we did not have it in our collection I thought, well, okay let us get it then. Actually I got the set with the two movies that have been released and yesterday we watched the first one.

Well, as far as I am concerned, it is not a turkey, it is rather ‚Äúokayish‚Äù but I certainly do not understand all the hype. It is really far from a great movie. But then, I am probably somewhat biased since, as I wrote above, I did not really think this movie was my cup of tea. Anyway, it starts of with a lot of scenes in ‚Äúwobblycam‚Äù. I have not met any person outside of the movie industry and self-proclaimed so-called ‚Äúcritics‚Äù that actually likes it when the camera wobbles around, scenes are blurred and you generally get nauseous by watching. Bad start!

The backbone of the story is ludicrous to say the least. Part of the world leaves in luxury when the rest is starving. Been there, seen that. Every year a seemingly random selection of kids, not adults but kids, are selected to fight to the death under some silly pretext of ‚Äúpreserving the peace‚Äù. As I said, ludicrous. The entire air of ludicrousness is enforced by the wacky costumes, makeup and hair styles of the people in the capitol. As I science fiction and fantasy fan I could easily live with this but, sadly, the movie made me only mildly interested in following the characters to the end.

The acting in general is adequate but nothing special. Having said that it must be difficult to actually make anything out of some of the silly roles in this movie. I for sure would laugh my head off every time I entered a scene with all of those ludicrous (yes I know I have used that word a lot in this review, live with it) costumes. The main characters act like the children, with absolutely no clue what they are doing, that they indeed are. This is of course entirely in line with the story but still, the main character is spending a lot of the time running away and sitting around looking startled, sorry or depressed when the games start. I have to say that, at times, the movie felt a bit boring. I have liked several movies that are very slow but here it simply did not sit right.

The games themselves with those dickheads in control and the changing rules, well they were mostly frustrating.

This movie, to me, is a movie for a young adult audience. I have not read the books and I can see how this kind of story would work for a YA book. Personally I was not unhappy having seen the movie and now, having watched the first of the movies I will watch the rest as well but for me it was okay as a two-hour diversion, nothing more."

Jeremy Renee‚Äôs Aaron Cross has a much more brutal combat style than Bourne, and excited to watch. The Bourne Legacy focuses more on the action and introduces the corrupt network that Cross must battle to bring down and survive.

I loved this new direction and these new characters and was disappointed that a sequel was canceled to return to Jason Bourne‚Äôs story rather than continuing with Aaron Cross.

The Dark Knight Rises may very well have been the weakest of all 3 films but when you're talking about a scale of this magnitude, it still makes this one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years.

I expected a little more _Batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of Bruce Wayne and Gotham City was good I didn't find it amazing. This might be in fact, one of my only criticisms‚Äîit was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story I felt was really being told. I feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.

The acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of Christopher Nolan's other films. Man does this guy know how to make a movie!

You don't have to be a Batman fan to enjoy these movies and I hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. These 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. They are damn near perfect. || I personally thought this film is on par if not better than the Dark Knight.

Whilst some think the film is too long for the story I didn't find this. The length of the film is longer than some (but doesn't feel it), I liked that the film took it's time rather than shoving more elements in it - I think this contributed to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed and calm before the final crescendo).

At the end of the day whether you like this film will boil down to if you like films Christopher Nolan has directed and/or you like the Christopher Nolan Batman series so far.

Stupendously good film in my opinion. || The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best movies to come out in 2012. The story compels you to watch it time and time again. It also has I of, I my opinion, the best bad guys in any movie, Bane! Batman was well played as all ways and the cast where well selected. I think this movie is the best batman to see the light of day or the darkest nights (pun intended)."

It‚Äôs maybe not the most famous of the bard‚Äôs works, nor for my money is it one of his most original. The story itself has shades of ‚ÄúJulius Caesar‚Äù too it as it depicts the rise and fall of the eponymous dictator (Fiennes). It all starts when the grain-deprived masses of the city take to the streets and their leader, who holds most of these plebs in utter contempt, finds himself unexpectedly deposed by the council - upon which sits his own mother (Vanessa Redgrave) - and shown the Appian Way. Disillusioned and furious, he enters into his own equivalent of a Faustian pact and swears allegiance to his bitterest enemy ‚ÄúAufidius‚Äù (the seriously over-challenged Gerard Butler).

This does look good, and the assembled cast are extremely competent at delivering some of the poignant and thoughtful dialogue contained in this political tragedy, but I felt that perhaps too much of the nuance had to be condensed out of this necessarily abridged story, and somehow the fact that it wasn‚Äôt stage-bound lessened the intensity of the characterisations. Though she looked entirely natural in her pseudo-Fascist uniform, I felt Redgrave lacked for emotion as she performed and Fiennes over-compensated for that with plenty of intensely photographed opportunities for his nostrils to flare and his Adam‚Äôs Apple to agitate.

Upon hearing of her ex-boyfriend's new born baby, she decides that they are still meant for each other, and the fact that he is now happily married to The Perfect Woman is but a minor detail on their road to eternal bliss. More simply put‚Ä¶ Mavis is bat s*** crazy.

Going into this movie, I thought it was going to be a hilarious comedy, full of LOL moments. Actually it is nothing of the sort. Thinking about it, seeing the way this ""adult"" woman lives out her life (sleeping till noon, living in a pigsty, forgetting to take care of her dog and playing children's video games), is really incredibly sad. No, it's pathetic. She is the author of 'young adult' books, which in any other case is a perfectly fine job, except in hers it basically means she vicariously lives the life of her main character ‚Äì a high school girl. This is the emotional level Mavis is stuck in.

Hearing about her ex-boyfriend's baby stirs an awkward obsession in Mavis. She packs her bags and returns to her small hometown in Minnesota ‚Äì completely convinced that she and her ex Buddy are destined to be together. Back home, it's obvious the people she left behind know her a little better than she knows herself. Basically, everybody knows her‚Ä¶ and everybody hates her. And who can blame them‚Ä¶ Mavis is quite simply the most childish, entitled, RIDICULOUSLY selfish woman there ever was. Thankfully there's at least one old acquaintance from her past who's willing to look beyond all that. His name is Matt, he walks with a crutch because he once was the victim of a horrible hate crime, and he is the only one who listens to her.

What I love about this story is the fact that, although it starts out as a comedy, it gradually flows and meanders into a beautifully crafted, delicate character drama. Mavis, at first sight, is a hysterical character, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that this woman has some deep seeded issues, no matter how hard she tries to cover up for it. Mavis is played wonderfully by Charlize Theron, who delivers one of her most hilarious, yet at the same time, understated performances to date. She could have easily gone overboard with this character, but somehow manages to humanize this completely unlikable woman. In fact, I'm willing to state that about 80% of Young Adult 'works' because of her. She displays some of her best work in two very intense scenes, where Mavis' sky high ego comes crashing down, leaving her remarkably exposed and vulnerable. That right there was some truly wonderful acting on her part.

Matt is played very amiably by Patton Oswalt, who seems to be the only character in town with any emotional intelligence. Although this character may be a bit of a clich√© (the wise, sympathetic loser with a physical disability and a traumatizing past), that's OK because it works. Oswalt's acting clearly takes a shot at versatility and he passed with flying colours, as far as I'm concerned.

I love the script. Penned by Diablo Cody (writer of Juno), it's full of sharp, sassy character traits and dialogue, while remaining very subtle and human. As a story, it doesn't honestly have that much to offer but it's a joy to watch for the high quality of 'human relatableness', I guess I could call it. Actually, I can't really think of any major flaws. It has an awesome soundtrack, all the actors are very well cast and the direction was placed perfectly in the very capable hands of Jason Reitman.

This is a small film, about basic, non-glamorous human behavior and a big girl who might find happiness yet, if only she wants it badly enough. Highly recommended.
_(January 2015)_ || The premiss is that Charlize Theron (""Mavis Gary"") is an erstwhile successful novelist, now divorced, borderline alcoholic and bored. She heads back to her home town in Minnesota to catch up with her parents - and, more importantly, to hook up with her now married ex-boyfriend, who now has a baby... When she arrives, she initially meets up with the guy whom everyone thought was gay at school, and was (very) badly beaten up, who warns her off her intended - ""Buddy Slade"" (good looking, but wooden as a skateboard Patrick Wilson). To be honest, I found this quite a hard watch - Theron is so convincingly odious as to make me want to throttle her. Add to that the nauseatingly forgiving nature of the townsfolk whose lives she would willingly have wrecked and it made me even more annoyed! Not sure who this is actually for, this film, but it certainly wasn't for me... A thing of shallowness."

That all said, and though the villain here is certainly no Phillip Seymour-Hoffman of _M:I:III_, I still felt this was the strongest entry of the franchise so far. They even finally figured out that women can be used for more than just a damsel-in-distress, throwaway-set-piece or eye-candy. They haven't moved terribly far past that point, but at least they're changing it up a little. This fourth entry also adds a little levity, something a series that has always been a little dumb, is well served by.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn‚Äôt quite work as a whole._ || This is almost as good as the first outing - almost 20 years ago - for ""Ethan"" (Tom Cruise) and he finds himself on the wrong end of an evaluation from the US Government - led by ""Hunley"" (Alec Baldwin) that wants to dissolve the IMF. He and ""Luther"" (VIng Rhames), meantime, are on the trail of the ""Syndicate"" - a criminal organisation that poses a real threat to the peace and security of the nation and to his organisation. Co-opting ""Benji"" (Simon Pegg) and ""Brandt"" (Jeremy Renner) they soon come across the enigmatic ""Ilsa"" (Rebecca Ferguson) who wants to help out, but why? What now ensues is a tautly directed thriller with plenty of action that takes us all around Morocco and Europe before quite a gripping conclusion to the intrigue leaves everyone unsure who they can trust. Christopher McQuarrie seems to have decided to go back to the television series for reference here, the teamwork (even from the usually terrible Pegg) and the plot develop more plausibly and excitingly; it has a grittier and more substantial story to it, and even if Cruise looks a little unkempt from time to time, that narrative is just better - it actually is a thriller rather than just another piece of star-led boisterous entertainment. Like most films that depict the principle of US Senate oversight, it continues to poke fun at the (in)competencies of that body to even make a proper cup of coffee; there is some humour in the dialogue and it's put the franchise very much back on track. || **Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol takes an already great formula and upgrades it with bigger stunts, more character development, and an expanded universe.**

Ghost Protocol tops the list of best Mission Impossible movies and sits near the top of best spy films. Ghost Protocol ratchets up the action, the stunts, the comedy, and the allure while still delivering a compelling and entertaining story in ways the franchise hadn‚Äôt mastered before. The world of the IMF expands beyond its star agent Ethan Hunt by showing agents on other missions and giving Hunt‚Äôs team backstories and development. Brad Bird‚Äôs Pixar charm rubs off on the film with fun, quirky moments punctuating the incredible action set pieces and providing a little breathing room in the intense face-paced plot. The quality of new characters and the pedigree of the actors playing them seems to prepare the franchise for spin-offs or even a changing of the guard (if Tom Cruise ever wanted to pass the movies on to a new lead). Ghost Protocol sets a new bar for the Mission Impossible series that causes its successors to thrive as they reach for its level of excellence. If you didn‚Äôt want to watch all 6 (and soon to be 8), Ghost Protocol wouldn‚Äôt be a bad place to start."

This film came five years ago, but I watched it now. A US-Russian collaboration product that's entirely takes place in Moscow. This is an alien invasion theme, but slightly different than those similar films. It never gives the reason, just the destructions like apocalypse on its way. That means it is about the survival. A group of Americans who are in the Moscow for different reasons joins the hands after people started to turn into ashes with the contact of the strange electric mist that came from the sky. So what's their plan now and whether they get out of it safely or not focused on the remaining film.

Surely some people would enjoy it. It's not all bad if you are not expecting a masterpiece. I should have seen it in digital 3D for a better experience, even the normal watch is not that bad. The turns in the story were unpredictable, particularly the film characters, but the twist wasn't. They kept the open ending, and you know why is that. I liked the performances, not individually, but the overall everyone, including the Russians.

The film was also shorter, which means fast moving tale. The graphics were okay, especially those electric mist thing, but disappointed for not show the aliens other than for fractions of seconds during the fightbacks. Despite enjoyed watching it, I'm not in favour of it, because it's just one of those films that falls in the average category where the majority of those who watched it not happy for not detailing everything in the film.

_4/10_ || **Good CGI, good action scenes, good sound, Moscow is an interesting place, but everything else is so weak and stupid that it's not worth watching this movie twice.**

I decided to watch this film yesterday, when it was shown on TV, but curiously I was waiting to see another film with a similar title made in 2017. Even so, I didn't give up my time: even though I didn't have much predilection for alien invasion films, the film is quite dynamic, has good action scenes and a good amount of high quality CGI, and so it is, at least, a piece of entertainment that we don't regret watching... once. Just once.

Let's start with the good stuff: the scenes take place in Moscow, the Russian megalopolis, long before we ostracized the country due to aggression against neighboring Ukraine, when Russians seemed to want to have more contact with Westerners. This was a real breath of fresh air because in sci-fi films we almost only see US cities. I also believe that filming in Russia was a strategic option for the production to be able to film at lower costs. In addition to the clever use of the filming locations (which include Red Square and the GUM Shopping Center), the film offers us a massive dose of high-quality CGI, which we see in greater glory when the aliens appear. But the whole film is a feast of CGI and visual effects. The sound effects are also very good, and the action and running scenes are fun enough to keep the film moving.

And unfortunately, good things end here. Everything else is so full of flaws and problems that make the film unworthy of a second chance. This is just my opinion, but I think we can all agree on one point: there are a lot of films about alien invasions, and it doesn't take much thinking to remember two or three that make this film a total joke.

The film is directed by Chris Gorak, but it seems like he was more fascinated with CGI and action than trying to direct. Thus, we have a very young cast who are left to their own devices and who interpret the characters according to what seems most appropriate to them. Emile Hirsch did an excellent work in ‚ÄúInto the Wild‚Äù just before this, but he had a solid character and was well directed. Here, he has none: the result is a tepid, vague, lifeless interpretation without any personality. His partner Max Minghella, who had just done ‚ÄúThe Social Network‚Äù, was not a good choice for his character. He is one of those actors who is ‚Äúalways the bridesmaid and never the bride‚Äù, so to speak: his lack of presence and charisma put him far from the main roles, although he is an option for supporting cast. Joel Kinnaman is stupidly weak as the villain: he behaves like a high school bully, and his character is as thin as paper. Olivia Thirlby also does little for the film, with a character who merely looks sexy, and who we expect to see kissing one of the boys at some point. Worse luck was Rachael Taylor, who is irritating to the point that we say hallelujah when her character finally dies. And the Russian cast? I don't know any of the actors, but I even liked Veronika Vernadskaya a little. Unfortunately, the Russian cast seems to be there only for us to see the Russians as perpetual badasses, a ""Rambo nation"" on horseback with machine guns. Putin certainly enjoyed seeing this in a Western film.

As bad as the cast and their performance, the script copies moments and elements from several sci-fi films (‚ÄúCloverfield‚Äù, for example) to create a story where there is no logical sense or real threat. It's truly unfortunate that, with such good CGI and such well-chosen filming locations, the film is unable to cause a single shiver of tension in the audience. In addition to a rather weak story, there are several moments in which the film seems to be mocking our intelligence: Moscow is one of the most densely populated places in the world: it makes sense that, even after the city is devastated in the first attack, there are only five or six people wandering the streets? Seeing a commercial plane crashed in a shopping center is sensational, but where did its wings end up? And why is there no fire, debris or explosions resulting from the collision? The film ends with a nuclear submarine setting sail from the Moscow River. However, you don't need to be a Muscovite or even a Russian to see that this watercourse doesn't have the depth or width to maneuver such a big thing! To think that the public will believe this things is insulting."

I was cracking up. Especially when they are on the island. That's when it's the funniest. || The usually worst-rated movie of the franchise...and my personal favorite.

The movie starts off with a cruise trip that allows for several gags and silly ideas and then, once things start to go south, changes to a family-friendly island survival adventure.

And I have to say, I love it!

First off, the Chipmunks and the Chipettes, introduced in the previous movie, are a really well-fitting team.

While the boys represent their usual personalities and quirks at first, the Chipettes get the time to actually develop more of the personalities you might know from the cartoons:
Brittany as the little ""star"" that values her look and plans, Jeanette as the timid and smart but also most-adult one and Eleanor as the emotional one.

These things develop quite well and each of the Chipettes is a great counterpart to the corresponding boy, and it's really nice to have all six of them:

Alvin's and Brittany's arguing, Simon's and Jeanette's shy and cute behavior while trying to guide their siblings, and Theodor and Eleanor as the emotional siblings, with Eleanor doing well to be the emotional part that Theodor was in the second movie.

And then, once the survival aspect comes into play, especially Alvin and Simon both get a big chance for character development, learning more about themselves, and in the end taking some of the learned things with them.

All the while it contains adventure elements, treasure hunts and lots of cuteness and dancing.

Like with the movies before, many moments where characters can learn about themselves, responsibility, family and love.

Some cute little surprises, well-animated dances and lovely character interaction.

And contrary to the second movie, even the human actors have more important roles again that don't feel totally out of place.

I really enjoyed it!
Also, I ship Simon and Jeanette, they're lovely! <3"

Streep does well mimicking the style and voice of the politician, but the back and forth style of the film's timelines robs it of much of it's potency. It is hard to be critical of the woman or her style when she is largely portrayed via the image of the shell that she had become towards the end of her life. You cannot help but feel a degree of pity for her and I suspect everyone watching - and her too - would not have wanted that. The condensed nature of the narrative does little justice to her career - it's controversial highs and lows; position on the global stage, even her downfall is rushed - and the depiction of her life here leaves us with little of substance with which to judge this most polarising of women.

It‚Äôs perhaps not the worst movie I‚Äôve seen but it is in no way worth that kind of rating.

The good part of the movie is Liam Neeson who makes an enjoyable performance with the script that he was given. He is pretty much the reason that I gave it as much as 4 IMDb stars. The rest of the film is just plain wrong.

My first impression is, god this director likes film grain! Now this is a matter of taste of course but I don‚Äôt like when movies have artificially been made to look like they were filmed on old and crappy film. It has its places but it didn‚Äôt add anything here.

The film starts off with a plane crash which is not done very good. Neither in terms of special effects nor in terms of realism.

The lack of realism, unfortunately, continues throughout the movie. The behavior of the wolves is utterly unnatural and unrealistic. I can live with this if it‚Äôs a horror movie or some other fantasy movie but this is not supposed to be that. The actual footage of the wolves is rather mediocre as well.

Then there is this so called experienced hunter and ‚Äúwolf expert‚Äù. Leaving the crash site is a dubious decision to say the least. Then we got the jumping of cliffs with a flimsy home made rope instead of just walking a bit further to get down not to mention making ammunition go off by poking wooden sticks at it, what the f‚Ä¶? In addition the guy knows nothing about wolves, or any other wild animal for that matter.

Just to add to this not so enjoyable experience, the film has an utterly lousy ending. || I can't believe it took me so long to get around to watching _The Grey_.

What a ride. Don't know that it's realistic but damn it was good. Put me in that wolf pack. Would I be instantly dismembered? Sure, but you get that on the big jobs.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._ || **_Go out fighting (and believing)_**

Liam Neeson stars as the quasi-leader of seven misfit Alaskan oil workers who survive a plane crash in the wilderness. As if this isn't bad enough, a pack of territorial wolves want to take them out. Will they survive? 

Released in January 2012, ""The Grey"" is a somber survival flick filled with primal reflections on death and faith. The trailer is misleading in that it advertises the movie as an action film, but that's not the case at all. Although there is some action, this is a grave, dreary adventure with raw meditations about the will to live or die and more -- God.

It's not as good as 1997's ""The Edge,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix"" or ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" the latter two from 1965, mainly because it's so funereal and seemingly empty, but it's unique and worthwhile.

Some complain that the story's unbelievable, like the wolves and the jump from the cliff, but movies (or certain things in them) aren't always meant to be taken literally and aren't supposed to be realistic as filmmakers are more concerned with aesthetics, psychology, metaphors and conveying ideas; and that's the case with ""The Grey."" The survival story is merely a stage.

Which brings us to another common complaint, that the film's ultimately pointless, which simply isn't the case. Now you may not like the story or the points that it conveys, but it's not pointless. See my interpretation below, if interested.

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in Smithers, British Columbia.

GRADE: B 

**MY INTERPRETATION** (Read only if you've seen the film)**:** 

Ottway (Neeson) is in a horrible state of grief after the passing of his beloved wife as he protects oil workers by shooting wolves that get too close to the camp. Depressed, he decides to commit suicide but before he can pull the trigger a wolf howling in the distance strangely prevents him. I believe the howling wolf was the Creator's way of speaking to Ottway and giving him a chance to go out fighting; and not just that, go out _believing_ as well, even if it's belief in its rawest form.

The next day Ottway finds himself surviving a plane crash in the wilderness with six other men. In contrast to his near-suicide attempt, his survival instincts kick-in and he finds himself doing everything he can to survive, for himself and the others. Do you see the irony? The night before he desperately wanted to die and a mere day later he's doing everything in his power to live and save others.

The topic of God and faith comes up at a campfire. A couple of the guys believe, but Diaz naturally mocks such things. Ottway says he doesn't believe either, but wishes he could.

Later in the story, Ottway finds himself the sole survivor and at the end of his rope. Cursing, he passionately cries out to the Almighty for succor, but the heavens remain mysteriously silent. Regardless, he musters the strength to (try to) carry on. Shortly later, while reflecting on the men and their loved ones who died, he seems to clasp his hands in prayer and the Alpha wolf appears and challenges him. Unlike a few days ago when he was going to kill himself, he goes out fighting and, even more important, believing.

For those who argue that Ottway didn't believe, remember that he was praying when he was crying out to God. Yes, it was a prayer of desperation and rage, but prayer nevertheless. Job did the same thing in the bible. The utterly humbling situation drove Ottway to his Creator and compelled him to go out fighting. It was God's gift. The Almighty knew Ottway better than Ottway knew himself."

The plot is a very standard and unoriginal one about agent getting double-crossed and subsequently deals out some pay-back. I have no problem with that. It is a valid setting for some nice action. The problem lies in the implementation.

The acting is never anything to write home about. You get the feeling all the characters are just reading of the script in order to get the scenes done and over with. As a consequence you never really get any attachment to neither the heroine nor the bad guys. Most of the movie I just sat and waited for the next action scene to begin.

I really enjoyed this film, which is a powerful and poignant drama set in the years after the Bosnian War. Under the cover of peacekeeping operations in this country, marked by ethnic tensions and the scars of a fratricidal war, an American police force ends up discovering the involvement of military and UN employees in a vast scheme of trafficking in women for sexual exploitation. She exposes what's going on, but she has no way of knowing anyone's true loyalties, and most of the big culprits are safe behind powerful diplomatic immunities sanctioned by New York.

I don't know, as well as I would like, the real facts behind the action of the film. What I do know is that the real Kathryn Bolkovac sued the firm she worked for being wrongly dismissed, and won after denouncing the criminal wrongdoing she encountered. But regardless of that, it is a good film and entertains its audience very well, with a touching and engaging story, which Larysa Kondracki knew how to use well.

Rachel Weisz gives us a very strong and intense performance, her dramatic work being a key point in making the film work. The film also features quality work from David Strathairn and veterans Vanessa Redgrave and Monica Bellucci.

74998.0,Seeking Justice,"After his wife is assaulted, a husband enlists the services of a vigilante group to help him settle the score.",Vengeance always has a price,"Action, Drama, Thriller",105.0,2011-09-02,en,5.915,1022.0,1.4828,"Nicolas Cage, January Jones, Guy Pearce, Harold Perrineau, Jennifer Carpenter",Roger Donaldson,"assassin, fugitive, playing chess","It's not what a lawyer tells me I must do, but it's what humanity, reason, and justice tell me I ought to do.

After his wife (January Jones) is brutally raped, New Orleans teacher Will Gerard (Nic Cage) gets involved with a shadowy vigilante group run by a man called Simon (Guy Pearce). A favour for a favour to get justice seems viable, but all is not as it seems...

To be frank it's just another in a long line of vigilante thrillers that get trundled out every other year. Rarely does one, certainly in the more modern era of film making, have something viable to say, to challenge the thought process of the viewers. Justice (AKA: Seeking Justice) starts off very promising, grabbing the attention whilst having an atmospheric texture about it. Sadly come the mid-point things just get daft (yet Cage stays ultra serious throughout) and in spite of the makers trying to add in some twisty thriller conventions, all the potential (and promise) for thought provoking depth has long since gone.

That said, as an intrigue based drama it's a decent enough watch, with director Roger Donaldson (No Way Out/Thirteen Days) adept in the staging of suspenseful sequences. Yet the lack of kinetic action is sorely felt, the over all feeling being one that Donaldson and crew were not quite sure which way to take the picture. Should we keep things shadowy and suggestive? Or should we have live wire chases and dastardly peril? Justice only winds up as an uneven blend of ideas. While wasting Xander Berkeley and the New Orleans locations is a crime in itself.

Not bad exactly, above average in fact, but just forgettable and another wasted opportunity to add meat to a hot topic in film form. 6/10"

I felt it was surprisingly mediocre and very ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù.

The good parts are the flight scenes and the special effects. They are enjoyable to watch and reasonably well done. However, that is pretty much what makes up this movie in terms of enjoyment.

I would say that a lot of it is not very realistic. The German anti-aircraft guns seems to be next to useless most of the time for instance. Also, there is the scene where a single P51, armed with nothing but machine guns, takes out an armed German warship in two quick runs. That felt quite unrealistic.

A lot of the film also felt too much like some Hollywood drama. Some of the pilots behave like morons and in real life they would have been shot down rather quickly. The alcohol problems and the romance seems to have been thrown in just to appeal to the American soap-opera viewers. The entire movie is very shallow and if it was not for the budget and special effects it could very well have been a TV-movie.

Most of this movie I was yawning in my seat and waking up only when the flight action started so that I could watch the special effects. || Yeah, I came into this long after seeing HBO's Tuskegee Airmen, which kind of stared everyone on earth and was brilliantly acted and had a great and compelling plot.

So this is kind of a bias review.

Compared to the HBO original movie, Red Tails has better special effects but that's about all. The story is worse, the plot is worse, the acting is worse. The history is worse, and I like to give movies a wide breath for artistic liberty.

It tells a love story instead of a Tuskegee Airmen story. It replaces drama with fx.

Walk away and dig up the HBO movie from the 90s."

Andrew has problems at home; his mother is dying of cancer, the cost of her medication has become prohibitive, and his dad is an abusive drunk. Andrew brings with him the bulky old video camera he's been using of late to document... I dunno, the misery of his life I suppose. Anyway, once at the party Matt, mildly embarrassed by his cousin following him around with a camera, peels off away from Andrew to hang with some of the cooler kids, including the impossibly popular but genuinely decent Steve (Michael B. Jordan, The Wire, Friday Night Lights). The camera causes further problems for Andrew and he's unceremoniously ejected from the party. He's found outside by the aforementioned Steve, and invited to come with him and Matt to check out a weird hole in the ground in the woods nearby (elements of the party had spilled outside into the darkness, as these things do from time to time). Andrew, Matt and Steve venture down this hole, which turns out to be more of a tunnel, leading to... what is that? A space rock of some sort? Something mineral, and glowing, and a bit scary. Upon exiting the hole, the trio find that they possess mild levels of telekinesis, the ability to move objects with their minds. They also find that with practice, they can strengthen that ability. They soon graduate from levitating Lego bricks to flying through the air. Andrew proves to be particularly adept with this new ""talent"", and that proves to be problematic, because where Matt and Steve are content to limit their telekinetic use to mild pranks and perhaps flying somewhere interesting on holiday, Andrew's home life, general isolation and subsequent mood swings as a result of each cause him to want to embrace his power - and for him, it's grown into a potentially deadly power, now - in altogether different ways indeed.

With Chronicle, writer Max Landis (son of John ""An American Werewolf in London"" Landis) and director Josh Trank have taken some fairly tired areas (cin√©ma v√©rit√©, superhero origin tales) and made something decent and fresh with them, for comparatively little money (budget was $12m apparently, looks like five times that). It's not a perfect film - the first-person narrative's need to justify its camera angles leads to one or two bum notes despite the fairly ingenious device of having Andrew telekinetically ""float"" the camera around behind him; some of Andrew's worst rages during the second act - including one with devastating consequences - seem badly disproportionate to the infraction, disconnecting us from the character (though perhaps that's the idea); and the abusive father (Michael Kelly, Dawn of the Dead, Did You Hear About the Morgans?) seems unrealistically so. But these are things I thought about after having seen the movie. The movie's tone and pace, and the performances of the three newly-empowered young men particularly, carry the movie very well right to the brisk 78th minute end (minus the credits).

Recommended. || Why this movie seem to get a lot of 7 and above ratings is beyond me. It‚Äôs certainly not my cup of tea. The three high school friends are behaving annoyingly stupid, reckless and irresponsibly. Only one of them is showing any sign of intelligence. One of them is just silly and the other one is a nutcase. Of course the film actually revolves around the nutcase.

It starts of kind of okay with the three friends finding this glowing alien thing which gives them superpowers and there are some mildly funny scenes when they experiment with them. After that it spirals out of control when the nutcase goes more and more insane.

I can live with the drama and bizarre behaviours if the movie would have had some other redeeming factors such as imagery or acting but none of it is present here. Rather the inverse since the film shot in this wobbling-about handycam/documentary style which I really do not like.

I‚Äôm afraid that I found this movie not very entertaining. || Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

I am partial to found footage style of shooting, so I understand if that's not for you.

Dane DeHaan does a lot of the heavy lifting in this movie, but Michael B. Jordan is right behind him, alongside Alex Russell.  It is almost literally just these 3 guys filming each other as they gain, experiment, and grow their supernatural abilities.  There are some supporting cast, but they're more there as plot devices, and another camera angle.  Found footage is not easy to do, which is why everyone complains about it.

This is a very natural feeling movie with some dark aspects too it.  I really think you can feel when the mood changes in this movie.  It also brings up some great points on the ""reality"" of if people gained super powers.

While most people would claim to be Captain America, the reality is that people tend to do whatever they can get away with, so creating a checks and balances with one's co-supernaturals makes sense, but the reality is enforcing that turns it into super ""hero"" versus super ""villain"".

Surprisingly, this movie reminds a little bit of ""Hancock"", but probably not quite as good, mostly just different.

If you like dark, edgy super power stuff or found footage, give it a go."

Great casting choices, great subject matter, and plenty of production value.

When it comes down to it, I'm sure this is the movie that settled Dwayne Johnson as the guy for Jumanji.

Josh Hutcherson and Vanessa Hudgens are really cute together and play off of each other really well.  Michael Caine and Luis Guzm√°n both act really well with their character kids as well as Dwayne.

The biggest actual problem I have with this is the insistence in 3d technology.  It is really blatant and really weird sometimes.

The iconic action scenes in this are amazing, and were probably not cost efficient at all:  a giant lizard, bird or fish animated like this looks so good, but lasts for 5 minutes (?) and costs ridiculous amounts of money to get quality as good as this movie does.

But it's the ""no expense spared"" attitude that really makes this a good movie watching experience.  Yes, the writing is solid, and I love the idea of visiting the Mysterious Island, but the quality is what puts it over the top.

Well worth the watch, but its the experience more than anything I can verbally express right now. || <em>'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'</em> improves upon <em>'Journey to the Center of the Earth'</em>.

This is good fun. It's a shame that Brendan Fraser and Anita Briem were unable to reprise their respective roles, though the additions of Dwayne Johnson, Michael Caine, Luis Guzm√°n and Vanessa Hudgens are all positives. Johnson has a few silly moments (berry pecs + ""What a Wonderful World""), but all in all is fairly solid.

The special effects, though still not as great as they should probably be, are upgraded, the score is also better. The plot is the main improvement, this location is more interesting than that of the last movie; admittedly the lame effects for the latter are quite the hindrance.

Seems as if a third film from this series isn't completely dead in the water, despite the now twelve year gap. It's pretty surprising that it has yet to happen given the financial success of this and the 2008 flick - studios turning down money, that's a rarity!"

Idris Elba was probably the only reason why i went to watch this but even then his role was thin and futile, On the whole, it's messy , funny and plain bad, i pray to god there is not a third one || Christ what kind of bum did they get to write and/or produce this one.

I really, really liked the first Ghost Rider movie. This one is nowhere near that one. Sure, Nicolas Cage is doing Johnny Blaze again and they even got Christopher Lambert to play an old priest but the movie is just poorly implemented. The Ghost Rider is actually not really appearing that much and when he does, the special effects look cheap and not at all as cool as in the first movie.

It doesn‚Äôt help that, when he first appears in the movie, he gets shot down by a simple ‚Äúhuman‚Äù gun and ends up in hospital. This nonsense about, first trying to hide out in some obscure place a ‚Äôla The Hulk (been there done that), and then trying to get rid of his powers and afterwards taking on Satan without them is just ruining the fun. The film totally lacks the spirit of the first one.

As I said, I‚Äôm rather disappointed. It‚Äôs really a shame that they screwed this one so badly because now we probably won‚Äôt get another one even though they made a lame attempt at the end of the film to leave a door open for that. || _**Wild sequel**_

The first Ghost Rider film from 2007 was fairly faithful to the comic. When Ghost Rider came out in 1972 it was more of a general idea than a fully fleshed-out premise. This was clear as the stories changed from writer to writer and one artist to another. Ideas were added as the years progressed, like the ""penance stare"" and Blaze's growing awareness of the former angel of justice, Zarathos. The book was canceled in 1983 after a ten-year run. In 1990 a new version of Ghost Rider was introduced with a different character and it ran eight years.

The first film was an amalgam of the ideas presented in these two series, mostly the first, and struck me as the comic-book come to life. Really, the only thing that was disappointing was the villain, Blackheart, who was seriously scary in the comics, but not so much in the movie.

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" (2012) is a worthy follow-up with Nicolas Cage returning as Johnny Blaze. The story switches to Europe and, more specifically, Romania and Turkey, where the film was shot.

This time the devil is played by Ciar√°n Hinds, rather than Peter Fonda, which isn't a big deal considering Satan could presumably take different physical forms. The devil's main minion is played by Johnny Whitworth, a different character than Blackheart from the original, albeit similar. The hot female is Violante Placido, who's arguably an improvement over Eva Mendes. Another positive is the rockin' soundtrack.

I don't mind the story switching to eastern Europe since the locations are excellent, particularly the amazing cave-monastery, but there are other changes that I'm not so crazy about, like the charred biker jacket of the Ghost Rider, but this is just a matter of taste; I simply prefer the cool biker ""costume"" as opposed to the dirtbag biker look. A more significant negative is the overactive camera that's annoying and draws attention to itself (hopefully this fad has run its course). But there are enough dramatic parts to balance out the quick-edited thrills; besides, you get used to it

BOTTOM LINE: ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" is a quality sequel that interestingly fleshes out the nature of the spirit that possesses Johnny blaze (I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it). People who claim the film's more ""serious"" and ""faithful"" to the comic are off the mark. It has the same quasi-serious, cartoony-horror vibe as the first film, with glimpses of humor. As radical as the first movie was (in a comic booky way), this one ups the ante and is the better for it. Unfortunately it's marred by the hyperactive camera and quick editing.

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes.

An Aboriginal with a half a face actually kills someone with a boomerang (there you go Luke, apparently it is possible!), so points. There's lots of fire, but no explosions, so points. The executive producer is Greg McLean (the kid behind _Wolf Creek_ and _Rogue_) so points. Plus, it's entertaining!

And I mean come on, Steve Bisley's in the damn thing! (the guy who played Goose in _Mad Max_). Ryan Kwanten (_The Knights of Badassdo, True Blood_) and Tom E. Lewis (_The Proposition_) make their presence known as the protagonist and antagonist respectively.

It's a little crazy, some sort of... Horror/Crime/Thriller/Western hybrid with a couple of comedic moments. Not that it's a comedy, or cheesy, just a bit funny once or twice... Like! There's this one bit where... Nah, better not ruin it. It's good though!

The score's great, one of the better I've heard lately. Though some of the more extreme Western elements bothered me (like quick-draws, horseback cops and white cowboy hats, etc.) I was more than willing to forgive these, after all, we as Australians are not yet in a position in the film industry where we can afford not to pander to the Yanks.

First time Director Patrick Hughes certainly is somebody I'll be looking out for in the future, if this first effort is anything to go by. _Red Hill_ is imaginative, clever, bold, no-nonsense and entirely watchable film that I'm more than happy to have in my collection. I wasn't blown away, it was no fresh new thing I'd never see coming, but Bisley's screen presence and the general non-stop awesomeness makes _Red Hill_ it one of the better productions we Australians have unleashed onto the world.

Sarcastic Spoilers Within Review.

Off the bat lets say it, Gone is not a very bad movie, it has the requisite mystery elements, Amanda Seyfried makes for an engaging lead as the once kidnapped girl who nobody seems to believe, the cinematography (Michael Grady) is high quality and there's some decent moments of chills along the way. Unfortunately the film just exists as a case of unadventurous screenplay writing.

Gone is written by Allison Burnett, who writes it like some homework assignment set by a bored lecturer at a film studies class. Everything about it is rank and file what you have seen a million times before in this type of genre offering. A bunch of characters file in for cameos under the guise of red herrings, while our spunky heroine single handedly out-foxes the whole of the Portland police force, while naturally evading capture at every juncture.

Everyone but Seyfried's character are just on the periphery of things, where the likes of Wes Bentley and Jennifer Carpenter stand around hoping for the script to give them something worthwhile to do. In fact Carpenter's character is a set up for a late plot development, only for it to be the last we see of her, which is just bizarre in hindsight. Then the ""big"" finale arrives and the serial killer/kidnapper arrives and gets afforded the same ""none"" time as everyone else.

Nothing remotely original here, sadly. It serves decent enough as a time filler, but once the hopelessly weak finale plays its hand, you may come away asking yourself this question, why do films like this continually get green lit by studios when they have nothing more to offer other than putting another title on a budding actor's CV? 5/10 || **Overall : Could it have been better? Sure. Was it awful? No.**

If you checked out the reviews for this movie elsewhere, you read that it is an absolute piece of garbage. And that just isn't true. It's a run-of-the-mill thriller with a very good performance by Amanda Seyfried as the main character that ends a little differently than expected. I enjoyed guessing who the killer was as the movie offered multiple red herrings to throw you off. Not one that I would say rush out to watch, but if you got a random need to watch a decent b-movie thriller, then maybe check this one out?"

This _Lorax _is almost all filler. The message is still there, but it's lost under a tidal wave of meh.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal._ || The Lorax thneedn‚Äôt have shoved its colourful environmentalist message so brutally. Well, the live-action ‚ÄòCat in the Hat‚Äô adaptation was a *cough* massive success *cough* so it was only a matter of years before another Dr Seuss family-friendly book would have its zany vivid world transferred onto the medium of film. Then comes the introductory title screen. A despicable minion pops up next to the bold cancerous studio name ‚ÄúIllumination‚Äù, and instantly all hope was diminished.

Aside from their initial franchise, they seem to be unable to create animated flicks without treating the audience like simplistic Neanderthals, and The Lorax takes the biscuit. Patience was running thin just from the introductory musical number alone. A young boy journeys outside the walled plastic city of Thneedville to find a living tree so that he can impress a girl, but soon relives a tale that would change his way of life.

This is a mess. Perhaps unadaptable due to Seuss‚Äô imaginative wordplay that inspiringly illustrates a creative warning against corporate greed and destructive deforestation. Illumination on the other hand, whilst consistently producing colourful and vibrant animations, shoved the morality down the throats of its audience. Within two minutes, the civilians are singing about their perfect plastic bubble and capitalistic functionality. The main character, not the titular creature, has yet to be seen. A Kim Jong-Un lookalike imprisoning his people in a miniature North Korean world fuelled by propaganda. Taylor Swift refusing to sing any of the forgettable songs. And an underdeveloped insight into consumerism by showing one advertisement for canned air.

Then the narrative shifts to flashback mode when ‚ÄúThe Once-ler‚Äù retells his past mistakes. That being the termination of candy floss trees to manufacture his new invention. High-pitched carps, who clearly watched ‚ÄòAlvin and the Chipmunks‚Äô, irritate with forced pop culture humour. Cuddly cubs scratching their hairy walnuts on display and devouring slabs of butter. Finally, the spirit of the trees gracefully descends from the clouds by awkwardly hoisting his orange derri√®re in your face. The Lorax.

Danny ‚ÄúRule Number 95 Kid, Concentrate!‚Äù DeVito. A legend if I‚Äôm being honest, but terribly mismatched with the moustached beast. In fact, all of the voice acting was generic and forgettable, never truly matching the wide mouths of its unmemorable characters. The, what is essentially two narrative strands, inadvertently produced an underdeveloped arc that had sole intentions on pushing its well-intentioned morals instead of genuine character development and emotionality.

Illumination aren‚Äôt known for their subtle storytelling, and it‚Äôs evident in this adaptation. Aside from ‚ÄòHop‚Äô (which we shan‚Äôt talk about ever again...), this is by far their weakest mess. Understandably I‚Äôm not the target demographic, but children will only be hypnotised by the entrancing colours. I guarantee they shan‚Äôt remember it after a few days. What a thneed-fest! || Good watch, will probably watch again, and can recommend.

Despite the ""Despicable Me"" / ""Minions"" franchise, Illumination seems to do good work, and they really brought the zaney world of Dr. Seuss to life here, regardless of how much sense it may or may not make at the time.

It's been a while since I read ""The Lorax"", but I'm pretty sure the motivation to plant a tree wasn't to get a girl.  For all I remember the Onceler's story was the original storybook with a couple of catchy musical numbers thrown in.

That aside, there is a lot of fun in this movie with a (ultimately) positive message about environmental conservation, thought it's not as strong as it would like to be, but as palatable as necessary.  While I won't bored you with the details necessary to convey my view on environmental education, there is an odd bit to the ""conducting business"" scene series where there almost seems to be a subtle message for capitalistic business during the moments we're being told this is bad, or maybe that was the point: there is a struggle and balance necessary.  I just thought it was funny.  At least the put message out there for us not to underestimate the elderly.

The world / character creation is very well done, and I'm humming one of the songs as I write this, but there is one problem I have with the writing: that the Onceler breaks the story up across multiple days.  Once he has his audience  (oh, play with in a play: a Shakespearean device), and the movie has its audience, just tell your story through.  I'm not a fan of break up a story into multiple stories if it's not necessary (if you've ever binged a tv show, you know what I'm talking about).  At least he didn't flip it all around and tell it out of order (see ""Pulp Fiction"").

While the Lorax itself is an underwhelming, if subtle, character itself, I can imagine most people will enjoy it."

If you're a fan of the John Carter novels then you will probably get some enjoyment from John Carter.  While there are some differences you'll meet some familiar characters and recognize quite a few relevant plot points.

Not a great film, but not a bad one, either. || We sat down and watched this movie on Blu-ray yesterday evening to nicely end our little excursion day. This is a good film but it could have been (much) better.

The film itself and its special effects are quite good. I would say that the special effects are very good. The airships are very cool looking. The design nicely captures the retro atmosphere of the book without looking silly. I think they made the green men too slim though. I have always pictured them as way more bulky and monstrous. I like Woola‚Äôs appearance although him moving around at ‚Äúsupersonic‚Äù speeds is a bit over the top.

However, why is it that every film-company/producer/director/whatever now thinks that he can take an old classic, slam on the name in the title, and then do what the hell he likes with the material? This film has borrowed the basic idea and the names from Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter book but almost nothing else. At most 10% of the story of the books is in the movie. The rest is pure invention and it does not improve the story. As a matter of fact it turns what was a good story into a standard unintelligent Hollywood faire. Been there, seen that, done that.

The examples are plentiful, the white apes the size of dinosaurs, the city of Zodanga moves around (what the f‚Ä¶), most of the plot as I said before is invented, the Therns have a completely different role etc. etc.

I especially dislike how they have made John Carter, the honorable gentleman from Virginia, into a fairly plain American guy who at first refuses to do the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing. And what about these bloody wife and child flashbacks? That‚Äôs just disturbing.

None of this improves the movie. It got 6 stars, it could have gotten 9 or 10 if it had followed the books properly. It is Disney‚Äôs own fault that this movie was a disappointment at the box office, they screwed with classical material‚Ä¶again."

Doug Smith was an ice hockey enforcer who played over 60 games for seven teams over the course of his career. In June 2002 he wrote a book entitled _Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey_. That book was the basis for the 2012 movie _Goon_ starring Seann William Scott. I've not read the book, but have known about the movie for quite a while, but never got around to watching it.

Here's the official description to give you an idea about what the movie focuses on:

_Doug Glatt, a slacker who discovers he has a talent for brawling is approached by a minor league hockey coach and invited to join the team as the ""muscle."" Despite the fact that Glatt can't skate, his best friend, Pat, convinces him to give it a shot, and Glatt becomes a hero to the team and their fans, until the league's reigning goon becomes threatened by Glatt's success and decides to even the score._

While this is marketed as a comedy, its really not that funny. That's not say that its a drama though, because its not that serious. It never really fully commits to being either, so the end result for me just felt like a series of mildly interesting things happening. 

What doesn't help this is the editing which moves everything along way too fast. It's almost like this was once a longer movie that was cut down to fit a 90min run time. Some scenes feel cut short and incomplete, and I felt like at times they're going ""okay you get what's going on here, so we don't need to finish the scene, so let's move on to the next one!""

Add to that Jay Baruchel being extremely annoying any time he was on screen, and a side character having more of a story arc, and I felt myself regularly tuning out of this and checking how much time was left. This movie seems to have a bit of a cult following, but I really couldn't get pulled into it. There is a sequel out there, but I won't be busting any doors down to watch it.

Side note: If you're a hockey fan, make sure you watch the credits for some footage of the real Doug in action cracking heads on the ice."

We normally do not have Canal+ in our ‚Äúbouquet‚Äù but they are making a drive right now so everyone can watch Canal+ for a couple of weeks and this movie looked interesting, at least compared to the rest of the choice available that evening, so we watched it.

It was a surprisingly entertaining evening movie. It is pretty much a standard Hollywood nonsensical pop-corn movie but it is a well done one. It makes no pretence of being anything else than it is. The story is a fairly predictable action story. Hero gets framed during the introduction scenes. Quick flip to the space prison that is going to serve as the scenery of the bulk of the movie. Dumbass thinks he is more clever than everyone else so he breaks the rules. Goes bad. Prisoners break out. President‚Äôs daughter just happens to be there at the same tame. Our hero is sent in to save the day. Action time!

There are a few more complications to the story but that is pretty much it. It is a simple and solid story that pretty much holds water. It would have been a fairly standard, even mediocre, movie if it was not for our hero which is doing an admirable job of playing hero and tough guy. The dialog, as nonsensical as it is, definitely lifts the move. The action is fairly good and so are the special effects although it is by no means a movie that is held up by its effects. The main bad guy is a really irritating psychotic son-of-a-bitch. The actor is doing a good job of portraying him but the character itself bugged the hell out of me when watching the movie. He is a bit over the top that has to be said.

Anyway, the movie was quite entertaining as an evening pop-corn flick and since we picked it more or less by chance and did not know much about it before hand it was indeed a fairly pleasant surprise. || Nobody smokes anymore, Snow! 

I was kind of inclined to headline this as being the movie guaranteed to make highbrow film fans froth with incredulity. That anyone could enjoy such a derivative, tongue-in-cheek, low ambition piece of schlock, is surely cause for venomous spleen venting from the serio film brigade. They call them guilty pleasures, but thing is, I just don't feel guilty about having such a wonderfully fun filled great time with the Luc Besson produced Lockout.

Plot? Well it's the future and basically Guy Pearce (Snow) is wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to do stir in stasis until whenever. But up in space at the MS1 prison facility, home to all the maniacs found in ""Demolition Man"", the president's daughter, do-gooder babe Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), is suddenly taken captive and it's a big hostage situation. This looks like a mission for a serious hard bastard type! Well ""Snake Plissken"" wasn't available, so they get Snow, who is bulked up, full of wise cracks and has a point to prove. Guess what follows? Yep, complete popcorn frenzy as Pearce and Grace cut a swathe through MS1 and have a date with coolness personified.

On the way, via a truly gorgeous sci-fi affected Blu-ray print, we will tick off the homages and influences and compare notes with our viewing partners about how it's a ""Snake Plissken"" movie but with Shane Black type dialogue. While those who are partial to a bit of sci-fi design are well served here. Because even though there might be the worst CGI effects ever during a chase scene (that mercifully only runs for 50 seconds), the space ships, sets and Torsion System sequence, prove that you don't need Michael Bay type bucks to please the eyes. From the quite brilliant and hilarious opening interrogation beat down, to the big reveal and punch line, this Besson produced piece is serving popcorn with a smile to a certain segment in the film watching populace.

With bits of the ""Snake Plissken"" movies, ""Fortress"", ""Die Hard"", ""Commando"", ""Demolition Man"", ""Minority Report"", ""Last Boy Scout"" and any other quip laden dude/wronged man on a mission movie, Lockout clearly lacks originality. But seriously! Was anyone involved playing it as anything other than a sly homage movie? No, they wasn't. Pearce is great fun in the role, but he isn't trying to worry the highbrow crowd's votes for films of the year. Anyone viewing it expecting something cerebral should feel more guilty than those who stand up to say they had a great time watching it. Ingem Ferem. 7/10"

The travel through the Underworld maze to the Tartarus is just the best example of how bad the story is. In addition, they just mix the Greek mythology in the most absurd ways, putting a minotaur where it doesn't belong. 

Make up is quite bad. Specially with the beards and appearance of the gods.

Andromeda, who is also misplaced and doesn't really have any relevant role, is the spark to remark, played by Rosemund Pike. || The visual effects where very good. Unfortunately, that was about it. The script was just awful. I do not want to watch a movie about Greek mythology just to see the gods being portrayed as week, loosing their power and ultimately disappearing.

I don‚Äôt know why so many writers today cannot do anything better than to take a well known setting and then totally destroy it for thrills. It seems like they all have some ‚ÄúLets-destroy-the-Enterprise‚Äù complex.

To me the awful script ruined this movie. It became depressing despite the good visual effects. || I'm split on this one! In some ways I kinda prefer <em>'Wrath of the Titans'</em> to its predecessor, though in other ways it is a downgrade.

My positives include the pacing and the use of 'the gods', with both - in my opinion - better done in this 2012 film when compared to the 2010 original. The shorter run time helps, while Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are far better utilised this time.

My negatives include the story and (one or two) new cast/characters. The plot didn't really hold my attention very well, at a number of moments I felt my mind drift away from what was occurring onscreen. I wasn't bored or anything, though I could feel myself lose interest immediately after a scene that promised more than it delivered. As for the latter, Rosamund Pike and √âdgar Ram√≠rez are disappointing additions.

With that said, Bill Nighy is a newcomer here and he actually entertained me - probably my standout character from this sequel. Toby Kebbell is a solid newbie too, to be honest. Elsewhere, Ramin Djawadi is missed on music but Javier Navarrete does a perfectly fine job in fairness.

Naturally, I can only speak for myself and to me this is an average, if admittedly forgettable, flick - nought worse."

It certainly had its funny, even hilarious, moments but at the same time it was incredibly stupid and silly at times.

The idea of the Nazi‚Äôs having fled to the moon and built a secret moon-base there was a rather original I think. On could of course wonder why, if they had that technological advantage already 1945, everything is still looking like 1945 now, why they did not have computers, even why they lost the war in the first place? But let us not get picky now‚Ä¶it is a comedy movie after all.

There are quite a few funny moments. Most of them involving their stupor when seeing a black American astronaut and their subsequent dealing with him. Unfortunately there are also quite a few incredibly stupid and silly moments. Their depiction of the American present, her PR-people and most things revolving around here was not really very funny, just stupid. I do not mind a movie that makes fun of the American president but in this movie it was not very intelligently done, just silly. Also, using a Sarah Palin look-alike was just cheap not to mention that such a joke is lost only a few years later when no one has a clue who Sarah Palin was.

The special effects where quite cool, at least when considering that it was ‚Äúonly‚Äù a comedy movie after all and even more so considering the movies minimal budget. The Nazi‚Äôs steampunk-like contraptions where rather fun to watch. 

In all I would say that the movie managed to place itself in the enjoyable range, barely, but I cannot bring myself to give it a more than fairly average rating. || Well I can't call it different. I've never actually seen a movie with a plot like this, but it did feel exactly like a low budget cheap drive in comedy/sci-fi show and...kudos.

The best part about this is that, at no point in time, does it take itself seriously. It knows exactly what kind of movie it is and delivers the goods without any pretense, without any attempt to be a better film.

It seems like everyone involved knew the score and did their parts to sell the movie for what it is, and not what they think it could be.

So, what you have is a comedy that is ferociously entertaining. It's a stupid plot with a cheesy script and equally inane characters and it pulls it off brilliantly.

The end result is, when you sit down to watch it, you're going to laugh and be entertained and the time is going to fly by.

But, you are going to hate it if you walk in expecting 2001, an enormous budget, or a deeply profound political lecture...but then, if you walk in expecting any of those things why are you watching a movie about Nazis on the moon?"

Written and directed by Mike Flanagan, Absentia finds Tricia (Courtney Bell) and Callie (Katie Parker) as two sisters who come to believe that the underpass nearby could be linked to the many disappearances in the area.

A slow burn indie horror is not everybody's idea of a good time, but Flanagan has crafted a smart atmospheric chiller, one with a nifty fairy tale fantasy bubbling away under the surface. Narratively it's low-key, though the air of grief and terror is palpable. The setting is a low rent area of Los Angeles, a place where the girls are told to always keep the doors locked, with the ominous underpass haunting the edges of every other frame.

Flanagan filters his story through the urban locale while populating it with characters who are haunted by something unseen, or by others who are troubled by personal issues (Tricia's husband disappeared 7 years ago and Callie is fighting a needle habit). The formula scares are kept to a minimum, Flanagan choosing to imbue the story with a sense of dread, toying with the sisters and us the viewers that there just may be something truly awful lurking just out of the eye line.

This is not a creature feature, like The Relic or Mimic, this is a different horror film to those. The horrors are born out of what you don't see, or what you barely glimpse, just like the classic horrors of yesteryear, with Flanagan cheekily dangling ambiguity into the bargain. It's unnerving and sad, creepy yet cunning, and a refreshing experience for those tired of big effects driven horror movies. If you like the slow burn less is more approach, with well written human drama in the bargain? Then give this a chance. 8/10 || Pure filmmaking. Has the atmosphere that is by and large missing from the horror genre, opting for character development, tension, engagement and grounding rather than jump scares and gross-out gore effects. Still a horror movie, to be sure (and therefore not for everybody) but one that stands on its own.
_
Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - I strongly recommend you make the time._ || I watched this film without knowing it was actually directed by Mike Flanagan. When I saw his name in the beginning of the film, I immediately knew I was in for a treat! I was not wrong!

There is something special about the way he tries to scare people who watch his films. I can't tell you exactly what that is. All I know is that he is bloody good at it!

You could see the film had a limited budget but actually the fact that its budget was limited made the film even better. Its atmosphere was unique. The ""jump scares"" were not really a traditional jump scare but rather an amazing collection of moments where you wished you were so glued to the screen.

Would I watch it again? Definitely! Would I make my friends watch it? ASAP!"

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._ || In the centre of Jakarta, a criminal fraternity pretty much own a residential block where they carry on with impunity. ‚ÄúTama‚Äù (Ray Sahetapy) is the kingpin who pretty much does as he pleases and has a small army at his back when the police arrive to close him down. This is an heavily armed SWAT team but what soon becomes evident is that they are outnumbered and outgunned and that their boss has engaged in this perilous operation without advising his bosses - so there will be no reinforcements, or better still, a few missiles fired into the place from a well placed helicopter. The building is riddled with CCTV so the police movements are easily monitored and quite swiftly ‚ÄúLt. Wahyu‚Äù (Pierre Gruno) is down to a mere handful of folk as they try to ascend to the seventh floor. Fortunately, one of them is ‚ÄúRama‚Äù (Iko Uwais) who is no slouch when it comes to martial arts and with some assistance from an unexpected source, battle lines are drawn. The dark and dingy building provides a good venue for their graphically violent activity and though it is definitely repetitive, especially later when it seems determined never to end, the sheer gymnastic athleticism here is impressive. It‚Äôs a vehicle for the charismatic Uwais to show just how nimble he can be against machine guns, pistols, machetes and fridges and packs plenty in. The story plays out predictably and at times really does suffer from a ridiculous degree of an immortality syndrome with characters surviving the most impossible of physical injuries to keep on breathing, let alone fighting - but this isn‚Äôt meant to be reality, it‚Äôs a showcase of athletes that has a video game mentality and rarely stops for breath."

Great movie, one of the best in this ""genre"" for quite a while. || Finally got around to The Cabin in the Woods. 8/10, great fun. A Joss Whedon-(co)written (also co-written and directed by Drew Goddard, who wrote Cloverfield) take on an old horror staple in which 5 stereotypical teenagers (an academic, a jock, a stoner, a slut and a ""nice"" girl) venture out into the woods for a dirty weekend. It's no spoiler to say that these unfortunate young na√Øfs appear to have been cherry-picked and are being heavily monitored all the way into the woods by some very (very) high-tech manner of... what? Government agency? It's with these fellows that we visit first, before we ever meet our protagonists; two middle-aged, white collar I.T. types, a little brow-beaten by what appears to be a fairly monotonous job (although it really ****ing isn't) but full of typical office cameraderie and essentially confident in their own competence and that of the numerous other departments that make up this rather large-scale operation. Whoever is watching our heroes/heroines, they're big-time. So, what's happening? To say more would be to start giving things away, but those kids are very deliberate archetypes, placed in a very deliberately typical horror scenario. Because it's an American film set in America, it's called The Cabin in the Woods as is befitting the conventions of God-knows-how-many American horror flicks. Were it a J-Horror set in Tokyo, it would be called The Freaky Long-Haired Schoolgirl Ghost, an assertion ably illustrated in the film itself to great and rather humourous effect.

Decent performances all-round, even the deliberately irritating characters are kind-of likeable. A pre-Thor Chris Hemsworth is particularly good as is Richard Jenkins (Nathaniel ""The Dead Patriarch"" Fisher from Six Feet Under). It threw me a bit, this film, because in purposely not looking too deeply at what it was about prior to seeing it, I mistakenly thought I was about to watch a seriously scary and effective horror, and this isn't the case at all. It's a slick product with what looks like a decent budget as you'd expect from a Joss Whedon project (in case you've been under a rock somewhere, he of Buffy/Angel and latterly of The Avengers fame) and it's loaded with nods to other horror literary and cinematic classics (The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, The Strangers and HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos are all fairly explicitly referenced), but it's not especially gory, it's intentionally funny more often than it's intentionally scary and it's a real thrill-ride, a slice of fun. It's not quite there, but it's a damn site closer to ""Horror-Comedy"" than it is to balls-out ""Horror"". It's not perfect by a long way - it instills bags of concerned curiosity in the viewer, but provokes almost zero real tension whatsoever. And late-on a special effects extravaganza treads clumsily into Night at the Museum-for-grown-ups territory. But it remains a great way to spend a couple of hours. || This is another one of those movies where I cannot understand why so many people give it so high scores. Sure it‚Äôs not a really bad movie but, personally, I found it only moderately good. I‚Äôm not sure whether the movie was intended to be scary or funny or both. It wasn‚Äôt very funny though and only moderately scary.

It has been presented as a not-your-usual-teenage-slasher-horror movie. Well, it sure has an interesting twist but‚Ä¶it is still a teenage slasher horror movie. The twist could really have lifted the movie but unfortunately this good idea is pretty much wasted in a poor implementation.

Instead of holding on to the surprise it‚Äôs spoiled right away with that eagle flying in to the force field (since when did we learn to build force fields by the way?). Another thing that really drags down the film are these utter morons in the control room. If this was really a matter of survival of mankind then you would have thought that it would have been left to professional people and not these jerks.

The movie isn‚Äôt all bad though. With the exception of these major flaws it does pass as a decent slasher/horror movie and makes for a reasonably entertaining hour and a half of not too intelligent movie watching. The part nearing the end where all the monsters goes on a rampage is rather fun to watch. I was not very impressed by the end itself though. That was rather uninspired I would say."

Hence begins the path of violence, later a young woman joins him and how long it all goes was briefed.

Seems very familiar, but still worked so good. It's not your 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Pretty Poison'. In fact, you can drag as many titles as you can, but still it is quite simple and entertaining. Obviously predictable, including the main twist and several scenes, but the rhythm of the narration was great, keeps us hooked to it for the way it was filmed. It's not about the moral science. It is pretty much a confused or misunderstood situation based theme, especially the conclusion clears out that. So if you don't care anything about those things, particularly in a film, then it is for you.

Unfamiliar faces, but they both in the lead were excellent. The same film with some popular stars would have made a better headline and collection. Not seen quite a nice B film like this in the recent time. I got what I wanted from a film. Especially for a small film like this its exemption in a few areas due to the tight budget, but this film did not have any trouble, just amazing. Yeah, a well made film, from writing to direction, performances, this is a decent hidden gem of its kind.

The Raven is directed by James McTeigue and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare. It stars John Cusack, Luke Evans, Alice Eve and Brendan Gleeson. Music is by Lucas Vidal and cinematography by Danny Ruhlmann.

""On October 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was found, near death, on a park bench in Baltimore, Maryland. The last days of his life remain a mystery""

It's a real smart idea that the makers have here, putting their own theory forward on what happened in the lead up to Poe's death. Essentially a period whodunit procedural as Poe (Cusack) and Inspector Emmett Fields (Evans) race against time to find the person who is killing in the style of Poe's literary works. Poe's love interest, Emily Hamilton (Eve), is in grave danger, so as to add extra peril and suspense into the clock ticking drama.

It's a safe piece of entertainment, one that acquaints the uninitiated with Poe's work and his life struggles away from the writing bureau. The detective angle is fun and the murders grizzly and appropriately Gothic in execution. Unfortunately it rarely convinces as a period piece. The dialogue is often out of sync with the era, Eve is miscast, the score is inappropriate and it always feels like actors playing at period rompery. 

It's a shame that it is bogged down by such irritants because Teague's direction is stylish, while the art design deserves a round of applause. Cusack is fun to watch, but more at ease playing Sherlock in the second half of the piece than a tortured soul in the first, and Evans is confident in the straight backed gentleman detective stakes. There's a good time to be had here on a surface whodunit follow the clues experience, and Poe fans will delight at catching the many references to his life and spiky works, but it unfortunately misses the mark in too many key areas. 6/10 || I just happened to find this movie in the program listings yesterday. Movies based on Edgar Allan Poe can be a bit hit or miss but I like quite a few of his works so I decided to give this one a try. I have to say that it is surprisingly good. The Victorian era setting together with the rather dark plot and atmosphere makes for a very enjoyable old times thriller. The movie is based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe but not in the usual way that one would  think when one says based on. Instead the story in this movie is a new story spun around Edgar Allan Poe as a person where his work is used by the evil mastermind in that the various stories are re-enacted in real life‚Ä¶with deadly results.

I, for obvious reasons, have no idea how Edgar Allan Poe was as a person and I did not really have any pre-conceived opinions before watching this movie either. I can imagine that he, as a poet and writer of rather grisly stories, might have been a wee bit excentric though so to me John Cusack‚Äôs performance as the rather excentric, somewhat alcoholic and sometimes almost insane but still brilliant Edgar Allan Poe was a very good one. Not that the rest of the actors are below par by any means.

The story, if you take it apart and remove the parts taken from Poe‚Äôs original works, is not really something to jump up and down over. However, put it together with the bits and pieces from Poe, add the characterization of Poe by Cusack, the dark Victorian ambiance and generally well implemented cinematics and you have a movie that is, as I wrote above, surprisingly good."

Neither Collins nor Hammer set the story alight, the dwarves have a rather aggressive, slapstick, nature to their characters and though an attempt to keep it light-hearted has gone into the script, it's all just a little too wordy and frankly rather plodding.

Actually that's a little unfair, for those after a two hour plus movie of noise and robotic like destruction, then this has a modicum of popcorn frivolity about it. But it's all so vacuous, any semblance of a story is given over for a chance to show some Transformers effects work, the human characters constantly an afterthought as they play second fiddle to another CGI action scene. It feels like an extended toy advertisement, the acting is sub-standard and the editing - appropriately enough for the film's setting - is akin to a bout of sea sickness. The action sequences all carry a familiarity about them, while like their human counterparts, the alien foe here are devoid of any rhyme or reason as to their motive and being.

Cash infused metallic porn at its most tiresome. 5/10 || I have to say that I enjoyed this movie. The visual effects are great, the alien designs are interesting and there‚Äôs lots of explosive hardware flying around. Although not exactly a very logical/practical design I did like the cool rolling ‚Äúballs‚Äù of destruction that the aliens where using. Seeing the ‚ÄúMighty Mo‚Äù in action was of course an additional plus. It‚Äôs really a shame that these magnificent floating fortresses have become obsolete.

However, the enjoyment brought by this movie was almost purely one of visual effects. Well, I generally like Liam Neeson as well but not much else in this movie was of any higher standards. The story is the usual Hollywood stuff. The holes in the logic are big enough to drive, well, a battleship through. For instance, the aliens can come from far away, navigate between the stars, but they cannot avoid accidentally colliding with a satellite in earth orbit? Come on.
 
It unfortunately becomes even worse when they decide to fire up the Missouri. I could live with the fact that there‚Äôs no way that a handful of veterans could have gotten that ship into running state. I could even live with the fact that the film ignores that it would take days to fire the ship up from cold storage even under optimal circumstances and with a full crew. But what really got me pissed off is when they drop the anchor to make a ‚Äúhand break turn‚Äù and turn the ship around on a dime actually sliding the ship on the water. What the fuck !!!

How utterly ignorant, dumb, stupid can you become as a Hollywood producer/scriptwriter/director? I‚Äôm actually being kind to these morons now because if the people that wrote that scene is not total idiots then they are assuming that the audience are such idiots which would be even worse.

That part alone dropped it two stars for me. I still gave it 6 out of 10 because I enjoyed the visual effects and the sea battles so much. || **Battleship might have sunk at the box office, but it's still an entertaining disaster to enjoy if you have some time to spare and nothing else to do.**

I literally watched this movie in theaters on my honeymoon - not the greatest choice for the first movie as a married couple, but thankfully she stuck with me üòÇ. Battleship swung for the fences in hopes of being the next Transformers and struck out. I can't say that it was a surprise that a movie based on the board game where you blindly guess where your opponent's boats are on a grid wasn't a mega-hit. There wasn't much there, to begin with, but sprinkling an alien menace on top makes everything better, right? Sadly, it did not. The effects weren't quite there, and some of the acting and characters were outrageously bad. But even with all that being said, Battleship, with the right expectations, is still an entertaining movie! Taylor Kitsch is a fun actor. Rihanna makes a feature film debut. Liam Neeson pops up. Aliens are blown up. Shut your brain off and embrace the nonsensical goofy action."

Before seeing the movie I saw one review categorizing it as having Benny Hill style comedy. I did _NOT_ see that at all in this movie. In fact, one criticism that I have is that I'd liked to have seen a little more comedy.  One of the characters is truly over the top, but not slapstick.  But regardless this movie flows elegantly start to finish without being overly saccharine or morbid or falling back on what you might expect for comedy involving the elderly.  This film won't move you like Slumdog Millionaire but it is a quality film in its own right. || This is easily one of the best films I have ever watched. I cannot put it into words that will describe my feelings towards the film. From the very beginning to the very end, the characters were introduced excellently.

You feel a strong bond for each and every character. Every single one of them are so relatable, as if this was a reality show and not a film.

Especially in the days when most of the world continues to live repetitive lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people question the ordinary lives we all have. This film can be the one spark you need in your life to start over.

Would I watch this again? Absolutely! Would I make my friends watch it? Without a doubt! || We've all read brochures that extol the virtues of an hotel or resort (or maybe even read the effusive nonsense MUBI write about their daily, ""hand-picked"" film selection) so we won't be surprised to learn that when a selection of elderly Brits arrive at the ramshackle ""Exotic Marigold Hotel"", they are sure to be surprised. Recently widowed ""Evelyn"" (Dame Judi Dench), curmudgeonly ""Mrs. Donnelly"" (Dame Maggie Smith) and retired High Court Judge ""Dashwood"" (Tom Wilkinson) are amongst this motley collection who must adjust to their new lives in this vibrant and frenetically different city - all whilst under the watchful gaze of the enthusiastic, but pretty hapless young, and loved-up, hotel owner ""Sonny"" (Dev Patel). Yep, it plays to just about every stereotype in the book. That can either ruin it for you, or serve as quite a fun conduit to tackling some of these pre-conceived ideas and in some cases - from both cultures - hold them up to a bit of humorous scrutiny. The characters are possibly a bit too much of a potpourri of society. Gay, straight, happy, sad, lonely - you name it, but the character actors engaged here - especially Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup, I found - help to dismantle the template of ignorance that prevails at the start of this light-hearted comedy. The writing is often effective at illustrating that age (or declining health) is not necessarily a barrier to happiness and fulfilment, and though this film is very much more on the simplistic side of an evaluation of race, religion and creed - it's not meant to be a documentary. It's an enjoyable bit of cinema that does raise a smile."

This is a fine movie, but it is probably one of the most depressing romantic comedies I've ever seen.

This is a stacked cast with Emily Blunt and Jason Segal carrying most of the movie, with Chris Pratt and Alison Brie giving a significant support.

From the title alone, you can suppose a fair bit of life creating adversity as one person in a relationship often sacrifices for another, but ideally in even terms.

Part of the reason this is depressing is that it's a real ""slice of life""  film.  Fortunately there were good comedic actors and writers that worked on this and added a significant amount of humor to this to make it watchable.

It does feel like it drags on for quite a while at points, and thinking back on it, the highlight for it was Alison Brie, which is always a bad sign for a movie that a pretty face was one of the more interesting things.

I loved Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman. Hated Batman Returns, Alice in Wonderland, and Willy Wonka. Could care less about Nightmare before Christmas and Sweeney Todd. Okay, so I'm not a Tim Burton hater. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. I think in this situation, I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda, no attachments. That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and ""showiness"" kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up. So much talent is wasted on these films having the same look, cast, and feel to them. Take that talent and make something fresh! Stretch yourself just a tad out of that Hot Topic comfort zone will ya? This movie was long, boring, and ruined. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer. By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's. That's bad film making whether your name is Tim Burton or not. || I generally like Tim Burton as well as  Johnny Depp. This movie was no exception. It is a dark (of course with Tim Burton) comedy with some hint of action/thriller in it. I would not really characterize it as a horror movie even though there are a vampire as well as a witch and a werewolf in it. Of course there is the romance stuff but I personally feel that is really more of a background or justification to the plot than anything else.

This is not a magnificent movie but it‚Äôs a good movie. I have never seen the original series so I am not biased by that. It seems that many people that considers this to be a bad movie refers to the original show. I have read several of the critical reviews and I do not agree with most of them.

I found this movie to be a nice, moderately paced, comedy in a vampire/gothic setting. The mood and the wackiness were fairly typical for a Tim Burton production. Johnny Depp was pretty much as can be expected which is a good thing if you like Johnny Depp. 
The return of Barnabas to his, now rather dysfunctional, family is rather funny. The ease with how Barnabas was duped and trapped again in the second half of the film was a bit annoying but then, he had been asleep for a few centuries.

The entire family quite enjoyed this movie. || ***I don‚Äôt get all the hate***

On coastal Maine, a Vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is released in 1972 after almost 200 years in captivity and reacquaints himself with his family‚Äôs chateau & the nearby fishing village. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Collins matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter the in-house shrink, Eva Green a conniving witch, Bella Heathcote the reincarnation of Barnabas‚Äô long-lost love and Chlo√´ Grace Moretz a 15 year-old punk.

Directed by Tim Burton, ‚ÄúDark Shadows‚Äù (2012) isn‚Äôt far removed in tone from his ‚ÄúSleepy Hollow‚Äù (1999), which also featured Depp as the protagonist, although I suppose ‚ÄúShadows‚Äù throws in a little more humor. I‚Äôve never seen the TV soap opera Dark Shadows or the subsequent two movies, so I can‚Äôt compare this movie to them. All I know is that I liked this rendition quite a bit, just as I liked the inexplicably reviled ‚ÄúThe Lone Ranger‚Äù (2013).

The October/November ambiance (i.e. Halloween-season) is to die for and Depp as Barnabas Collins maintains your interest throughout. He‚Äôs obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don‚Äôt get the hubbub over Moretz, but she‚Äôs a‚Äôright (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo. I should add that the opening credits sequence with ‚ÄúNights in White Satin‚Äù is cinema at its finest.

The movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England (Devon, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Cornwall &  Farnham) and Scotland (Mull, Argyll and Bute) with exteriors of the chateau shot at Trafalgar Castle School, Whitby, Ontario, Canada.

There's a supporting role alien that was pretty endearing though.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || **This film knew how to honor and equal the first film.**

Despite their popularity, the first two MIB films, from the turn of the century, are films I don't really like to watch. The first movie, from 1997, is still worth it, but the second one was so bad that they had to wait more than ten years for this movie to come out, and even then, we still remember it. Good news: this movie is virtually as good as the first one and knows how to meet the public's expectations.

The plot is reasonably simple, but it guarantees entertainment: over the years, the boss of the MIB organization became a woman. Meanwhile, the escape of a dangerous alien from the lunar prison will force J to travel back in time, to the beginning of K's career, to try to prevent planet Earth from being invaded by a destructive galactic force. The script does a reasonably effective job and there is a lot of movement and action.

Will Smith shows that he has matured as an actor, and he knew how to imprint that maturity on the MIB agent he played: J is no longer a rookie or someone who accepts lessons, he is a senior agent with experience, who knows what he is doing and is sufficiently trained to deal with what you have in hand. Of course, K remains a veteran, and Tommy Lee Jones won't let that go by the wayside: sullen and seemingly unflappable, Jones' character will take particular pleasure in lecturing and lecturing Smith whenever appropriate. And, ultimately, it's the way the two actors interact that makes the movie funnier. The villain is worthy of our dislike and has some good jokes and tongue-in-cheek lines, but Jemaine Clement seems to have sometimes exaggerated things a bit. Michael Stuhlbarg and Josh Brolin do a very honest and committed job, and they help substantially to increase the quality of the film.

Technically, there is a serious and substantial bet on CGI, computerization and computer-made effects. It's something almost predictable, nowadays it's a very widespread resource and sci-fi or action movies have learned to master it. However, the authenticity of real scenes always tastes good. So the ending seems to be a bit out of step with the rest of the movie, but that turns out to be a minor problem. The cinematography is quite well executed, the sound and soundtrack are effective, the visuals as well. The sets and wardrobe, as well as the props, are in line with what you would expect to find in a MIB film. || Well it took ten years to try and recalibrate this franchise after the disappointing sequel, and to be fair - they have at least had a think about the story before rehashing the theme of the detective agency charged with policing the earth of our visiting friends from planets far away. Clearly, ""J"" (Will Smith) has become much more experienced since the days of the talking dog, but suddenly he finds himself ill-equipped for this latest trauma that is gong to need him to engage with his partner ""K"" (Tommy Lee Jones) and even travel through time to work with his younger version (an uncannily similar Josh Brolin). All of this is now under the leadership of new chief ""O"" (Emma Thompson). The plot is all a bit old hat - they have to save mankind from imminent annihilation, but at least this time around there is a bit more humour - usually more effective from Thompson - and a bit less of the constant diatribe from the over-powering Smith. At times it's a bit ""Dr. Who"" and the action scenes recycle themselves as they pursue the eminently un-menacing ""Boris the Animal"" (Jermaine Clement) towards a predicable, but colourful, denouement. Could Andy Warhol have been in on the whole ET-thing? It's better than the second but nowhere hear as much fun as the first one. Maybe we should stop now."

I have to say that I enjoyed this movie.

Despite that a lot of the world is much darker and filled of despair in this movie the photography is nice and the film is beautiful to watch. The film focuses a lot more on the huntsman than previous Snow White movies that I have seen and I think this is also the first one that I have seen where snow white mounts up in full battle armor. I think it worked quite well.

There is quite a few special effects in the movie but not enough to overdo it and they are reasonably well done as far as I am concerned. As I mentioned earlier the plot is somewhat different although it follows the general lines of the original story. It is still a fairly simple adventure/action plot but it holds together well enough.

The dwarfs are present of course and, although the film takes much more serious take to the Snow White story, they still give you a laugh or two. There are a couple of scenes which more or less seemed to be fillers with not that much to add to the story but they did not really disturb the flow of the movie either.

When the credits started to roll I was quite satisfied with my movie evening. || Ever since I saw the first photographs of Snow White and the Huntsman surface on IMDb about a year ago, I've been extremely excited to see this film. And over the past few weeks, that excitement only built op more and more to the point where almost no film can meet such high expectations. See, I have always loved the fairy tale of Snow White and the evil queen, but never before had anyone attempted to make it into what I believe it was always meant to be: a Gothic tale of fantasy and horror, rather than a sweet night time story. And now, with a much promising trailer, it appeared that Rupert Sanders had fulfilled my wish. And even though he has claimed quite some artistic license story wise, the end very much justifies the means. Snow White and the Huntsman is a film worth watching.

Literally everything I ever imagined about this classic story is there. The Dark Forest is actually Dark. It's creepy and spooky in the best kind of nightmarish way. Funnily enough, throughout the film there were some analogies with the classic Disney film. For instance, in the Dark Forest, the tree branches move autonomously towards whoever dare enter their territory, grasping around like freakish clawing fingers. The mushrooms spew poisonous fumes when you touch them. And the hills literally have eyes... The Evil Queen's castle is every goth kids' dream house. And the dwarfs are rugged, mean little men. Graphically, there's simply nothing not to love.

However, without the key elements perfectly worked out, the pretty pictures alone wouldn't have made this film work. Let me start with the leading lady. I don't know why Kristen Stewart is getting so much hate, honestly. Not only is she a very talented young actress, she is the perfect Snow White. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job with this than her. She doesn't just have the right look (pretty face, pale skin and raven dark hair), she also has the right attitude to play Snow White the way her character was written: smart, daring and independent. This is no damsel in distress, this is a girl ready to kick some ass and get revenge. She just needs a little help from her friends. First and foremost friend on the list is Eric, the Huntsman. He is initially hired (or rather, commanded) by the Evil Queen, to hunt down Snow White. However, when he finds out that he has been deceived, he turns on the Queen and decides to help her instead. This character is played by Chris Hemsworth, and he is perfectly cast. He is all the Huntsman needs to be; rugged but charming, complete with a husky Scottish twang. Lastly, there is Snow White's childhood friend William, played by Sam Claflin, who sets out on his own personal mission to help her.

Of course, the tale of Snow White would not have been complete without the notorious 7 (or 8, in this case) dwarfs. It seems the casting director pulled open a can of Britain's finest for this occasion. Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Eddie Marsan, Ray Winstone, just to name a few. These characters are a delight to watch and also bring some much needed comic relief to the story, without actually turning it into a comedy (which is a good thing).

And then there's the Evil Queen, Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron. Ms Theron is a great actress, and I was really looking forward to her playing this purely evil character. And as such, the Queen was everything I had hoped for; a heartless, sadistic beauty who relies on dark magic to remain forever young and beautiful, sacrificing whosoever crosses her path for this purpose. Though strangely, viewed solely as a performance, I caught Charlize doing something I had never expected from her: she overacted. Personally I feel that her performance would have actually been much more intense had she decided not to spend half her screen time screaming at the top of her lungs, but rather just some of it, carefully dosed. However, Ms Theron has garnered a more than sufficient amount of brownie points in my book, so I'll just chalk it up to excitement. It's obvious she had a lot of fun playing this character, so she's easily forgiven. Besides, physically she fit the role perfectly and I still really enjoyed watching her.

Visually, Snow White and the Huntsman is truly stunning. The CGI is top-notch, especially the Mirror is quite awesome. It transforms into a human-shaped mass of liquid gold in order to speak, and it's one of the best visual surprises in the film. The Dark Forest is the closest thing I've ever experienced to an acid trip, and all the fantasy creatures are really cool (my favourite was the angry forest troll!).

I don't need to tell you about the story, we all know how it goes (although I've never seen Snow White in a harness before...), so there's no really big surprise anywhere, and of course you get the happy ending (trust me, that's not a spoiler). Still, it's the way this story is told here, that makes it a very exciting ride. There's only one point of critique I have, and that's the pacing. They really could have kicked it up a notch here and there.

I think, in the end, Snow White and the Huntsman actually did live up to my expectations, and that's quite an accomplishment, considering how high they were. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for Snow White: The Gothic Version. Beautiful, awesome, cool!
_(June 2012)_ || Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.

This is probably my favorite Snow White story version to date.  I'm a fan of Kristen Stewart, and both Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are both top tier actors giving amazing performances.

A dark and gritty tale with plenty of money to fuel the amazing CG effects of the movie.  The story is well laid out with complex multi-threading, Each story thread is actually interesting and I've always thought fairy tales like Snow White needed more fight and military battle scenes.

Charlize Theron really steals the show, not only as a villain, but she embodies the insanity of the character and is worth the watch all on its own."

A trillion dollar expedition to discover the ‚Äúmakers of mankind‚Äù and they put together a band of asocial morons for crew where not even the scientists among them seems to have met each other before the wake up millions of miles from Earth.

The entire film is just a jumble of illogical acts one after another. 

Then we have the ending. What a joke. Apart from the fact that Elizabeth‚Äôs actions are just ridiculous, how does she expect to live on a alien ship without food or any other supplies?

This film had good promise. The idea of getting to know the origin of the aliens intrigued me and the basic plot idea was cool. However, the film was really ruined by a script obviously written by total morons. || Although this is not a great movie, I was positively surprised, given the tons of bad references I got from this movie.

The background story is interesting and the cast is quite decent. Theron and Elba played well but specially remarkable are Rapace and Fassbender.

In any case, it does have many flaws in the script. Several characters are stupid beyond comprehension, several things are completely unexplained, Pearce character is really bad and the crashing of the alien spaceship is just ridiculous, as it is the killing of Theron's character.

In any case, it doesn't leave a bad after taste and I am looking forward to the continuation of the story. || Looks good, but feels a bit hollow to me.

Noomi Rapace is probably the film's standout, though Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are also involved - the latter two feel a bit underused, we get a fair bit of them both but still I wanted to watch them more - especially Theron, who feels a bit tacked on."

This is actually the true story of what happened between a purely good man and a purely evil woman.

Jack Black plays Bernie Tiede, an assistant undertaker in the small town of Carthage, Texas. He is loved by everybody for his pure-hearted character, his sympathy for every person he comes across and his willingness to help everyone who needs it in any way, shape or form. He's just such a good guy, you almost wouldn't believe it if not for the fact that this character is based on an actual person.

And then there's Marjorie Nugent, played by Shirley MacLaine. She is his polar opposite, as hated as Bernie is loved. She is the widow of some rich oil baron, and she is just the most mean and spiteful woman you could ever fear to meet. Everyone in town absolutely hates her guts, and there's no one who would be sorry to see her go...

Then comes the day when these two people meet and ‚Äì all due to Bernie's good nature ‚Äì form an unlikely friendship. Until about two years later when Marjorie's true personality rears its ugly head and even Bernie can't stand her abuse any longer, when he is reduced to her personal slave and whipping boy. And what no one believed possible, happens... He kills her. (don't worry, that's not a spoiler, that's the story line.) What follows is the strange lengths Bernie attempts to go to, in order to cover up his crime.

What makes this film work so well is mostly the subtle humour of it. Director Richard Linklater thankfully didn't choose to make this into the hysterical, caricature of a comedy it easily could have been. Something that really adds to the authenticity of the film is the use of actual Carthage townsfolk, providing commentary on the events in documentary-like interview scenes. This really is a perfect move on the director's part, because it makes the 'acting' completely real and spontaneous.

I really like Jack Black, but in this case, I'm somewhat glad he left his crazy mannerisms and facial expressions at the door, in order to just play this character true-to-form. He actually acts, rather than just playing another silly, typical ""Jack Black character"".

I always love watching Shirley MacLaine in a mean and vile role such as this one, and in 'Bernie', she plays it to a T once again. Imagine her character in 'Steel Magnolia's' and then multiply it by ten. That's what you get here and it's an absolute joy to watch.

Matthew McConaughey plays the county sheriff, dead-set on burning Bernie for his crime. I'm usually not too fond of him, but his role in 'Bernie' is pretty funny and he plays it well. He seems to be the only person in town who thinks it's bad what happened to Marjorie. That's another really funny aspect to this story ‚Äì the fact that everybody involved just loves Bernie so much and really hates Marjorie to the bone, that they all seem to take his side in the matter. You might feel like I'm just throwing spoilers at you here, but pretty much the whole story is told in hindsight and flashbacks, so there are no real secretes or mysteries unveiled. Then what's the point of watching, you might ask, if I already know everything that's going to happen from the get-go? The point is the enjoyment you'll get from watching these events unfold.

The actors are all really well cast, and they play their roles with a certain flair that makes them instantly likable. The dialogue is clever and witty, and like I mentioned earlier, the combination of event re-enactment and documentary-like interviews, is a winning ticket and 'Bernie's' major selling point. The story is well constructed, as is the chronology of how it unfolds. Basically, it's just very well-made, and it definitely would have deserved a little more credit. But then again, this film also kind of has a ""small budget/small audience"" feel to it, so that might explain why it practically went unnoticed at the box office. It's just a shame that charming little comedies like 'Bernie' always get overlooked when stuff like 'The Hangover' and the like get multi-million dollar appraisal. All I can hope for is that 'Bernie' gathers its own DVD-fan base, because it's certainly worth it.

Watch this film if you're in the mood a darkly hilarious comedy that has its heart in the right place. Oh, and stick around for the credits, where you can see pictures of the actual Bernie and Marjorie, and footage of Bernie and Jack Black talking, which is a fun addition.

All in all, a highly recommended film!

Written and directed by Sarah Polley, this film tells the story of Margot, an ostensibly happily married woman who's eye begins to wander when she meets the charming artist/rikshaw driver across the street.

Margot is excellently played by Michelle Williams.  She is an interesting mix of quietly confident, insecure, unfulfilled dreamer who doesn't know what she wants from her life.  Her husband Lou is played by Seth Rogen in an understated dramatic performance, even if his character is a little thin and 2 dimensional at times.  The new love interest Daniel is played by Luke Kirby, and he's kind of the male version of the manic pixie dream girl, except he's all confidence, charm, smouldering intensity and artistic earthiness.  Just don't ask how he can pay his rent pulling rikshaws for a living.  He's an unrealistic dream character that is there to serve as a distraction and make Margot question her marriage.

The film really is all about Margot, and she is great character.  She really feels like an actual person, slightly annoying at times, well intentioned, good at embarrassing herself and generally not able to cope with a life that lacks any purpose.  Her relationship with Lou feels real when dealing with the minutiae of day to day life.  They have silly couple games and favourite ways of annoying each other.  Sadly Lou's obtuse nature doesn't feel realistic all of the time.  Margot is needy and Lou doesn't know how to deal with that neediness, so he just focuses on the task at hand.  They've been married for 5 years, and it can't be just now that Margot's neediness has surfaced, so his inability to even connect with her or console her is one of the few parts of the film that feels unrealistic.  Maybe we're supposed to think this neediness is a new thing that has sprung up since Margot has become tempted, but that doesn't ring true to me.

The other true star of this film is the city of Toronto.  Polley makes it look vibrant and colourful and a place I would like to see for myself.

This film isn't for everyone.  It has some shortcomings that can't be ignored, and some of the subject matter might irritate people.  But where it fails a bit on an intellectual level it makes up for on an emotional level and an artistic level.  It really is a beautifully shot film, that deserves a watch if you enjoy romantic dramas.

7/10 || ""Margot"" (Michelle Williams) encounters the hunky ""Daniel"" (Luke Kirby) on a plane after he spots her using some interesting tactics to get onto the priority boarding list. They hit it off pretty quickly and on landing share a cab to their homes - it turns out that they are all but next door neighbours. Now she is very happily married to ""Lou"" (Seth Rogan) but I challenge anyone married or otherwise not to find the charismatic Kirby a bit of a distraction. Not looking for change, what now ensues is a gently evolving romance that shies away from sentimentality but focusses more on human nature. On how what isn't broken doesn't need fixed - but perhaps it needs changing? On the downside, there is a flaw in the marital relationship that isn't explained - and after a while I found that annoying, but for the most part this is a characterful study of people looking for happiness - even when they think they ready have it - and maybe even one that points out that it might never be truly attainable. Sarah Silverman contributes sparingly, but well, as the alcoholic sister-in-law (""Gerry"") and though his is very much the lesser of the three leads, Rogan too offers us a considered performance as a man realising that his dreams are changing too - just not at his behest.

I still like to see him in movies and this is a surprisingly good movie. The movie had a proper theatrical premier in most countries except USA where it went straight to VOD which I find a bit surprising. It is a lot better movie than much of the stuff that are shown in theaters. I suspect the politically correct hypocrites had something to do with that.

Personally, I found this movie surprisingly good. Mel Gibson fit the role very well and made a quite good performance. The settings with the bizarre prison which looked like a cross between Alcatraz and Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen was quite cool. It was the kind of setting that I would not have been surprised to find in a Tarantino-movie. I also liked the cynical and somewhat ironical voice-over by Gibson.

The story was okay. Perhaps not the most believable one but good enough for this kind of action movie. Speaking of action, there were indeed some decent action in the movie but it is not like the movie is overloaded with it. It is nicely spread out and once the action starts it is pretty good. It is also true that some scenes are a wee bit gruesome but I am not sure that I agree with the R-rating. Most of the time that rating felt a bit over the top. Still, I rather have a R-rated movie with cuts than a PG-13 with lots of silly cuts in it.

There were some silly bits of course, like how easy Mel could evade the prison and make a ‚Äúbusiness-trip‚Äù to the states when he finally felt like it and the entire business of performing transplantation surgery in a filthy prison. Mel might have found that ‚Äúput it back‚Äù statement funny when he wrote it but it came out rather silly to me.

Bottom line is that this was a quite enjoyable movie. A perfect after-work movie when you feel like parking your brain somewhere in the garage with your car and just sit down and watch something requiring a minimum of concentration."

Cinematography is standard, nothing particularly memorable, and the visual storytelling doesn‚Äôt do much to enhance the narrative.

Eddie Murphy delivers a good performance, especially given how much he has to rely on physical expressions rather than dialogue, but the script lets him down. The writing lacks depth, missing opportunities to make the story more impactful.

While the roles are a little (by design) stock characters, their personalities grown and change and stay interesting while keeping their core tenants.

The investigative style to the main story line intuitively delivers as a mystery, with proper drip-fed information and misleads.  It all properly builds to a significant moment in the story where you begin to question things.

I highly recommend this for fans of conspiracy, time-travel, mysteries, or just weirdos with wishful thinking. || I wanted to watch this movie because I like stories about time travel.

There are a couple of ordinary and almost cliched subplots involving the two men accompanying her on the investigative assignment to talk to the alleged time traveler, so don‚Äôt go to the fridge for a snack when she is onscreen. Fortunately that is for most of the scenes.

I don‚Äôt know that I will ever watch it again, because I am not young and there are a lot of movies I still need to watch. But neither do I regret the 90 minutes I spent with it. As a final side note, the movie ends where many time travel films begin, but I will say no more than that."

First of all, I never felt like there was much meat to the story. It was enjoyable sure, and had some good morals and family values but I never felt like I was invested in the main characters. Stuff just seemed to happen.

Secondly, and this isn't as much the movies fault as perhaps the marketing that surrounded it, but it was actually a very different movie than I thought it was going to be. I discovered that it's hard to break those pre-conceptions as I kept thinking the story was going somewhere else than it did.

Brave was at its best when it made me laugh which  unfortunately, was just too seldom. For example, the entire scene where the 3 clans try to fight for M√©rida's hand was way too short!

The voice cast was very good though. Kelly Macdonald in particular, was perfect as M√©rida.

All in all, Brave was good but not great. It just seems to lack the ""magic"" I expect from Pixar. Not their worst outing but close to it. || The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2012.

The film in all was a relatively decent venture. Perhaps Pixar's well deserved success is its pitfall here. Though highly enjoyable, Brave was simply not up to the standard brought forth by the likes of the Toy Story trilogy, Up or Monsters Inc. ?This movie falls more into the category of ""Entertaining, acceptable, cute"" instead of the higher echelons some of the studio's past work has earned it.

Brave attempts to take the ""Disney Princess"" line away from its predecessors in which princesses are only good for getting themselves into trouble so that men can rescue them (ie. Snow White, Belle, etc.) or in the case of the Little Mermaid in which she is willing to almost literally walk on broken glass for a man simply because he's pretty. And for this, we thank Brave. All that said and done however, there was one rather unfortunate side-effect of all this. I at first simply felt it was my warped interpretation, but every person whom I've spoken to drew the same conclusion, so perhaps not... Now, I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but, I must say, the main character Merida... Seemed to... Have a thing for her mum. Just saying, honestly, that's how the piece feels as it plays out.

On a less incestuous note though, stand up comic/actor Billy Connolly as Meridia's father King Fergus is simply brilliant, and probably the highest point of the whole film. Though the animation didn't exactly make leaps and bounds forward in comparison to anything else that's come out in the past couple of years, it was still most certainly impressive.

Maybe if I had been part of Brave's target audience I could have appreciated the movie more. It was most certainly good, but I wasn't really ?blown away? by any aspect of the film whatsoever. It managed to scrape a slight ""above average"" but I really would have liked something more than I got, especially seeing as movies on the big screen tend to impress me more readily.
Brave's biggest problem is that it is, in essence, forgettable. Though an entertaining 93 minutes to be sure, I can't imagine myself hankering for a re-watch any time soon.

-Gimly || A wholehearted animated film from Disney.

<em>'Brave'</em> is very good. The Scottish vibes help a lot, but the meaningful message and superb animation are just a few of the film's other big positives. The casting, characters and music are some too. The premise itself isn't anything breathtakingly new, but is most certainly enjoyable to see unfold.

The cast are excellent, with my personal standouts being Kelly Macdonald (Merida) and Emma Thompson (Elinor). There are also good performances from Billy Connolly (Fergus), Robbie Coltrane (Dingwall) and Julie Walters (Witch).

It's a fun and simple watch, one I thoroughly felt entertained by."

For a sequel, <em>'Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World'</em> is indeed a fine attempt. I like the story of Pocahontas visiting London and seeing a new place, though the new love story is pretty dull and forced.

Irene Bedard is again good, while Billy Zane comes in with a fair performance as John Rolfe; arguably better than Mel Gibson's John Smith. The latter is now voiced by Mel's brother, Donal, funnily enough.

The problem when films add another 'good' love interest is that you end up having to force the lead into one direction, most of the time without strong reasoning - that's exactly what happens here unfortunately.

I'm sure the story of Pocahontas is again fictionalised just like in the original, but as a film it stands up solidly and I just about enjoyed it."

I found it to be a quite enjoyable movie. 

The story is somewhat bizarre indeed, but then what would you expect when Tim Burton has stuck his fingers into the production? The blurb about the film is also not exactly correct. The 16th president doesn‚Äôt discover that vampires are planning to take over the United States. It‚Äôs more on the line that he enters politics and actually becomes the 16th President because of the vampires. The story also manages to, more or less, blame the slave trade on the vampires. After all, slaves would make a nice food source for plantation-owning vampires wouldn‚Äôt it? As I said, the story is indeed somewhat bizarre. 

The film as a whole is quite enjoyable though. Well, I guess you have to like vampire/action movies in order to find it enjoyable but then, why else would you want to see this movie in the first place? There‚Äôs enough action to keep the film going most of the time. If anything, maybe the training parts were a bit rushed and too short. The action is quite well done, reasonably blood-splattering, and fun to watch. 

The axe-swinging Abraham Lincoln is a cool twist instead of the usual wooden stake, cross swinging or dart throwing vampire hunters that we‚Äôre used to see. He must be bloody, as in unnaturally, strong to be able swing around that axe the way he does but what the heck, it‚Äôs a vampire movie after all, so one should perhaps not nit-pick on such things. 

There‚Äôs a scene near the end of the film where a train is about to crash down into a ravine since the bridge, that the vampires have set on fire, is about to collapse. That‚Äôs scene was a bit silly and overly unrealistic. There‚Äôs also a fairly big whoops in the make-up department where Abraham and his friend Joshua clearly has aged a lot towards the end of the movie, which you would expect, but his wife and his friend Will seems not to have aged at all. How that managed to slip through is somewhat unbelievable. || Joyously Bonkers!

It is what it is, a nutty premise made in nutty fashion, but for the undemanding horror fan there's a good time to be had here. Action choreography is of a very good standard, as is, perhaps surprisingly, the CGI. The history aspects of the story, one Abraham Lincoln's accent into justifiable legendary status, are of course a mixture of the based on fact and chaotic popcorn, but it's always interesting, exciting and bloody!

I imagine most horror fans have seen it by now, but if like me you are late to it, and like me you go in with low expectation levels, you could well find yourself having a blast and not hating yourself in the morning . All that and Rufus Sewell looks suspiciously like Adam Ant! 7/10 || My expectations were pretty low, but I somehow actually ended up liking it even less than I thought I might. The big setpieces seem to be what _Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter_ is all about, and they are **so bad**. Just abysmal.

Seth MacFarlane, der neben seiner Regiearbeit auch noch Ted spricht, hat ihr einen Film erschaffen, in dem kein Blatt vor den Mund genommen wird und vor allem davon lebt, dass Ted einfach in jeder Szene auf die eine oder andere Art daneben benimmt. Immer einen fiesen Spruch auf den Lippen sprudeln die Beleidigungen und unangebrachten S√§tze nur so aus Ted heraus und wenn man bei menschlichen Protagonisten schnell das Gef√ºhl hat, dass dieses Verhalten zu viel des Guten ist, kommt dies bei Ted nicht vor. Dies mag daran liegen, dass Ted eben ein Teddyb√§r ist und man so ein Verhalten von einem Kuscheltier eben nicht erwartet.

Erstaunlich ist auch, wie gut Mark Wahlberg (Shooter, Vier Br√ºder) im Zusammenspiel mit dem chaotischen Teddyb√§ren funktioniert. Wahlberg hat sich in den letzten Jahren ja eher in Actionfilmen und ernsteren Produktionen positioniert, zeigt aber in ‚ÄûTed‚Äú, dass er den ‚ÄûOver the top‚Äú-Humor genau beherrscht wie das Actionfach.

Und auch Mila Kunis (Black Swan, Ausgequetscht) darf man nicht vergessen. Kunis hat sich ja schon mehrfach in Kom√∂dien ausgetobt und beweist in ‚ÄûTed‚Äú, dass sich auch in derberen Vertretern des Genres eine gute Figur macht.

‚ÄûTed‚Äú bietet aber nicht nur derben Humor, sondern mindestens eine Szene, die in die Filmgeschichte eingehen wird, den Donnersong. Wenn John und Ted bei Gewitter im Bett liegen und ihr Lied singen und dabei das Unwetter wild beschimpfen, dann bleibt auch bei den Zuschauern kein Auge trocken, die ansonsten wenig mit dem Film anfangen k√∂nnen.

Insgesamt gesehen ist ‚ÄûTed‚Äú allerdings kein Meisterwerk. In erster Linie nutzt Seth MacFarlane seine Erfahrung die er mit der TV-Serie ‚ÄûFamily Guy‚Äú gesammelt hat und mixt den derben Humor der Serie mit neuen Figuren. Klar, mit dem gesellschaftsuntauglichen Ted pr√§sentiert er dabei eine Figur, die man so auf der Leinwand noch nicht gesehen hat, er erfindet sich allerdings mit dem Film nicht neu, sondern erschlie√üt mit ‚ÄûTed‚Äú nur eine neue Zielgruppe, n√§mlich die Kom√∂dienfans, die MacFarlane noch nicht von ‚ÄûFamily Guy‚Äú kenne, aber derbe Kom√∂die wie z.B. ‚ÄûHangover‚Äú m√∂gen. [Sneakfilm.de] || Ted is THE poster child for the fact that every great concept doesn't automatically become a guaranteed winning project once it leaves the drawing board. This movie SCREAMS ""Here's a great idea, but we just didn't know what to do with it."" Whether it was because of lack of imagination or too many tokes on the community bong, nobody will ever know.

Having a movie about a real-live Teddy Bear existing in the every day life of a 30-something underachiever sounds like a winning formula. However after the first few moments, the movie stalls, the dialog gets stale quickly and the majority of the story revolves around Ted getting high and/or trying to bang shallow, attractive women (even though Hasbro didn't include on him full, working equipment) while the main character tries to balance his 4-year ongoing relationship with a woman completely out of his league and his life-long Thunder Buddy (Ted).

Lewd, crude and rude, Ted does little to entertain beyond the limited soph-moronic humor. Unless you are a rabid fan of Family Guy or the 80s Flash Gordon, live in or around the Boston area or think it's funny to hear the F-word every other second, this one won't be for you. || Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

This is a stupid movie, it doesn't mean it's bad: it's not a great movie, but it is entertaining.  I love stupid humor and dirt comedy, basically absurdist comedy which Seth MacFarlane excels at.

The cast is great, and I think it would have been a very different movie if they had used anyone else in any role.

The concept alone is unique and refreshing, ""Did you see the movie about the teddy bwear that came to life?"", that's this movie.  You almost owe it to yourself to see such a unique concept.

And they they do some fantastically structure humor mixed with some rather contrastingly serious romantic drama.  They even mix in a touch of horror, and I was even able to get into it, despite it being about a Teddy Bear that has express displeasure about not being constructed with a penis.

I can't imagine ever watching this and not being entertained."

For a film that‚Äôs supposedly about the sexualisation of the male body, we see way more female nakedness and that I felt rather defeated the purpose. I don‚Äôt mean we needed dangly bits all over that place, but to tell a story about sexploitation - both the good and the bad elements of it, well - you need something more natural.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._ || A young British student (Abhin Galeya) is gradually indoctrinated into a Muslim cell bent on revenge after the ""War on Terror"", and is pursued by a government agent - Sean Bean - who is pretty much given a clean slate by his boss Charlotte Rampling. The story is told via parallel timelines in which we discover what has driven both men to their current courses of action; and whilst it does use some fairly sweeping stereotypical generalising for plot development, the characterisations delivered by both - especially Galeya - are quite revealing as a potential explanation for extremes in behaviour caused by fear, ignorance and large scale indifference. Regrettably, the dialogue is mundane; and the direction loses focus all to often as we flit between scenarios whilst trying to build up some sort of interest in two rather unlikeable - if good looking - men obsessed with their own perspectives. Rampling features sparingly, as does James Fox, which is a shame as they could have both have been used to further develop the cause and effect toxicity of the storyline.

Spider-man is a hero everyone knows. He¬¥s been around for so long everyone is familiar with his origin, comic fan or not. Its basic pop culture. Then you have the Sam Raimi¬¥s movies. Everyone saw them. They made loads of money and they¬¥re always on tv. They are entertaining movies. ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù gave us a good origin story in 2002. This movie simply wasn't needed. 
Now I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There¬¥s Burton¬¥s Batman and Nolan¬¥s. Maybe this was a different Spider-Man. A more ‚Äúdark‚Äù vision perhaps! Maybe the movie spent a few minutes on the origin and then wisely moved on with its story. Maybe... well maybe it wasn't just another rehash. A shameless attempt to remake, or how they say it these days, reboot the same idea with minimal changes except the cast. I was naive.
The whole movie is about Spider-Man¬¥s origin. They traded Mary Jane for another love interest and held off on ‚ÄúThe Green Goblin‚Äù because that would be too much ‚Äúrubbing it in the face‚Äù for the fans, I guess. We get Gwen Stacy and ‚ÄúThe Lizard‚Äù. The rest is same old, same old. The same uncle Ben plot, the same scenes about making the suit, learning how to control powers, the search for the criminal Spider-man lets get away with horrific results. Same thing. Except everything is done without a spark of energy or creativity. Raimi¬¥s movies were energetic, flowing with excitement. They were ‚Äúnew‚Äù. Seeing Spider-Man on the big screen,  webbing all over the city, fighting ‚ÄúThe Green Goblin‚Äù, it was amazing. We didn't have ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù back there, or ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù. This was like a dream come true for comic fans. 
‚ÄúThe Amazing Spider-Man‚Äù smells of old cheese. 
I tried to take the movie for what it was but it was impossible. My mind would not let me. I knew what was going to happen next. I knew all the plots! I¬¥d seen it all before! 
But even ignoring that the movie just does not work. Its slow, turgid with an unlikable Peter Parker and a CGI lizard for a villain. Parker is a whiny, self centered idiot. His relationship with aunt May and uncle Ben is never fully explored and what little there is consists of Parker being a rude jerk for no reason at all. 
The movie has one thing going for it. The cast. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are great with what little material they have. Emma Stone is sexy and sweet which is ‚Äúher thing‚Äù and again she pulls it off brilliantly.  Rhys Ifans is decent as Curt Connors and surprisingly enough I loved Andrew Garfield as Spidey. Yes, seriously! He looks perfect for the part and he did his best with the horrible script. He¬¥s charismatic and brought his own touch to the role instead of copying Toby Maguire. If the movie is even slightly original its because of him. 
Some of the action in the last third of the movie is also spectacular. Spider-man¬¥s movements when fighting are really well done as is the web-slinging. The action is well directed and exciting and the movie sets up a sequel rather nicely. 
But its asking a lot to go over the material everyone knows for two hours for a few minutes of cool action. The movie plays it so safe it hurts. Its competent but never brilliant. Tedious but far too long with little spots of action but few and far between. 
I hope in the sequel this ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù can find its own style and its own place. Given space to grow and evolve, on the strength of the character and Garfield¬¥s acting this could be the weak start to a new amazing super-hero trilogy. 
Then again, maybe i¬¥m just naive. || This is the fourth spider man movie although it is not the fourth sequel but rather one of these reboots which seems to be so popular today. I found the movie to be quite enjoyable but at the same time a bit of a let-down.

In some ways it is better than the previous trilogy by Sam Raimi (well it is not very hard to make something that is better than the 2nd installment in that trilogy of course). The film is darker, more serious and Spider Man is not so silly and a total mess-up when out of his costume as the character portrayed by Toby Maquire.

However, this movie has its own faults which makes me have to think hard whether it is really that much of an improvement over the previous movie and this is what makes me feel a bit let-down since I had hope that this reboot would be that ‚Äúreal‚Äù Spider Man movie that enabled me to forget about the previous ones.

A lot of not so interesting scenes are really dragged out and the important stuff is rushed. Peter Parker‚Äôs transition to Spider Man after his bitten is over and done with quite quickly. In another scene he spends 5 minutes trying to talk some kid out of a car. He even takes off his mask and gives it to him (what the f‚Ä¶) and in the end just zips him out with a net shot. He could have done that right away and spared us the boring time.

Generally I think this movie is indeed a better Spider Man movie than the previous ones though and I quite enjoyed the movie evening yesterday, just not as much as I hoped. || Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can.

The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. 

Peter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers. 

While the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of ""fans"" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think. 

I mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the ""reimaging"" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that ""reimaging"" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! 

Negatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin ""origin"" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. 

However, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. 

It's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10"

A cheerleading squad from the suburbs of Houston goes to summer camp to improve their camaraderie and cheer skills, but a masked killer is on the loose and most of the youths end up dead one-by-one.

‚ÄúSpirit Camp‚Äù (2009) is a satirical meshing of the Friday the 13th and Bring It On flicks. It‚Äôs a spare change Indie, but the director/writer (Kerry Beyer) is proficient and so the filmmaking is professional with quality locations, lighting, photography, gore, sound and score/soundtrack. Even the no-name cast rises to the challenge with an amusingly campy approach, although there are a couple of scenes with noticeably dubious ‚Äúacting.‚Äù

Beyer wisely includes all the staples of the slasher genre and, best of all, knows how to photograph women. The standouts are Katy Rowe (Amber), Denise Williamson (Monica), Amy Morris (Lindsay), Julin (Rachel) and Sarah McCulley /Thygeson (Beth); superb job on this front.

With the campy vibe I had doubts that the story would remain compelling over the course of the slightly overlong runtime (for an Indie slasher, that is), but Beyer keeps things moving and I eventually found myself taking the events fairly seriously (surprisingly). A plus is that I couldn‚Äôt predict who the killer turns out to be. A minus is that he shoulda toned down the crudity, but it‚Äôs not as bad as some flicks, e.g. the tasteless ‚ÄúAmerican Pie,"" and he was obviously aiming to amuse. 

The film runs 1 hour and 36 minutes and was shot in Cleveland, Texas (a 2.5 hour drive south of Lake Tyler), with the suburban scenes done in Houston.

GRADE: B/B- || Decent watch, probably won't watch again, and can only recommend for horror fans to see particular aspects.

Done in a very 1980's style, this movie combines the concept that a camp would have a manager, a groundkeeper, and 2 counselors for 6 cheerleaders....all from the same squad.....at the same school.  At best I guess it was a bootcamp.

Regardless, the characters are mostly flavorless, and the dialogue and cinematography is pretty low quality.  Roxy Vandiver carries the movie for most of it, but she arguably has the most poorly developed character in the story.

The movie's biggest strength is a clear knowledge and application of horror tropes, using them in both an expected manner and refreshingly surprising manner.  I think that's what the movie is probably best known for: a few great moments.

Horror fans will probably like this, but I imagine it will disappoint a lot of general audiences."

I'm not a big fan of Ben Stiller (most of the time), and definitely not Vince Vaughn.  I like Jonah Hill, but this is after he found some range and before he learned to control it, intense doesn't not equate funny.  I thought Richard Ayoade would save it, but he just stood by and watched the train wreck happen.  I do chuckle a bit thinking of him asking the other guys if this is stuff Americans find funny.

This has a great premise, average joes find alien invaders, so good in fact, it's basically a trope, but the way this presents it feels like they tried to steal it from ""Laser Team"" and then legally distinct it from that property.

Long story short, there just isn't a lot of value in the movie.  It's not that funny, it is basically a huge commercial for Costco and some other obvious brands.  There is so much money poured into something that feels like a waste.

Don't get me wrong, it's done by professionals, it looks great, even if I don't like the Xenos design, and there is a decent script at the core of this.  There is just an overall fail of execution, and lack of interesting characters and story.

Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn‚Äôt quite work as a whole. || William Friedkin serves up Trailer Trash Neo-Noir with a side order of Fried Chicken. 

Killer Joe is directed by William Friedkin and adapted to screenplay by Tracy Letts from his own play of the same name. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Thomas Haden Church and Gina Gershon. Music is scored by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Caleb Deschanel. Plot finds Hirsch as Chris Smith, who because he is in severe debt to local thugs, hatches a plan to bump off his waster of a mother and claim the life insurance. Roping in the rest of his trailer dwelling family, he hires Killer Joe (McConaughey), a cop with a sideline in murder, but the Smith's have no idea just what price they will have to pay for his services.

So pulpy, so amusingly dark, Killer Joe is one of those films that will sit at the top of many film fan's best of lists for 2012. Yet if someone came up to me and declared it one of the worst then I certainly will understand. Undeniably it has no widespread appeal, you either get it or you don't, you will either laugh along with Friedkin and his dark observations or you will feel the whole thing is just too ugly to be entertainment. Man it's good to have Friedkin back pushing peoples buttons!

Filmed in Texas in under three weeks, Killer Joe is a film that walks the fine line of misogyny and perversity for perversity's sake. But it never falls over that mark, even though these are scummy characters living in a scummy world, where there's sex and violence, and violent simulated sex and nudity; all of which is cloaked by a sweaty crime gone wrong caper. Much of the film is dialogue driven, rest assured this is very talky, but the director wrings out much tension and salaciousness from every character interaction, the slow-burn approach only heightening the sense of dread. When the finale comes, and it's a cracker-jack ending, there's an almost merciful release that it's all over. These are people you wouldn't want to hang out with ever, only there's Friedkin chuckling away to himself having made us spend an hour and forty minutes with this grime laden crew. If you feel like you need a bath afterwards, that's perfectly natural.

Friedkin has garnered terrific performances from a top line cast. Hirsch (powder-keg), Church (naievity extraordinaire), Temple (virginal piggy in the middle) and Gershon (bold and suspicious), are all giving disturbing credibility to the material, but as good as they are they are trumped considerably by McConaughey. One of the most frustrating actors working today, much like Cage, a ream of poor movies adorn his CV, but once in a while he throws in a performance of such genuine quality that it begs to be acknowledged by his peers. Here as Killer Joe he lays on a Faust like menace, delivering his lines with clinically calm precision, yet still there's a glint in his eye, we know a black heart beats there but he can charm a snake out of its basket, a girl out of her underwear...

Unflinching direction, bravura performances and neo-noir at its near best, one of the best films of 2012 so far. Well, to some of us at least.... 9/10 || _Killer Joe_ had the making to be a genuinely great film, but the quality control in the writing room limits the results.

So much of the story works for me on a thematic and plot progression basis. I enjoyed the premise and the stakes that this movie provides, but writer Tracy Letts wrote this like it was some subversive wet dream of his as a teenager.

This movie is vial, there is so much unnecessary nudity from creepy changing room shots to women's genitals being presented in full view, to soft-core pornography in the climax of the movie. I understand that this movie is supposed to have no redeeming characters, but the graphicness takes away from the scene more than adds to them. It is very reminiscent of my complaint about Rob Zombie films.

With that being said, the performances here are incredible. Matthew McConaughey is amazing. McConaughey is cold, calculated, and downright terrifying in almost every scene he is in. The final twenty minutes of this film are spectacular. His discovery and reveal gave me goosebumps. I loved it. Thomas Haden Church is pretty great too, he is so stupid and pointless that he adds a bit of humor in intense scenes that makes the viewer guilty for laughing. Everyone else was okay, they filled their roles well but did not necessarily impress me.

Despite my complaints, I enjoyed this film. It was an intense and thrilling experience that kept me on my toes till the credits rolled. I still think that the graphic nature and vulgarness take away from what could have been.

This reboot of the Paul Verhoeven/Arnold Schwarzenegger 1990 monster hit finds Colin Farrell as factory worker Douglas Quaid who, in search of meaning in his life and maybe an answer to his weird dreams, visits Rekall, a company who implant fantastical memories to order. When something strange shows up during the initial procedure, Quaid finds that nothing in his life is at all what he thought.

There's a lot of very good craft here, there really is, that is on proviso you are happy to indulge in stylised effects over character substance. It's also a cold hard fact that fans of the original Philip K. Dick story, and fans of the Verhoeven bonkers adaptation, are very unlikely to embrace such a candy shop approach to what was once an inventive premise.

Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale file in for the two lead female roles, which on facial likeness is a smart bit of casting, while on a butt point of view they have two of the best in the business. Farrell is competently gruff rough and tough, but again can you avert the thought process away from Schwarzenegger cutting a swathe through a futuristic world? A big problem is that as much as Beckinsale is lovely and feisty, the decision by her husband, director Len Wiseman, to make her part a complete film filler, grates on the nerves with its obvious stench of nepotiz. 

Still, if you are looking for a sci-fi picture awash with outrageous excitement, bangs and crashes galore and a sexy cast? Then this will certainly give you cause to chomp down with glee on your popcorn. There's homage nods to the Arnie movie, which are gratefully received, the pace never sags and the art design for this futuristic world is grade ""A"" in quality. As remakes go it's OK and far from being a stinker, you can have fun here, but it can't deliver enough quality to those fans mentioned earlier, and they are right to have such high standards. 6/10 || I quite liked the 1990 version of Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thus I was somewhat concerned whether or not I would like this one since it would be impossible for me to watch it without comparing it to ‚Äúthe original‚Äù.

Well, luckily, I did like it. I think the 1990 version is still my favourite but I did indeed like this one as well. It is said that this movie follows the original story better than the 1990 version. I wouldn‚Äôt know since I have not read it. Both are good stories with the same central idea although I have to say that the 1990 version of the story felt a wee bit more ‚Äúgrand‚Äù than this one.

This movie is, of course, more modern in that the special effects are more up to 2012 standards. Having said that I think the funny idea of going through earth‚Äôs core in a tunnel through the planet is way more far-fetched than actually going to Mars and, although the gravity reversal was a good idea in itself, the instant on/off effect was just ridiculous. Obviously no scientific experts where hired for this movie.

The 1990 version had a lot of action in it and this one doesn‚Äôt disappoint in that area. Actually, the entire film is pretty much one long action chase and a pretty well done at that. One gripe I have though is that I felt that Quaid was a bit on the wimpy side. But then, that probably comes from comparing with the Schwarzenegger ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù.

So the bottom line is that I quite liked it, It‚Äôs a good solid action movie, but it didn‚Äôt de-throne the 1990 version."

Unlike Quantum of Solace, I felt like they actually took the time to tell this story and the pay off was worth it.

Something I found interesting is the idea about Bond getting old and how the job of an MI6 agent is not something you can do forever. It makes me wonder if they might explore some of these themes in the next movie.

It's true that the last 1/3 of Skyfall didn't feel like a Bond movie at all and I think that's why I loved it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies have always taken a different look at James Bond and Skyfall was no exception.

Like I said, great movie. Execution on all accounts were solid like you'd expect. I hope Mendes gets a chance to do the next film. || Skyfall is a great movie. In my opinion the best proformas by Daniel Craig I have see in all his Bond movies. The title song was not to my taste like in previous movies. The story line is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Silva, played by Javier Bardem was excellent and he played him very well. All in all a very good movie. || Bond (Daniel Craig) is on another (important) mission somewhere in the big world, this time on the heels of someone who has stolen a hard drive with all the names of the British agents who work for MI6. On the mission, Mr. Bond is shot by one of his own (an agent named Eve, played by Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. However, Bond is not dead, and when he resurfaces, he jumps right into the game in the pursuit of an old agent called Silva (Javier Bardem), an old favorite of M (Judi Dench).

While Bond is out in the world, M discovers that someone, presumably Silva, has hacked their computers and threats to expose the true names of the British agents. However, it is also clear that the enemy has other plans, plans of terrorism. Bond is now in a race against time before more agents are revealed, or worse yet, before M is killed by their mysterious enemy. Fortunately, everything works out perfectly for 007, who finds the mysterious Silva with little effort.

OK, admittedly, this was a very short summary of the plot in Skyfall, but in all honesty, there isn't a big plot in this movie. I could have given some spoilers about the ending, and maybe added a bit about Mallory (Ralph fiennes), but really, this is an extremely simple plot. Not at all worthy of a big iconic character like James Bond.

It is classic 007, with everything thats part of such an adventure, like product placement (not a favorite of mine, in fact I get rather annoyed when its as obvious as the watch in the opening of the movie), car chases (in this case, more like a motorcycle chase across the roofs of some unknown city), beautiful women (which are exactly as shallow and pointless as you would expect), and lastly a total lack of emotions and realism.

I am not a big Bond fan, and haven't seen all of the movies in the series, so I am probably not the right person to review this movie. I do not understand what it is that draws people into the cinema time after time, to watch yet another Bond movie‚Ä¶ when they can watch something original with a real plot and real characters. Perhaps these people like the shallow characters, who care little for the safety of the innocent people in the world, yes, I said it. Look carefully in the opening sequence, how the female agent cares little for the people on the bridge, as she shoots after the enemy. Later in that scene, she finds it really hard to shoot the enemy, because what if she hit Bond instead. I may be wrong in this assumption, but isn't MI6 here to protect the innocent people? Perhaps these people like the almost infinite number of one-liners that made my ears bleed at one point. Why are we treated this way? Do the people who makes these movies really think we are so stupid?

Before I actually say something nice about Skyfall, because I can do that, I just want to give a small piece of advice to future Bond villains, because who are we kidding, there will be more Bond movies in the future‚Ä¶ my advice is this: Always remember to close the door behind you, whether its an actual door, or maybe a manhole (cover). If you don't do this, Bond will surely find you. But of course, perhaps you are dying to have him on your tail, in which case, you are doing it exactly right!

OK, something positive. Skyfall is a beautiful movie, in a very obvious (and superficial) way. The colors are just stunning, especially when we follow Bond swimming through the night of Shanghai, high above the streets. There is no denying the imagery and action of the movie, in every possible way, this is some of the best the world has to offer. I'd also like to give a shout out to Albert Finney, whose character (Kincade) raises the quality of the movie, and actually give it some human emotion.

The very last thing I want to say is this‚Ä¶ why hire Sam Mendes for this movie? Why hire him when he is not allowed to use the powers that God have given him? Where are the human emotions, where are the dark humor, where are the personal stories that capture our hearts as much as our minds? If you want to watch a real Sam Mendes movie, I suggest the following American Beauty, Jarhead and even, Revolutionary Road.

The medium of animated films has really gone through the roof in the last 20 years. There was a time when Disney was the only reliable source for such colourful frolics. Now we are blessed with a whole raft of film makers creating their own animated films born out by their personal visions. One of the benefits of this ""branching out"" has been the rise in the animated horror comedy, right up there with the best of them in recent times is ParaNorman.

Norman Babcock is considered to be the weird kid in town, you see he claims to see ghosts. Little do the residents of this New England haven know it, but they will soon need Norman to break a centuries old witches curse or they are all doomed!

Picture unfolds in a delightfully quirky nature, with the makers showing great love and respect to both the genres it appertains to. As with the best animated films, ParaNorman manages to be an all encompassing family friendly production. The chilly thrills are the right side of child friendly, the animation craft superb, while the humour is smart and the Gothic atmosphere surrounding the tale is pitch perfect. It all builds nicely to a bona fide thrilling finale, where the visual spectacle sits comfortably with the emotional beats of the film. Lovely, intelligent and spooky into the bargain. 8/10 || Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

This is surprisingly dark, and underrated.  While the animated characters are almost grosteque in their stylization, it serves fairly well when it comes to the undead.  It also pushes the boundaries of it being a ""kid's"" movie or an ""adult's"" movie in it's content.  So this is probably a movie for ""older younger"" audiences.

Not only is this a great concept, effect execution, and story, the characters that do pop, really do.  I honestly could have done without a few of them, but most of the important characters work for what they need to do.

There is a much appreciated ""twist"" that examples some self-aware story telling that comes with the tropes typically involved with ""I see dead people"" stories.  Its really rather refreshing without removing the idea that burning witches at the stake was an atrocity in history.

The story is touching and charming and just requires an open mind, which is part of the message of the story. || His parents think he's a bit bonkers, but ""Norman"" swears that he can communicate with his deceased grandmother (especially when she wants the central heating turned up!). When his uncle tells him that his unique skills might help with a ritual that could spare their sleepy town from a curse, he agrees to help - but oops! Next thing, the place is awash with zombies and it falls to ""Norman"" to figure out just what originally caused the curse and to find a way - together with his popular sister and his new found, and rather unlikely, friends - to annul it before it is too late! This is a fun family adventure with some strong characterisations (including the really enthusiastic voice talent of Kodi Smit-McPhee in the title role) and some superbly detailed stop motion animation. The writing is frequently quite pithy with plenty for the grown ups to smile at, and think about, as the story progresses. Though hardly original - the story itself has everything from ""Salem's Lot"" (1979) to ""Hocus Pocus"" (1993) running through it - it's still an enjoyable watch that lends itself well to a big screen to better appreciate the colourful vivacity of the creative artistry and lively Jon Brian score. Sure, their heads are bigger than the rest of their bodes combined, but the facial expressions are what makes this and I rather liked this film."
109584.0,Broken,Three suburban English families' lives intertwine with tragic consequences.,,Drama,91.0,2012-08-22,en,6.903,273.0,1.0051,"Tim Roth, Eloise Laurence, Cillian Murphy, Zana Marjanoviƒá, Robert Emms",Rufus Norris,"family, diabetic, mental hospital, father daughter relationship","Broken: Past Particle Of Break.

Broken is directed by Rufus Norris and adapted to screenplay by Mark O'Rowe from Daniel Clay's novel. It stars Tim Roth, Eloise Laurence, Robert Emms, Rory Kinnear, Faye Daveney and Cillian Murphy. Music is by Electric Wave Bureau and cinematography by Rob Hardy. 

Theatre and Opera director Rufus Norris turns his hand to feature film, choosing for his debut a cunning slice of British miserabilism and knowing humour. Story is based in North London and primarily centres on a young girl affectionately known as Skunk! She witnesses a sickening act of violence in the cul de sac where she lives, from here the lives of the residents unfold in a number of identifiable ways. 

Thematically there's much going on, such observations on life's dilemmas from both a child and parenting point of view are superbly played out by the cast. It would have been easy for the makers to lean too heavy on the melodrama, or perform as if it's a headline torn straight from one of Britain's sensationalistic tabloids, but it's played with earthy realism, helped no end by the fulcrum setting of a residential cul de sac that on the surface looks normal, so therefore believable. But of course what lies behind a neighbour's door is rarely all glint and gold.

The concurrent theme of violence, illness, heartbreak, grief, so basically life's strifes, gnaws away at the senses, but this is delicately balanced with much love and charm also on show, be it devotion to one's children, or the innocence of youth - puppy love/whimsy/ignorance/inquisitive leanings et al - this picture jabs at the heart in more ways than one. Norris and his team also have a nifty style of filming and scoring, very much putting us in the various frames of this story. 

It all builds to what in truth is a very crammed last quarter of film, because if ever there was a case for a much longer running time then this is a classic example. But it's just a niggle, and not enough to derail what is a moving, funny and crafty slice of Britannia. Yes! Even if the daring ending has proved divisive. 9/10 || ""Skunk"" (Eloise Laurence/Lily James) lives with her dad ""Archie"" (Tim Roth) and older brother in what can only be described as the suburban cul-de-sac from hell. Indeed, our own introduction to their street sees neighbour ""Bob"" (Rory Kinnear) beat up ""Rick"" (Robert Emms) because he thinks this lad is some kind of pervert. As the story unravels, we realise that ""Skunk"" has a crush on her hunky schoolmaster ""Mr. Kiernan"" (Cillian Murphy) who in turn has a bit of a crush on ""Kasia"" (Zan Marjanovic). The toxicity of this small community is further augmented by an odious young bully and just goes to show how much damage lies can do when unchallenged or supported by societal assumptions. The timelines flash about the place a bit, so you need to concentrate as the threads begin to inter-twine, but as they do we are presented with a really strong performance from the young Laurence and a couple of sparing, but quite potent, efforts from both Kinnear and Emms - whose character assumes greater importance as this drama evolves. It's not an easy watch, and though not overly graphic it still hits the ground running and sustains a steady pace as these increasingly volatile characters struggle to find some sort of peace. True, maybe some of the plot-lines are a touch far-fetched and overly contrived to heighten the drama, but it's still well worth a watch as a glimpse of dysfunctional family life where emotions run high."

This is one of the movies that my dear wife picked up. I had no clue concerning this movie until we watched it. It turned out be an enjoyable movie evening. This is a well done movie indeed although I felt like it could have been an even better movie at the end.

Acting, scenery, general story is all quite good. Well the story is okay. It is not exactly ground breaking but rather a standard bootlegging kind of story. The new deputy is a real asshole to the extent of being somewhat unbelievable. Guy Pearce plays the role well though. That goes for the rest of the main cast as well. It is a well-acted movie.

It kind of drags on a bit though. The real action where they finally take on the asshole deputy is not until the very end of the movie. Okay, that is perhaps understandable but until then the movie is quite slow. I would not have minded to see both the older Bondurant brothers being a bit more into the action but instead we mostly follow Jack (Shia LaBeouf) on his various more or less silly escapades and romantic adventures which, not very surprisingly, ends up with him leading previously mentioned asshole deputy right to their illegal booze factory‚Ä¶sigh! I am not 100% convinced that you can survive having your throat cut by the way. I think that was rather silly.

It is a good movie and of a lot higher quality than most although perhaps not exactly my style of movie and I have to say that I thought the ending, with Forrest blundering into the frozen lake, was rather meh. Still, it is worth 6 out o10 stars but not more as far as I am concerned."

I myself like a lot of cinematic offerings that require the brain to be left at the door. There's something very calming about being able to sit back and drive oneself into a movie with absolutely no worries about themes, agendas, politico posturing and etc. What shouldn't be tolerated is when film makers ask you to not only leave your brain at the door, but to also dribble with it and slam dunk it into the nearest garbage can.

Alexandre Aja's 2010 redux of Piranha was a whole bunch of fun, even away from the 3D, in 2D form it had a devilish glint in its eye, but this on the other hand is an embarrassment to all involved. Who doesn't love the female form? Whatever your sexual proclivities et al, you would have to be dead to not appreciate the splendour of Eve's offspring. But when it's your main selling point, when you are only trying to please a very small movie watching demographic, then you got problems.

John Gulager (director in the broadest context of the word) wants to craft a Porky's for this latest hairy palmed generation, whilst he even thinks a touch of Grindhouse might curry favour with the mall rats and skaters. Everything about this picture stinks, the acting, the hopeless attempts at suspense, badly timed jokes, poor stereotyping, laughable effects work, and on it goes. Standing up and saying it's meant to be tacky, corny and tongue in cheek just doesn't cut the mustard here, bad film making is just that, especially when it's done purely to make money.

Right, I'm off to dive into a tank full of piranha fish, because that will surely be better than having to ever sit through this movie again. 1/10 || The piranhas are back. Why? Not really sure, don't really care. But they are, and its a sad sight. This time they manage to lure their way into a water park, and you surely imagine what will happen. An endless amount of pointless killings, blood... everywhere. There are people too, mind you, a virgin, a greedy dude, a celebrity lifeguard, a couple of innocent youths and a corrupt cop, and more... but it matters not, they can't save eachother, and they certainly can't save this movie.

I have to admit, I knew what I was going into, but I still sad down and watched it. It was painful to say the least, and the few laughs that were provided, were... horrible forced laughs. I would really like to know which people love these type of movies and why they watch them. Why I watched it, you ask? I wish I had a good answer.

Anyways, my days watching anything remotely like this, are... over.

Unfortunately, the answer is: not much. The problem, or one of them, is that the movie establishes too long a period of time between the loss of the manuscript ‚Äî shortly after the end of WWI ‚Äî and its publishing ‚Äî presumably, the then-present day.

As we all know, Hemingway eventually got over the incident and went on to become arguably the greatest author of the 20th century, essentially rendering the film‚Äôs premise moot.

Co-directors Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal‚Äôs script, however, conveniently has its homologous character, played by Ben Barnes as a Young Man and Jeremy Irons as an old nurseryman, give up writing forever following his soon-to-be ex-wife‚Äôs misplacement of his text.

Needless to say, this is the least hemingwayesque thing to have done. Here‚Äôs another couple of problems. Wannabe writer Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper) finds the briefcase in an antiques store in Paris, and buys it; lo and behold, not only is the manuscript still inside, un-touched ‚Äî from the Gare de Lyon in the 1920s to an antiques shop in the 2010s, the briefcase sure-ly must have exchanged hands often (now, there‚Äôs you film), and yet it didn‚Äôt occur to anyone to rifle through it on the odd chance that it might contain something of value ‚Äî, but Rory actually leaves it untouched (""He retyped every word as it was written on those pages. He didn't change a pe-riod, a comma, or even correct the spelling mistakes""), which doesn‚Äôt stop from going directly to the printing press.

It‚Äôs at this point that one yearns for a movie like Genius, about famed editor Max Perkins ‚Äî who worked with the likes of Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Wolfe, and Hem himself; even an Ernest Hemingway at the peak of his powers wouldn‚Äôt crap out a best-seller just like that, and it certainly wouldn‚Äôt hit bookstore shelves without undergoing extensive rewrites and editing work.

But I digress. The Old Man (who, again, lacks the testicular fortitude of both Papa and the character to which his moniker is a reference) recognizes his work and confronts Rory ‚Äî but don‚Äôt expect anything along the lines of Secret Window; the Old Man ""just thought [Rory] should know the story behind these stories in case anyone was to ask.""

This comes right after the Old Man admits ""I don't know how you did it. To be brutally honest, I don't care."" But if he doesn‚Äôt care, and he clearly ne-ver did, why should we? Why even bother?

The whole thing becomes even less urgen when we consider that the Old Man‚Äôs tale is only a story within Rory‚Äôs story, which in turn is a story within another story: the latest book by novelist Clay Hammond (Dennis Quaid), who is discussing it with literary groupie Daniella (Olivia Wilde). Enough to make you wonder if there‚Äôs a point to any of this drivel, and if so, what the hell it is.

PS. That Rory‚Äôs adventure is a fictional yarn ‚Äî which might be based on events in Hammond‚Äôs life, and then again it might not ‚Äî could explain that he and the Old Man live in a world where Hemingway existed (a copy of The Sun Also Rises makes a cameo, being read by the Young Man), but neither ever stops to consider for the briefest moment that their little mix-up is eerily similar to one of the best known anecdotes in Western literature."

Shot on 70mm film in 30-odd countries, this was one of the most visually impressive films ever made, and its lack of any dialogue or narration allowed viewers to engage in their own individual reflections about the panorama on the screen. Two decades later, the team returned with <i>Samsara</i>, a sequel that wasn't really necessary.

One reason that <i>Samsara</i> is not very good is that it often seems a shot-for-shot repeat of <i>Baraka</i>. The filmmakers revisit many of the same locations (such as Thai prostitutes, a chicken-processing plant, home appliance factories, landfill gleaners). Again Buddhism, the Ka'aba and high church Christianity are depicted, but because the film does not go on to any other religions than what was on <i>Baraka</i>, these rituals feel this time like cheap exoticism instead of unquenchable anthropological curiosity. SAMSARA also lacks the dramatic arc of <i>Baraka</i>, coming across as a random succession of images instead of the journey from sacredness to horror and back that we found in its predecessor.

That is not to say that <i>Samsara</i> is completely without interest. There is an astonishing clip of performance artist Olivier de&nbsp;Sagaza, and the freakish Dubai landscape is depicting in a detail that few (even those who have been there) have seen. <i>Samsara</i> is all in all a darker film, and while depictions of the wreckage of Katrina, a Wyoming family that are proud to own an arsenal of guns, and a wounded veteran may fail to really shock viewers in the West who have already been exposed to such images for years, scenes of garish funerals in Nigeria and Indonesian men making the rounds in a sulphur mine (even though they know it is killing them) are stirring and memorable. Of course the visuals are rich, and in Bluray format on my HD projector the film is just as stunningly detailed as its predecessor.

However, <i>Samsara</i> lacks enough new things to say, it surprisingly doesn't offer continual rewards on rewatching, and just by the fact that it exists out there it potentially dilutes the impact of <i>Baraka</i>, once a singular film.

They more or less always become very unrealistic and full of paradoxes. I would almost go as far as to say that producers making serious (non-comedy) time travel movies are the ones that are scientifically too stupid to realise that it is just going to be a mess, or they do not really care about the issues hoping that the audience also will not care.

This movie is really proof of this. It is full of paradoxes and annoying ‚Äúbut if this happened now then that couldn‚Äôt have happened then and vice versa‚Äù. Maybe some people can force themselves overlooking these things but I have some difficulty doing so. I fully agree with the statement that one of the characters in the movie was making: ‚Äú""This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg‚Ä¶"".

Anyway, trying to pierce through the cloud of time-travel issues and enjoy the movie, it is not a bad movie. Given that it really had no chance of succeeding in the science area, or have a plot which didn‚Äôt defy all logic (time travel you know) it does indeed make a valiant try to entertain. It is not one of Bruce Willies standard all-out action-filled roller-coasters. That is not to say that there is no action but there is also plenty of time for trying to actually tell the story in the movie. The movie is actually quite dark and melancholic. The future seems to be fairly dirty, run down and ridden with criminal organisations.

As if time-travel itself wasn‚Äôt bad enough the story also involves 10% of the population having developed psychic powers. Most of them good for nothing except cheap show tricks like levitating small objects. Most of them‚Ä¶except our future crime lord which of course is found to have super-psychic powers. Also, of course, the kid had to behave like a spoiled brat with anger problems which was somewhat annoying.

The ending, which I will not divulge here of course, was not very surprising and left quite a few open questions. On the whole I would say that the movie was entertaining but it is far from going on my top ten list. || The plot is full of flaws. Quite like a even worse inception."

That's My Boy finds Adam Sandler on auto pilot, for this represents him not giving a care in the world about his fans or anyone remotely interested in watching a decent comedy. Sure this has fans, and it's not my want to chastise people's personal preferences, especially with what makes them laugh, and certainly making light of serious issues doesn't have me signing up for the next PC Brigade march, but this is pathetically played.

It was a colossal failure at the box offices, and it deserved to be. Sandler and his writer, David Caspe, blend edgy offensiveness with base juvenile comedy, throwing erection and sperm gags together with incest and statutory rape was always going to be tricky to successfully pull off, even more so when Sandler and co seem to think shouting loud makes scenes more funny. It's just that it never comes off as a funny whole, just a series of mind farts dotted alongside a potentially warm bonding between estranged father and son thread.

Next to this Little Nicky looks a masterpiece! It's a tough film for Sandler fans to defend, and I have been one in the past, but when Vanilla Ice sending himself up is a highlight then you got problems. Whilst Susan Sarandon and James Caan should look in the mirror and ask questions about appearing in this... 3/10 || Bad watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend.

I really couldn't believe I didn't know about this movie before.  I've organized a series of Happy Madison watch parties before, but after watching it, then I  know why I didn't know about ti.

Now I'm not a big fan of either Adam Sandler (though he has movies I enjoy, repeatedly) or Andy Samberg (I think he's better at creating comedy than performing it), but this was really like he was at a party with a big head and bet someone that he could make anything funny.

So, of course, the movie starts with a statutory rape case.  Now, MAYBE, he was making a message out of the ridiculous double standard about whether or not the minor is male or female, but the seriousness of the situation (though flatly stated in the movie) is not conveyed properly.

Since most of the movie is about sex, and possibly alcoholism (again, the point isn't made very clearly), there is a fair amount of sex positive messaging throughout the movie, being inclusive of maturity, skin color, body type, handicapability, and open expression.  However because there is a key component of adultery and incest used for humiliation and comedy, it throws any of the previous sex situations into comedy bits, which means not only the message to laugh at people in a messed up sex situation because of incest / adultery (the morality between the two directly addressed), but also statutory rape, the elderly having sex, people expressing thoughts about sex, sex with big black women as things that are comical and that you shouldn't do and should repress.  And if that's a thing, then fine, but don't make a movie about it and make me think about it, and then call it a comedy.

All of that is on top of the usual thing where everyone wants to bang Adam Sandler, and then he's an alcoholic on top of it, and then we add the litany of things that happen to Andy Samberg's character, to include child neglect, and probably abuse.  And it's great for a family to rectify and come to terms together, but to make a movie where they bond over Donny's awful social magic is a weird message on which to make a production.

Look, I like being able to turn off my brain and watch some silly movie, and I was ready for it, but then I go thrown into a someone else's debate about if it's okay for a high schooler to knock up his teacher, and it kind of ruined it for me."

Action‚Ä¶most definitely yes! Anything else‚Ä¶well if you‚Äôre member of the younger part of the average male population you probably watch it for Milla Jovovich as well.

Now that we have established the baseline for the movie, does this movie deliver? The answer to that is, without a doubt, YES! This film delivered exactly what I expected of it. As I mentioned it is the 5th movie in the series and the entire series is sprung from a video game in the first place so it should really be no surprise that the film is one long video game action sequence sporadically interrupted with some dialog. Yet a lot of people seems to expect something else and judges the movie by those expectations.

I think those really low rating are quite unfair. The movie does indeed deliver what I think you should expect. A lot of the action scenes are marvellous. The slow motion scenes are well done and enjoyable unlike some movies where they are just annoying. The zombies and other monsters are good. And yes, I confess that, although I‚Äôm hardly among the younger part f the mail audience anymore I do like watching Milla Jovovich jumping around in the scenes in those ridiculous skin tight suits.

If I should complain about anything it would be that I sat through half the movie being annoyed that nobody would get the, painfully obvious, idea to rip that red mind control gizmo off Jill‚Äôs chest. When it was finally done in the end it was like ‚Äúdid you really have to take that long to get that idea into your head you dumb bastards‚Äù.

I cannot really give the movie a top rating since it does lack much of a story after all but I certainly think it is worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed myself a lot while watching it. The ending is the usual video-game-movie cliff-hanger and I really hope they make another sequel now when Alice got her powers back. That she lost those was one of the big downers for me in one of the previous movies in the franchise. || Watching it again after 8 years, my feelings about this installment remains the same.

Don't waste your time. || **It's a film for a fairly narrow audience and is very slow paced... too slow.**

Honestly, I expected more from this movie. A certain strong dramatic spark that really justified the time spent watching it. Unfortunately, it seems the only motivation for seeing the film is its criticism of the Church of Scientology, a criticism that, if you read a little about the church and pay attention, is not even implied.

Paul Thomas Anderson is a respected director, especially after the films ‚ÄúMagnolia‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere Will Be Blood‚Äù. I'm not going to discuss that, not least because he's not a director I'm comfortable with (I think, counting this one, I've only seen two of his films). What matters is this film, and here, the director did a good job. It probably not the best of his career, there are very debatable options especially in terms of editing and rhythm, but it's enough.

The cast's work is even better. Joaquin Phoenix gives us an impeccable, intense and very dramatic work, even if it is totally surpassed by the charisma of Philip Seymour Hoffman, a totally accurate choice for the character, who required not only charisma but also leadership, affirmation and authority. The actor, who left us suddenly and quite prematurely, was rightly nominated for an Oscar here. Laura Dern and Amy Adams ensure the main presences in the feminine, and they do it safely, even if in a more discreet way.

On a technical level, the film has some very good points and others not so well developed: if on the one hand we have an excellent collection of sets and costumes, a good recreation of historical periods and places, an excellent cinematography and an enviable filming work, we also have a badly done edition, incapable of giving the film greater drama and some rhythm. I don't know if that was on purpose or not, what I do know is that the movie is disgustingly slow, dull and boring, with tons of lamely written dialogue and a lot of wasted time in between. I was left with the feeling that it would have been perfectly possible, in editing, to cut about half an hour of film without rigorously altering the meaning or running the risk of ruining the story.

And talking about editing invariably leads us to talking about the script. I am not and have never been a member of the Church of Scientology, so I feel free to see a film that openly criticizes it, and also a film that criticizes it more covertly, as is the case. What the film makes clear is the weight of a great leader's charisma for the growth of a cult, but that was something that seemed clear enough to me. There are also some passages in which the film suggests that Scientology (like the ‚ÄúCause‚Äù) is a great hoax, but this is also apparently consensual among the common public, and is based to some extent on testimonies from former members of the church. Regardless, it is not a film that is capable of attracting the masses to cinema, it is a topic for a niche of people already interested in it and not for the general public. And that doomed the film to a tremendous financial failure, considering the capital the production spent on it."

You will think you will hate Dredd but you wont. || I think this adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics books are a much more how most people probably would expect that a Judge Dredd movie should be, especially compared to the rather disappointing 1995 version. That of course means that the movie is quite violent. Anyone who has ever read the comics should not be surprised about the fact that this movie is mostly about taking out the bad guys, and if you cannot take out the bad guys using violence then just use more violence.

Except for a few gripes that I will come to I quite liked this movie. The plot is a fairly simple one but it is also a plot that I would not have been surprised to find in one of the 2000 AD comics. It is a quite suitable plot for a Judge Dredd movie. The plot centres around the drug ‚ÄúSlo-Mo‚Äù which slows down your perception of time. This of course gave the director carte blanche to use extreme slow motion effects which could have been quite annoying if overdone. I think it is used quite well in this movie though. I especially liked the effects on the people standing behind the door that Dredd blew in at the beginning of the movie.

Judge Dredd himself is well played by Karl Urban and, thankfully, he does not remove the helmet in this movie. I‚Äôm sure it was done to satisfy Stallone‚Äôs ego in the 1995 movie and it was one of the things that ruined it. Judge Dredd is not supposed to remove his helmet, period. ‚ÄúMa-Ma‚Äù is also a quite okay bad guy for this movie. Sufficiently psychopathic yet intelligent and rational enough to make a believable, at least as believable as a Judge Dredd villain can be, adversary to Dredd.

I have a few gripes about the movie though. My main gripe is that it is not the ultra-modern city from the comics, at least from the comics that I have read since I have not read them all. It is more of a bunch of mega-scrapers spread out among the city slum that is left from today and still looks very non-futuristic. The initial chase scene is done using an old Volkswagen van for Christ sake. I really did not like that and, as far as I am concerned, it lost a star for that. If I remember the comics correctly MegaCity One was built more or less on top of the old ruins.

Another thing that I did not like was the crooked judges. Ii is possible that they used the concept of a bad judge in some of the comics, I do not remember, but I still did not like it. The judges are supposed to be above ‚Äúordinary people‚Äù. I am sure that they could have come up with some other plot element than that.

Anyway, the bottom line is that I quite enjoyed the movie. The fact that the DTS-HD Master Audio sound on my Blu-ray copy was excellent did add to the enjoyment of course. The surround and LFE effects was quite powerful yet balanced so they did not cause my somewhat weak subwoofer to go into resonance. Very enjoyable movie evening indeed."

It's shot mostly cin√©ma v√©rit√©-style, utilising a plotline in which officer Taylor is shooting a documentary piece for a student course he's taking.

Gory, fun and inventive - if flawed - portmanteau horror pic shot in the cin√©ma v√©rit√© (Cloverfield, [REC], The Blair Witch Project) style.

Like all anthology pieces, some ideas work better than others but V/H/S is packed with good stuff, containing as it does six ""stories"" (including the wraparound segment that tenuously links them all), each directed by a different up-and-coming bright young thing in horror movies. The wraparound story is by far the worst, and bizarrely it wraps up second-to-last, but still: a bunch of petty-criminal ****ers, presently making small-but-quick bucks from a streaming porn site by attacking innocent women in the street and exposing their breasts for the camera (charming) are hired by a ""fan"" of the site to carry out a reasonably simple task: break into a house, sneak in, steal a specific VHS videotape (apparently they'll know it when they see it, though this is far from the case), and get out of there. What they find is a largely empty house save for a cellar area chock-full of tapes and one room containing an expired tenant sat in front of a bank of old TVs and video players. They randomly play through a few of the many tapes in order to try and ascertain what they're supposed to be nicking, and that's where the five anthology tales come in; they're what these bellends see on the videotapes.

The stories, then (I'll buzz through these, they're only twenty minutes or so long each, so too much info will be to give the story up):

1. Amateur Night - A trio of lads go out on the razzle armed with some cool camera-glasses, so one of the guys can happily film their evening's debauchery without anyone being any the wiser; superb if you're planning to get a couple of lasses back to your motel room for some gangbang action and film the results. They... well, they probably pick the wrong gal to bring back. I liked this one, despite my nagging fear (placed by this segment in tandem with the wraparound skit and even borne out further - though to a lesser degree - by the other segments) that there might be a nasty undercurrent of misogyny running through the movie. I guess though the simple truth is that when you put a bunch of young male twats in charge of filming ****, they end up venturing up the ""amateur porn"" route sooner rather than later.

2. Second Honeymoon - Directed by slow-burn specialist Ti West (The Innkeepers, the superb House of the Devil), and this one's typical of his canon. Nothing really happens beyond getting to know - and like - the nice couple doing the usual touristy thing around Arizona/Nevada. Then a girl knocks at their motel room door. Gore-free - almost incident-free - until the very end, this one was nonetheless one of the most effective segments.

3. Tuesday the 17th - In which four kids go into the woods. Where some murders happened once. Ahem. The segment initially most calling to mind The Blair Witch Project being as it is both found-footage style AND set in the woods, this was for me the least affecting of the ""watched videotape"" tales, not through a lack of ideas (well, let me clarify: it DOESN'T make a whole lot of sense, but I don't mind that at all in short-story form) but because the actors in this segment were the most ""actorly"", the least honest and realistic. IMO. That said, it moved along at a real lick, it's as gory as **** and the antagonist's ""appearances"" on the videotape are pretty cool.

4. The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger - Chronicling a sequence of Skype chats (hang on: this tale is being watched on a musty old VHS tape; who's converting their Skype chats to VHS? Ah well, no matter I suppose) between a guy working away and his girl, who is becoming convinced that she's either going crazy, or the house is haunted. Her arm's hurting her, as well... Yeah, this was a pretty good one. Not much in the jump stakes but it had a nice Tales of the Unexpected vibe going on, which is always welcome in these sorts of films.

5. 10/31/98 - Oh-so-simple tale, in which a bunch of guys - and in a refreshing change from the wraparound segment and Amateur Night, NOT a bunch of unlikeable dickheads - are on their way to a Halloween party, and go to the wrong house. Like, REALLY the wrong house. This may well be the best segment of the lot. Certainly the most cool-effects-laden. It was a great way to close out the movie.

Flaws - well, there's that aforementioned misogynistic streak running through the movie (most specifically the first 40 minutes or so). Also, although great ideas and buckets of grue abound and it was a blast to watch at the time, I'm afraid that lasting, visceral scares are thin on the ground, although I attribute that more to the nature of portmanteau films not having long enough per segment to develop real empathy or tension. But the worst flaw, by the proverbial ""country mile"", is that of all of the ""shaky-cam"" films I've ever seen, V/H/S is far and away the worst, most vomit-inducing exponent of that trait. Cloverfield didn't really pretend very well to be all that ""amateur"", [REC] elegantly addressed the problem by having their in-film cameraman be a professional television cameraman, with professional kit, and the Paranormal Activity franchise managed to sidestep the problem with the utility of tripods and fixed camera positions. So the worst I'd seen before this was probably The Blair Witch Project, way back when. But the cameras in V/H/S have been painstakingly made to look as amateur as possible, sadly to its detriment on several occasions. I found myself craning, squinting and frowning to see what the **** was happening a few times when I should have been freaking out at the events unfolding on-screen (somewhere).

Still, despite that: What V/H/S gets right, it gets VERY right (and it does so very often). If you likes your horrors, you need to give this one at least a look. Recommended. || Creeper Compendium.

The horror anthology has a chequered history, some are bad but saved by one great segment, others boast a couple of genuine creepers but are undone by one instalment so bad it tarnishes the film forever. And on it goes. V/H/S brings the format into the new age by unfolding its tales by wrapping around the latest craze of found footage.

Six indie directors have produced a picture that was well received at Sundance but has proved to be most divisive with critics and horror fans on internet forums. This will come as no surprise to anyone who knows their horror anthology onions. The usual problems are evident here, a couple of great stories are surrounded by mediocre ones, but at least there is something for everyone, with most bases covered, but that in itself is a problem, all horror fans have preferences, it's a big ask to expect a fan of stalk and slash to love a story about a winged harpy!

Then there is the issue of the found footage format, here recorded on actual VHS. Not everyone is a fan (myself for instance), and much of V/H/S is dizzying and often hard to follow, especially as regards the Tape 56/frame narrative story that cloaks the other five stories as a bunch of no-mark young crims burgle a grotty house and sift through the tapes. It's a format loved by many for its supposed realism factors, I don't get that myself, but for those people this really is up their trees!

Amateur Night (David Bruckner) and The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger (Joe Swanberg) are the standouts. The former is a cautionary tale of frat boys out for sex who get more than they bargained for when they take home the mysterious Lily, the latter an eerie tale unfolded via Skype communication as Emily appears to be a victim of a haunting whilst chatting to her doctor boyfriend.

However, if you ask another fan of the film what stories they feel standout, you may just get two different answers. So as with any other anthology horror, you roll the dice and take your chance, just don't expect genius in every story, for that is purely folly of expectation. 7/10 || Anthologies are, by their very nature, pretty mixed. And found footage horror is not my kettle o' fish. So a found footage horror anthology did not have me ecstatic. I actually didn't mind _V/H/S_ though, this was actually better than a loot of the found footage stuff I've seen, even if they do lean hard into the most annoying things about it, say for instance, video quality, which is (intentionally) abysmal. The framing device didn't work for me though, like, at all. I was very confused, and even if I hadn't been, I wasn't engaged by it at all. Which is a real shame, because I am particularly fond of the director of that part of the film, Adam Wingard. The entries over all weren't amazing, but, almost every segment of _V/H/S_ had a real good ""oh shit"" sort of a **moment** in it that was real intense, and I'm into that.

Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn‚Äôt quite work as a whole."

A round movie with a fantastic Mads Mikkelsen. Honestly, I think this movie would have been even better with some more minutes on it to develop the plot even further.

Fantastic directing. || Viewers beware: this is not an easy or light watch.

Mads Mikkelsen absolutely kills it as a somewhat lonely single man, who suddenly finds love and welcomes his son to live with him.

That's all I'll reveal in the review, no spoilers here.

But again, this isn't a light film, nor should it be. This tackles the subject matter with the poise it deserves, with stunning performances from Mads as well as the entire supporting cast. The script and cinematography lend themselves perfectly to the task at hand, delivering a well-crafted portrayal of love, friendship, and ruin.

Excellent. || Happy to file this one under 'Films I Evidently Didn't Get'.

<b>[Edit: I can't lie, I'm absolutely waffling below. Apologies in advance and totally feel free to ignore, I just typed whatever came into my head because I'm simply so unsure about this. I've articulated myself awfully I'm positive, way too many paragraphs and all that but hey-ho.]</b>

I don't even know where to start with <em>'The Hunt'</em>, I'm finding it difficult to seperate my thoughts. On the one hand I dislike a lot about this, from the writing to the pacing to the supposed message of it and from the clearly phenomenal acting.

I usually solely focus on my own opinions and type up my review before reading others', but every now and then a film comes along that I just don't get and when it's one with surprisingly (to me) high acclaim I have to read other reviews to see if I've just simply missed something glaringly obvious - which is, even now, entirely possible, don't get me wrong.

However, the vibe of a handful of reviews on here I've seen is either hate the kid(s) or hate the people for believing the kid(s)... surely that's not the point of the film? I'm aware this is perhaps too UK-centric a reference, but if that is the case it is giving major Tory/Brexit/GB News vibes. As in, it's (hate this word, but...) some sorta 'wokery', we must get rid of cancel culture and all that stupid rhetoric.

Pre-reading reviews, I just simply didn't understand what the film was trying to say... and even by stating whatever, why it went around the houses for nearly two hours and then proceded to not even wrap it up. I personally found it exhausting to watch, I admittedly don't tend to enjoy films that attempt these sorta 'smart' open-ended endings.

If all the film is trying to say is that people can sometimes be falsely accused and have their lifes ruined by mob mentality, then fine... but I'm not sure using child abuse is quite the way to portray that idea. It's hardly a regular real life occurrence of children (very young children, at that) ruining grown mens lifes with sexual assault claims, is it?

That's what I mean with what I said three paragraphs back, it's like you see on social media when a well known person is alleged to have done something serious and you get that section of people who immediately hate the likely victim for no reason.

Now, perhaps I'm unsure about this 2012 release as I'm judging through my 2023 eyes, as in the aforementioned online rhetoric has murked the waters in terms of what the film is actually trying to say. Nowadays it's closely associated with those who use the terms 'woke', 'snowflake' etc. and that makes me feel uncomfortable, I can't lie.

Now, even all that aside, solely as film I still didn't really enjoy it either. The way parts are written and characters act annoyed me, e.g. the shop scene. From them all willing to fight Lucas one second to the next when they're all scared because he head-butted someone; and how they didn't see that coming, or Lucas himself didn't see the initial punch coming. I acknowledge that's a random example, but it kinda typifies how odd the film felt to me at most moments.

As I said, I do have one positive and that is the acting - which is truly top notch, frustratingly so if anything as it makes it difficult for me to rate the film. Mads Mikkelsen is truly outstanding, one of the best performances I've seen from him thus far. Thomas Bo Larsen is quality as well. No-one on the cast puts a foot wrong in truth, even youngster Annika Wedderkopp or the more experienced Anne Louise Hassing.

I get severely awkward when I'm rating a film so much lower than the majority, which doesn't happen all that often at all but when it does it makes me cringe. I'm just being honest in how I feel though, even if it's totally possible that I've just got the wrong end of the stick completely. If I have, so be it."

Not as good as the first one. Yes, I am sad to say it is not as good but on the other hand the story is still sound and the action is better and faster then before. Liam Neeson plays his role excellently while some on the other cast members didn't preform as well. All in all a good movie but there are some little problems, but worth seeing any way. || I enjoyed this movie as a no-brainer action/thriller flick. Sure, it has a bunch of illogical and idiotic elements in but I have seen a lot worse. The movie certainly do not deserve the ridiculously low ratings that some people have given it.

It is perhaps not as good as the first movie, mostly due to the silly bits and pieces, but as a plain vanilla action/thriller it is certainly passable. I generally do like Liam Neeson. I did like him in the first Taken movie and I do like him in this one. The other actors with the possible exception of his wife and daughter are mostly there to fill up the scenes.

After a semi-dull beginning which is pretty much just setting up a reason for them all being in Istanbul, Bryan and his wife is, surprise, surprise, taken and that is pretty much when the action starts and from there on it is pretty much action all the way.

As have been mentioned, there are a lot of stupid things happening in the movie. Dropping grenades in the middle of Istanbul seemingly without anyone really reacting for instance. Bryan‚Äôs daughter have failed to take a drivers licence in the states several times but still, when thrown into a car with a manual gear stick, she handles the car like a stunt driver. Then we have a violin player that sits in the same spot all the time? Not to mention crashing into the embassy while being fired upon by the embassy marine guards and then they can just sit there in the wrecked car, in front of the embassy, while Bryan calls for help from some guy playing golf in the states.

It is clear that the Luc Besson didn‚Äôt really put realism very high on his agenda for this movie. But then this wouldn‚Äôt be the first time for him. Overlook the silliness and you have a decent enough action/thriller flick. At least I enjoyed it and I am normally not too forgiving when it comes to stupid and unrealistic stuff in movies. || The _Die Hard 3_ of the _Taken_ franchise, except like... Nowhere near as good.

82505.0,House at the End of the Street,"A mother and daughter move to a new town and find themselves living next door to a house where a young girl murdered her parents.

A little better than its garbage reputation, as evidence by the support it got at the box office from its target audience, Mark Tonderai‚Äôs horror/thriller is safe genre film making. There‚Äôs no intelligence in the screenplay, no copious amounts of blood letting, the characters do dumb things and in truth it unfolds as a standard girl in peril movie. These things are what have led to it being savaged by critics, but backed by a trio of strong performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Elisabeth Shue and Max Thieriot, boosted by a genuine narrative surprise and the fact that Tonderai is able to do the peril motifs with suspenseful impact, ensures House at the End of the Street is at least a decent enough time waster. 5/10 || _**Does a killer prowl the neighborhood or is it just local lore?**_

A mother and daughter (Elisabeth Shue & Jennifer Lawrence) move into a Pennsylvania suburb where a nearby abode was the scene of a double murder four years earlier, committed by a deranged girl named Carrie-Anne. She was thought to have drowned, but her body was never found and local legend suggests that she prowls the eerie woods. Meanwhile her brooding brother (Max Thieriot) lives on the property and is maltreated by some of the residents. Gil Bellows plays an officer that befriends the mother and is sympathetic toward the despondent young man.   

‚ÄúHouse at the End of the Street‚Äù (2012) is a coming-of-age drama mixed with mystery and horror of the slasher variety, but more realistic than a guy in a mask lurking around with a machete. It borrows story elements from ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù (1960) and ‚ÄúSleepaway Camp‚Äù (1983), but has the polished modern tone of flicks like ‚ÄúSolstice‚Äù (2008), ‚ÄúThe Last House on the Left‚Äù (2009) and ‚ÄúMy Soul to Take‚Äù (2010). It‚Äôs not great like ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù or the remake of ‚ÄúLast House,‚Äù but it‚Äôs at least on par with ‚ÄúSolstice‚Äù and superior to ‚ÄúSleepaway Camp‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Soul to Take.‚Äù   

Jennifer looks great in her prime while Thieriot‚Äôs character makes for a sympathetic study. The lush Eastern locations are sumptuous and the relatively believable story holds your interest while offering some unexpected revelations. The feminine cast also includes Allie MacDonald, Eva Link and Jordan Hayes.

The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Metcalfe & Carp, Ontario, both outside of Ottawa.

NO SPOILERS ‚Äì SheBlogger hates spoilers :)

 

Okay‚Ä¶so here‚Äôs another horror movie review from the girl who is yet to be scared with scenes shot in the dark, gory murders and startling sound effects.

 

HeBlogger and I went to the mall last Sunday to watch a different movie.  We thought Tiktik, which is a Filipino horror movie, was already showing.  Apparently, it is not scheduled until next week.  Then we saw Sinister‚Äôs poster, which said, ‚Äúfrom the producer of Paranormal and Insidious‚Äù.  We have seen both movies and we both didn‚Äôt like Paranormal but both enjoyed Insidious. So we said, okay‚Ä¶let‚Äôs watch this instead.

Didn‚Äôt know anything about this movie Sinister so as we walked inside the empty movie house, I wondered which one is it going to be like. Is it going to be a homemade movie about paranormal activities with three different endings? Oh please‚Ä¶I fervently hope not! I crossed my fingers because I noticed there were rolls of super 8 films on the poster. Or is it going to be about demons capturing souls and possessing the physical body with a non-happy ending? Or is it going to be a totally different story?  I hoped it would be.

We were the first two of the five people who came to watch this movie.  The others were a group of three teenage girls, who surprisingly didn‚Äôt scream or shout at all, throughout the screening.  What a joy to be watching in silence and absolute peace!

Okay, on to the movie review‚Ä¶

The movie opens with a scene shot like a home video, so I go like, uh-oh‚Ä¶ But don‚Äôt be disheartened. It‚Äôs nothing like Paranormal and deeper into the story, you‚Äôd see that it is more like Insidious. That much I would tell you.

The story is about a real crime stories writer, played by Ethan Hawke (the only actor I know in the movie), who moved his entire family to a house where a family was hung to death in the backyard tree and their little girl still missing.  In the course of his research and with the help of rolls of seemingly innocent and happy family home videos that mysteriously appeared in the attic, he discovers more brutal murders of different families in different houses. So there‚Äôs the question‚Ä¶ Are these murders in any way related, considering there‚Äôs always a little child missing?

I must say that I find the premise of the story original. Well, at least for me. So I give it 4.5 gems for Story and Originality...

Continue reading on: http://heblogs-sheblogs.com/2012/10/sinister-movie-review/ || Bughuul the Bastard!

After moving himself and his family into a new house that was the scene of a horrendous crime, true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) finds a box of 8mm ""snuff"" films that suggest the murder he is currently researching is the work of a serial killer whose career dates some way back still further...

It is becoming the un-reviewable genre, horror that is, there are just too many splinters of horror to choose from and so many people to cater for. There are many who stand up and proudly proclaim that they will watch any horror film and view it on its own terms, yet in this new millennium age that doesn't appear to be the case. I know I'm at fault, I hate torture porn and excessive grue type films, they just bore me, so can I review Hostel 9, Saw 27 and Wrong Turn 12 fairly? No, I don't think I can. I mean the human body can only be sliced up in so many different ways, right? Right? Vice Versa, can someone who loves Argento, Roth and the like, review fairly a boo-jump ghost story that caters for those who want to wet themselves when something jumps out of a cupboard? I really don't think so, but I digress...

Sinister is a wonderfully creepy movie that deals firmly in the realm of demons who come into the real world to cause unmitigating terror and heartbreak. It has no ""axe"" to grind with the blood thirsty who want to see arteries sliced and diced, it just wants to put a protagonist front and centre as he gets in way above his head, have his family come under serious threat; especially the child (oh my, the children...), and throw in the odd ""boo-jump"" moment to keep the pant wetters happy. The video footage used to show us the previous crimes unnerves greatly and there's a strong mystery element to keep the intrigue level high, whilst the ending doesn't cop out in the slightest. Hawke is excellent, perfectly portraying a man horrified yet submerged by the need to unravel the story, but his turn is sadly balanced by Juliet Rylance as the wife who seems unable to generate believable emotion.

This film really isn't for any horror fan who isn't into the ""demon in the real world"" type horror; like Insidious for example. While those who like this splinter of horror and still decry it brings nothing new to the table, I'll ask again, well what would you like to see brought to the table then? I love this sub-genre of horror, and I feel Sinister is one of the best films of its type in recent years. Its reputation amongst like minded adults is well founded...just don't watch the trailer first, mind! 8/10 || Hits an absurdly high number of horror clich√©s, but manages to do it in a pretty successful manner. Features many more laugh out moments than you might expect from a horror of this type. Not sure if that's a pro or a con.

_Final rating:‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._"

The movie is incredibly convoluted, so it's hard to know what to say that definitely won't end up being a spoiler, so maybe it would be better if I just stuck to talking about the actors, as it's a crazy bunch of them for McDonagh to bring together.

Don't believe the trailer, and certainly don't believe the posters. _Seven Psychopaths_ has nothing to do with either of them.

Olga Kurylenko (_Max Payne, Quantum of Solace_) is shamefully under-used, but at least Martin McDonagh acknowledges that his film's female characters are not a focus point, and their weakness is his own failing (in a rather surreal way). I've adored her ever since I first saw her in _Hitman_, and was absolutely blown away by her _Centurion_ performance. Though she does practically nothing here, it's always fantastic to see her get more work (particularly in such a great film).

Woody Harrelson (_Natural Born Killers_, _Defendor_) has also been one I've kept my eye on for some time now. He's a believable psychopath, a strong actor, a funny dude and he has great presence. I've yet to be annoyed by him. Ever.

Sam Rockwell (_Choke, Iron Man 2_) has only recently gained my appreciation, but fuck is he great. I'd seen him and loved him in so many things before, but I never drew the connection. Now in _Seven Psychopaths_, I feel he has his strongest role to date, moreover, he is certainly the greatest character of the film.

Abbie Cornish (_Limitless, Sucker Punch_) is Australian. I'm Australian. So there's that... No, she's great, I just never really locked her in as a favourite like I do with so many others. Again, in _Seven Psychopaths_, that's not fault of her own. The script allows little room for women, which is unfortunate, but well handled. She gets much more screen time that Olga Kurylenko, but it would still have been good to get more of her.

Christopher Walken (_Pulp Fiction, Sleepy Hollow_) is the sort of guy that I'd watch a movie just 'cause he's in it, and I don't even know why.

Collin Farrell (_In Bruges, Fright Night_) meshes with me spectacularly poorly. It's hardly like I hate the guy or anything. He's a perfectly adequate actor with a great accent, I guess I just never got the hype. He manages to be the star of _Seven Psychopaths_, but have the show stolen out from under him by pretty much everyone else on screen.

It's rare that I give a film a rating of 80% or more, so if that means anything to you at all, then I implore thee, go watch _Seven Psychopaths_, it's well worth the price.

-_Gimly_ || <em>‚ÄôSeven Psychopaths‚Äô</em> didn‚Äôt quite do it for me. It‚Äôs not far adrift from being a good movie, I just wasn‚Äôt able to connect to it in the end. It kinda has similar issues that I found with this director‚Äôs previous film, <em>‚ÄôIn Bruges‚Äô</em>; it‚Äôs better than that one, mind. The comedy is lacklustre and the cast don‚Äôt feel at their best.

Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken and Woody Harrelson being in the same flick is a recipe for success, so I am disappointed to say that I didn‚Äôt rate this one. The story has some solid moments and in summary is intriguing, though how it is all connected together with everything in-between and how it‚Äôs portrayed to us simply didn‚Äôt satisfy me unfortunately.

His early two films have surprisingly disappointed me, thankfully Martin McDonagh followed them up with two absolute crackers. I hope his upcoming fifth release follows suit. || ‚ÄúMarty‚Äù (Colin Farrell) has an idea for a great screenplay, but thus far has only come up with a title. Hungover, as usual, he‚Äôs chatting with his pal ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù (Sam Rockwell) who is just full of ideas for his psychopathic characters but hates to impose on his creatively constipated buddy. Now ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù, aside from having a vivid imagination, is also involved in a cunning wheeze with the cravat wearing ‚ÄúHans‚Äù (Christopher Walken) that involves a bit of high-end schnauzer snaffling! Yep - they dognap! It‚Äôs when he turns up to visit the suitably bemused ‚ÄúMarty‚Äù with a perfectly pet-icured Shih Zhu and they take quite a perilous trip into the desert that perhaps his juices might flow again? That might be inspiration, but is more likely fear as the dog‚Äôs owner is the none-too-charming hoodlum ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù (Woody Harrelson) who wants his mutt back preferably with a few pounds of flesh to feed it with, too! Now they have a surfeit of ideas for his book, but can they stay alive long enough to capitalise on them? This is my favourite outing for the boy from ‚ÄúBallykissangel‚Äù as he looks good, natural and works really well with the scene-stealing Rockwell who has a great¬†comedy timing; with the dapper and wily Walken and with an on-form Harrelson who mixes a faux-charm with shotgun menace entertainingly too. The structure of the story is cumulatively episodic and that allows for plenty of thuggery, bullets and escapades as we build to a denouement that is anything but predictable. Martin McDonagh knows how to combine elements of a thriller with comedy and he also manages to get some collaborative performances here from his cast as they poke fun at the genre whilst remaining entirely immersed in it‚Äôs excesses."
